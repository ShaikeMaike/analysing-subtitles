The channel's here on the chart.
So are the marking lights.
Then what's wrong with them?
Those lights don't seem to be in just the right place.
They're both a bit out of position, according to this.
Two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over.
"Safe between the world over" doesn't go in these waters.
Look here. You'll see the water shoals on the island side... while the deep soundings run to the mainland.
Have any of you seen the captain today?
- No. He wasn't down for dinner.
- No, and he wasn't down for lunch.
He hasn't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel.
What are you driving at?
Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters... he's had the jitters.
There's something wrong. I...
Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?
- Give him a shot of scotch.
- Give the whole bottle.
- No! I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc.
Just what you need.
- Well, maybe you're right.
- And how, boy.
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead.
We're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland.
- Good.
- But the lights are just a bit off, according to the chart.
The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific. You know that.
I know, sir, but...
Doesn't Branca Island mean anything to you?
- Well, not a lot.
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...
Bob's not a sailor.
He's a hunter.
He's made many of these trips.
He's young, but he has judgment.
I'll call him.
- Oh, Bob. Bob!
- What is it?
- Come up here, will ya?
- Just a minute.
What's bothering you, Captain?
There are no more coral-reefed, shark-infested waters in the whole world than these.
Boy! Just take a look at these.
You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter,
Doc, but oh, what a photographer.
If we'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip... they might have believed my book.
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip, you'd have never had me on this one.
Say, here's a swell one of the ship, Skipper. What's the matter?
These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other... and end up believing it all themselves.
I think that Mr. Rainsford should know... that the channel lights aren't just in the position given on the charts.
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?
I think we should turn back and take the outside course.
We'll go ahead.
Very well, sir.
It's your ship.
"It was the schooner 'Hesperus,' and she sailed the wintry sea. "
Now, wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk this over.
- There's no use taking any chances.
- Chances? That's fine talk... coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face.
Get an eyeful of this.
And he talks about taking chances.
Here's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera.
Get the expression on Doc's face, Bill.
He looks more frightened than the tiger.
- He is.
- What'd you have on your mind, Doc?
I'll tell you what I had on my mind.
I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization.
The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage.
The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized.
- Hear! Hear!
- It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?
Now, just a minute.
What makes you think... it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?
Take that fellow right there, for instance.
There never was a time when he couldn't have gotten away.
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.
He didn't hate me for stalking him... any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.
As a matter of fact, we admired each other.
Perhaps, but would you change places with the tiger?
- Well, not now.
- Mm-mm!
Here comes that bad-luck lady again.
Third time tonight.
- Here. Let me shuffle them.
- Wait a minute. Don't evade the issue.
- Yeah, speak up.
- I asked you a question.
- You did? I forgot.
- Oh, no, you didn't.
I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.
- Come on.
- What's your answer now, Bob?
That's something
I'll never have to decide.
Listen here, you fellows.
This world's divided into two kinds of people... the hunter and the hunted.
Luckily, I'm a hunter.
Nothing can ever change that.
Hang on!
Hello! Hello, down there!
Hello, Engine Room!
- The panel is flooded!
- If the water hits those hot boilers...
Help!
Help!
You trying to drown me?
Where are the others?
See anybody?
Nobody left but us two and... that fella.
Doc! Help!
- Look!
- Shark!
Ohh! It got me!
Hello!
Is anybody here?
Anybody around, I say.
Oh, hello.
Is this your house?
I'm not trying to break in, but I've been in a wreck.
Our yacht just sunk with all hands.
I got ashore and found your place here by accident.
I'm not trying to intrude, but I'm in sort of a jam.
Don't you understand any English?
Lvan does not speak any language.
He has the misfortune to be dumb.
Oh, hello.
Are you the owner here?
Yes.
Welcome to my poor fortress.
- Fortress?
- It once was.
Built by the Portuguese, centuries ago.
I have had the ruins restored to make my home here.
I am Count Zaroff.
My name's Robert Rainsford.
Glad to meet you.
Very glad.
Lvan is a Cossack.
I am afraid, like all my fellow countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.
Smile, Ivan.
I was trying to make him understand there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.
But how appalling!
And you mean to say that you are the only survivor?
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
You're certain?
I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been.
The swellest crowd on Earth... my best friends.
- It's incredible.
- Such things are always incredible.
Death is for others, not for ourselves.
That is how most of my other guests have felt.
Your other guests?
You mean this has happened before?
My fellow, we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house.
It would seem that this island were cursed.
That's just what the captain said.
Only he thought it was uninhabited.
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.
- Well, it's a break for me, anyway.
- My house is yours.
Oh, by the way. You'll want to change those wet rags immediately.
Yes. They look about the way I feel.
Yes.
I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests... that you can possibly get into.
Lvan will show you to your room.
- Thank you.
- You'll find a stiff drink there also.
Thanks a lot.
All pleasure is mine.
Come in.
- Ready, Rainsford?
- All set.
I'm afraid we have finished dinner.
But I have ordered something for you.
Thanks. I don't feel like eating, though.
Oh. Well, perhaps later.
Now, then, what do you say to coffee... and most charming company?
It is hard to forget your comrades' fate, I know... but our feminine guest is easily perturbed.
If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter.
A- Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel.
- Why, sure. Of course.
- Thank you.
Miss Trowbridge, may I present
Mr. Robert Rainsford.
- Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.
How are you, old chap?
Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?
- Coming out of it now, thanks.
- We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?
Indeed we do.
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.
Vodka, that's the stuff!
One shot'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java.
Have to toss it off, though.
Like this.
Now, Martin, you don't have to drink it all tonight, do you?
Don't be ridiculous, sis.
We are victims of circumstance.
Same as Mr. Rainsford.
And if anyone has a right to his liquor, it's a victim of circumstance.
- Isn't that so, Count?
- Of course, yes.
- You were in a shipwreck too?
- Yes.
Our lifeboat was the only one saved... my brother and I and two sailors.
The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs.
Those channel lights must have been shifted.
- I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report 'em... just as soon as we get back to the mainland.
You see, the count has only one launch... and that's under repair.
Russians are not the best mechanics.
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient a few days longer.
It's all right with me. I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now.
Speaking of that, perhaps now you'll tell us... a little bit about who you are.
Just sketchily, you know... born, married, why I left my last job.
No, no, no, no.
One moment, please.
Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house.
We entertain a celebrity,
Miss Trowbridge.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I know. Flagpole sitter.
- I know. He wrote some books.
- No, he lived some books.
If I am not mistaken, this is Mr. Robert Rainsford... who hunts big game so adventurously.
Yeah? Here's to ya.
- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little. "
No, I have read your books.
I read all books on hunting.
- A papiroso?
- Thank you.
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view.
- What do you mean, "sane"?
- Cigarette?
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse.
Let me see.
How did you put it?
"Hunting is as much a game as stud poker... only the limits are higher. "
- You have put our case perfectly.
- Then you're a hunter yourself?
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.
He sleeps all day and hunts all night.
And what's more, Rainsford, he'll have you doing the same thing.
We'll have capital sport together,
I hope.
Don't encourage him.
He's had our two sailors so busy... chasing around the woods after flora and fauna... that we haven't seen them for three days.
But what do you hunt here?
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.
I have done a rare thing.
I have invented a new sensation.
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.
What is this sensation, Count?
Mr. Rainsford,
God made some men poets.
Some He made kings, some beggars.
Me, He made a hunter.
My hand was made for the trigger, my father told me.
He was a very rich man... with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.
When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun.
- Good for him.
- My life has been one glorious hunt.
It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.
- But when the revolution...
- Look out.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Count Zaroff was so interesting...
I didn't realize the danger.
Oh, it's all right now. What were you saying about the revolution, Count?
Oh, merely that I escaped with most of my fortune.
Naturally, I continued to hunt all over the world.
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this.
That must have been a close call.
Yes. It still bothers me sometimes.
However, in two months
I was on my way to the Amazon.
I'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning.
No, no, no.
No sport at all.
Well, conditions are bad everywhere these days.
One night, as I lay in my tent with this... this head of mine... a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain.
Hunting was beginning to bore me.
Is that such a terrible thought,
Count?
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has been the whip for all other passions.
When I lost my love of hunting...
I lost my love of life... of love.
Well, you seem to have stood it pretty well.
I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage.
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow.
Tartar which?
Tartar war bow...
That one up there.
It's cute.
Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it... but alas, even that was too deadly.
What I needed was not a new weapon... but a new animal.
- A new animal?
- Exactly so.
You found one?
Yes.
Here on my island...
I hunt the most dangerous game.
"The most dangerous game"?
You mean tigers?
Tigers?
No.
The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.
I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water. Was that it?
It's no use, Rainsford.
He won't tell.
He won't even let you see his trophy room... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.
My one secret. I keep it as a surprise for my guests... against the rainy day of boredom.
You let me in on that game... and I'll bet you
I go for it.
You know, Rainsford, he hasn't failed yet.
If he says a thing is good, it is good.
He's a judge of liquor, wizard at contract... plays the piano... anything you want.
He's a good host and a good scholar, eh, Count?
Yes, yes.
You want me to go hunting?
You just say the word. We're pals.
We'll have a big party, get cockeyed and go hunting.
A completely civilized point of view.
I tell you what you do. You come to my place in the Adirondacks, see.
We'll have a private car, liquor and gals on the trip... and the guides will make the deers behave.
I think we'd better change the subject.
All right.
Change the subject.
Oh, I know!
Play the piano, huh?
If you wish.
Good idea. Play the piano.
Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.
Perhaps the count doesn't want to play.
There you go, sis, throwing cold water.
Leave me alone.
I know where the piano is.
I'm perfectly sober.
Charming simplicity.
"Completely civilized," did you say?
He talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt.
We barbarians know that it is after the chase... and then only that man revels.
It does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast.
Of course, yes. You know the saying of the Ugandi chieftains...
"Hunt first the enemy, then the woman. "
That's the savages' idea everywhere.
It is the natural instinct.
What is woman... even such a woman as this... until the blood is quickened by the kill?
- Oh, I don't know.
- "Oh, I don't know. "
You Americans.
One passion builds upon another.
Kill!
Then love.
When you have known that... you will have known ecstasy.
Oh, Martin!
Here you see Zaroff, the keyboard king... in his Branca Island hour.
Come on, Count.
Now, you show them.
- What do you suggest?
- Oh, just a good tune.
But not highbrow, like last night.
- Just a good tune, see?
- I see.
Oh, his hunting dogs.
Keep your voice low and listen.
It isn't true about the launch needing repairs.
I heard it leave the boathouse last night. It returned this morning.
You mean he's keeping you from returning to the mainland?
Yes.
Well, perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people.
Two, maybe.
There were four of us a week ago.
- The other two have disappeared.
- What do you mean?
One night after dinner, the count took one of our sailors... down to see his trophy room... at the foot of those stone steps.
- That iron door?
- Yes.
Two nights later he took the other there.
Neither has been seen since.
Have you asked him about them?
He says they've gone hunting.
Oh, be careful.
He's watching us.
Will you smile, as if I'd said something funny?
Now look here. You must be mistaken.
Not now.
Applaud.
- Attaboy! Attaboy!
- Thank you.
What did I tell you?
Smacks a mean ivory, eh, Rainsford?
It was splendid.
Don't stop, please.
I'm afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience.
Well, I expect it's rather difficult for Mr. Rainsford... to concentrate on anything after all he's been through.
My dear lady, you are pleading for yourself.
I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes.
Excuse me.
You know, the count's worse than a family governess.
Every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children.
Oh, no, my dear. No.
Charming children.
There, you hear that, sis?
Now trot along upstairs and don't bother us grownups anymore.
Well, after that I guess...
I guess I'll have to go.
- Good night, Mr. Rainsford.
- Good night.
We'll be seeing each other at breakfast.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, sis. We won't be seeing each other at breakfast.
Oh, my dear Rainsford,
I have been most inconsiderate.
You must be feeling the need of sleep too.
- Yes, I am just about all in.
- Then Ivan will show you to your room.
Oh, Martin, turn in early, please?
Don't worry. The count'll take care of me, all right.
Indeed I shall.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.
Sleep well.
Oh, uh, well, here's to long life.
A long life.
Tell me, Mr. Trowbridge... are you also fatigued?
Tired? Me?
You know I'm not.
You know, Rainsford, we two are just alike.
Up all night and sleep all day.
Well, good night.
Well, what are we gonna do, huh?
What's the big idea?
I thought that perhaps... tonight you would like to see my trophy room?
Your trophy room?
I'm sure you will find it most... interesting.
Say, that's a great idea.
Ho-ho. Now we're pals.
No more secrets now, huh?
- We'll make a night of it.
- I hope so, Mr. Trowbridge.
Just you and I... pals.
We'll have fun together, huh?
Precisely, yes.
Fun together.
Attaboy, County, old boy, old boy, County.
Please let me come in.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm frightened.
- What was it? Those dogs?
- My brother.
I've been listening for hours for him to come upstairs.
I've just gone to his room.
He isn't there!
- He's probably somewhere with the count.
- That's just what I'm afraid of.
Count Zaroff is planning something... about my brother and me.
You don't really think anything has happened to your brother?
Oh, I don't know, but we've got to find him.
Won't you help me?
Why, of course I'll help you.
- Where do you think he's gone?
- Where did the others go?
The iron door.
I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes.
Thank you.
That's queer.
It's unlocked.
Zaroff! He's coming down.
Back here, quick!
Where is my brother?
You killed him!
You killed my brother!
You!
Why, you...
Come, come, my dear Rainsford.
I don't want to treat you like my other guests.
You and I, we are hunters.
So that's your most dangerous game.
Yes. My dear fellow,
I intended to tell you last night... but you know, Miss Trowbridge...
You hunted him like an animal.
I know what you think, but you are wrong.
He was sober and fit for sport when I sent him out.
An hour or two strapped up in here brought him to his senses.
You raving maniac!
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take it off... when we've finished.
The stupid fellow tried to escape through the swamps of Fog Hollow.
You see, when I first began stocking my island... many of my guests thought I was joking... so I established this trophy room.
I always bring them here before the hunt.
An hour with my trophies... and they usually do their best to keep away from me.
Where do you get these poor devils?
Providence provided my island with dangerous reefs.
But there are light buoys to mark the safe channel.
They do not always mark it.
- You shifted them.
- Precisely right.
Too bad your yacht should have suffered... but at least it brought us together.
You take half-drowned men from ships you've wrecked... and drive them out to be hunted.
I give them every consideration... good food, exercise... everything to get them in splendid shape.
- To be shot down in cold blood.
- Oh, no, no.
Oh, I admit, with this annoying fellow... but usually I give them hunting clothes... a woodsman's knife and a full day's start.
I even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark.
And if one eludes me only till sunrise... he wins the game.
Suppose he refuses to be hunted.
Ivan is such an artist with these.
Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose to hunt.
And when they win?
To date I have not lost.
Oh, Rainsford, you'll find this game worth playing.
When the next ship arrives, we'll have gorgeous sport together.
You murdering rat!
I'm a hunter not an assassin.
Come, Rainsford.
Say you will hunt with me.
Hunt men?
Say you will hunt with me!
No?
What do you think I am?
One, I fear, who dare not follow his own convictions... to their logical conclusion.
I'm afraid in this instance,
Mr. Rainsford... you may have to follow them.
What do you mean?
I shall not wait for the next ship.
Four o'clock.
The sun is just rising.
Come, Mr. Rainsford.
Let us not waste time.
Ivan.
Your fangs and claws,
Mr. Rainsford.
Bob! Bob!
Lvan.
Bob! Bob, what are they going to do?
- I'm going to be hunted.
- Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge.
Outdoor chess.
His brain against mine.
His good craft against mine.
- And the prize?
- The prize?
You may recall what I said last evening.
Only after the kill... does man know the true ecstasy of love.
Suppose you lose.
If I do not...
What shall I say?..
Find you... between midnight and sunrise tomorrow, freedom for both of you.
- I'm going with you.
- No. He'll kill you too.
Not at all.
One does not kill a female animal.
If you lose,
I can easily recapture her alive.
All right.
I'll take her with me then.
We'll set him a trail he'll remember.
It's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow.
Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.
Don't lose your nerve.
We'll beat this thing.
- The others didn't.
- We will.
Come on.
Let's get going.
It seems as though we've come miles.
Yeah, but three hours doesn't take you far in this jungle.
Come on.
Let's keep going.
Come on.
Just a little more of this, then easy downhill going.
We'll soon be safe.
No wonder he was so sure.
This island is no bigger than a deer park.
Oh, Bob!
Come on, now.
What are we going to do?
We didn't each live through a shipwreck to let this crazy man hunter worry us.
I shouldn't have come with you.
You might beat him if you were alone.
Alone? And leave you here with that savage?
Not a chance.
Now we've got to think of something to worry him.
You'd never get near him.
He'd shoot on sight.
Weapons aren't everything in the jungle.
Say, did you notice that leaning tree down there?
- The one we just passed?
- Yes. I want to show you something.
You see? If that supporting branch were cut away... this fallen tree would make a perfect
Malay deadfall.
A Malay deadfall? What's that?
A man-killing contraption the natives use.
It would stop that madman, all right.
Trouble is, it takes quite a few hours to build.
He said he wouldn't follow till midnight.
That's right. If you help me,
I think we'll have time.
Come on.
We'll cut some strong vines.
There. Almost ready.
This bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie.
He'll have been on his way almost an hour now.
Look out!
Don't touch that trip line.
You'll have a two-ton tree down on your back.
- Jungle wood's as heavy as iron.
- Will it really work?
I've never known a living thing to get by one yet.
Look here.
You touch that trip line... it'll pull that trigger free.
Once that's loose, there's nothing to keep the log from coming down.
It'll crash down and kill anything underneath it.
Look.
We're ready.
Let him come.
Give me that knife.
Come out, Rainsford.
Why prolong it?
I'll not bungle this shot.
You'll never even feel it.
But surely you don't think that anyone who has hunted leopards... would follow you into that ambush?
Oh, very well.
If you choose to play the leopard...
I shall hunt you like a leopard.
Wait. Maybe it's a trick.
Eve.
Why did he go?
He's playing with us... like a cat with a mouse.
What do you mean?
You heard him say he'd hunt us as he'd hunt a leopard.
That means he's gone for his high-powered rifle.
His rifle?
Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!
- Run, quick!
- Eve, wait.
- No, I tell you, no!
- Don't stop! No!
Wait. That's Fog Hollow ahead.
- Fog Hollow?
- The swamp where he caught the others.
We haven't a chance of keeping ahead of him there.
- But there's no place else to run.
- That's just what he's counting on.
We've got two hours till dawn. We've got to use our brains instead of our legs.
But he'll have his rifle.
And we'll have a man trap.
Look.
It makes me dizzy.
Cover this over.
When Mr. Zaroff falls down there, he'll be all through hunting.
Quick. Gather some leaves and grass.
I'll cut some branches.
Yes. Very good, Rainsford.
Very good.
You have not won yet.
Look at your watch.
Are you looking at it?
Still half an hour till sunrise.
Swamp or no swamp, we can keep ahead of him that long.
As you are doubtless saying, the odds are against me.
You have made my rifle useless in the fog.
You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle.
Those animals I cornered... now I know how they felt.
Achmed, Miss Trowbridge... bring her here.
Now!
My dear Rainsford,
I congratulate you.
You have beaten me.
Not yet.
Oh, but of course.
I insist.
Why, you're...
You're not even wounded.
You hit the dog not me.
I took a chance and went over with him.
A clever trick, Rainsford.
I cheerfully admit defeat.
Here's the key of the boathouse.
The door is in the trophy room.
You and Miss Trowbridge may leave at once.
No!
Ohh!
Bob!
Eve!
The boat! Quick!
Impossible.

Hello there, hello there.
Is something wrong?
My wife and I found him lying dead in the yew alley,
Face downward.
What did you do then?
I hurried across the moor, to fetch the doctor.
Dr. Mortimer.
He was at dinner with Ms.
Stapleton and her brother.
Very well, Barryman, that's all.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Mortimer,
To what do you attribute the death of Sir Charles?
Heart failure, sir.
I might add that for sometime,
Sir Charles was in a highly nervous state.
Worried.
Something was preying on his mind.
Did he confide to you what was preying on his mind?
Well...
No.
Well, what about those footprints, Dr. Mortimer?
As though Sir Charles had been tiptoeing back toward the house.
I examined them myself, and as a man of science..
So did I, Mr. Stapleton, more likely Sir Charles was running.
Running? Running from what?
If you please, gentlemen, one at a time.
Why don't you tell the truth, all of you?
Tell all you know.
Silence, Mr. Franklin, you've already testified.
You were not there, no nothing whatever of this matter
Nevertheless, I insist he was murdered.
Murdered I tell you.
That will do, sir that will do
There were no marks on the body of any kind, Dr. Mortimer?
None.
Then as his physician what would you say was the cause of Sir Charles' death?
Most empathically, a heart failure, sir.
Such then Gentlemen is the verdict of this Coroner's court.
Call it what you like,
Sir Charles was murdered, there's more than one person in this room knows I speak the truth.
I am blessed if I know why on earth you want all these clippings. about this Baskerville fellow.
I have an idea Watson that young Sir Henry isn't destined for a very long existence in this world.
What?
My conjecture is that he'll be murdered!
Murdered?
It will be very interesting to see if my deductions are accurate.
Oh, Mr. Holmes!
While you out a Gentleman called to see you and left this.
He asked you to give it to me?
Oh no, he just left it there by mistake I imagine.
Dr. Mortimer.
He didn't leave his name, sir.
No, it's here on the stick,
Mrs. Hudson.
Oh is it, I didn't notice.
Do you know any Dr.
Mortimer, Watson?
No, what did he want?
He didn't say, sir.
What do you make of it, Watson?
Why should I make anything of it?
The fellow came to see you.
What kind of a fellow?
Let me hear you reconstruct him.
From his walking stick.
By our usual method of elementary observation.
I should say that Dr.
Mortimer is a successful man, well esteemed.
Good, excellent.
I should say that he does a great deal of his visiting on foot because the iron fellow is worn down.
Perfectly sound.
Let's have a look at this inscription.
"From his friends of the C.C.H."
I should say that is something about a hunt.
Really, Watson, you've excelled yourself.
Has anything escaped me?
Most everything my dear fellow.
A person to a Doctor is more likely to come from a Hospital than a hunt, and when the letters 'CC' appears before the Hospital, the name "Charing Cross Hospital" rather obviously presents itself.
Well, you may be right.
Furthermore, I'd say that Dr. Mortimer had a small practice in the country and was the owner of a dog.
How can you tell that?
Quite simple, from the teeth marks.
Look you can see for yourself.
A rather large dog, I'd say and unless I'm mistaken,
Dr. Mortimer will call on us again in a few moments.
Rubbish, Holmes, rubbish
How the devil can you deduce that?
Well, as his left his stick,
Isn't reasonable to presume that he'll come back and get it?
Dr. Mortimer, sir.
Mr. Holmes?
Yes, come in Dr. Mortimer.
I took the liberty of calling upon you.
And left your stick.
Oh, so I did.
Thank you so much.
A presentation I see?
Yes sir, from Charing
Cross Hospital.
This is my friend
Dr. Watson.
Of course.
How do you do, sir?
Mr. Holmes, you're the one man in all England who can help me.
Won't you sit?
Thank you.
A friend of mine is in grave danger.
May I enquire his name?
Sir Henry Baskerville, heir to the estate of Baskerville Hall.
I am in mortal fear
Sir Henry's life will be snuffed out
Why what makes you think that?
I have information which leads me to believe that for centuries past every Baskerville whose inherited the estates has met with a violent and sudden death.
But as I recall it, Sir Charles died from natural causes, heart failure.
Apparently, that was the verdict of the Coroner, in which
I, Sir Charles
Physician concurred but there was one point which I kept back from the police, from everybody.
Yes?
About fifty yards from where
Sir Charles fell dead were footprints.
A man's or woman's?
Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!
A hound?
Why didn't you report it?
Not a soul would have believed it.
During the night it rained and in the morning the marks were completely obliterated.
But I saw them.
As clearly as I see you and then a few days ago as one of the executors of the estate
I found this:
This old document.
Legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.
Let me read it to you, Mr. Holmes.
It's quite short, I won't bore you, I promise.
Yes, please go on.
In the time of the great rebellion about 1650,
Baskerville Manor was held by Hugo of that name.
A profane and Godless man.
One Michaelmas this Hugo stole down upon a neighbouring farm and carried off the daughter of the house.
He locked her in an upper chamber. and while Hugo and his friends were carousing as was their nightly custom
Such a cuddlesome little winch never existed before I swear.
Cheeks soft as velvet and a form so wondrously rounded...
- Tell us more
- What happened then?
Where was I?
The form you were saying.
No need to cry out I told her
Hugo will not hurt you.
With that I whisked her up on the saddle I covered with me cloak and we were off like the wind.
You brought her here?
- to the manor?
- Where is she?
Go fetch her, Hugo.
Easier said than done hey, Hugo?
How will he fetch her if she isn't here?
Ah, she isn't eh?
Come on, I'll show you.
You think she's really in there?
Yes, he did.
May we come in my sweet?
These drunken sots will give Hugo...
There is no girl!
Gone.
Now he says she's gone.
Out of my way.
What ails him?
Tim, Gary.
- Yes, Sir Hugo
- What's wrong sir?
She's gone. The winch.
Well, don't stand there gaping go bring my mare.
Yes, sir.
What's wrong?
I've never seen him in such a rage.
Where's he gone?
- Let's follow him.
- Let's go Roderick
Very well.
Come on Matthew?
Hold the stir you blockhead.
I'll give my soul to the devil for that winch.
Hear how he thinks he'd sell his soul to the devil for that winch.
Well may he find her and wed her then the devil will have his soul.
On and on they rode until suddenly they came upon the body of the girl.
Dead.
Then from just over a rise they heard sounds so hideous that the blood froze in their veins. and, looking up, they beheld
Before we could get at him
Sir Hugo was dead his body literally torn to shreds.
Such is the history of the hound that has cursed the
Baskerville family ever since.
Many having been unhappy in their deaths, that have been sudden, violent and mysterious.
Well Mr. Holmes?
Interesting, very interesting.
What do you think?
I don't know.
But Sir Henry is arriving from
Canada tomorrow.
Please understand my dilemma, my responsibility
I was Sir Charles' best friend
My duty is to protect that boy.
If I should take him down there to Baskerville Hall and if anything happened to him...
What I suggest, Dr. Mortimer, is when Sir Henry arrives you bring him here.
Oh, thank you, thank you, Mr. Holmes,
You don't know what a load you have taken off my mind.
Good night, Dr. Watson.
Good night, sir.
You left your stick again.
Oh, thank you.
By the by, Dr. Mortimer,
Do you have a dog?
I have no dog.
Then how do you account for these marks?
Evidently the teeth marks of a dog.
I used to have a dog, a small Spaniel, but it died.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well Holmes, what do you make or it?
Do you think there is anything in it?
Good heavens you are not going to start scratching on that infernal thing are ya?
Dear old Watson!
Good bye, Sir Henry.
If you ever go back to Canada be sure you sail with us.
Thanks, you've all been wonderful.
The very best of luck, sir.
The same to you.
This way, Sir Henry.
Thank you, Sir.
- and you and you.
- Thank you sir.
Sir Henry, it's too bad it's all over... just when you and Betsy Ann were really getting to know each other.
Oh, but we are going to see one another in London, aren't we Sir Henry?
Oh, I should love to but I have to go down to the country, unfortunately.
To your ancestral estate how exciting
Perhaps Betsy Ann if you are very good Sir Henry will ask us to visit him.
Of course, yes.
We are staying at the Savoy.
- Don't forget.
- I won't
- Bye
- Good bye.
Sir Henry?
Yes
I am Dr. Mortimer, your uncle was my best friend.
How do you do?
Thank you for coming to get me.
Not at all, my dear boy,
You have a pleasant trip?
Splendid, thank you.
I've taken rooms for you at the
Northumberland Hotel, where I'm stopping.
Fine.
I assume you will be staying in London for a few days.
Yes, I haven't seen it since I was a boy.
Thank you, sir.
Northumberland Hotel.
Sir Charles' death was a great personal loss to me.
I was more than his doctor...
What's this?
What are those words?
"As you value your life or your reason keep away from the Moor"
You mind, Sir Henry.
No, not at all.
What do you make of it, Mr. Holmes?
Why do you thing that last word is printed in ink?
Oh, that's simple enough the words have been snipped from the London Times, that's evident from the typography.
But the word 'moor' is an unusual word
Your correspondent evidently couldn't find it in the newspaper.
You'll admit Dr. Mortimer, there is nothing supernatural about this?
Supernatural?
Tell me Sir Henry has anything else unusual happened to you today? since your arrival in London?
I can't think of anything, unless you say that losing one of your boots is unusual.
You lost one of your boots?
Yes, brand new ones too never had them on.
I put them outside the door to be cleaned and when I went to fetch them there was only one there.
Brand new boots and you put them out to be cleaned?
They were tanned ones, Dr. Watson.
It prevents them from scratching to have them polished first.
Now will you please tell me what this is all about?
Dr. Mortimer bringing me here to see you? this letter?
It's about you, Sir Henry, your inheritance and Baskerville Hall.
Dr. Mortimer thinks that it might not be safe for you to go down there.
Safe?
On account of a hound.
A wild, supernatural monster that has cursed you Baskerville's for the last two or three hundred years.
Ah, ho, that sounds grand a family ghost eh?
Why didn't you tell this before, Dr. Mortimer?
Well, Mr. Holmes... suggested.
He is going to tell you about it now, Sir Henry.
Take him back to the hotel, Dr Mortimer
Show him that old document
Tell him everything, the whole business.
I'll join you a little later.
Come on we'll stroll back, you can tell me on the way.
This is not something to joke about, Sir Henry. Believe me.
See you presently.
Good night.
What's up?
Come on, Watson.
What's up now?
Where are we going?
You'll see soon enough.
Not a moment to lose.
Newspaper.
Get your evening paper!
Keep your eye on that Hansom.
This letter dates back to about 1650.
Paper,
Get your evening paper!
Evening paper, sir.
Get your evening paper? tells all the latest news.
Thank you sir.
Evening paper.
A dissident, drunken fellow.
Look out stop!
Whip up cabbie, whip up.
Very good, sir.
Who was it?
I don't know but it is just as I expected.
Haven't we better hurry on and warn them?
No, no, no they are not in any danger now.
Here is the number of that Hansom.
Find out from Scotland
Yard who the cabbie is and if you can fetch him along to the hotel.
I'll do my best.
"Northumberland Hotel"
Well, now that Dr. Mortimer has told you everything...
What have you decided?
To go there, of course.
Good that's what I thought you'd say.
If Dr. Mortimer will only guarantee that this supernatural hound of his will really appear,
I'd go already.
Don't say that my boy.
Sounds like a bogey story they tell kids to frighten them at night isn't it, Mr. Holmes?
Yes, rather.
It might interest you to know however that you were shadowed from my house.
Shadowed?
Yes, and probably have been ever since you arrived in London.
By whom?
I don't know.
A man in a Hansom.
He must have seen me run after him and had the cabbie dash off.
By the by, did you ever discovered your mislaid boot?
No, hello?
The browns ones here but one of the black ones is gone.
I'll ring for the Chambermaid perhaps she can explain.
Yes, do.
Now why should anyone want to take an odd boot? and then exchange a brand new one for an old one?
Can you explain it Mr. Holmes?
No, I can't.
Come in.
Did you ring, sir?
Yes about that boot of mine?
Oh, I have not found it yet, sir.
I've made enquiries all over the hotel.
Well it's back the brown one, but now one of my black ones is gone.
Oh, sir, that is odd!
Who else except yourself has access to this apartment?
Only the housekeeper, sir and she wouldn't do a thing like that
No, no, of course not.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I'll do my best to find your boot.
Okay, thanks.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, Dr. Watson.
I've got him!
Come on in Clayton. Come this way.
This is John Clayton, number 2704.
- How do you do?
- How do you do Clayton?
Won't you sit down?
I won't keep you long.
It's good of you to come
Thank you, sir.
Now, Clayton I wish you would tell us who your fair was that watched a certain house on Baker Street this evening and later followed these two gentleman.
Well I'll tell you you know as much as I do, sir.
Not quite as much I hope.
The gent said he was a detective, sir.
Oh he did?
Yes, sir.
How would you describe this gentleman, Clayton?
I suppose... about 35 years of age, sir and dressed like a toff and a small black beard.
And the color of his eyes?
I can't say, sir.
I see.
When did he tell you that he was a detective?
At the station, sir.
When he gave me the 2 guineas, of what he promised me.
Did he tell you his name?
Yes, sir.
What did he say it was?
Sherlock Holmes.
What?
It's the name what he gave me, sir.
Sherlock Holmes.
Well, whoever it is, at least has a sense of humour.
Here Clayton, here is something for your trouble.
Thank you, thank you kindly, sir.
Is there anything else I can tell you, sir?
Nothing at all I think.
All right, sir. Good day, sir.
Good day, gentlemen.
Well Mr. Holmes, have we progressed.
Do you think?
Perhaps.
Tell me, Sir Henry, when were you planning to go down to Dartmoor?
Immediately, tomorrow.
I am really awfully keen to see the old place.
You will accompany us, Mr. Holmes?
I would like to very much, Dr. Mortimer, but unfortunately I have some rather pressing business here in London.
Of course, there is no need.
Please don't think me ungrateful,
Dr. Mortimer
I do appreciate your concern for me, but this story of the hound is nonsense.
As for that silly letter and all the rest of it I am sure it can all quite easily be explained.
I quite agree with you, Sir Henry,
All the same if you don't mind,
I'd like to ask Dr. Watson to go down with you.
What's that?
If you don't mind, Dr. Watson
Gladly, if you care to come.
Of course, I'd be delighted.
Good. Well, thank you Dr. Watson, and thank you, sir. and we'll stalk the hound together.
Don't take it too lightly, Sir Henry.
Well I must be going.
Mr. Holmes?
Yes, Dr. Mortimer.
About that person calling himself Sherlock Holmes?
Very interesting, Dr. Mortimer
Keep me posted, Watson.
Write me daily reports.
To the smallest detail, Holmes.
Fine, I give him into your care, Sir Henry.
Guard him well. Good night.
Guard me well, I like that!
God!
Here we are, Sir Henry, on famous Dartmoor and what a history it has.
You see those rocks over there?
Actually they are stone houses built by Neolithic man
50 or 100,000 years ago.
You don't suppose the Baskervilles go back that far.
And over there, beyond that hill, those dark spots
That's the great Grimpen Mire.
As treacherous a morass as exists anywhere.
Thousands of lives have been sucked down into its bottomless depths.
Cheerful little spot.
Fascinating.
Oh, it is, Sir Henry and mysterious!
No wonder the people about here have such odd beliefs.
Some will tell you that nothing ever really dies upon the Moor. and after a time one gets to believe it.
Really?
You believe that?
Of course not.
If I believe all the legends about this place
I wouldn't live here.
I wouldn't have the courage.
And now if you'll look
Baskerville Hall, the home of your ancestors, Sir Henry.
How are you, Barryman?
Very well, thank you, sir.
Thank you.
This is Barryman, the butler,
Sir Henry and Mrs. Barryman.
Welcome, Sir Henry.
Welcome to Baskerville Hall.
Thank you.
Barryman was with your
Uncle most of his life as was his father before him.
Well I hope you will be just as happy with me.
Thank you, Sir Henry.
Baskerville Hall.
Just as it has always been,
Sir Henry.
Your uncle did some modernizing upstairs. but down here nothing has been added or taken away since Sir Hugo's time.
Well I wouldn't say it was the most cheerful spot I have ever seen.
I beg your pardon, sir what time do wish dinner, sir?
Early I think.
Dr. Mortimer has to drive home.
Tell the Coachman to have the carriage ready after dinner.
I'll tell him, sir.
Now I suppose you'll like to freshen up there is hot water in your room, sir.
I'll show the way.
Thank you.
Be careful, sir, these steps are a bit in need of repair.
My dear Holmes - we arrived tonight shortly after dark
Dr. Mortimer stayed for dinner.
I wish I could describe the dreadful eeriness of this place
I didn't want to startle you,
I thought you might be asleep.
What is it?
Come quickly someone's prowling around.
What are you doing, Barryman.
Oh, nothing sir, it was the window.
The window?
Yes, sir I was just seeing that it was fastened.
What does it matter whether it is fastened or not?
A window on the second floor.
I go around every night seeing that they are fastened.
Sir Charles always insisted upon it.
Well that sounds reasonable enough.
Well if it is properly fastened now, Barryman
You can get back to bed.
Yes, sir, thank you.
Do you see anything?
Nothing
Nothing, except a pinpoint of a light a long way off, over there by the Craggs.
Well, keep your eye on that point of light and tell me what happens.
Do you see anything now?
It's gone now.
There it is again. and there it goes.
Just as I thought.
Barryman was signalling someone.
Come on get some clothes we'll find out.
It's still there.
Yes
Try not to lose sight of it.
Crouch down here, whoever it is may come back.
What about getting a little further away from that light?
Up there.
Good idea.
Stop.
Are you mad.
Whoever it is, knows his way among these rocks, we don't!
Who the devil can it be?
You were right about Barryman.
Yes, but what connection can there possibly be between that horrible creature and Barryman?
You know I have a half a mind to fire the fellow in the morning.
Then notify the police, and let them shadow him.
No it's the last thing Holmes would want us to do.
Our job is to watch, Barryman watch him like a hawk.
Come on, let's get back.
What do you think it is?
What does it sound like, to you?
Well... if we were back in
London, this would seem ridiculous.
Let's get on.
Look here doctor, you don't believe that nonsense do you?
Of course not.
No more than you do.
"What was it? That's what we must find out the wind? a bird?
Or was it the hound?"
Good morning.
Good morning, Sir Henry.
So that's our famous moor, eh?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Where's Sir Henry?
He went out, sir.
Where?
Across the moor.
Didn't I tell you to let me know immediately if Sir Henry ever ventured out there alone.
I know but I only just found out from my wife.
"Sherlock Holmes Esq. 221 B
Baker Street, London"
Hello there!
Oh, forgive my shouting at you, Dr. Watson.
My name is Stapleton, live just across the moor.
But how did you know my name, sir?
From Dr. Mortimer, one or our neighbours.
Ah, yes.
How is, Sir Henry?
He is very well, thank you.
We were a bit worried that he might decide not to come here after the rumours that followed the sad death of Sir Charles.
Has Mr. Holmes come to any conclusion yet?
I really can't say.
Is he going to honour us with a visit?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Well if I can be of any help I do hope you will call upon me.
I know this place pretty well.
Thank you but I don't think I shall be needing any help.
Wonderful place this moor.
From a Scientist point of view there is nothing like it.
Vast, barren, mysterious
Do you see those bright green spots over there?
It seems a little more fertile than the rest.
Fertile? That's the great Grimpen mire.
One false step means death
While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it.
Turn me sick with horror to see it struggling and the sound of its screams...
What's that?
Oh, that. The people around here say it is the hound.
Surely you don't believe such rut.
Bogs make queer noises.
Or perhaps it's a Bittern booming.
A Bittern?
Yes, a very rare bird, practically extinct...
If anything is extinct on the moor.
Stop! Stop!
Look out, stop!
That was a voice, a woman's voice.
Thank heavens you heard me.
Another few yards you would have been into that mire.
It looks innocent doesn't it?
But only yesterday a little moor pony got into it and that was the end of it.
Well, thank you for shouting at me.
You're Sir Henry?
Yes
I suppose I should say welcome, Sir Henry. but I'm afraid it wouldn't be sincere.
Oh that's understandable.
A stranger coming here and taking the place of someone you were fond of.
Oh, it's not that.
No, tell me what it is it?
Sound silly I know, but...
Oh it's not that ridiculous hound legend?
I never used to believe those things until I came to live down here.
But you do now.
You're rich, you can go anywhere you want to.
There's so many other places to live in the world, interesting places.
Just now I find this place very interesting.
Why hello, Beryl!
Hello!
Dr. Watson, my step-sister
Miss Stapleton.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Hello, Doctor.
And this I'm sure must be...
- Sir Henry, my brother.
- How are you?
I was just telling Dr. Watson, how delighted we are you decided to come here
I am here and to stay.
Well that's splendid, you know it has been quite dull down here since the halls been closed.
It's wide open now, especially to friends of my Uncle.
You must both come and dine with me.
You must come to us first.
Yes, what about tomorrow night?
You and Dr. Watson
Will invite the neighbours over to meet you.
Of course you already know, Dr. Mortimer the only other one is old Mr. Franklin.
Who's he?
Oh, wait until you meet him, Sir Henry
He'll bring suit against you,
I warn you.
What on earth for?
He'll find something.
Suing people is a passion with him.
I look forward to meeting him.
All right tomorrow night.
Thank you.
And thank you again for rescuing me.
Goodbye.
"There is something about this fellow Stapleton I don't like.
However, his charming step-sister has invited us to dine with them at their house, across the moor, near the village"
And were it not a personal insult to Sir Henry, I would never of come here this evening
Oh but why, Mr. Franklin?
I is a stickler for convention
I'm not in the habit of breaking bread with my host. on the eve of persecuting him.
Great heavens!, What crime have I committed now?
A most gruesome one, Mr. Stapleton.
That of body snatching.
What?
You're a body snatcher, sir. a ghoul, a despoiler of graves!
Oh, come, come Mr. Franklin, that is a very serious charge!
Beryl, re-fill Mr. Franklin's glass will you?
Thank you, my dear.
And an excellent vintage it is too but if you're implying that I am tipsy, sir.
Oh, of course he's not.
Tell us more Mr. Franklin,
Whose body has
Mr. Stapleton been snatching?
According to my evidence, Sir
Mr. Stapleton was seen digging among the old stone huts in the moor and removed from there a skull.
Oh, that!
A most interesting relic, Sir
Henry of Neolithic man.
I'll show it to you after dinner.
50,000 years old, if it is a day.
Nonetheless, sir you removed it from the grave without the consent of the next of kin and according to British law, that constitutes body snatching.
Deny that if you can.
But what good will it do you to prosecute Mr. Stapleton?
None, sir
I have no interest in the matter.
I act entirely from a sense of public duty.
If you care to drop by my house some day and take a tippler of wine with me
I'd be glad to tell you a thing or two about everybody here.
About him
Prowling the Grimpen mire at night.
And why he takes her with him.
Oh, there is no secret about us
As you know, I dabble a bit in the Occult.
Mrs. Mortimer has very strong mediumistic qualities.
She finds the old caves in the moor particularly conducive to psychic phenomena
Very interesting.
Have you ever tried to communicate with my uncle since his death?
Oh, yes, on several occasions.
With no success.
But if my wife would consent to a séance tonight while you, Sir Henry, are present, we might...
No, no, James not tonight, please.
Perhaps some other time.
Shall we have coffee in the drawing room?
If you and Dr. Watson would care to see my little collection...
- Oh, yes, the skull. - Yes, well in here.
- I would like to very much.
Quite a museum.
Oh, a very modest little collection.
But this one really is quite a treasure.
You will observe its unusual cranial index
Gentlemen, gentlemen, my wife has consented, she's agreed to a séance.
Splendid!
Please, come at once.
Now then if you will all get chairs arrange yourselves naturally, comfortably here by the fire
As Shakespeare says,
"You can call spirits from the vasty deep, but will they answer"
I don't answer scoffers or sceptics.
If that's your attitude, Mr. Franklin perhaps you wouldn't mind leaving us.
Oh, I am sure Mr. Franklin didn't mean to doubt.
Of course I doubt, and I ask you to keep a civil tongue in your head, Dr. Mortimer.
Ordering me out from under the roof of my host is grounds for a very, nasty, little lawsuit.
Oh, come now, Mr. Franklin, sit down by me.
Now, tonight we may communicate with Sir Charles.
Find out what he feared so greatly.
What he was running away from.
Now Jennifer you sit here, please.
Sir Henry here.
Oh, would you please put out those lights?
Certainly.
Stapleton, that light, please.
Dr. Watson.
Now, if you all keep quiet, sit quite naturally.
Sir Henry, your hand please
Sir Charles can you speak to us?
Let us know if you're present.
There are things that only you can explain.
Speak to us, Sir Charles if you're here.
There are things only you can tell us.
Sir Charles, can you speak to us?
Let us know if you're present.
There are things that only you can tell us.
Speak to us, Sir Charles, if you are here.
There are things that only you can explain.
That sound I have heard it before.
It's nothing, nothing but the wind.
Or a Bittern, I was telling Dr. Watson only yesterday about it.
Sir Charles,
What happened that night?
What is it you feared?
Tell us, Sir Charles.
Of all the weird terrible things that have happened on the moor.
Listen, there it is again.
I can't stand it, will someone put on the lights, please.
I tell you it is nothing.
Nothing but the wind.
Mr. Franklin,
What do you think it was?
The hound, of course.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Any fool would know that.
James, get my cape, take me home.
Very well, my dear.
Dr. Watson, can I give you and Sir Henry a lift?
No thank you, we have our own carriage.
You're trembling.
That wasn't the wind we heard;
I've heard that sound before, often that's what I tried to tell you yesterday on the moor.
That's why I wish you hadn't come here.
But sounds can't hurt you.
It doesn't matter what they are or where they come from
You don't know.
Oh, you have got to get all that nonsense out of your head, Beryl!
I wish I could.
You're going to. I am going to make it my business to see that you do.
You have been alone too much there's nothing to do down here
That's the trouble.
I am going to change all that..
If you let me. will go fishing together, riding...
You like riding?
Yes, I do.
Good, will start tomorrow, shall we?
Yes, thanks.
Fine.
I'll ride over for you in the morning.
Are you coming, Sir Henry?
Right, Doctor.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"My dear Homes - Nothing to report except that I am quite convinced that that Sir Henry is head over heels in love with...
Hello!
Hello Beryl.
Well, where shall we go today?
There's one place we haven't been
- High Tor.
- Fine.
That's where all the old ruins are.
You know Jack says they are all 50,000 years old.
That sounds interesting.
And you can still see the remains of their stone huts.
All right, good.
Those flattish stones over there are graves.
Oh, those huge bronze monoliths, are remains of their temples.
Doesn't anybody know who they were... or what they look like?
Jack has some theory about them.
But anyway they must be very primitive.
Living on roots and dressing in skins.
But still laughing and dreaming just as we do.
I wonder how many times some young savage brought his bride to this very hut? said "take your hat off darling, this is home"
You know this is probably where she cooked his first meal for him.
What a yell he must of let out when she burnt it up.
And now they are quite forgotten.
Just as we will be too, one day.
Do you suppose when a man met a girl that he liked he had to wait a respectably long time before he dared tell her? or are things like that sudden, natural?
I would like to think things were like that.
Beryl, that's the way they are with me.
Oh, but we've only known each other such a little while.
There you see, convention, custom.
We can't even be ourselves when we want to be.
Why is that?
You know I used to come down here quite often and explore these old caves when Jack and I first came to live here.
I didn't have a fear of the moor then.
And you've none now, that's all gone.
When I'm with you it's gone. I seem to forget it, laughing and talking.
But when I am alone it all comes back to me.
At night I still wake up trembling as if in my sleep
I could hear those awful noises... then it get's bad as ever.
Oh, I think of you and I wish you weren't here.
Oh, don't say that!
I wish you were in
London or in Canada.
But even if I wanted to go back to London or Canada, I couldn't.
Why not?
You know why.
You must know why.
I can't go anywhere now unless you come with me.
Oh, Henry!
Would you mind pausing for a minute.
I am afraid I have lost my way.
Hello, Doctor, Sir Henry and I were just...
We were, getting engaged.
Engaged, splendid!
May I congratulate you both!
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Who is that?
It seems we didn't pick a very secluded spot.
What do you want?
Just crossing the moors, sir.
Just crossing the moor
I be
I be peddling my wares, sir.
I must having something here would interest you, sir.
How about a nice mouth organ, sir?
No, thank you.
Here is something an old squire like you could use, sir.
A whistle.
A whistle for calling your sheep dog.
Calling my what...?
Sheep dog, sir.
A regular charmer, sir.
You'll hear it for miles around, sir.
Take it away and yourself with it.
How about some scent for the Lady, sir?
That will do, be off and about your business.
All right, all right,
I ain't doing no harm.
I ain't' doing no harm.
You know that's what
I hate about this moor.
There is always something strange.
Look, he's limping on the other foot now!
"Dr. Watson- if you want to hear something to your advantage come at once to the stone hut southeast edge of the Grimpen mire"
Barryman.
Yes, sir.
Who delivered this note?
No one, sir.
I found it slipped under the front door.
Thank you.
Barryman, is Sir Henry home?
No, sir. He has gone across the moor.
Oh, sorry I missed him. Did
Dr. Watson go with him?
No, sir.
Oh, thank you, Barryman.
I'll tell Sir Henry you called, sir.
Yes, do.
"Sit down and make yourself comfortable"
Was it you who sent me that communication?
I did, sir.
Out with it.
Whatever it is you want me to hear?
I only want you to hear this zither, sir.
Zither?
They don't come no finer, sir.
What blasted impertinence.
Getting me out here...
Look here my man
You're up to something.
I, I only ask you to try it, sir.
Be careful! This thing is loaded.
Who are you?
Well, I might ask the same of you, sir.
Trawling around the moor, spying out on everybody.
That's my business, to spy.
Oh, it is, is it?
Yes, and if you want to know who I am,
I'll tell you.
Who are you?
I am Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes, the detective?
Yes, and now perhaps you realize why I can't be hoodwinked.
Oh, sir, sir, that changes everything.
Now who are you? Quick.
Well in that case, sir my name must be Watson.
Holmes.
How are you, my dear fellow?
A fine detective you are, calling yourself Sherlock Holmes.
So you have been down here on the moor all the time.
That's a fine way to treat me, I must say!
Send me down here, let me think you are in
London, working on that blackmail case... let me sit up half the night, writing those blasted reports
Here are the reports my dear
Watson and very valuable they were to.
I made arrangements to have them forwarded onto me.
A dirty trick which I'll not forget. ah but a very necessary trick
If I'd come down here with you and Sir Henry, every movement of mine would have been watched while in this way only you and
Sir Henry have been watched and I have been free to work.
That's all very well, making a fool of me.
Sit down, Watson, do sit down.
Perhaps a little supper will help you get over your huff
Huff? I'm in no huff!
Here try some of these sardines.
It's a pity I didn't know you were coming,
I would have provided a brace of pheasants.
It's a pity you didn't think of bringing down that infernal violin of yours. to regale me with some of your enchanting music.
I did my dear Watson.
Anything to oblige.
Well, if you've had enough to eat Watson... and are feeling of better spirits
I think we better be getting along.
Getting along where?
If I am not prying.
I'm returning with you to Baskerville Hall.
There are still some gaps to be filled in, but all in all... things are becoming a little clearer
Not to me I assure you.
Still a hopeless jumble.
Mr. Franklin, Dr. Mortimer, the Barryman's...
Put it all together and what have you got?
Murder, my dear Watson.
A refined cold blooded murder.
Murder?
There is no doubt about it in my mind, or perhaps I should say in my imagination that's the way crimes are conceived and where they are solved, in the imagination.
But there has been no murder unless you mean, Sir Charles. and the facts clearly indicated that he died from heart failure.
That's why so many murders remain unsolved, Watson.
People will stick to facts, even if they prove nothing
Now, if we go beyond facts use our imagination as the criminal does, imagine what might have happen to him and act upon it as I have been trying to do in this case... we usually find ourselves justified.
Then you know?
Another day or two at the most and I will know.
My one fear is that the murderer will strike before we are ready.
In that case...
What's that?
Where is it coming from?
There.
No, no there.
The hound!
Come on Watson, quick
Look.
Sir Henry.
Must have run along that ridge and fallen over the cliff.
He's dead?
Skull crushed in.
- The convict, thank heavens.
- What?
That's the man I shot at the night we arrived.
The man Barryman was signalling to.
Who is it?
The Notting Hill murderer.
He escaped from prison last month.
Hiding on the moor ever since.
The Notting Hill murderer?
You mean he is responsible for all this?
That remains to be seen.
But he is wearing
Sir Henry's clothes.
Yes, yes, that accounts for it.
Accounts for what?
For the hound. These clothes were the cause of that poor devils death.
You mean that the hound was after Sir Henry.
Yes, and mistook the convict for him because the scent of the clothes
Do you remember that missing boot, Watson?
Why do you suppose the brown one?
The one that had never been warn? was so mysteriously replaced and the black one taken?
Why?
Because a boot that had never been worn wouldn't have the scent of the owner and the black one had.
But how did this convict come to be wearing Sir Henry clothes?
Oh, well that's simple enough.
Why Dr. Watson, is somebody hurt?
Who is this?
The convict who escaped from Princeton.
Oh, it's terrible!
I heard a cry that's what brought me over here.
What's your theory about it, Mr. Holmes?
Your quick at identification.
Everybody knows you, sir.
As a matter of fact we have been expecting you down here.
My names Stapleton.
How do you do?
You came in time to see a tragedy.
Yes, yes, a most unpleasant remembrance for me to take back to London tomorrow.
Oh, must you go so soon?
I have been looking foreword to meeting you.
Yes, yes I am afraid I must.
We were hoping, Mr. Holmes, you may be able to shed some light on the occurrences that have puzzled us down here.
Yes, but an investigator needs something more than legends and rumours.
Quite so.
Give me a hand will you, Watson, we better put this poor fellow in one of these huts until the morning.
Let me give you a hand.
Oh, I think we can manage all right thank you.
Where is Sir Henry, Barryman?
In the library, sir.
Now, Barryman, is your wife still up?
Will you tell her Mr. Sherlock
Holmes would like a word with her?
Sherlock Holmes?
Yes
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sir Henry.
Holmes.
I am glad to see you so well,
Sir Henry.
Why didn't you tell me Mr.
Holmes was coming?
Well, I...
He didn't know, we across each other in the village.
I am glad to see you.
What is Barryman?
I asked to see Mrs. Barryman, if you don't mind, Sir Henry.
Of course not.
Come in, Ms. Barryman.
I think you better sit down.
Thank you, sir, I prefer to stand.
I am afraid I have some rather bad news for you.
What is it?
Well it's going to be a bit of a shock.
Oh, they've caught him?
Your,
Your brother.
They will hang him for sure!
No, Mrs. Barryman.
He is beyond the law now.
He is in more merciful hands.
We came upon the poor fellow as we were crossing the moor.
He must have missed his footing and fallen over the cliff.
No further need, Barryman to signal to him from the window or take food out to him or give him Sir Henry's discarded clothes.
Oh, Sir Henry, it is all my doing.
Barryman here wanted to tell you all along so as you could notify the police. but he was my kin, my own kin even though he was never any good.
We understand.
You won't hold it against
Barryman? Oh, yes, sir.
Of course not.
Now take her along and see that she is all right.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Sir Henry.
Well, it's nice to get that end cleared up for their sake as well as mine.
It clears up everything,
I think Sir Henry.
That poor devil must have been completely demented.
And that accounts for those dreadful noises that we have been hearing from time to time.
Exactly.
Your troubles are over, Sir Henry.
I really am most grateful, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, not at all I've done little enough.
But you can sleep peacefully in your bed now and commence to lead the life of a happy country squire.
Well, not for a little bit I am afraid.
I'm off to Canada again.
Canada?
Beryl, Miss. Stapleton and I are going to be married.
Miss. Stapleton?
A very charming young lady,
Congratulations!
Everything is arranged.
Her brother is giving us a farewell party tomorrow night.
We'll be married in London the following day. and then off to a honeymoon in Canada.
My congratulations too, Sir Henry.
Thanks.
What luck you're here.
You and Dr. Watson will be with us tomorrow night
No, I am sorry I afraid I can't
I must hurry back to London and so should you too, Dr. Watson.
You'll have to report to the police here about that convict in the morning but there is a train living early in the afternoon.
Oh, what a pity, Beryl will be dreadfully disappointed.
Now will remedy that when you come up to London.
You must...
You must dine with us before you sail
Well, there's the old boy himself
Sir Hugo, Hugo the
Beast of the Baskervilles.
Not a bad bit of brushwork.
By Ransome, one of the minor painters.
Oh, I don't imagine it's very valuable.
I can't quite agree with you, Sir Henry.
One day, it might prove to be of the greatest value.
Well, we must be going.
There are still one or two little points Holmes, that I can't for the life of me reconcile with your theory. about that poor demented convict.
One or two little points?
Surely, you can't mean he was in London three weeks ago? sent that letter, stole that boot?
Of course not.
Then who the devil did?
The same person who was responsible for the death of that convict last night. and will try again to murder,
Sir Henry tonight.
Tonight?
Unless my imagination has run away with itself and I don't think that it has.
Then why are we rushing up to London?
Leaving, Sir Henry entirely unprotected?
We're not my dear, Watson.
We're just giving the impression of rushing up to London.
In a minute now we will be in
Okehampton, there we'll catch a train back to Dartmoor. and if my surmise is correct we will nab out man in the act.
If you know who it is why all this running about rigmarole?
Why don't you have him arrested?
Because I have no case, not a shred of evidence that would hold in any court.
The only way is to catch him red-handed.
To catch him in such a way there is no escape, no alibi.
That means gambling with Sir Henry's life.
But you can't possibly...
Gambling to save his life!
But we got to take that chance.
Otherwise, the shadow of sudden death will be forever hanging over his head, and sooner or later...
Here we are Okehampton.
And may you both spend the rest of your years together,
- in happy content.
- hear, hear
Thank you, thank you.
And now I want to thank you all for the kindness that you have shown a stranger and when Beryl and I return,
I want you to know that you'll always be welcome at Baskerville Hall.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Sir Henry
It's going to be lonely for you
Mr. Stapleton with Beryl gone.
Yes, indeed it will, Mrs. Mortimer
I should be more dependant than ever upon you, my neighbours.
Don't count upon me, sir.
In my opinion you're a body snatcher.
And until the courts have decreed otherwise.
I want nothing what so ever to do with you.
Oh, Mr. Franklin!
I say driver, can't you go a little faster?
I'm doing the best I can, sir.
You idiot! We said go faster, not break our necks!
How far is it to
Baskerville Hall?
It's 5 miles by road, sir.
But if you want to cut over the moor it's only about three.
Here you are.
Come on, Watson, quick!
It's been a wonderful evening, Stapleton.
Well, glad you could be with us, Mortimer.
Take this broach my dear and wear it on your wedding dress.
It belonged to my great-grandmother.
Something old, something new, you know.
Oh, that's so sweet of you
Mrs. Mortimer! Thank you, so much.
And come back to us soon, both of you.
We will.
May I offer you a lift, me lad.
It's such a beautiful night, Mr. Franklin,
I think I'll walk, thank you.
Merely, a gesture of hospitality, reject it, if you like.
You're not going to cross the moor alone, Sir Henry.
Why not? There's nothing to fear anymore.
We can't be sure.
Oh, but I have Sherlock Holmes own word for it.
Come along, James.
Good night, Sir Henry.
Good night, Mrs. Mortimer.
And the best of luck to you both.
Thank you, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I wish you would let Mr. Franklin drive you home.
I wanted to stay and say good night to you.
This is our last good night.
From tomorrow on there won't be anymore, ever.
Tomorrow we will be away from this place.
I wish it were now.
So do I.
Oh, now don't be silly
Good night, Beryl.
Good night, dear.
Well was it a nice party?
Wonderful, everything and most of all you.
Jack, I haven't said very much about going away but...
You know how I feel.
Yes, of course, it had to be.
You won't be too dreadfully lonely will you?
Well I should have my work.
Henry and I will be back before you even know it.
Yes, of course you will.
Well, you better go to bed now.
You got a big day ahead of you tomorrow.
Good night, Jack.
Good night, dear.
Over there.
We'll head him off.
Jack.
Where are you?
He's coming too.
You'll be all right old man.
Watson?
Yes, ole chap.
Mr. Holmes?
Yes.
What, what was it?
We've got to get him home, quickly.
Can you manage him alone?
- Yes.
- Cause I got things to do.
Help, get his arm around my shoulder.
I'm all right.
It's pretty painful, I know.
But it won't take much longer.
Go on, it doesn't hurt.
Now, Mrs. Barryman some gauze, please.
I just heard the dreadful news.
Thank heavens, you're safe.
Is he all right?
Well, now we know for certain this is no legend.
No myth, there really is a hound.
Was a hound?
Yes, Mr. Holmes told me.
I ran into him across the moor.
He asked me to send you to him at once.
It's a matter of great importance.
He said he would wait for you at the spot where the beast was killed.
I must finish here first.
This poor boy has taken a terrific beating.
Well, I could carry on for you, Doctor
I'm a bit of a doctor myself, you know.
Do you think you could manage?
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I think you really ought to go, Dr. Watson
Mr. Holmes was most urgent.
Oh, really?
I should need some hot water,
Mrs. Barryman.
Oh, I want it boiling, please.
Yes, sir.
Must have been a terrifying experience, Sir Henry.
Terrifying.
It was.
It was indeed.
Yes, I can see you are still weak from loss of blood.
I can't say I feel any too well.
Here drink this, Sir Henry.
You will feel much stronger.
I'll see to your other bandages after.
Oh, it may taste a little bitter but don't mind that.
Sir Henry...
Well, feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
I say that's uncomfortably close to your eye isn't it?
All along this side... well, well.
Oh, I am terribly sorry, that was clumsy of me.
It was only a bit of a tonic.
Sir Henry, has lost considerable blood.
- Yes.
- Henry
Henry!
I'm all right, darling.
Oh no, you're not.
We hear those dreadful noises on the way home.
It's a mercy he's alive.
I owe you an apology, Sir Henry, for jeopardizing your life.
Jeopardizing?
But you saved my life.
But there was no possible way for me to fore tell the plot.
And I must also apologize to for deceiving you last night when I told you that your troubles were over
I knew that they weren't.
But if I hadn't cleared out, the crisis which came tonight would have indefinitely been postponed. with the shadow of death hanging over you... and over you too
Miss. Stapleton.
You knew this was going to happen?
How could you know?
The person who wanted to snuff out your life, Sir Henry, was the same one who plotted to kill your Uncle.
He wanted to get you both out of the way.
So, he could lay claim to this place, to the whole Baskerville estate.
In tracing back his lineage.
He discovered not only that he was the next of kin.
But also learned of that old legend about the hound.
So he brought the hound to life.
By the simple expedient of buying the most savage dog that he could find and hiding it on the moor until he needed it.
If he had succeeded tonight the blame would have fallen on the legendary monster. and no possible suspicion would have been attached to him.
A most ingenious device.
And I am quite sure that he would have had no difficulty in proving his claim to Baskerville
Hall and all that goes with it.
The most amazing instance of a throw back that I have ever seen.
And you can see for yourself.
Stapleton.
One move and I'll shoot!
Jack.
You two, stay where you are.
You're under arrest Stapleton, for the murder of Sir Charles Baskerville, the murder of a convict and the attempted murder of Sir Henry.
You can't arrest me, Holmes.
Now one move from any of you and
I will blast you all to kingdom come.
So, sorry old boy.
What's the matter, old man?
What's the matter?
That's our man.
Stapleton, a murderer.
He won't get very far.
I've posted Constable's on both the roads and the only other way, is across the Grimpen mire.
I'm so sorry, Miss Stapleton.
I wish I could have spared you this.
Well, that officially closes the case, Sir Henry.
And a very interesting case for your annals Watson.
An ordinary dog and a genius criminal.
And a more ingenious detective.
I owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude.
Oh, we all do, Sir Henry!
Mr. Holmes, we have admired you in the past as does every Englishman.
Your record as our greatest detective is known throughout the world.
But this, seeing how you work knowing that there is in
England such a man as you.
Gives us all a sense of safety and security.
God bless you, Mr. Holmes!
Thank you, Dr. Mortimer, thank you.
Now, if you don't mind, I have had a rather strenuous day
I think I'll turn in.
Of course.
Good night, good night.
Good night, Mr. Holmes.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, Watson. The needle.
Music
<b>THE PHANTOM LIGHT
Yeah, yeah.
Here, missus, where do I get a car to the village?
[speaking Welsh]
What?
[speaking Welsh]
Alright. Alright. Alright.
[speaking Welsh]
Same to you.
Huh, nice place, Wales.
God, blimey.
Whose there?
Hello... -Beg pardon?
I'm sorry, miss. Nice evening.
What's nice about it?
I've been here for hours.
Oh, you don't happen to know where
I could find a car, I suppose.
That's just what I'm waiting for. -Well, isn't anybody about?
Only the old station woman, and she only talks Welsh.
Funny sort of place.
Oh, here's a porter.
Oi, taffy, come here.
Do you speak English? Well,
I want a car, see. -A car.
A car to take me to the village. -Both of us.
Car. -Alright, alright,
I heard you, cook.
God bless me soul. Another white man. How did you get here?
Transferred from Clapham Junction.
-Huh.
Now listen, I've got a job of work to do, see.
I'm reporting for duty tonight.
I'm taking over at the North
Stake Lighthouse. -Oh, are you?
Yeah, any complaints? -Plenty.
-Well, go on then, spit it out.
Well, down here they say the lighthouse is haunted, and what's more, blokes go mad and kill their selves.
Oh, do they? -Have they? -Yes, miss. The last bloke done himself in or somebody done him in.
People say it's ghosts.
-Who told you that?
Well, the whole blinkin' village.
-Ah, don't you listen to him, miss.
He's been so long from a fried fish shop he's gone batty.
Oh, be quiet, this is interesting.
Well, I'm sorry interrupt, miss, but you see I'm late as it is.
Now then, old sport, what about that car?
Right-o, cook. I'll go and have a look down the road.
Uncle Percy of the Children's Heart.
You know, I think you're wonderful, mister...
Higgins. -Higgins.
The way you don't seem to mind about ghosts and murders and things.
Oh, a lot of nonsense. -Well, it didn't seem like nonsense to me.
Oh, didn't it? -No.
You know, you surprise me, Mr.
Huggins. -Higgins. -Higgins.
I always thought lighthouse keepers were grim and grisly with yellow teeth and scars.
You know, sort of human gorillas.
I never realized they were good looking like you.
Well, there are two in the service handsomer than me.
Now then, miss, what's your little game?
Take me with you to the lighthouse. -What?
Well, don't look at me like that.
-Oh, so that's your game, is it?
Well, you can put that idea out of your head.
There's nothing of that sort of thing goes on in lighthouses.
What sort of thing? -Well, that sort of thing. -How dare you!
Well, ain't that what you meant?
-Of course not. -What did you mean?
Mr. Higgins, I'm going to tell you the truth.
I live nearby in a small village.
Life in a small village is very dull, Mr. Higgins.
Not with you there, I'll lay a pound to the sausage.
Of course, I do all I can.
I belong to a psychic society.
Wales is full of folklore, you know. -Is it? -Didn't you know? -No.
Now, I've heard this legend about the phantom light, and I mean to investigate it for my society.
Well, I'm very sorry, miss, but you can't do it on my lighthouse.
You see, I've got me instructions, and though they mention there's a lot of funny things they don't mention no women.
We've got work to do on the lighthouse, and females is tattoo.
Now how good looking am I?
This is the station's car.
It looks it.
Oh, it lools to beatup to put anybody in.
I suppose there's somewhere
I can sleep tonight.
I expect they'll put you up at the pub, miss.
This is the pub, miss. -Well, thank God we've got here.
Where are you off to, mate?
-Harbormasters. Do you mind?
Well, you better walk the rest. It's safer.
I believe you. How do I get there?
Down the street, follow the stream, then take the steps 'round the cliff.
-Right-o. -You'll see it by the harbor.
Here you are, mate. Here's my share of the damage.
Goodnight, miss. -Goodnight. -So long, cook. See you at the funeral.
So long, misery. I'll be in the front carriage.
Not there, miss. That's the bar.
You're the Bottle and Jug.
Well? -Is this the Bottle and Jug?
YES. -I want a bed.
[Crosstalk]
Nice evening. -Maybe.
[Singing in Welsh]
I tell you that nobody may visit the lighthouse without the permission of
Trinity House. Nobody at all.
It is the regulations. Nobody.
Not at all. -But if I was to go -
When I tell you it is the regulations,
I tell you it is the regulations.
Don't you understand me when I speak English?
Name of Higgins, chief lightkeeper.
Reporting for duty at the
North Stake Lighthouse.
Good evening, lightkeeper.
We have been expecting you.
Now that's off my chest.
Oh, thanks very much.
So he did, did he? -Yes, 50 times did I tell him he could not go, but he would stand there and argue. -Funny, ain't it?
You know, there's lots of folks like him.
They think there's something romantic about lighthouses.
Romantic. A couple of months out there in winter weather, that would learn him.
Pork and beans, pork and beans.
And you're lucky if you find the pork.
By the way, where is this here lighthouse?
Marked in the chart. -Over there?
I see. Half a mile from the shore around the inland.
So if I got a bit of skirt in the village I can't wave to her.
Mr. Owen,
-Yeah.
What about a boat to the lighthouse?
-My brother Griffith will take us over.
The boat is ready. It is the others we are waiting for.
It is time Dr. Carey was here, David.
Late he is and we must go out on the ebb tide. -Aye.
Is it him we're waiting for? -And Sergeant Jones.
They have to make a report on poor Jack
Davis, the lightkeeper who was killed.
Drowned wasn't he? Poor devil.
He just disappeared.
Disappeared like the other lightkeeper before him.
Well, I hope it ain't catching.
What's the doctor coming for?
For poor Tom Evans. It is him we will be bringing off from the light tonight.
What, the other lightkeeper? I wasn't told this. What's his trouble?
His poor brain got twisted by what he saw the night Jack Davis died. -Cuckoo?
Only yesterday we knew it. There were signals from the light.
Very rough it was. Hardly the relief boat get out to the light.
But whose in charge out there now? -Claff Owen. -Owen?
My brother. -Let's get this straight.
There's you two Owens here right now, then there's Claff Owen at the lighthouse now.
Then there's the Owen who drove me down in the car. That makes four.
Anymore Owens?
Well, there is John Owen in the coal and William Owen, the gas.
They are the cousins of
Owen and Owen at the post.
And there is Iva Owen at the farm and Trevor Owen.
Owen, Owen, Owen, ain't anybody paying?
That's not bad.
There will be a sea getting up before long, Griffith. -Yeah.
Wasn't there a big wreck around here last year? -Yes, indeed.
One of the Fern line, it was. My son Emerus was in her, whatever.
It was a lot of men from this country.
It was the North Stake light that drowned them all.
You'd better be careful what you're saying. I mean, this is serious, this is.
You'd better not let Trinity House hear him. How could the light drown him?
But he is right, lightkeeper. It was the light that drowned them all.
Everybody knows it is a haunted light.
And when a ship comes into the channel, suddenly out goes the light and another light comes up onto the cliffs, and the ship goes on to the rocks over there.
A phantom light, I tell you.
Oh. So this is a good place for wrecks, is it?
Well, now, I'm going to tell you something.
It ain't going to spoil my sheet.
I've been in the service now for 25 years come Michaelmas, and I've never had me light go out yet.
Hello, David. -Dr. Carey, this is Mr.
Higgins, the new chief lightkeeper.
Good evening, Mr. Higgins.
-Good evening, sir.
I suppose they've been chilling your blood to begin with, eh?
Well, they've been doing the best, sir.
They tell me the Merry
Fern signaled up channel.
Claff Owen will be pleased. His son's the chief officer on board.
What ships that, sir? -The Merry Fern.
-But I thought she was wrecked last year.
Oh, no, no, that was her sister ship. -Oh.
Yes, it hit the village pretty hard too.
Most of us are small shareholders.
Oh, by the way, David, where is Sergeant Jones?
You will find up to the public house, Dr. Carey, courting Mrs. Owen.
Well, we better go down there and find him.
I don't suppose you'll object,
Higgins? -Lead me to it, sir.
Here. Did you say Mrs. Owen? -The name Owen is not uncommon in Wales.
God blimey, it must be half the blinkin' directory.
How's the sea? -It looks like a bit of a chop come in, sir.
We'd better have a look at the glass.
Yeah, it don't look too good, do it? -No.
By the way, Sam. -Yeah. -You don't believe all those old women stories about Jack Davis' death and the men after him, do you?
Well, I don't know, sir.
It seems a bit odd to me.
Oh, pure coincidence.
Don't let them frighten you.
Well, it's the only bed I've got.
Take it or leave it.
Oh, I'll - I'll take it.
You were quite right about that mattress.
I said it was a flop mattress.
-I thought you said rock.
Your health?
She is staying whatever?
These skinny bits of girls from London do not know when they are well-off indeed.
Aye, it is not everyone who is as good a judge as you, Sergeant.
Perhaps it is because I am used to looking at a really fine woman, Mrs. Owen.
YES.
Hello, chum. -Good evening, Dr.
Carey. -Evening, Evans. Evening, Mort.
Good evening, doctor.
Good evening, sergeant.
Mrs. Owen, I want a couple of good tarts of rum.
It is rum, isn't it, Higgins?
-Thank you, sir. Doubles.
Sergeant, they shall want you directly.
This is the new lightkeeper Mr. Higgins.
Good evening. -So you've come to take poor Jack Davis' place.
Well, his place where he was, not where he is.
Ha-ha. Joke.
-I hope it's the right one.
Well, cheerio. -Cheerio.
Same again? -I should say so. -Single.
You blokes, what about having one with me?
No.
Well, it isn't many fisherman would care to drink with the man that has his fate on him.
Well, perhaps I better pay before I pop off.
We're all ready now, doctor.
-Oh, right David. Sergeant?
Yes, doctor, Whenever you're ready.
We'll need to be getting right away on the tide, doctor.
Even now it will be dark before we get to the North Stake rocks.
You got a special rig for Tom Evans?
That's what I just came up to show you. -Right.
You will follow Higgins. -As soon as
I've got my rations, sir. -Good night.
Slowdown, young man.
You're in a hurry, aren't you?
Sorry.
Whiskey and splash, please.
Planning for a rough night? -Bloody rough.
I want a word with you, lightkeeper. Have one?
Well, I don't mind if I do.
Doubles.
Cheerio. -Here, here.
Going out to the lighthouse now?
-Yeah. -I'd like to come with you. -No.
YES. -No! -Have another.
Well, um... -Doubles.
Now listen, do you think that if I could - now, look here.
You heard what the harbormaster said, didn't you?
That nobody could go out to the lighthouse under no conditions.
No.
No.
You're a reporter, ain't you?
How'd you guess that? -You're so ready free with your office money.
Chin-chin.
Does anybody here got a motorboat
I can hire? -There is Tim Morgan.
Where can I find him? -Well, he lives at the grocers down the street.
Say you'll come from me. He'll want paying in advance, young man.
It's a very old boat he has, and the coast is very dangerous.
I know the coast.
Gin and soda, please.
Not much gin.
And soda? -Not much.
Good evening. -Good evening.
-Nice evening, isn't it?
Yes, very.
I know what that is. That's a map.
I've got one at home.
An awfully nice map.
What did you say?
-I didn't say anything.
It is a nice evening, isn't it? -Yeah.
-Lovely evening to go out in a boat.
Is it? -Oh, I'd love to go out in a boat tonight. -Would you?
Do you know what I'd do if anybody asked me to go out in a boat? -No.
Well, just ask me and you'll see.
Well, of course I would not go out with you now if you begged me to.
Thanks very much. -But you are going to beg me, aren't you? I know you are.
Anything else you know? -Yes. You want to go out to the lighthouse.
Oh, do I? -Yes, and you've hired a motorboat. -Have I?
Yes. I heard you when
I was around there.
I see. -Well, what about it?
-Why do you want to go out there?
Well, I want to go because you're... to be with you... -Goodbye.
No, but... no, no, listen. Wait. Wait.
Listen, I'm going to tell you the truth.
Oh no, you're not.
Use the tressel.
God blimey, King Kong.
Well, Higgins, how do you like your new quarters? -Oh, they're all cozy, sir.
Especially the loony ward.
Oh, thanks.
When was the last attack? -This afternoon, Dr. Carey. About teatime.
Well, he looks as quiet as a lamb now.
Get off of me.
[Fighting]
There, there now.
Larry? -Yes, Dr. Carey? -We must have a word about this.
It's impossible to get him away in this condition. -What sent him that way?
Who knows. Perhaps it was
Jack Davis dying so suddenly.
No, David, he's certainly not fit to be moved.
Well, he's fit enough to all but murder you, sir, and chance it.
It's out of the question,
Higgins.
Any sudden shock might be very dangerous to the poor fellow.
Well, no offense, sir, but
I'm in charge here, you know?
And if me and king - I mean, if me and Claff Owen and the boy have to look after the light and take on his nibs in all his resting as well.
He's not to be moved, Higgins.
-Well, look here, Sergeant -
You heard what the doctor said, lightkeeper. That's enough now.
Dr. Carey surely ought to know what you should be doing.
Uh-huh.
Well, I've made me protest.
That's all I've got to say.
If anything happens it won't be my fault.
Here, how do you know it wasn't him what done to these blokes before me?
Do you know who that poor boy is, Mr. Higgins?
My sister's son. He's a good lad when he is normal.
Ah, when he is normal.
But he ain't normal.
I mean, he has these come-and-go fits.
When they come, somebody goes. -Aren't you talking rather wildly, Higgins?
Well, as I said before, sir, I'm in charge here.
You've said that many times. We know it now. -Well, I am, ain't I?
There's no need to worry, Higgins.
-Oh, I'm not worrying, sir.
But if I'm found tomorrow morning at the bottom of the sea with my throat cut
I'll know who is responsible.
Well, I'll know then that you have done your duty.
Oh, I have no doubt it's very funny because I'm busting my sides.
The tide is on the turn, doctor. We should be going.
Oh, alright,
David, I'm coming.
There's nothing we can do here tonight.
I'll need the three of you to look after him.
I'll come over first thing in the morning. -For the body?
Well, he's not going to die.
-Oh, I didn't mean his body.
What's going to happen the next time he goes off the deep end?
These will keep anybody quiet. If one isn't enough give him a couple.
Don't worry, he's only a bit unhinged. -Yes, I've noticed that.
Goodnight. -Goodnight, sir. -Sleep well.
He seems peaceful enough now.
God blimey! Now, now, now, look here.
I've got two things to put you to bye-n-byes and one of them is this.
Who leaves spinners about?
Yeah. Pressure's alright.
Come on.
This is Bob, isn't it? -Yes, sir.
-You've got a nice face.
How did that happen?
Isn't she a beauty?
Not a half. -It wasn't me who left the spinner.
Oh, forget it, old timer.
We'll be having it up and forth before long.
You'd better taking your observations.
I see the log book as I come up. -Aye-aye, skipper.
But why did this man want to come down here?
Reporter - newspaper reporter.
Can you beat it? -Yeah.
There's a lot I don't know, as the farmer's daughter said to the squire, but there's one thing I do know, and that's how to cook a sausage.
Look at them. None of your smooth bananas here, my boy.
Every one with a split stomach.
You can have that one.
It's a beauty. The king his self would be proud to eat that sausage, though I said that it shouldn't.
YES.
Well, to resume.
Bread please.
Thanks. Pepper.
About this reporter bloke, he takes a bundle of notes out of his pocket, see, and he says, “Mate, one night on the lighthouse and you can have the lot." Tried to bribe me.
Me, with 25 years service come Michaelmas.
Then he takes out a lot more, bundles and bundles of notes, all spread out before me.
Pound notes or ten shillings?
-Pound or ten, what's it matter?
What about the honor of the service?
Then at the station there was a girl. What a peach.
You know, lovely beauty parlor lips, film star eyes.
"Take me with you", she says. Just like that.
What did you do?
Do? I give her a look like the one you got now. That settled to her.
Claff? Claff?
Yeah. -Are you aware that I've been talking?
I've been listening. Do you hear anything? -No.
What is it? -Footsteps.
Soft footsteps like Bob and me heard last night. -You've got the rhets.
Sometimes I think of the ships passing to and fro in the storm, and I listen to the gulls beating against the glass and breaking their little wings.
It's then I realize the lives that are in my hands.
Suppose I let that light go out?
I'd have all those drowned souls on my conscience, beating their wings against my window like the birds.
The phantom light. That's what you and me's go to think about.
The phantom light.
-Some of you blokes... well, sure, you'll make me believe it myself before long.
Of course, you know what your trouble is, don't you?
Listen.
Did you hear anything?
I could have sworn.
Last night when Bob and me heard the steps,
I ran downstairs and shouted, but the only answer I got was a scream from poor Tom Evans.
In his bunk he was lying with his face hidden in the pillow and babbling about
Jack Davis and the light and God knows what besides.
All over the floor was the marks of wet feet leading from the bedroom down the stairs.
So down I go to the bottom, and the outer doors are opened
Open. And the wind is whistling in, and the spray from the waves wets my face.
The feet led to those open doors.
It was the spirit of Jack
Davis up from the sea, mangled maybe by the rocks below.
YES.
Poor Jack Davis, back from the dead with the water streaming from his hair.
Oh, God, the phantom light. The phantom light. I don't know...
Now's the time for his sleeping drought.
-No, wait 'til he gets real violent.
Oh, he ain't been real violent yet?
Well, I'm going to get a bit of a rope, see, and tie him down.
There's no need. I know Tom.
My sister's boy, poor fellow.
Well, personally, not being one of the Owen's,
I'd feel safer if your sister's little boy was tied down, see.
Ahoy.
Lighthouse ahoy.
Ahoy below. -Hello...
Mr. Higgins, there's a motorboat off the lighthouse.
Right-o. Standby the searchlight.
AYE-Bye, sir.
Ahoy below. Who are you?
Motorboat drifting, running out of petrol.
Throw us a line. -You can't land here. How much juice you got?
Almost gone. I've got to land. -Alright.
Claff!
Tom - Tom Higgins, ahoy, Sir.
Hello. -Come back. It is against the regulations.
No one must land here.
Come back.
Come on, give us a hand.
Come on!
Come on, hurry up.
Here, catch hold of this.
Good God, sir, it's a weight.
And this.
How many more? -Look out, I'm going to abandon her. -Alright.
Oh no, you don't. -Eh?
Hello... -What the hell are you doing here?
You swear at me later. I don't want to drown now, even if you do.
Here, grab hold of this.
No, don't do that.
Here, give it to me.
Now, when I say jump, jump-
I don't think I can. -You've got to. Now then, jump.
Here now. Catch hold of this.
Go on, quickly. There you are.
Give her a hand.
There you are.
Oh, it's cold.
I couldn't help it.
-Here hand on to this.
Oh, wait 'til I get across.
Don't.
How do you expect us to get up here out of a little boat up to this great, big high place?
What are following me about for, anyway?
Well, I wouldn't have followed you if you had you spoken to me nicely, but the way you shouted at me, what do you expect?
Oh, come on, for God's sake.
Jabber, jabber, jabber.
I've never heard anything like it.
In there, you. You'd better change quick before you make any more puddles.
Yeah, I bet you can do it.
Me best trousers.
Oh well, it can't be helped. Now look here, that's my Sunday clobber.
Now you got easy on em', see?
Well, what are you doing? You'll crease them.
What's in there? -Nothing. You caring about my clothes just as if you... now come on, off with those things of your'n.
It's went enough outside as it is.
Come in.
Here. Help, miss.
Help. They've tied me.
What's up? -There's a man over there. -Oh, him.
Oh, don't mind him, miss.
That's the one, old man.
Now you go to bye-bye, see.
You see, miss, he's batty. He's always seeing things. Anyway, he's tied down.
But I can't undress with a man in the room.
God bless you, there's no worrying about his feelings.
What if he do happen to see you with nothing on?
He'll think he's seeing the fairies.
Well, what was she yelping about? -Oh, nothing.
She just met one of our prize exhibits.
Well, now, perhaps you ought to tell me why you joined up with that bit of trouble.
I didn't. She's a stowaway.
-Stowaway, me foot.
A ruddy girl in a respectable lighthouse.
You wait 'til old Claff has a talk with you. -Who is he, chief lightkeeper?
What him?
Don't make me laugh.
I'm chief here.
Ever heard of King Kong?
You are always saying you are chief here, Sam Higgins.
No one is disputing it.
It is your responsibility this man and woman are on the lighthouse against all regulations. -Well, we couldn't leave them to drown, could we?
This is the reporter bloke I was telling you about. -Mr. Higgins?
Oh, brace them up.
Don't let them drag like that.
I've braced them up and braced them up so much that my feet hardly touch the ground.
Well, go on and roll them up then. Tuck a leaf in them. Here.
God blimey. Tuck your shirt in, can't you? Put it in these here tapes.
Oh, do what you like with them. I ain't your nanny.
Females.
So we've got you on our hands tonight, I suppose. -Uh-huh.
And you didn't know she was with you? -Nope.
Must have followed me and hid under the tarpolean.
Can't these journalists tell them?
You tried to bribe me, didn't you, so that you could give your paper an eyewitness account of life at a lighthouse.
Or had you another idea in coming here? -Aye, speak the truth, man.
Or maybe you'll leave this lighthouse the way others have left it before.
Oh, steady on. It ain't a capital offense, you know.
Mr. Higgins?
-What the... do you mean to say you went and cut my...
Well, you told me I could do what I liked with them, and I think I made a very good job of it.
My Sunday trousers.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Go on, now. Sit on there.
Now, we'll do avail of me Sunday trousers.
What's your little game?
Mr. Higgins, you know I wouldn't have done it -
Oh, for goodness sake, don't turn on the tap.
Here.
Mr. Higgins, I'm going to tell you the truth.
I'm an actress, hiding from the police.
What, you act as bad as all that?
There was a man. He fell in love with me, terribly in love with me, and then there came another man, and he fell in love with me.
And they fought. -What for? -Me. Poor little me.
They fought as cavemen fight for their mates. Oh, it wasn't horrible. I fainted.
And then one reached for a knife and I fainted again.
And then the other reached for a knife, and I ran and ran and ran.
And the next thing I remember I was in a train, and I fainted again.
When I came to there was a man sitting opposite me.
I smiled at him. -And he fainted?
No. I said, "Where am I?"
He said, "Telebuch."
You do believe me, don't you, Mr.
Higgins? -So the police are after you.
They ain't in love with you too, are they? -Oh, please don't make fun of me.
You've got such a kind face. -Hmm, what was the show you was in, Eastland?
Cheerful, ain't it?
So now you know. Of course, personally speaking I don't believe it.
But old Claff - well, here he is.
He'll tell you.
So you believe in the phantom light, Mr. Owen?
Yes, sir, I reckon I do believe in the phantom light.
So will you if the Lord ordains you see the sunrise tomorrow.
The prime minister of mirth.
This thing you heard, opening and shutting doors, do you really believe it was a ghost?
Pretty strong, your ghost.
What was that? -Oh, nothing.
Ain't you had enough excitement already?
Me, excitement? Oh, yes.
Of course, you know you'll be having ghosts after you as well as police if you're not careful.
Are you sure there was no one about when you heard those steps?
No, there was not until Tom Evans let out a terrible, great scream.
It's Davis!
Fetch it quickly. Quickly.
That was a near shave. -Yeah.
I wonder - he's tied up alright.
I'm almost beginning to believe -
Sam. Sam!
What the - what the blinkin' -
They are open, like they were last night, wide open.
Have you searched the place?
Nothing here?
Listen, I've been waiting for a chance to see you alone. -Have you?
You're a frightful liar. -Am
I? -And a fearful nuisance.
Am I really? -Uh-huh. -Then you don't care for me a little bit? -No.
You know, nobody ever hated me before like you.
Really? Isn't that grand? But all the same, I want you to help me.
Opens the door with invisible hands and vanishes.
Don't be silly. How could you vanish if you're invisible?
If you're invisible you're vanished before you started. Ridiculous.
I'm going up to talk to Bob.
Lord protect us.
Lord protect us.
So he tied you up, my own flesh and blood tied up so that you can't move hand nor foot.
Well, we'll soon see about that, Tom, my boy.
We'll soon see about that.
Well, I think it's the most thrilling thing I've ever heard. -Good.
Now, the first thing you've got to do is to keep Sam Higgins out of the way.
Well, I can easily do that. -I'll tell you what, get him to show you the light, him and the other fellow.
-Do you want me to them there?
Yes, as long as you can. Let them go on thinking I'm a reporter.
I'm going down to the storeroom to fix my box of tricks.
It's all wired. It's only got to be connected up.
Bolshies.
Claff!
I thought you was going up? -Claff, they ain't what they said they was.
I just overhead them talking.
You know what they're going to do?
They're going to blow up the lighthouse.
What? -Communists, that's what they are. A couple of ruddy Bolshies.
Now, listen, we've got to act quick and don't interrupt.
I did not interrupt. -No, but you was going to. -I was not.
What if you know. Shut up.
Now listen, you go and take the young lady upstairs and show her the light.
That I won't.
It's against the regulations.
You'll do what you're told.
Who is boss here, you or me? Me.
Then it's unanimous. Now come on.
Come along. Show her the light.
Suppose she doesn't want to see the light.
Hello, Mr. Higgins. -Ah, nasty night, don't you think? -YES.
Still, I suppose you'd rather be in here since the cops are after you.
You won't give me away, will you? -Oh no.
But wouldn't you be better off if you went to some foreign clime?
Foreign slime?
-Yeah.
I knew a bloke who was in trouble just like you. -Oh?
But you know what he done? He grew along beard and went to Russia.
Ever been to Russia?
-Nope, nor grown a beard.
Mr. Higgins, what's up there?
Oh, that's where we keep the light.
Would you like to see it? -Just what I was going to ask you.
Claff, take this young lady up and see the light.
Now, go on and do what I tell you.
Take this young lady up and see the light.
But Mr. Higgins, you're coming too. -No, thanks very much.
I think I'll turn in if you don't mind.
Please.
Wait for me, Mr. Claff. Is it much higher? -We're there now, miss.
Oh, if I had known there were so many steps I might have changed my mind.
Lighthouses aren't built for fun, miss.
What an interesting room. Oh, good evening. -Evening, miss.
Can't I stay here a little while?
-Well, no need to hurry, miss.
What do you do up here? -This is the service room. See this?
That's hollow. It goes right down to the bottom where there's a cupboard holding the weights that works the clockwork.
Why's that so thick all the way down and so narrow in the living room?
There's only a cable passing through it in the living room.
This way, miss. -What's this? -Oh, this is a clinomter, miss. -This way, miss.
Oh.
Oh, hello.
Hello? God bless me soul.
I must have dropped off.
That's funny. -Do you usually go to sleep with your boots on?
Oh, I couldn't sleep a wink without them, chum.
Just habit, you know. -Hmm, not even trouble to slip off your clothes either.
Well, it ain't necessary. You see,
I could sleep anywhere, any hour.
It's in the family.
Same with my father.
He used to go to bed with his hat on. Just his hat and his socks.
You wouldn't believe it, would you? -No.
-That's a fact. Same with my grandfather.
Even on his wedding day they had to wake him up to say I will.
Hello... Oh, by the way, I wanted to ask you something.
Yes?
Have you ever been to Russia? -No.
-Why ask? -I don't know. Just an idea.
Been to Switzerland, if that's any good. -No. -Oh. -Just a moment.
You know, I've took rather a fancy of you.
Now, what was your idea in pretending to be a reporter, eh?
Well, aren't I? -You know ruddy well you ain't. Come on now, what's your game?
Game? -Yeah. -Game.
-Come on, now.
Can't I sail a boat if I want to? -Nice night for it.
I like sailing at night. -Oh, you do? -I like everything at night.
I was born at night. -And the girl? -Never set eyes on her before.
I don't know who she is.
I don't know where she's from.
I don't know how she got into my boat. I don't know a single damn thing about her.
Oh, blimey, you talk as if you was married to her.
Bob.
Hello... -Getting a bit thick out there, isn't it?
Yes, Claff. -Better get the fog signal going.
Aye-aye.
Hello? -Oh, it's you. See
Higgins on the way down? -No.
Well, if you do, keep an eye on him.
He suspects us.
Here, hang on to this.
Oh, Lord, hang on to it. And nip up to the loony hatch. -Where?
The bedroom, play it out of the window.
Leave 6 foot in the room and then shut the window down tight.
It's the aerial.
Everything hangs on it.
And don't fall out. -I won't.
But I promise if I do I won't hang on the aerial.
Hang on to this a minute. Have any trouble?
No.
Did you see anyone? -No. I can't think where they've all got to.
Oh, it doesn't matter. I'll have this ready in a minute.
Oh, no you won't.
Hey, put that down.
This ain't Chicago, you know.
Claff? -And if you shut up a minute I'll tell you something.
Lord, blimey, I've done so much ruddy listening tonight I've got corns on me ears.
Well, come on now, make it short. -Right.
I'm a naval officer. My brother is skipper of the Merry Fern.
Ever heard of that ship?
-She's due in tonight.
Now, all this funny business here, these Wreckers. -Go on.
They're after the
Merry Fern tonight.
They expected her the night Jack Davis disappeared but she was held up at Havre.
I don't like your mate's stories. -Claff?
Oh, Claff's alright. He ain't a ray of sunshine, but he's alright.
Are you sure of that? -What's it got to do with you anyway?
Just you keep on dodging the cops and minding your own business.
I mean, ain't you done enough harm cutting up my best pair of trousers?
Just you mind your own business, see?
But it is my own business, see.
Mr. Higgins, I'm going to tell you the truth. -What, again?
I'm a detective from Scotland Yard.
I was told to join up with Lieutenant Pearce.
And you ain't an actress no more? -Oh, actress?
Oh, of course I couldn't trust you before, but I do now.
Blimey, you a detective.
What is the force coming to?
No wonder the cops wear top hats to set their blinkin' handkerchiefs.
Here, what was you saying just now about wreckers?
Do you mean to tell me they want to sink the Merry Fern? -Mm-hmm.
What for? -Ever heard of insurance? -Yeah.
Well, the Merry Fern's heavily insured, just like the ship that sank last year.
And most of the shares are held by local people.
God love a duck. -You see? Now perhaps you won't be so stupid.
Oh, stupid am I?
Well, I'm not so stupid to believe that you're a real tick anyway.
If you are, produce your papers or your badge or whatever it is.
My, my, my... -Alright, lightkeeper
I'll answer for this lady. She's alright.
Well, if it comes to that, what about you, sir?
How do I know you're a real naval officer?
Alright, sir. Sorry.
Well, let's get busy.
Yes, but what at? -I'm going to talk to the Merry Fern. -Huh?
Oh, I see.
You're going to warn them.
Mm-hmm.
-Good for you, sir.
I can't place the
North Stake lighthouse.
The sound seemed to come from over there.
It's getting thicker, Mr. Owen.
We ought to be beside them by now.
Call Captain Pearce. -Yes, sir.
Both on duty?
Yes, sir. I didn't think it was worthwhile when we were docking in a couple of hours.
Just as well, Mr. Mason.
Cigarette? -Yes, sir.
We haven't sighted the
North Stake light yet.
I want you both to keep a sharp lookout. I'm beginning to wonder.
Excuse me, sir. There's something coming through.
It's a call for us, alright, sir. perhaps it's the station.
Take their message. It may be important. -Yes.
Well? -Mr. Owen's compliments, sir.
Would you please come up on deck?
Mason, bring that message to me on deck.
-Yes, sir.
Young Bob will be done in a moment.
What are you going to do about him? -That's your lookout.
You keep an eye on him. -Very good, sir.
Got them. -Great.
-Yeah, come again.
That's the captain's brother, isn't it?
Put an extra lookout forward, another in the crow's nest.
Very good, sir. Below there. -Aye-aye, sir.
Got an extra man in the crow's nest and an extra man forward.
Get on to it. -Funny. I wonder why Bob hasn't come down.
Bob? Are you there, Bob?
Bob?
Hey, Bob?
Claff?
Another light on the cliffs.
What? Just a minute.
Look.
Oh my God. -It's the phantom light, the one they all talk about.
Then it's true, it's really true.
Don't be a fool.
That's not the phantom light.
That's the wrecker's light, and we've got to put it out.
Get Sam Higgins, quick.
Gone.
-Damn.
Sam, the phantom light's on the cliffs. -What?
Come on.
He's coming.
Oh, are you alright?
Get this, quick.
-What?
Blimey, it's locked.
It's from my brother. Is this all?
-Yes, sir. I couldn't get him back.
God! It's us. Our light's out.
Bob? Bob?
Can you hear me?
Silly roust.
Good luck, sir. -Thanks.
Take the strand. -Right away, sir. -All set? -Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Got it? -Yeah.
Now steady, sir. Slowly.
-Right. Alright let her go.
Yeah.
Here. Don't worry about him, miss. He won't be found ground.
Come on, let's have another go. Come on.
Quick, shove your shoulder a bit.
Lighthouse. Starboard bow, sir.
That's better.
Mr. Owen, ring below.
Tell MrCarthy we've sighted the north stack then head her up.
Very good, sir.
What is it? What is it? -The light.
North Stake light is out.
The North Stake light, out?
Tell the coast guard.
The phantom.
Ahoy.
Ahoy.
You are sure it was on the cliffs that you saw the phantom light, the cliffs up there? -Yes, hurry.
On to the lifeboat.
That is on the cliffs nearby where the coast guards are.
Ahoy.
Hurry you there. Yes, it is the phantom light I tell you.
Stay you there a moment, sir.
Nice lightkeeper I am. -You can't help it. -Can't help it?
Best excuse we all make when we fail.
If a man's worth his salt, he oughta help it.
And here's me with 25 years service come Michaelmas.
Sitting here while a gang of Wreckers plays tag in me own lamp room.
What am I doing, I ask you? Twiddling my thumbs.
I wish I could twiddle them for you, Sam.
Give me his gun.
What is it? -Whatever it is.
Claff!
My God.
They've smashed it.
Where are they?
Where's Bob? Go and see if you can find them.
Don't let them see you.
Here, take this gun.
I've got to get the emergency tanks going. I must get the lights going.
Listen, he's not far off now. -I can't see anything.
Neither can they, thanks to this fog. -Carey, I don't like it.
Why not? -These others. -Ah, halfwits.
It's dangerous.
What about my 50 quid?
You'll get it when the Merry
Fern is on those rocks.
Carey, how did he get here?
I'll tell you I'll pay you when the company collects the insurance.
Company be damned, you're the company.
You promised me my money tonight.
Close the door quietly. Don't let them see you. Don't let them hear you.
I've got to fix the lamp.
[Yelling]
Light's gone out. -Pull her stern. Warn the starboard
Those guys have done it.
They've got that light out.
Wait.
Higgins?
-Mr. Higgins, quick.
What's up? -Higgins?
Hello... -Higgins, I want this door opened. -Oh, you do, do you?
I'm not in the habit of being kept waiting.
Well, what are you going to do about it? -I've got the boy here.
Helpless, and very near the edge.
Don't mind me, Mr. Higgins.
Don't you open that door.
I'm a merciful man, Higgins.
My profession makes me so.
But if you don't open this door in five seconds -
Alright, wait a minute.
Quickly. You go and light the lamp. -Me? -Yes.
It lights like an oil burner.
Turn up the jet at the side.
Quickly,
Alright, sir, just come in.
Alright.
It's a bit stiff this here lock.
-Higgins?
Alright, sir, just coming.
Now then, hands up?
Pull her stern; hard at starboard.
Where the devil are we?
Wait a moment, Mr. Owen. We're just off the North Stake Branch.
Bring us around again.
Warn the engine room.
That was a near one.
-You're right, sir, it was.
So you thought you'd got me, didn't you?
Give me that gun. -Let go. Let go, I tell you.
Damn you.
They must be in the lamp room. Come on. -Aye'.
They're up there. -Where's Alice?
Stop him. Stop him.
Carey?
Come out, Carey, it's no use. I know what you've done, but you can't escape.
You'd better give up.
Carey?!
Signal the lighthouse. Say all is well. -Very good, sir.
Hey, you, wipe your nose and get back to duty.
The Captain says it's alright now.
I bet you got the wind not fogs, didn't you?
Blimey, what a night.

[ Telephone ]
Yeah?
Oh, hello Angie.
Listen, dearie.
A friend of mine called up and he's lonesome, see.
His wife is out of town and he wants somebody to go places with him.
Sort-of show him a good time.
I'm practically there.
14 Claybridge Apartments.
Okay, I'll go right into my dance.
Morning, sister.
Park yourself, honey.
I'll be right with you.
Well, well. If it ain't little Gilda.
It's you, huh?
─ Right here looking at you.
How are you, baby?
─ You got a nerve.
How come?
─ Sending for me.
What's wrong with that?
I got lonesome for my little pal.
─ Since when were you and me pals?
Well I don't just remember the dates.
─ Oh, you don't, huh. Well I do.
Come on, have a drink.
─ Not for a million bucks.
There is no danger of the wife walking in this time.
She's out of town. Come on, Hon.
Hey, that cost ten a quart.
You don't think I'd drink with you, you ..
Why not?
Say, what are you sore about?
You don't know?
You mean because I found out what you was doing?
On the level. I never figured you'd wind up like this.
Where else would I wind up after the deal I got from you?
Ah, that's all forgotten.
─ Yeah?
Say, we ain't going to stand and chew the rag all night are we?
Come on.
─ Cut that out.
Oh baby.
─ You heard me, cut it out!
You're the one man I'm drawing the line at.
Why you ..
Fire, fire, fire!
[ Telephone ]
Oh ..
[ Telephone ]
Yeah?
Oh Angie, what do you want to wake me up so early for?
You're worse than that dame across the way with that Victrola.
Ain't you read the morning papers?
Well, listen.
The Claybridge burned to the ground last night.
"Piet went too."
Burned to death.
The fire started in his room.
And listen, dearie.
"The bellhop squealed on you."
He said Piet had a girl in his room.
Well, the cops came up here and gave me the third degree.
But I didn't spill a thing.
They got a pretty good description of you so you'd better lay low.
And listen, dearie.
Don't mention my name if they catch up with you.
No, I won't.
Thanks, Angie.
[ Door knocks ]
Carl.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah. Your long lost sailor has returned.
Let's see how you look.
Kinda peaky. You had breakfast?
I'm not hungry, Carl.
We'll stage a big feed at noon.
Gee, did I have a time finding you.
I traced you all over town.
You did?
Yep .. if you'd not left a forwarding address at the last place ..
I never in the world would have kept track of you.
What happened to the job at Van Saal?
Why .. I quit.
A long time ago.
─ Didn't like the place?
No.
Left 'em flat, huh?
That's the girl.
Say, I got a lot of junk here for you.
Come on, take a look.
Say. I didn't have this when I went away.
No, dear.
Officer?
─ Bet your life.
Gee that's swell, Carl.
Officers draw down more dough.
When a guy wears a stripe like this.
He can afford to ask his best girl .. the big question.
You know what I mean, Hon.
We're going to get married.
Ain't we?
And look what I've brought you.
I made it myself.
How did you get the boat in here?
Wouldn't you like to know.
From Japan.
Carl.
Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Say, get this.
Gee, that must have cost an awful lot.
─ Nix on how much it cost.
Nothing is too good for my girl.
Here, try it on.
What's the matter?
But.
I can't marry you, Carl.
Why not?
I can't.
You don't love me anymore. Is that it?
No, no.
Some other guy?
─ No.
Well then, what's wrong? We always planned to get married someday.
I've changed my mind, so you might just as well be going.
I wish you would.
I'm not going until you give me a good reason. Have you got one?
Yes.
─ What is it?
Piet Van Saal was killed last night.
I'm to blame.
And the police are after me.
You? What did you do?
─ I went to see him last night.
I thought you stopped working for him.
─ Yes, I had but he wouldn't believe it.
What do you mean?
When I was working for them.
One night he broke into my room and .. stayed there.
He threatened me if I told his wife.
She found out what he was doing and kicked me out.
She followed me every place I got work and told them so they bounced me so I ..
I made my living the only way I could.
I've been making it that same way for almost a year.
Why, you dirty little ..
Where you going?
─ What's it to you?
Everything.
[ Police siren ]
It's the Cops.
They've come after me.
Get your duds together. Hurry.
It's my fault.
If I hadn't left you alone to scrape for yourself, things may have been different.
Hurry!
You couldn't love me after ..?
I do.
[ Door knocks ]
[ Door knocks ]
Hey, for the love of ..
─ What's the matter now?
Do you know you can't smoke down here?
─ Why not?
We've oil on board.
Thousands of gallons of it.
You want to blow up the works?
─ It's okay by me.
Ah buck up, kid. You're getting your first break.
What do you mean "break"?
I always travel Fist Class.
Oh, come on.
Now listen, Hon. There's a wireless out to search all ships for you.
And the skipper gave me the job.
─ What will you do?
We'll pull out of this alright. Don't you worry.
All you got to do is lay low and cut out the smokes and everything will be fine.
Look.
What's that?
─ It's a map.
It shows where I'm taking you, so you will be safe until this mess blows over.
You see that little dot there. That's an island.
It's a small one, ain't it.
Well, that's where we're going.
We'll be there in three more days.
How many?
It won't be for long.
Then nothing can happen to you on the island.
I don't understand.
It's the one place they can't extradite criminals from.
You mean .. they can't send me back even if they find out I'm there?
Yes, right. It's the only place in the world where they've no extradition laws.
All the sailors know about it.
I'll go screwy if I'm alone much longer.
You'll be out of this soon.
Have a little faith, will you.
There's a great big plan that we don't get.
But the fellah that made the plan knows what it's all about.
He will see you through.
He's certainly been doing his bit.
Well, you got to believe me.
I do believe in you.
You are the only one that's ever been decent to me.
Where is this place?
It's in the Caribbean Sea.
Just off the coast of ..
I got to go now, kid.
Don't leave me.
I'm afraid.
Now come on, where's your spunk?
─ I ain't got any.
Sure you have. Let's see you smile.
Come on, now. Smile.
That's the girl.
Hop out, kid.
What am I going to use for legs?
There .. you okay?
Yeah, if the ground would only stop moving.
Here you are.
Come on. Let's see how you're going to like your new home.
Oh, for the love of Mike.
Could you give a guy a break, huh?
You sure this ain't the YMCA?
It's the only hotel in town.
I don't know where else to take you.
Is there something I can do for you?
I want a room.
Oh, I have the most elegant room, sir.
How much?
Sixteen colóns.
Sixteen? That's more than I can pay.
Why, it is my rate sir, for one night.
For a lady and gentleman.
Well, this is just for the lady.
And she is going to be here a long time.
What's your rate by the month? Single.
Oh, the lady is here .. for her health?
The climate up north got a little too hot.
New Orleans?
─ Yeah.
Why, I was in New Orleans lately myself.
So you can have the room for six bits a day, Mam'selle.
Lead us to it.
I'll pay a month in advance and they'll be more coming by mail. Regular, too.
Newcastle.
Yes, Madame?
Show the Mam'selle to the single room at the top of the stairs.
Righto.
Is this the extent of the luggage, sir?
Why, yeah. Nothing wrong with that is there?
Absolutely nothing, sir.
May I ask you to follow me?
What's her moniker?
Is she that sailor-boy's girl?
She is Señorita Gilda Erickson from New Orleans.
USA.
And a very charming lady.
A lady, eh? Ha!
What's she doing here?
Spending the winter for her health.
Send the best bottle of champagne to her. With my compliments.
Hey, lay off. I seen her first.
You? What about me, eh?
Now .. be patient, gentlemen.
She is the only white woman on the island.
You must at least give the lady time to get settled.
Right.
Yes, right.
Hey, remember boys. From now on ..
Refrain from using any words ending in "itch" and "ore".
Perhaps you would like something to refresh you, sir?
That's right. This is a free country.
Oh yes. We have gin, whiskey, rum.
And a dash of almost any cocktail.
Bring me a shot of gin.
Ah, just one. It would kinda steady me a bit.
Never mind. Forget it.
Certainly, Madam.
Perhaps something else?
─ No.
Wait a minute.
I want to get a minister.
I beg your pardon, sir?
A preacher.
Oh, yes. There is a church on the other side of the island.
It will take a little while to get him, sir.
A church.
How do we get there?
I would suggest a carriage.
The centipedes are rather thick on the hillside this time of year.
Order us a carriage.
Righto.
Is there a minister here?
He died last month.
They'll be another here in a few weeks, maybe.
We're out of luck, Hon.
I never really expected you to marry me, Carl.
Well I'm going to, just the same.
We're going to be man and wife before I leave this place.
But how can we?
─ I'll show you.
Ready, Hon?
Yeah.
I, Carl .. "take thee Gilda, to my wedded wife."
"To have and to hold from this day forward."
"For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer."
"In sickness and in health."
"To love and to cherish."
"Until death us do part."
"According to God's holy ordinance."
"And thereby, I plight thee my troth."
Now, do I speak now?
Here, there: "I, Gilda .."
"I Gilda, take thee Carl to be my wedded husband."
"With this ring, I thee wed."
"And lead us not into temptation."
"But deliver us from evil."
"Amen."
You are mine now.
Yes, Carl.
What are you crying about?
Don't you know?
I wish I didn't have to leave you here.
I wouldn't do it if there was any way of taking you with me.
I can take care of myself, Carl.
I don't like the look of those fellows at the hotel.
Don't you have anything to do with them.
─ You don't have to tell me.
They're crooks, all of 'em.
Or they wouldn't be here.
They may get fresh and start something.
You turn 'em down cold and stick to your room.
Would you do that? Promise?
I promise, Carl.
You are my wife. You know what that means, don't you?
It means there will never be anybody else but you.
And there won't, Carl.
I swear it.
[ Ship's horn. Loud ]
Here's some money. I'll send you more by the next mail.
And I'll write you from every port I touch.
But don't be lonesome, babe.
I'll try not.
All you've got to do is believe.
[ Ship's horn. Loud ]
Goodbye, kid.
Give me a big kiss, Carl.
It's got to last a long, long time.
Bye, kid.
Goodbye.
[ Ship's horn. Loud ]
What are those things you are always eating?
I don't like them.
─ Nuts.
Why don't you swallow them, shells and all?
Them ain't shells I'm spitting out. Them is worms.
Come here!
May I ask you Señor, what your intentions are for the chicken?
Honorable, I hope.
None of your business.
And those goes for all of you mugs.
[ Door knocks ]
Hello, cutie.
From me to you, with love and kisses.
What do you mean?
This here is a hen.
Really?
Smart, ain't you. Huh?
Take it back.
No. It's for you. It's for your room.
My room?
─ Yeah.
We get a lot of centipedes down here.
And thy run around the floor and they'll bite you.
And the hens, they eat them up. See?
I'm making you a practical present.
I ain't taking any presents from you or anybody else.
Ah, cutie.
You look like a million dollars to me.
Yeah?
Señor Egan.
It takes more than the ham to make the chicken.
Yeah? Newcastle.
Put this in the pot for supper.
Won't he make a tasty stew?
A most excellent stew, sir.
Have a seat, Mr Bruno.
I was just going, sir.
Will you join us in a drink, Señor?
Brandy.
─ The same.
Leonie.
Three brandies.
Coming right up.
How's tricks?
There are no tricks in my business.
When a man hangs.
He hangs.
What a satisfactory way to get rid of one's enemies.
I have no enemies.
No living enemies, eh Señor?
As jailor and executioner of this island.
I may not be popular with the criminal element.
Meaning us?
─ Hmm.
My activities are confined to island crime, my friend.
Well, we do not believe in the international law of extradition.
Our own laws are very strict.
But as long as you behave yourselves here.
You are safe from both jail and gallows.
Safe in hell.
I do not know which
I would prefer, Señor.
What do you mean?
I will not repeat what
I have heard, Señor.
In my country.
We leave that to the ladies.
Gossip, eh?
So they say my jail is worse than my gallows, eh?
Newcastle.
Yes, Madame.
Three brandies.
Three brandies.
Where will I find the drinking water?
In the rain barrel, Mam'selle.
Help yourself.
Thanks.
What is the matter, Miss?
This water is crawling with something.
─ What?
Let's have a look.
They won't hurt you.
─ What are they?
Wrigglers.
Don't do that.
─ Why not?
You will only have to scoop it up again.
But I can't drink it with those slimy things in it.
Strain them out.
We keep them in all the drinking water here.
Why?
To kill the Yellow Fever mosquitoes.
We believe in protecting the people that visit our island.
Especially the ladies.
More especially ..
The white ladies.
With slimy wrigglers?
Yes.
Hmm.
May I introduce myself?
I am General Emmanuel Jesus Maria Gomez.
I have had the honor of instigating three successful revolutions.
And annihilating three stupid presidents.
Ain't you lucky.
Yes.
If you will allow me, please.
Oh, please.
Your room is a small one.
I am satisfied.
I am fortunate enough to have a suite.
At the end of the battles.
It is my second home between revolutions.
May I offer it to you?
It is very comfortable.
And I shall be there only .. occasionally.
I don't want you to be lonesome.
Here is a few little wrigglers to keep you company!
Keep clean, General.
Hey .. peanuts!
Peanuts!
[ Singing ]
"Da da de, da, da da .."
"Da da de, da, da da da!"
I bid two spades.
Three hearts.
Four diamonds.
What's the matter with you fellahs?
For the past two weeks you've been snapping at each other and ..
Prowling around like a pack of starved dogs.
A very apt simile, Señor.
The mail is here, gentlemen.
What-oh! The mail is here.
Hey-oh!
Is there anything for me?
Nothing for you, Señorita.
He ain't writ you yet?
No, and he won't either. Not him.
I'll write to you, baby.
And I'll mark a lot of crosses on the bottom, too. Huh?
Ah, Jeez, look.
The Walla Walla Penitentiary Gazette.
Is this all the mail there is?
Quite all, Madame.
─ There wasn't a letter for me?
You can see for yourself, Madame.
─ Better luck next time.
Again, you are disappointed.
Perhaps you will do me the honor, to dine with me later?
Hey, nix.
She's putting on the feed-bag with me, see.
Ah, take off.
─ Why you ..
Hey, snooty.
How'd you like to have a big porterhouse steak with fried potatoes with me, huh?
How many times do I have to say "No"?
Newcastle, give me a light will you.
─ Righto.
Hey .. come here, you.
Ouch! You ..
Why you ..
[ Singing: ]
"Pale moonshine on the fields below."
"Darkies crooning songs soft and low."
"Oh, you needn't tell me boys, because I know."
"It's sleepy time down south."
"Soft winds blowing through the pinewood trees."
"All folks down home live a life of ease."
"When my old mammy falls upon her knees."
"It's sleepy time down south."
"Oh."
"Steamboats on the river a coming and a going."
"Oh, they're splashing the night away."
"You hear those banjos strumming."
"And the darkies under the moon."
"They dance until the break of day."
"Dear old Southland with his dreamy songs."
"Can take me back to my land of charms."
"Oh, how I'd love to hold him in my arms."
"When it's sleepy time down south."
Gentlemen.
Please, a toast to Leonie.
Whose eyes are as soft .. as her voice.
Please.
She has at last come out of her shell.
Wine for the Señorita.
─ Go on, get it down.
Champagne.
Champagne only. Only champagne is good enough for a Queen.
Newcastle, champagne, glasses. Come on.
There you are! Eat that baby, and you'll feel like a man.
Uhoh.
As I live and breathe. Old man river.
Hey. What's good for a pain in the neck?
Do you intend to join us, Señor?
I have already made up my mind.
─ Why not?
I am glad to see you come to your senses, my dear.
Yes. So am I.
You are then, wise.
Say, one more day cooped up in that room upstairs ..
And I would have had the screaming heebies.
Wine is what you need.
Wine is only part of it.
Hello, Sven.
Skol.
Skol yourself. Who's got a cigarette?
Oh boy, am I glad to be here.
Lights, music, all I can drink.
Let's make a lot of noise everybody.
Come on! Let's make a lot of noise!
Whoopee!
I never told you why I had to come to this blistering hole, did I?
I'll buy it.
Well, it was like this.
He wouldn't hand over his spondulix.
So I had to wallop him over the napper.
And the silly blighter croaked it.
Ah, button up.
You ain't nothing but a cheap pickpocket, see.
You know what they called me, lady? T-N-T.
I got a ..
I got an international reputation for safe-blowing like nobody else.
Ha ha ha!
Riff-raff, riff-raff anyway.
I am the only gentleman here.
As a General of the revolution.
I kill only Presidents.
And Vice Presidents.
That's swell.
You are exclusive.
You know, I'm a lawyer.
And as crooked as they make 'em.
I put a Police Commissioner on the spot and they took him for a ride.
The rest of these fellows are all small fry compared to me.
What's dear old grandpa doing in this gang?
I ..?
I burned my ship.
Unfortunately, the passengers and the crew.
Were either drowned or ..
Roasted to death.
I and the cook, we managed to save ourselves.
He .. he met with a little accident afterwards.
I collected the insurance for my boat.
Eighty thousand dollars.
And I hope to live happily ever after.
Amen.
This is no place for you, my dear.
You better let me take you over to my house.
Oh yeah?
Yes.
Nothing doing. I'm going to tick with the boys, Admiral.
Come on .. I know what's best for you.
Lay off! And I'm not kidding.
These people .. are not your kind.
What do you mean, they ain't "my" kind?
Because they're criminals?
Say, big boy. I'll tell you something you don't know.
I'm a criminal, too. I'm Gilda Carlson.
That's a phony name I've been using.
I killed a man in New Orleans and I'm just as tough and as hard as any of 'em.
And the sooner you find it out the better. Now scram, Commodore!
Who's got a cigarette?
[ Door knocks ]
Who is it?
What do you want?
I have something for your headache.
How you feeling, honey?
Not too hot.
What time is it?
It's going on five o'clock.
─ What?
You see, the party didn't break up till morning.
So everybody slept all day.
─ What's that?
Mr Gomez made you a little present.
That's rum, Mam'selle.
Not for me, I'm through.
What do you mean, you're through, honey?
Looks like you're just beginning.
─ Yeah?
Sure. Why, you got all the men crazy about you.
But when you came upstairs they almost broke each other's heads fighting.
Ha .. the only thing that kept them away from you ..
Was that they was too drunk to climb the stairs.
Those bozos don't mean a thing to me, and they never will. Get that straight.
What you say is foolishness, honey.
Do I? Listen.
I went downstairs last night because I had to talk to somebody or go crazy.
I had to blow off steam, let loose.
Forget what was worrying me.
That was the only way I could do it.
And I did it and that's that.
And I'm climbing right back on the wagon.
What are you going to do with all the men?            ─ Nothing.
You ain't taking any of them?
─ No.
Honey, how come?
Oh, nothing you would understand.
I made a promise.
To that sailor?
Uhuh ..
Yes, to that sailor. Uhuh ..
And I'm keeping it, too.
You're mighty high-handed now.
But the rent is coming due. And you got to eat.
Why, they all got money.
Especially General Gomez.
Why he's rich, Mam'selle.
And maybe you're going to need somebody before you get through.
Because I've been fooled by them sailor boys myself.
Uhuh ..
Does this boat carry mail?
Room and bath. Best you got.
Righto, sir.
Piet?
Well, I'm a son-of-a-gun.
It's you? Really you?
Sure it's me.
─ You're alive?
I tell the world I am.
But what's happened
The newspapers said you were dead.
Sure they did. That's what gave me the idea.
What idea?
I could go for a drink.
How about you?
Yeah. I'm as weak as a kitten.
Can I take the luggage upstairs, sir?
Yeah, be up in a minute.
─ Righto.
What is your pleasure, sir?
Gin fizz. Plenty gin.
Coffee.
What?
Coffee. Never mind what I'm drinking. I want to hear about you.
Well, it's like this.
The joint caught on fire, see.
I know that.
I got out okay, but I was kinda goofy for a day or so.
Where did you go?
I woke up in a rooming house, blocks away.
How I got there or what
I did, nobody knows.
Go ahead.
Well, I'm an insurance agent, you know.
Naturally, I carry plenty of life insurance.
See the point?
─ No.
No?
Well, the papers and everybody said I was dead.
Well, if I'm dead, my wife gets the insurance, don't she?
Yeah.
─ Alright.
I get to the wife on the Q.T.
She collects while I lay low.
Then what happens?
I grab the corn and beat it.
I never did like her much after she kicked you out.
Then she squeals to the Cops.
Can you imagine?
Well, here I am.
Fifty grand is a nice little nest-egg ain't it.
I can lay low until the smoke clears away.
And then grab myself a new start some place.
Yeah?
As long as I'm here, I'm safe.
That's why I came.
It's safe for us criminals.
But I'm not one. Not now.
They can't do anything to me because
I didn't kill you. They can't touch me.
What's the big noise?
─ It's Piet.
Piet who?
─ Piet Van Saal.     ─ Hiya.
He's the man I thought I killed.
Now I don't have to stay in this rotten place any longer.
I can go home to Carl.
You've always got a home with me, baby.
I forgive you for everything you've done.
Pah!
Hurry back.
I ain't had a kiss yes, Hon.
Come in and have a snifter.
Meet the rest of the guys.
Alright.
I've got a drink coming, if it ever gets here.
Are you from New Orleans?
Yeah.
That's where you met her, huh?
You mean Gilda?
Sure.
She's a pretty good little egg.
And straight as a dye, too.
None of us ever got to first base with her.
That's a laugh.
Yeah?
How long have you known her?
I was her first sweetie, brother.
Looks like she played you for a sucker.
I'm sorry sir, but the coffee has ..
Brandy.
Mister Egan, you know brandy don't sit so well with you.
Brandy, are you deaf?
I can just hear you.
Mister Egan.
Hey.
Come on up, fellahs.
Come on up.
I want you to meet another inmate.
Buenos dias, Señorita.
How much?
Three colóns, 50 centavos, Señora.
Thanks.
I left the old woman flat and blew the works.
With the dough and cash mind you.
Serves her bleeding-well right.
Women are ..
You are a friend of Miss Gilda, I see.
You might call it that, yeah.
An old friend.
Look out for that bloke on the other side of you.
He's nutty about her.
Because he's her protector.
You want to hear some good news? I'm heading north.
You are doing what?
─ I'm leaving for home. New Orleans.
When?
As soon as Carl comes after me. Right away, maybe.
What about the criminal charge against you back there?
Ah, rats with that!
The man is alive. He came in today on the tramp.
Congratulations.
Is that good news or ain't it. Oh boy.
Didn't I tell you she was spoofing you blokes?
Hiya, baby.
You think you can make a fool out of me, do you?
Haven't you made enough trouble for me already?
All comes under the heading of "fun", baby.
You took me for a chump, didn't you.
And played me strong.
You had better go to your room.
Who is this guy?
None other than our public executioner.
Warden of the Prison Workhouse.
Mister Bruno.
The name is Van Saal.
How are you?
Mister Van Saal?
Egan is on a rampage.
I ain't afraid of him.
He's nothing but a big kid.
Not when he's drunk.
And unfortunately there is no law to prevent his drinking.
I am powerless.
I'm going to stay right in my room. He won't come up here.
He might. Have you got a gun?
What would I do with a gun?
I think you'd better have one around.
─ Why?
I wouldn't use it if I had it.
Take it.
You really think I'll need it?
On the level?
I want to feel that you are safe while you are on the island.
You can give it back to me when you sail.
Thanks.
Of course you know it is against the law?
But as long as I give it to you ..
We can forget the law, eh?
I am your friend.
Don't forget that, my dear.
I ain't got so many friends that I'm forgetting any of them.
Don't let her get out of here.
I'm going over to swear up a warrant.
She has a gun in her room.
When I get back .. I shall want you to arrest her.
Deadly weapons are against the law.
Well, I'll be seeing you, gentlemen.
─ Right you are, cocky-legs.
Heh, porter.
Righto, sir?
What's my room number?
─ Number 17, sir.
What room has the little gal got?
─ She's in number 12, sir.
Hmm.
Well, 13 is my lucky number.
Understand?
Perfectly, sir.
Are you sure ..
Your neighbor will put up no objection?
I'll fix that up right away.
It comes under the heading of "pressing business".
You guys watch me if you want to learn something about technique.
[ Door knocks ]
How are you, babe?
Is everything under control?
Yeah, and I don't want any callers.
No law against old friends, is there?
I'm your friend, baby.
─ Don't make me laugh.
A laugh don't hurt nobody.
Go ahead, I can laugh too.
Unlock that door.
─ Oh, look.
I just want to say something to you and I don't want nobody butting in.
Ain't that fair enough?
─ Alright.
Say it and get out.
That's the girl.
Quite a dump you got here.
I've known a million women.
Some of them were plenty nifty.
But I forget them as soon as I leave them.
I never forgot you, babe.
Not for a minute.
If that's all you got to say, give me that key.         ─ Ah, listen.
I ain't holding nothing against you.
The time you crowned me, you mean?
You're older and smarter now.
Yeah .. I'm older and smarter.
I've got plenty of dough and I'm going to be here for a long time.
Get me?
─ Get out.
What's the matter?
You'll never lay your hands on me again.
─ Have a heart, babe.
And nobody else will. I've made a promise and I'm keeping it.
Unlock that door or I'll kill you.
Well, if that's the way you feel about it.
Alright.
How listen ..
─ Cut that out!
[ Gunshot! ]
Order in the court.
You may continue, Mr Jones.
Your Honour.
Gentlemen of the jury.
I have placed before you the simple facts of this case. All self-evident.
All pointing unquestionably to the innocence of this girl, the defendant.
Having weighed the facts, you are about to judge her.
To decide if she lives or dies, for the law ..
Has delivered her into your hands.
That she shot a man, I do not deny, nor does she.
In a desperate effort to defend herself, a man was killed.
He paid with his miserable life for the vicious assault ..
He made on her person and her honour.
And it is but just and right that he paid that forfeit.
As you who have homes to guard must know.
Her character and her conduct since she has been in our midst is above reproach.
Her neighbours and her intimates have so testified.
And as you, sat listening ..
Watching her, analysing her.
You own intuition knew it for the truth.
She is innocent, gentlemen.
Innocent.
And I beg of you in your mercy.
To see her free.
Order in the court.
Gentlemen.
It is your duty to pronounce an unbiased verdict.
However.
Unless you find strong evidence in favour of conviction ..
I ask you to give the defendant ..
The benefit of the doubt.
You're a cinch to get off, kid. Gee, it was a great line that he handed out.
Yeah, wasn't it.
─ So buck up now. Will you?
Any message from Carl yet?
No, honey.
Not even a postcard, huh?
Nothing.
Look here.
Why don't you go over in that little room and rest a while?
Wouldn't you like to?
They'll call you when the jury comes in.
Congratulations.
Oh.
In a few minutes, we will hear the good news.           ─ Yeah.
I'll be glad when it's all over.
─ Of course you will.
We all will.
It's a strain .. having a death sentence hanging over you.
I have been under a strain, too.
It would wreck me to ..
To have to hang you, my dear.
Last night I had a horrible dream.
I dreamed I was tying a rope around your little neck.
I woke in a cold sweat.
Like a cigarette?
─ Yeah.
Thanks.
Everyone has been so good to me.
Why wouldn't they be?
They came to see me the two days I was in jail.
I sort-of thought you would show up, too.
I hate crowds.
It sure will be swell to get out of this place.
Will they let me go as soon as the jury comes back?
I'm not so sure.
You see, there is something else to be settled first.
What?
If they say I ain't guilty,
I'm free, ain't I?
Not quite.
There is another charge against you.
Possession of a deadly weapon.
Well you can explain that.
You gave it to me yourself.
Have you a witness to prove it?
You are the witness.
I don't get what you're talking about.
Perhaps I'd better explain.
─ Go to it.
You would have to serve a light sentence. You can possibly escape it.
What kind of a sentence?
Six months in my prison camp.
Six months in ..?
─ You will be made very comfortable.
I will see to that.
Your own cottage, good food, good liquor.         ─ And you?
Yes.
I will be around.
─ Why you dirty ..
That's why you gave me that gun. You framed me.
Have your hysterics and get it over with.
You planted it in my room so you could railroad me. It was a trick.
It works sometimes.
But this time it don't.
What makes you think that?
─ I don't think it, I know it.
You ain't smart enough to trick me,
Bruno. You ain't go the brains.
You think I can't get out of this, don't you? Well, watch me!
Shut up and be sensible about this.
You'll be in my prison camp before night.        ─ Will I?
Certainly. Tell the court whatever you please about that gun.
No judge or jury will believe you.
─ They'll believe what I'll tell them.
What can you say that has any weight?
─ I can say plenty and I will say plenty.
The court is waiting, Miss.
Will you please take ..
I didn't tell you the truth. I lied to you. Every word was a lie.
Piet didn't do anything to me. Not a thing.
But I had it in for him so I begged him to come to my room and ..
I shot him.
I killed him in cold blood.
I tried to kill him once before in
New Orleans. It's on record there.
This time I nailed him.
I got him when he wasn't looking and didn't have a chance.
I murdered him! I am guilty!
Give me what's coming to me!
─ No, no, listen.
The only time you'll ever touch me is when you tie that rope around my neck.
Oh!
Miss Gilda, why did you ..?
Ah now ..
They let me off long enough to pack my things.
Yes. I know.
It won't take but a few minutes.
I haven't thanked you yet for everything you've done for me.
It amounted to exactly nothing.
You convicted yourself.
Why did you do it?
I had to.
It's the only way I can keep a certain promise I made.
Tell me.
To the one good, decent man I ever knew.
I love him.
With everything I've got.
You're a very brave girl, Gilda.
I've tried to be.
For him.
Do you see what I ..?
It's Carl! Oh, what will I do?
I'll tell him everything.
─ No, no. They'll never let me go now.
I can't drag him into this.
And Bruno would kill him, too.
Why ..
I'll see him alone with no-one around to give it away.
Downstairs in the courtyard.
Keep everyone away.
You're a brick.
There's a man coming here and I want to talk to him. It will only take a minute.
You can keep your eye on me all the time but don't let him see you do it, please.
Take anything I got in there.
There's clothes, money and other stuff. Take it all. I got to see him.
Honey.
─ Carl.
How are you, Mrs Carl Bergen?
I'm fine.
Did you get my last letter?
Which one was the last one?
The one I told you about my new job.
The company has given me a good job ashore.
I ..
I never got that one.
At the end of this voyage, we're going to find us a little home in New Orleans.
And settle down.
No. You bet your life, honey.
No more of this being away from each other.
There's nothing to it.
Say, was that slick about
Piet Van Saal showing up?
Yeah.
Sure.
That was a break, what I mean.
Yeah.
That must have knocked you for a loop.
It did.
Didn't I say when something happens, it's always for the best if you believe in him?
Was I right?
I'm just now beginning to think so.
Oh you are, huh?
Why just now?
It just this minute struck me that ..
You'd never be happy away from the sea.
I don't get you, Hon.
Are you kidding?
Sure, you big baby.
[ Ship's horn. Loud ]
You'd better grab the first boat out of here.
I tried my darnedest to get the skipper to take you with us but he won't do it.
We're only in for a couple of seconds.
That's all the time I got. Forgive me?
I'll meet you in New Orleans. You send me a wire just before you start.
I'll do it, Carl.
Just before I leave.
You're crying.
Me?
Just when everything is going so swell for us, you gotta cry.
Sure.
Women haven't got any sense.
Mine has.
That's the girl.
[ Ship's horn. Loud ]
Gee, I gotta go.
You alright, honey?
Sure?
─ Sure.
Nothing on your mind?
I love you.
I love you too, honey.
I know you do.
And it's made something different out of me from what I .. was.
But I'm good now, Carl.
Just like I was when we wäs kids.
I'll never be bad again.
Never again, Carl.
Oh, my baby.
[ Ship's horn. Loud ]
Goodbye, kid.
Carl.
Give me a big kiss.
It's got to last a loñg, long .. time.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Will you send him a .. a wireless ..
After it happens?
Yes, milady.
He'll be at sea.
He loves the sea.
It's like home to him.
And it's good to be home.
At a time like that.
Alright.
You can tell them I'm ready.
Let's go.
T-G
Good night, good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
That I shall say good night til it be 'morrow.
Good night, good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
That I shall say good night til it be 'morrow.
Good night...
Good night!
Help! Help!
Murder! Police!
Help!
Mr. Stevens!
Peters, help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Help! It's after me!
Help! Help!
Please, help!
Help! It's after me!
Help!
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Peters!
Stevens!
Mr. Stevens!
Help!
Help!
Please!
Help!
Help!
Well, Kitty, what is all this racket about?
Peters! Oh, Peters! I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
He's here in this house! He almost killed me!
The Gorilla! The Gorilla!
- It was awful! He'd've gotten ahold of...
- Be quiet!
- You have been dreaming.
- Oh, no!
- What's that?
- I don't know. I tell you, I don't know anything!
Call the police! Call Mr. Stevens!
He'll kill somebody!
- Be quiet, can't you!
- No, I can't!
I can't stay here or we'll all be murdered!
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Stevens!
- Were you calling me, Kitty?
- Oh, Mr. Stevens!
We'll all be murdered in our beds!
It's that gorilla fellow the papers are so full of!
The killer! He was just up in my room!
Why, now, come, Kitty, you're hysterical!
Oh, no, sir, I ain't hysterical! I've seen him like I said, sir!
Oh, Kitty, you're imagining things. Just you go back to bed.
That's what I said, sir, only there is this.
The Gorilla's paw.
Shall I call the police, sir?
The police? Yes, yes, call them right away.
Just a minute.
I'll handle this my own way.
- Yes, sir. Only...
- Only what?
You're thinking of the time, sir.
The time?
According to the newspapers, the Gorilla gives his victim only twenty-four hours notice.
Oh, nonsense!
Now you go back to bed and don't worry about this.
- Back to bed? Who, me?
- Or don't go back to bed. I'm not particularly interested in where you go.
- Oh, but, Mr. Stevens!
- Kitty...
- Yes, but...
- I...
Hello?
Oh, now, come please...
Just a minute.
That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, but...
I wouldn't be frightened like that if I were you, Kitty.
Look, you be frightened any way you want.
This is my way.
Hello?
I begged you not to telephone me here.
Yes, I know I promised, but...
You gave me until Monday.
Saturday?
Tomorrow?
That's impossible!
I can't possibly raise that amount of money.
Yes, I know I owe it to you, but..
A quarter of a million dollars?
Look, please, now...
Oh, please be patient.
I have a plan.
But it's only just started.
Give me time to work it out and I'll repay you dollar for dollar.
Hello?
I want to send a radiogram, please.
To whom is the radiogram going, please?
Ms. Norma Denby.
'D' as in 'Denver'.
Aboard the S.S. Paris.
'Regret unable to meet you at boat. '
'Mightily important that I see you at my home, tomorrow evening, without fail. '
Sign it, 'Fondly, Uncle Walter. '
Read that back please.
I'm Norma Denby.
Mr. Stevens is expecting you, Ms. Denby.
- May I take your coat?
- No, thank you. I'll keep it on.
Nice cozy little place your uncle has here.
He likes it.
He'd have to live in it.
This way, please.
Well, well, well! If it isn't the prodigal niece!
Oh, it's swell seeing you again, darling.
And good to see you again, too, dear.
I took the liberty of bringing along my accomplice.
- Good, I'm glad you did.
- This is Jack, Uncle Walter.
This niece of mine isn't much of a correspondent.
But the few letters she did write, they were full of you!
Congratulations, young man.
Thank you, and I hope you'll excuse me for barging in like this.
Nonsense, I'm delighted.
I was more than pleasantly surprised to hear that you set your marriage for June.
Do you realize it's only a month away?
Well, we decided we didn't wanna rush things too much, so...
- So we put it off until...
- The day after tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow?
Does it startle you?
Why... Why, no, no, that's fine.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.
But I'm forgetting my role as host.
Sit down, my dear, sit down.
We may as well come to the point...
- Perhaps you'd rather talk to Norma alone, Mr. Stevens.
- Oh, no, no.
No, not at all. As Norma's future husband, what I have to say concerns you, too.
Now, as Norma knows, she and I were named joint heirs under the terms of her father's will.
And until she marries, I'm the executer of her estate.
But should anything happen to either of us...
Why, then, the survivor is the head of the entire estate.
And I think that you, Norma, and you, Jack, as her future husband...
...should know of what that estate consists.
To that end, I have prepared a record of your estate's holdings.
And I want to talk it over with you both after dinner.
But your radiogram said there was something urgent.
Well, if it hadn't been urgent, I wouldn't have sent it.
Well, something's worrying you. What is it, Uncle Walter?
Well, perhaps I'm unduly alarmed, but...
Last night, I received this note of warning.
From the Gorilla.
The Gorilla?
You mean that murderer, the ones the papers have been so full of?
I do.
Well, isn't it possible that this is all just a joke, that someone's playing a prank on you?
I wish I could think so.
But, Uncle Walter, why should he or anyone want to kill you?
I don't know.
Oh, it's possible some old enemy of mine...
I bet I made enemies in my day...
It's possible that one of them in a spurt of revenge has hired this maniac...
...this professional killer, or whatever the Gorilla is.
But this note is exactly like the one that was in the newspapers.
After he murdered that widow.
Still, I can't bring myself to believe it.
Of course, you've notified the police?
No, I haven't.
- But, surely, if there was anything in all this...
- I'm taking other precautions.
Peters and I are armed, and in addition, I've engaged the services of a private detective agency.
Their operative should be here any moment now.
Well, obviously, this Gorilla is no ordinary murderer at all.
And judging by his past, shall we say, successes...
It is apparent the workings of the police were a load of bullock to him.
Of course there's a slim chance that, by not notifying the police, we might upset his plans.
Ordinarily, I'm not easily frightened, but...
I must admit this whole affair's giving me the creeps.
Well, it's nearly nine o'clock.
Now suppose you freshen up a bit.
We'll talk it over after dinner.
Oh, Kitty, show Denby to the green room, and Mr. Marsden to my room.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry, Uncle Walter.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Stevens.
- Yes, Kitty?
- Oh, I know it's customary to give notice...
Why, Kitty, you're not trying to tell me you're going to leave me?
Oh, no, sir. I'm trying to tell you I have left you.
But, Kitty, you're perfectly safe here!
Besides, we have guests. You haven't the heart to leave me now!
Well, my heart is willing, but I'm gonna have an awful time trying to convince the rest of my body.
I'll bet there's a dead body in every room.
Dead body won't hurt you.
Can't do you any good.
Well? What are we waiting for?
Let's go.
- Who did it?
- You!
- Who's with it tonight, chief?
- Make a note, then.
Keep doing it every once in a while.
It keeps me on edge and thinking.
Right.
Now what do you suppose they want detectives for?
I've got an idea. Let's go in and find out.
You're terrific.
By George, it's Peters!
- Who are you?
- Me?
- Why, I'm Peters, sir.
- Nevermind that, nevermind that. What's your name?
- Peters, sir.
- Just a minute, just a minute.
Where were you last night?
- I beg your pardon!
- Oh, so you did do something.
- I don't like your looks.
- What's that got to do with it? This is no beauty contest.
- Who's Stevens?
- I am.
- I'm Harrigan.
- I'm Mulligan.
I'm Garrity.
Harrigan? Mulligan? Garrity?
I sent for you because I need protection.
- My life's been threatened.
- Now, tell me. Any clues?
One very vital one.
This warning from the Gorilla.
That's weird. You got nothing to worry about.
- Mark that down, Garrity.
- Right. How do you spell Gorilla? Two R's or two L's?
Gorilla? Gorilla...
G- O-R... G! G?
G- O... Oh!
Gori...?
Did you... did you...?
Did you say Gorilla?
Why, gentlemen, you're not afraid?
- Oh, no. No.
- No, we're not afraid. We just thought maybe we...
- Thank you.
- The Gorilla coming here?
- It was nice to have met you, Mr. Stevens.
- Quiet!
Quiet!
Ah, yes.
I've already taken the precaution of arming my servant and myself.
And I think you'll find every door and window securely bolted.
I couldn't've done better myself.
With that sort of job, Mr. Stevens, you've got nothing to worry about.
- What's your plan, Mr. Harrigan?
- Well, first we'll take a look around the house.
Come on, men.
Now, you just sit tight, Mr. Stevens.
The Gorilla will get you over our dead bodies.
- Jack?
- Yes, darling?
- Who were those men?
- Probably the detectives your uncle hired.
Jack, I'm terribly worried. What are we going to do?
Well, it seems there isn't anything we can do yet.
Listen, darling. It isn't that I'm trying to appear skeptical. It's just that, well...
Somehow I can't make myself believe all this.
But that note! You saw the note.
Of course I did. But, still, I...
Look, darling. We'll wait.
We'll wait and see if something really does happen.
But what if it does?
I just don't believe it will.
Jack!
Excuse me, sir. I try to put your car away.
But unfortunately, there's something wrong with it.
What do you mean?
It won't start.
Excuse me, sir.
He gives me the creeps.
He doesn't exactly give me an appetite either.
But I wouldn't let him worry you if I were you.
Honestly, darling, don't you think there's any cause for alarm?
I'm afraid I don't.
Oh, there you are. Have a sherry before dinner?
Thank you, no.
Uncle Walter, how long have you had that butler?
Not very long. Why?
Well, are you sure he's alright?
I've found him so. Why?
Well, because I...
Dinner is served, sir.
Oh. Shall we go in?
You'd better drink a little of that, Kitty.
It'll quiet your nerves.
Why? Can you hear them?
Oh, here, take it.
What my nerves really need is a good, long trip!
Here!
Now, look here, where were you last night?
- Me? Why, I...
- Answer yes or no!
- I was...
- What were you doing there?
- Doing where?
- Well, how do we know?
Besides, I don't like your looks.
Did you ever take a good look at yourself?
- Yeah!
- Yeah, did you ever take a look...?
Here, now wait a minute, you. Where were you last night?
I spent the night with Shakespeare.
Yeah? Where is he?
He's dead.
Dead!
A murder mystery!
Have any idea who did it?
Look, Shakespeare's been dead hundreds of years!
Hundreds of...? This is a fine time to call us in on the case.
Say, but she couldn't've done it.
- How do you know?
- She can't be hundreds of years old.
That's write. Mark that down, Garrity.
Yeah, what do we do now, chief?
Well, you two have a look out there. I'll look here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What's this?
That's a door.
It leads to the back stairs.
Back stairs?
Well, remind me to have a look up there sometime.
That's an ironing board.
Yes.
It's an ironing board.
- Look, do you want this thing?
- Certainly we want it. Why do you think we iron on it?
Well, I...
Well, here, take it!
Garrity! Garrity! Garrity!
Come in here! We found it!
- You found what?
- The mystery.
- Well, that's hash.
- Ain't that a mystery?
- Some very good turkey, chief.
- I'll be the judge o' that.
I'm afraid, gentlemen, you won't find the Gorilla in there.
Why will we not find the Gorilla in there?
Now, listen you! I've had...!
Let that be a lesson to you.
Perhaps you gentlemen had better look outside for clues.
Maybe he killed Shakespeare.
Mark that down, Garrity.
Yeah.
Look, how do you get out of here?
That's what I'd like to know.
- Where's the back door?
- In back of you.
In back of me?
Don't you recall that the paper said the Gorilla always sends a warning to as many as half a dozen people at the same time?
To sorta throw the police off.
Maybe that's what he's doing now.
Perhaps it's just a ruse.
Well, let's hope so.
You know, it's wonderful how much more optimistic a good dinner can make one feel.
Shall we have licueurs in the study?
- Walter!
- Peters, Peters, a light, quickly!
Jack!
What is it? What happened?
Oh, uncle, are you hurt?
Why, no. No.
I don't know what happened.
- Look here.
- It seems to have been thrown in, through that window.
Oh, Uncle Walter!
What are we going to do?
The first thing you're going to do, or rather Jack is going to do...
Is to take you away from here.
But you're coming with us.
It's him! It's him!
Uncle Walter!
Who is it?
Oh! It's alright. It's one of those detectives.
He did give me a turn!
Did you see that face?
I bet when he gets drunk, snakes see him.
What's the matter with you, scaring us half to death?
I'm just trying to let you know I'm not the Gorilla!
This is my niece, Ms. Denby, and her fiancée, Mr. Marsden.
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.
This seems to be a bit more serious than I thought.
I just received this from the Gorilla.
A note. Who brought it?
No one brought it. It was thrown in through that window.
Through that window? Ha, through that window!
- He's right!
- Wait a minute.
This is my good ear.
Oh, say, that's right! You can't kid us!
We were outside patrolling the grounds!
What do you mean?
Why, the note couldn't have come through that window.
- Why not?
- Well, I'll just show you. Stand back, ma'am.
- That's why.
- But it was wrapped around a stone.
It was... a stone?
Well, why didn't you say so?
Anyway, what do you know about this thing?
Well, I don't know anything about it. We were preparing to leave the room...
...and suddenly the lights went out and...
...then there was a crash and...
So the lights went out, eh?
- Make a note o' that, Garrity.
- Fine.
You were outside a few minutes ago. Didn't you see anybody?
Nobody but us. Say, this note says at midnight.
- At midnight?
- Yeah.
What time's it now?
- It's 10:30.
- I got 11:10.
I got 11:30.
It is exactly 11:45.
Remind me to put some hands on this watch.
- Yes. Well, make a note o' that, Garrity.
- Right.
Now, look. The Gorilla's after Stevens. We'll have to keep an eye on 'em. Everybody, into the study.
Come on, let's go.
Who said that if you give a criminal enough rope, he'll hang himself?
- You, chief!
- Oh, that's where I heard it before.
Come on.
Now that you're all here, I don't want anybody to move, understand?
Is it alright if I breathe?
Yes, but come right back.
- Quiet!
- Personally, I don't believe the Gorilla's coming here.
Neither do I.
Why not?
I'll give you three good reasons, pal.
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.
It ain't enough.
Now, look here!
- I don't wanna have no
... Now, wait a minute. I'll handle this.
- Yeah, but you always...
- Yeah, but you...
You've received the Gorilla's warning, Walter Stevens.
You've just five minutes to live.
Oh, Uncle Walter! Jack...
- Excuse me.
- Here, here, here. Now where you going?
- I'm getting out of here.
- There's no door there!
Well, that's alright. I'll make one.
Quiet, quiet everybody!
Did you hear that?
I wish I didn't.
He's up there, men!
- Where you going?
- I say, he's up there!
That's what I thought you said.
Quiet.
Alright, men. Follow me!
Stick 'em up! I got you covered!
- What happened? What was it?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
Hey! Did you just pass here?
Yes. Yes, of course. I brought the trunk down from the attic.
- A trunk?
- Yes.
Were we here?
I couldn't say.
Well, maybe we're not here now.
Maybe.
May...
It's two minutes of twelve. What about Uncle Walter?
Uncle Walter, yes... Uncle Walter, we've...
Just going in here... We'll...
Now, everybody!
Stay just where you are.
Mulligan, you watch those doors. Garrity, you watch that one.
Mr. Stevens, you've... got nothing to worry about.
I wish I thought so.
Me, too.
You have one more minute, Walter Stevens.
I can't stand it any longer! I can't!
You've got to call the police! You've got to!
Mr. Stevens, I'm sorry, but Norma's right.
I don't know what this is all about, but certainly if there's something to it, the police oughtta know about it.
I no longer know what to think.
Perhaps you'd better.
Hello? Hello?
The phone, there's something wrong with it!
Mulligan, Garrity, it's me!
Uncle Walter! He's gone!
Gone? How can he be gone when every door and window in this room has been locked?
Mulligan, check those windows! Garrity, check that door!
How did you get in here?
Why, through this door, sir.
How can you when the doors are locked?
- I beg your pardon, it was not locked.
- I locked it myself.
- It is locked.
- That leaves us deadlocked.
It would be impossible for me to walk through the woodwork.
Why? Termites do.
Oh, this isn't getting us anywhere!
Now, leave everything to me!
Gorilla ain't gonna make a monkey out of me.
Now, you...
Come on, boys.
- Where do these stairs lead to?
- To the bedroom.
Mulligan, Garrity, you have a look upstairs.
Marsden, you come with me and we'll have a look around the grounds.
You two to the servants' wing.
With the Gorilla prowling around? Not me!
Well, alright, then, come with me!
Oh, nevermind. I'll take my chances with the other Gorilla.
But, wait a minute. We can't leave Ms. Denby here alone.
- Well, what are you waiting for?
- I don't know, but I wish I could think of something.
- Me, too.
- Oh, go on!
- Don't worry, darling.
- Oh, that's alright. I'll do all the worrying.
Marsden, come with me.
Oh, you first, sir.
Thank you very much.
Why couldn't this've all happened tomorrow?
What difference would that make?
Tomorrow's my day off.
Poor Uncle Walter.
Right from under our very eyes!
I don't understand how he got out of here.
All that's worrying me is how I'm gonna get outta here.
Oh, it's him, it's him!
I seen 'em! I seen 'em! It's the Gorilla! I seen 'em!
- What's up?
- It's the Gorilla! I tell you! He's in the closet there!
Oh, Jack, I'm so frightened!
- Come outta there, you.
- Get 'em, Mulligan.
- You heard him, Garrity.
- What did he say?
Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?
Not unless a hallucination has hair on it.
Come on.
- Now, ready?
- Yeah, yeah.
Is he dead?
- Who's he?
- I've never seen him before.
- Do you know him?
- No, sir. And this is no time for no introductions.
He's not dead.
- Mark that down, too.
- Right.
Come on, darling. We're getting out of here.
I'm afraid now, too. For you!
And I'm afraid now, too, for me!
Oh, Jack, it's horrible.
I don't know what to make of it.
All I can say is the Gorilla's around here somewhere!
And I know Mr. Stevens is around here somewhere!
And if you all look, we'll find 'em somewhere!
- Where you going?
- Somewhere!
Alright, men. Take 'em upstairs.
- Come on, Garrity.
- You! Lead the way.
I'll take care of 'em. Kitty, get a basin of hot water.
Do you mind if I go outta town to get it?
You and I have a look around the house.
Wait a minute. There's something funny about this.
Kitty said she saw the Gorilla's arm.
We open the closet and find the sailor's body.
Now, how did the body get in there?
And how'd the Gorilla get out without our seeing him?
That's just what I was about to ask you.
Stevens was sitting right here in this chair until the lights went out.
Gorilla? Night-night!
That's funny.
What's funny?
Nothing. I think I'll have a look around this house.
Have a look around the house?
Yes... and have a look around the house.
Yes. I'll go, too.
Hey, that guy won't talk.
- Why not?
- He's still unconscious.
You're unconscious and you talk.
- Hey, that's great, chief.
- Mark that down, Garrity.
- Right.
- What do we do now?
Well, first we'll have to reenact the crime.
So how do we do that?
Now, let's see. When the lights went out,
Stevens was sitting in that chair.
You're Stevens. Sit down.
- I'm Stevens.
- Mulligan, close the doors.
Hey! I'm Garrity!
You're Stevens! Now sit down!
I'll work the lights.
One, two, three.
Ah, it's no use.
I don't know. It works for Sherlock Holmes.
I don't know why it won't work for me!
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
- He's gone.
- He's gone?
Gone... Garrity!
Garrity!
Now we have two mysteries to solve.
- Look, I've got an idea.
- What is it?
If we can find out how Garrity disappeared, we'll find out what happened to Stevens.
That's a very good idea.
Shoulda thought o' that myself.
Alright, we'll reenact the crime. Sit down.
- But I'm not tired.
- Do you have to be tired to sit down?
I do.
You make me tired!
Well, then, why don't you sit down?
If I sit down, who's gonna work the lights?
- I never thought o' that.
- Yeah, well, sit down.
- Yeah, sit down.
- Sit down...
One... two... three!
Mulligan!
Mulligan!
Did you lose something?
Yes, Mulligan and Garrity!
Go over there.
Now, look. Sit down.
Oh, I don't wanna sit down.
You don't have to want to! You'll sit down and like it!
Oh, alright. I'll sit down but I won't like it.
What're you gonna do?
What I'm gonna do ain't important.
Well, what am I gonna do?
That's just what I wanna find out.
One...
Two...
Two and a... two.
Two...
Two...
Three!
Did I hear somebody scream?
Well, if you didn't, you ought to have your ears cleaned out!
Say, where's Mr. Harrigan?
The detective! He's disappeared!
Disappeared? What a pity.
Pity? Why, it's entirely...
How did you get in here?
We... Why, you're...
Don't be frightened. You're safe with me.
Safe with you, I?
Who wants to be safe?
Now, look. I'm very sociable.
I wanna go where there's people!
Hey, what's the matter? What's happened?
Look, I'm standing here, and all of a sudden...
Everything goes black.
Next thing I know, I'm here.
That's funny.
Hello?
Hello, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
No, no. You turn on Willow Drive.
Off Highway 22, and hurry, will you?
Thank you.
Look, it ain't human, I tell you.
It ain't human!
What isn't human?
For a guy to be standing here one minute...
...and the next minute, he's gone!
- Who's gone?
- I'm gone, they're gone, everybody's gone!
It don't make sense.
Certainly doesn't. Will you have a cigarette?
I don't mind if I do.
He takes us right from under his very eyes.
Who does?
The Gorilla!
Hey! Who are you?
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
Listen, man. You got me all wrong. I just came in to use the telephone. You see, my car broke down and...
This phone?
Look, that phone is out of order.
- Is it?
- Yes.
Number, please?
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.
Now, wait a minute, you!
You're the guy we're looking for!
- You're the Gorilla!
- Surely you don't think I'm the Gorilla!
I stopped thinking two hours ago.
- But you don't understand!
- I don't have to understand!
- Shall I try?
- No, you've tried enough, not get 'em up!
Listen, you're making a big mistake.
Well, it won't be the first time.
No... alright...
Alright, I got you covered.
Help!
Shake 'em up... shake 'em up.
Help!
Help!
Oh, help.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
What's the matter? What is it?
I got 'em, I got 'em. I tell you, I got 'em!
- Got 'em, where?
- Yes, he... Well, I did have 'em.
Here, get me outta these.
Keys are in my pocket.
They're right there.
Oh, it was terrible. The Gorilla, the Gorilla!
How'd you get all tied up like this?
The Gorilla, I tell you. It wasn't my fault.
He came in and hit me.
It was... Did I leave him in there?
I'm Stevens...
Wait a minute! How'd you fellows get in there?
You tell me. What're you doing with those things on?
Oh, look. A fellow walks right in.
It was the Gorilla, I tell you!
- Yeah?
- And starts to use that phone!
But he didn't get very far, not with me on the job.
Lucky thing for him you had your handcuffs with you.
Where is he? Where'd he go?
See, I'm the victim. How should I know?
Look, boys, I'm telling you, he walked in, six of 'em. Six big gorillas, they attacked me...
Hit me right on my crown. Look at that lump.
Yeah, look at this lump.
Right there.
These windows are locked.
From the inside.
You're not kidding.
Kidding? With the Gorilla right under my nose and a ten thousand dollar reward, he says I'm kidding!
Well, are you?
Who belongs to this?
What is it?
- Coat.
- Why, gorillas don't wear coats.
Sure, they do. Fur coats.
There's something screwy about all this.
Look, if there's anything screwy about this...
...it's me.
It's me!
But I'll soon find out. Each of you grab a wall.
What do we do with it?
Mulligan, you take that one.
Marsden, you take that one.
- I'll take that one.
- I'll sit this one out.
You won't sit anyone out! Grab it!
Now, take it easy.
Alright, now tap, each one of you.
See if you can find some trap doors.
Oh, must be out there. Come on, men, right out here.
Alright, cover the door, men.
What's the matter with all of you? I've been pounding on that door for the last ten minutes!
- Who are you?
- That's right. Who are you?
Nevermind who I am. I wanna know where Walter Stevens is.
Oh, you want to know where Mr. Stevens is, eh?
He wants to know where Walter Stevens is!
Who do you think we're looking for?
I didn't come here to play games.
I wanna see Walter Stevens and I wanna see 'em right now!
You don't understand. These gentlemen are detectives.
Detectives, bah! What are you trying to pull on me?
I talked to Stevens on the telephone last night.
He told me he had a plan to pay his debt.
- Plan?
- Yes, said he'd only just started working on it.
Well, did he tell you what this plan is?
I wasn't interested.
He wants to square up with me here tonight!
When I talked to him, he wanted a couple of days more to raise the money that he owes me!
Now where is he?
Well, Mr. Stevens' been kidnapped by the Gorilla!
Kidnapped by... Poppycock!
Now, look here! I don't know who any of you are!
But I do know this. Walter Stevens owes me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars!
And I'm going to collect it! Tonight! Or else!
- Now, wait a minute.
- Don't, buddy.
How do we know you're... Say, who are you, anyway?
I'm one of Stevens' clients.
I have proof that Stevens has been stealing from his clients' accounts for over a year.
I gave him until tonight to return my money.
And I'm not going to leave this house until I get it.
Yeah, but wait a minute, wait a minute...
I think he's mad.
Jack! If what that man says is true...
- I don't believe Uncle Walter could...
- It's almost impossible to know what to believe, darling.
Yet things are adding up. If your uncle did have a plan, if this business of sending for you was part of the plan...
Take her upstairs and keep an eye on her. This has gone far enough!
- It's gone too far!
- It's even gone farther than that.
I'll be alright. It's just too much excitement for one night.
Get your hat and coat, darling. I'm gonna see that you get to town if I have to push the car all the way myself.
I can't go til we find Uncle Walter.
We'll take care o' that. We'll break this case, won't we, boys?
- Won't we?
- Oh, sure we will! Sure!
Like it was walnuts.
- You know, I feel sorry for that poor girl.
- Yeah? What about poor us?
Strange men zooming in an out. Animals running around like this was a zoo!
Crazy goes on! I wanna go home.
Oh, so you wanna go home? I'm ashamed of you.
I'm ashamed of you!
You wanna take a run off and leave that girl here to take the blame alone?
- We're detectives, aren't we?
- Are we?
Haven't we looked all over this house?
- Yes.
- No.
- Where haven't we looked?
- Well, if there's a cellar, we haven't looked there.
- I'm glad I thought o' that.
- Say, this looks like a cellar.
Where?
- It's locked.
- Well, try your key.
Oh, yes, never thought o' that.
Alright, come on, men.
- Anybody down there?
- Uh, yes. We are.
- Now, look for a switch.
- It's around here somewhere.
Alright, come on outta there, you.
Come on. Get outta there.
Alright, come on...
Alright, come on outta there!
Mulligan?
- Where are you?
- I'm right here, chief.
Garrity, where are you?
Over here, chief.
Is anybody with me?
No, you're alone.
Mulligan, Harrigan! Something bit me!
What? First time I saw a mousetrap catch a piece o' cheese.
Harrigan! Garrity! Please get me outta this!
Get me outta this thing!
- Maybe you'd like a ride.
- Oh, come on, Garrity...
Garrity! Harrigan!
Garrity! Harrigan!
Now, don't worry. I'll handle this.
- It's a pleasure.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.
Okay, buddy. Come on, bud. Get that raccoon coat off.
Come on! Get that thing off!
Want me to hit you over the head with this thing?
Well...
We've been double-crossed!
Let's get outta here!
- Peters?
- Yes, sir?
What's all that commotion?
Sounds like our friends, the detectives.
You stay here with Ms. Denby.
I'll go see what's up.
Cognac, Ms. Denby?
No. No, thank you.
What's the matter? What's all the racket?
I got him, I tell you! I got him!
You got him? Got who?
- Yes, the Gorilla! He's in there!
- He's in there!
- I can hear him breathe!
- That's you.
Well, open it, open it!
Have you men been drinking?
No, but it's a good idea.
What was that?
- Norma, what's happening?
- It's the Gorilla!
Norma, where are you?
Jack!
A couple o' you get after 'em, quick!
- You heard 'em, Mulligan.
- So did you.
Nevermind, then. You take the hall. I'll go this way.
I'll stay here.
- Is something wrong?
- Where were you?
- I just went to get some tea, sir.
- Didn't I tell you to stay here with Ms. Denby?
I'm very sorry, sir. But I thought that perhaps a little tea...
What right have you got to think? We're not even thinking!
Ms. Denby might've been killed.
It's fortunate she wasn't, sir.
Why is it that something always happens when you're not here?
An unfortunate coincidence, sir.
- What did you find?
- An empty closet with Harrigan in it.
- Harrigan, Harrigan, Harrigan! Wake up.
- Get up.
- Wake up.
- The Gorilla, the Gorilla!
Did you get him? Did you get him?
- No, he got you.
- Well, it won't happen again.
- Okay, men. Follow me.
- Okay.
Follow me.
Go down and see where these stairs lead to.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
- Oh, me!
- It's awful dark. I shoulda brung my glasses.
- You never wore any glasses.
- That's right. I forgot.
- What's that funny tapping?
- Yeah!
It's my knees.
It's a fine time to be scared!
- You try and think of a better time.
- Yeah, well...
Look, look.
I've had about enough o' this!
Me and the Gorilla's gonna have a showdown right now!
- That's right, chief.
- I'm telling you I can't stand it!
Now, don't argue with me!
I know what I'm talking about!
I'm going in there, and we'll look over this house.
And he'll take orders from me, understand?
I'm gonna tear this house apart!
Tear it limb from limb!
Now, come on, follow me!
I'll show this monk who's a monk!
You fellows stay close behind me.
If anything happens, leave it to me.
I'll do all the talking.
Come on, men.
People here running here to there all day.
All day long. I've never seen anything like this in all my life.
First... Hey, where are you going?
What's eating you?
What've you got there?
That dame musta saw something or she wouldn't be running away like that.
Make a note o' that, Garrity.
Garrity! Mulligan!
- Good evening.
- Good evening...
- What do you want?
- Don't be frightened.
Frightened? Who's frightened?
Don't you come near me! I'll wrap this thing around your neck like it was a pretzel!
- There's nothing to worry about.
- That's what you think.
- May I give you some advice?
- No!
If I were you, I'd go to my room and stay there.
Why, yes, sir. I was just planning on that!
Wait a minute. Where have you been?
No place. Honest, sir! I was just getting ready to go to town!
- Good.
- Don't open that!
- Why not?
- The Gorilla! He's in there!
Don't be silly.
- Get going now. Get going.
- Yes, sir. I'm practically there!
That ain't a man. It's a gorilla. We saw it and we felt it!
I tell you, the Gorilla is a man. I ought to know.
I've read enough about him.
But how could a monkey possibly have written those notes to Uncle Walter?
Maybe it's got an education.
Poe! Poe!
Poe! Where is he, have any o' you seen him?
- Who?
- Poe.
- Who's Poe?
- Poe's the gorilla.
- The Gorilla?
- Oh, you know 'em, too, eh?
Know 'em? I trained 'em since he was that high.
You're just the one we're looking for.
Don't any of you understand? Poe is a gorilla, a trained gorilla.
- A real gorilla?
- Sure, a real gorilla.
Well, so we don't know what we're talking about, eh?
Yeah, we know a monkey when we see one.
Listen, this is serious. Poe ain't no pet.
There's no telling what he's liable to do when I ain't around.
'Specially with women. He hates women.
Well, what's he doing here? What're you doing here?
We was hired to come here. We're working at the County Fair.
Yesterday, a guy comes along, says he wants me to bring Poe here.
He says he's giving a party, wants us to put on our act.
- Who hired you?
- I don't know. I don't know nothing.
All I know is I bring Poe here, we're waiting out in the garage like he tells me.
Waiting to do our stuff.
All of a sudden, somebody gives me a clunk over the head and I wake up in a lady's boudoir.
But the gorilla... how'd he get loose?
You're asking me! That's what I wanna find out.
Listen, this is serious. We gotta find 'em.
We gotta. Somebody's liable to get killed.
The note from the Gorilla!
Fall against your fifty they were addressed to me!
Notes? Poe can't write no notes!
Even I don't know how to write.
Now, look. The next time I buck up against that gorilla...
I'm telling you, I'll...
Well, I'll...
He'll never know!
He'll do it!
- Listen, have you seen 'em?
- Yes, he's in the kitchen.
- Which way is the kitchen?
- Through the panel.
We'll go with you.
Listen, you fellows better wait here. There's no telling what that ape'll do.
Oh, Jack, I'm so confused.
A real gorilla, and those notes, and...
Listen to me, everybody.
The Gorilla has done his work.
Walter Stevens is dead.
You will find his body in the garage.
Oh, Jack!
Alright, everybody. Follow me to the garage!
Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
He's gone! Poe's gone!
- I tell you, he's in the kitchen!
- The kitchen's a wreck. He must be on a rampage!
Outta my way, brother. I got my own troubles to worry about.
Alright, all of you! Out in the garage! Come on!
I'll stay here and protect Ms. Denby.
This way, please.
I'll never forgive myself for not calling the police.
Why call the police with us around, lady?
You couldn't save Uncle Walter.
We couldn't, eh?
- Well, you didn't, did you?
- Well, we...
That's right, we didn't.
I gotta find out how that gorilla gets in and outta here.
There must be a secret spring around here someplace.
I think I'll look in back o' these books.
Help!
Help!
Somebody! Get me outta here somebody!
Don't tell me she's the Gorilla!
I told you I didn't like her looks.
- Oh, wise guy!
- Come on, we gotta find the body.
- What'd I do with them keys?
- Look under the mat.
- That's funny!
- Oh, very funny. Will you get me out of here?
Listen, what're you doing in Poe's cage?
What do you think I'm doing, waiting for somebody to feed me peanuts?
Get me outta here!
Don't you know Poe hates women?
So does Kipling. So what? Will you please get me out of here?
Alright, don't get excited.
Say, wait a minute. I think this was a trick to get us outta the house.
Come on.
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm the gorilla's keeper!
- Are you the one that gave me the clunk on the head?
- No, but it was a good idea.
Oh, yeah?
Look!
- He's got her!
- Don't talk! He'll drop her!
Poe! Bring her down, Poe!
Bring her down to me!
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!
Put her down, Poe!
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!
Poe! Stop it, Poe!
Bring her down, Poe!
Bring her down to me!
Put her down, Poe.
Come on.
Poe, Poe, come back here! Help me catch him!
Oh, thank you, thank you.
He hit me again!
Right here, he hit...
Poe! Let him alone!
That's a fine way to treat me.
After I give you the best years of my life.
You act like that... Listen here.
No, no. No kisses.
He might have killed somebody!
What do you mean, might have?
That's alright, lady. I got him.
You can keep him!
Okay. Scram, but take this character with you.
I was only kidding.
Just for that, he gets no c-a-n-d-y.
Oh, well, that's just c-a-n-d-y.
Sorry if I caused you any trouble, folks.
Yeah, and just for that, I won't read you the funny papers tonight.
Put you in bed without any supper, you bad boy.
You wait'll I get you home!
You have heard the last of this!
Come on!
Look at that.
Why, it's somebody's coat!
Alright, come on outta there, buddy.
So that's how I got clunked on the head.
Come on, come on outta there, you!
Look! It's opening!
Come on, come on...
Oh, so it's you!
- Do you know him?
- Do I know him? He's the guy I caught using the telephone!
- There's no law against that.
- Nevermind law, buddy. Get 'em up.
Now, just a minute. Don't you think you're a little premature?
Prema... Well, I can't remember that far back.
Just who are you?
I'm Detective Kletty.
An investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And I'm on the trail of the Gorilla, just as you are.
- A detective?
- How do we know that?
Yes, we...
Yeah, well, what were you doing in there?
Investigating. I've been on this case for some weeks now.
And I've discovered a little about the construction of this house...
...that my good friend here don't seem to have found out yet.
What do you mean?
This house is a maze of secret panels.
Now, undoubtedly, the voice of the Gorilla came through that radio from someplace right in this house.
That means that if we find the wire leading away from the radio...
We'd at least find the Gorilla's hideout!
And what's going on here!
Well, here it is. Here's the wire going right in here.
It's found.
Now, let's see...
Just as I thought!
Here's the wire!
Now, by tracing this, I think we may find the answer to this entire riddle.
The wire goes in here.
Back of this wall is the man we want.
Now, make a note o' that, Garr...
- Are you all armed?
- Yes, I'm armed.
Quiet, you!
Here it is.
There's your microphone, and as I expected, there's your Gorilla.
Mr. Stevens, the Gorilla?
Why, sure, I could have told you that all the time!
I guess the party's over, my Gorilla friend.
Yeah, but who tied 'em up like that?
I don't know. He figured the game was up and that this would throw off suspicion.
This is a homemade job. A child could've done it.
Ah, proposterous! Don't believe him!
I never saw this man before in my life! He's insane!
Now, what's that?
Why is it, with all the men in the house, they have to leave us here with you?
Quiet!
Why, it's Mr. Stevens!
- Alias, the Gorilla.
- The Gorilla?
Him?
Oh, I'll never trust another man if I live to be a thousand!
You can make that two thousand.
Uncle Walter, the Gorilla?
I don't believe it!
I think I can make it very clear.
- Oh, sure we can!
- Now, first of all...
- What's that?
- I didn't hear a thing!
Neither did I, but what was it?
We'll soon find out.
Hey, what is this?
Who hit me?
What's going on around here?
- It's that man again.
- Oh, there you are!
Kidnapped! Kidnapped by the Gorilla!
- Not kidnapped by the Gorilla, Mister...
- Conway. A.P. Conway.
Ah, the A.P. stands for ape!
Mr. Conway, this gentleman is the Gorilla!
- The Gorilla?
- But if Uncle Walter's the Gorilla...
...I don't understand why he should send himself those notes of warning.
For two reasons!
To keep you here and to throw off suspicion from himself.
Ms. Denby, under the terms of your father's will, if anything were to happen to you...
...who would inherit your estate?
Uncle Walter.
My hunch was right.
Your uncle brought you here tonight to kill you for your money.
Well, at least he had a reason!
So that's why he wouldn't let us call the police.
That's exactly why.
But what about these men, these private detectives?
They almost speak for themselves.
Do you think if Stevens life had actually been threatened...
...he would've called in three morons such as these for protection?
- Protection...
- Morons!
Hey! Wait a minute, I resent that!
But I tell you, I saw the Gorilla! Right there in that closet!
I saw his hand, then his arm...
And it was no optical confusion!
What you saw was this sleeve!
Another ingenious little invention of Mr. Stevens.
A very cute little idea!
Well, that about clears the whole matter up.
And since it's stopped raining, I think I better go.
- You're okay, buddy!
- You're okay!
Congratulations! Let me congratulate you! You were wonderful!
Oh, no you don't, buddy! Okay, folks.
Say howdy to the Gorilla!
- Howdy.
- Alright, give out or this moron is gonna blow your brains out.
Well, you see...
Now, all of you stick your hands up.
I'm the Gorilla, alright.
But the cops haven't been able to get me, so don't you halfwits get any crazy notions.
And as for Mr. Stevens, he's just as crooked as I told you he was.
The trouble with him is he talks too much and too loud.
I got tipped off on what was gonna happen here tonight.
How he was gonna pretend to be me!
How he was gonna get the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and at the same time...
...let him get the blame for all the Gorilla murders.
We were careful.
I'm a little nervous tonight.
Drop that gun. And I advise you not to move.
Hello? Police station, quickly.
What is this? I thought the phone was out of order!
- Maybe he paid his bill.
- Hello?
This is Walter Stevens speaking.
Send a squad car to my house.
We've got the Gorilla.
Things are so mixed-up around here that even the Gorilla doesn't know who the Gorilla is!
He's the Gorilla, he's the Gorilla.
Do I know what I'm doing?
Look, what's going on here?
Don't look so sad, darling. Your uncle isn't a crook!
The estate's all safe and sound now.
You know, you never can tell. This is liable to wind up to be a mystery!
You see, the Gorilla murders were threatening to bankrupt our insurance company.
Most of the victims were clients of ours.
So Conway, our special investigator, cooked up his little scheme to trap the killer.
I'm sorry I had to frighten you, dear.
- And you, too, Kitty.
- Oh, I wasn't frightened. I was numb.
You fellows are certainly great detectives.
- Oh, yes.
- We could have told you that!
Did you know that Kletty was the Gorilla all along?
- Sure we did!
- No, we didn't.
When did you find out he was the Gorilla?
When I shook hands with him.
- I don't get you.
- Well, you see, I was a window trimmer.
In a department store.
And I oughtta know a phony feel when I feel one.
We'll never be able to thank you, Mr. Harrigan.
Oh, well, that's alright. I understand you two are getting married soon.
Well, if you call tomorrow soon...
Well, remember, if you have any trouble with her, our specialty is following wives!
You know where to send the check.
And be sure it's certified.
From a detective's bank.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, that's the cocktail bar, huh? What's in there?
It's a private dining room.
From now on, it's the gambling room.
- Make a note of that, Charlie.
- Right.
Take him out for a walk.
It's too stuffy in here.
That, it's crummy. Change it.
But, Mr. Vanning, it's French.
I had it specially designed.
It's still crummy. None of the classy spots use that kind of stuff anymore.
I want the kind that sticks up in the ceiling.
- Indirect lighting.
- That's what I want.
- Hello, Gabby. Still around?
- Yeah.
Emmy Lou is the name, Mr. Vanning.
All right, now. This is it.
I'm taking over this joint.
From now on, you're working for me, understand?
Most of you have been around long enough to know how I operate.
If you don't, read the papers and find out.
Up to now, this night club racket's been run on a penny-ante basis.
That's out.
From now on, I'm organizing it.
When I organize anything, I make it pay big money, or else.
Now, this town is full of big shots from the sticks.
They keep pouring in by the carload, looking for one thing:
The kind of time they can go home and brag about.
And torch songs with soft lights aren't going to satisfy them.
We know the action they want, and we are going to give it...
...from tiddlywinks to roulette.
But they're going to pay for it plenty, understand?
In other words, a clip joint.
Yeah, and run on a high-class basis.
Your job is to soften them up so they can be taken.
There's only one way to work on chumps: Our way.
With no holds barred.
High-class?
- You don't like it, huh?
- It all depends.
How much is there in it for us?
About 50 times what you're getting now. But you don't get it for nothing.
Every week, you're going to kick back part of what you make to me.
That goes for protection, hush money, lawyer's fee, bail bonds, anything else...
...to square the rap in case the law steps in.
That's one thing you won't have to worry about.
Anybody that sticks with me gets taken care of.
Maybe you like this setup, maybe you don't...
...but you're going to take it.
I got every nightclub in town...
...and every girl working in every nightclub, sewed up.
You're going to work the way I tell you, or you don't work at all.
You got that straight?
All right, the place will be closed until we get it fixed like I want it.
And cut a peephole in the door. The chumps go for that "hard to get in" angle.
Come on, let's get out of here.
- Wait till I get my pay.
- Hurry up. We'll be outside.
Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Kind of old ain't you?
I need young dames here, the kind men go for in a hurry.
- But I've been here a long time...
- That's the trouble.
You won't do. You're through.
You said you took care of people who were loyal to you.
- She never worked for me.
- But she has for Beler.
And she's always been on the level.
How do you know what she can do?
Why kick her out just because you're taking over?
Sure, she's okay, Vanning.
Why don't you give her a break and let her prove it?
- You know, she can't wreck the place.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mr. Vanning.
- Pretty smart girl, aren't you?
- I get along.
How about coming up to my place for a drink? I'd like to know you better.
- No, thanks.
- Why not?
Well, you've told me I was working for you. So I work for you.
That's as far as it goes.
Anyway, I'm sort of afraid of your social set.
- Afraid?
- Yes.
I might get to learn too much about you, like Audrey Fleming did.
Remember?
If I'd wanted to end up in the river...
...I'd have taken a jump off
Brooklyn Bridge five years ago.
- You're not afraid to talk anyway.
- We're among friends.
And I think we'll get along a lot better if we understand each other.
- I think I'll be a big help to your business.
- Maybe you will at that.
Good night.
- Smart girl.
- Maybe too smart.
- Thanks, Mary. You were swell.
- Forget it, Estelle.
- Good night, Mr. Vanning.
- Good night.
- What's her name?
- Emmy Lou.
Make a note of it.
Here you are, girls.
Wait a minute, let's walk. We'll need some fresh air after that one.
That sign, what's it mean?
- Well, come on. What does it mean?
- Intimate.
- What does that mean?
- You know, intimate.
Personal. Get together. Like this:
Oh, well, why don't it say what it means?
- Change it.
- To what?
- What was that you said?
- Intimate.
- Intimate. Make a note of it.
- Right.
Good morning.
I don't really look old, do I?
What does he expect a girl to look like at 6 in the morning...
...after dragging heavyweight salesmen around a dance floor?
Like a debutante?
If he saw me when I'd come to work and my makeup was fresh...
Oh, let's skip it, Estelle, and go to bed. We're all fagged out.
Well, let him fire me. What do I care?
I don't want any part of his clip joints anyway.
And if you do, you're crazy.
He might as well put a gun in our hands and send us out on stickups.
Well, what are you going to do?
You heard what he said.
It's Vanning or nothing.
Well, this isn't the only way to make a living.
- Do you know a better one?
- Well, I can always go back into vaudeville.
Oh, stop kidding yourself,
Estelle. Your dancing days are over.
You'd need counterweights to keep your arches from falling.
Well, then I'll get a job in a factory, behind a counter, anyplace.
- At 12 and a half a week?
- That's enough for me.
For cigarettes.
We've all tried this 12 and a half a week stuff. It's no good.
Living in furnished rooms, walking to work.
Going hungry a couple of days a week...
...so you can have some clothes to put on your back.
I've had enough of that for the rest of my life.
And so have you.
Well, of course she has.
She's just burned up because
Johnny said she was getting old.
Aren't you, honey?
You're a sweet little hyena, aren't you?
Well, it's true, isn't it?
You know, working for Vanning isn't gonna be any bed of roses.
- And you don't have to rub it in.
- You're gonna work for him.
But I'm not getting into his trap.
And I'm not taking any chances of getting a slap in the face with a spade either.
You know, we're letting ourselves in for enough as it is.
Some will wind up in the short end, but not me, baby.
I know all the angles, and I think I'm smart enough to keep one step ahead of them...
...till I get enough to pack it all in and live on easy street the rest of my life.
- I know how to beat this racket.
- Yeah? How?
That's what I've been trying to find out for years.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hey.
- Oh, look at that.
- Keep the change.
This way, please. Where are they from?
Picked them up at Waldorf-Ritz, metal industries banquet.
It's locked. Hey, captain, commodore, come on.
Just a second, gentlemen.
From the Waldorf-Ritz.
McGrew sent them.
Say, are we having fun?
- Good evening.
- How do you do?
- How many?
- Four, please.
Right this way, please.
Are there going to be any more in your party?
I don't know.
Are there?
Carrie.
Florrie, sit here.
- Sit right down, honey.
- Oh, no, no. I saw her first.
All right, I've got my gal right here.
Gabby, go to work on them.
Well, how do you want it, honey?
Soft and smooth, or loud and hard?
Soft and smooth. Only don't put them to sleep just yet.
What is your party drinking?
- Why, what have you been drinking?
- Oh, champagne.
Fine. We don't wanna change your diet.
- Champagne for everybody.
- Everybody, champagne. Gallons of it.
Are you in the mood for music?
- I'll say I am, baby.
- All right. Hey, Gus.
- They're all set.
- Who ordered?
The young fellow with Mary. Champagne.
- Well, tell Mary the dice table for him.
- Okay.
Come on. Come on over here and sit up here, baby.
Here's how.
Thanks, sugar.
Snake eyes.
- Well, honey, I guess this isn't our night.
- Oh, keep on trying, you'll get hot.
Not with three pair of snake eyes in a row.
- How much am I in for?
- Eighteen hundred dollars.
- Is that all?
- Yes.
Would you mind taking my check? I don't like leaving myself without any cash.
- Glad to accommodate you.
- That's what I call service.
I believe you ordered for the party.
You might as well add this to it.
- That's a lot of party. Where are the others?
- They got a bit tight and left with the girls.
- Thanks.
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- Cab.
- Yes, sir.
Good night.
Need a cab?
Tail that cab.
- Boy, they sure took me to the cleaners.
- You had a good time, didn't you?
Never had a better time in my life.
I'd like to do it all over again.
- Well, I guess you can afford it.
- Afford it?
- What's so funny?
- You were thinking I can afford it.
Listen, sister, I don't make that much money in a year...
...let alone spend it.
You mean that you haven't got the money to pay off?
No, not a red cent. I was just putting on an act.
Boy, I'd like to see the look on their faces when they try to cash that check.
- Will that be funny.
- Yeah, like a funeral. Yours.
And that's what you're going to have if they don't get their money.
What are you talking about?
You're messing with the toughest gang in town. They'd cut your throat for a dime.
So you can imagine what they're going to do to you for that kind of money.
Say, are you kidding me?
Well, if you don't believe me, stick around and find out.
Well, what am I gonna do?
You got enough money to pay your hotel bill?
I paid that in advance.
Got my railroad ticket too.
Well, use it. Check out of that hotel...
...and grab the first train home before it's too late.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Remember what I told you.
- Oh, I will.
- Mary.
- Yeah?
Mary, I... I haven't even got enough to pay for the cab.
- Here.
- Thanks. I'll send it to you.
- What's your address.
- Forget it.
No, no, no. Please, write it down here.
All right.
Oh, gee, you're swell.
I don't know why. A sap like you deserves to be taken.
I guess you must bring out the mother instinct in me.
Now, go on, get in. Hurry.
- Good night, chump.
- Good night.
- Be careful.
- All right.
Take him to Waldorf-Ritz and step on it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hello, McGrew.
- Hiya.
Mind if we park here for a while?
Gotta keep an eye on one of those guys you sent till we can get his check through.
- How much did you take him for?
- Plenty.
Yes, sir, 319? Yes, sir. Right away.
He's checking out.
Pennsylvania Station.
What a night.
Oh, does it feel good to stand up and stretch.
Good morning.
- What's good about it?
- You all look as if you had hangovers.
No, stomachaches. I never ate so much chop suey in my life.
Me neither. One more dish and I'd have put my hair in a braid and opened a laundry.
Well, I like chop suey.
- You like anything.
- What happened?
Well, our boyfriends' idea of a swell evening...
...was to take us from one chop suey joint to another.
Did we have fun.
The only laugh I got was when the screwball I was with...
...tried to show off and darn near choked to death on a chopstick.
- How did you do, Mary?
- Oh, all right.
- Did they take that chump for much?
- Well, I... I don't know.
- Where did you go after you left the club?
- Home.
Gee, it must be swell to get some sleep.
And where did you disappear to last night that makes you so smug?
I spent a very charming evening with Mr. Vanning.
Emmy Lou.
- You're a fool.
- Don't kid yourself.
Girls, good morning.
Don't you believe in knocking twice?
- Don't you believe in paying once?
- No.
So we're even. How about it, girls?
According to my book, you owe me for enough dresses to start a new business.
Now, it's gonna come to a showdown.
Either you're gonna pay me or you ain't, one or the other.
Louie, I'm afraid it's gonna have to be the other.
Give us a break, will you, Louie?
You know us. We're good for it.
Listen, girls, if it was up to me, honest, I'd do it in a minute. Why not?
I like you, you like me.
But what am I gonna do?
That guy Vanning and his bunch are on my neck every minute of the day.
Collect, collect, collect.
- Vanning? What's he got to do with it?
- Everything. He's taken this over too.
Yeah, it's the truth.
All my life I've been in business for myself.
If I lost all the money I made, at least it was mine.
But now I don't even get that satisfaction.
Everything is his. Just like with you girls. Nice, huh?
You know, pretty soon that guy is gonna charge us for breathing.
- Listen, if you'll promise to pay a little...
- Yeah?
- I'll show you some new stuff I got.
I positively guarantee you that it was stolen from the best shop in town.
But you gotta promise.
- Sure.
- Oh, we promise.
- Sure.
- I'll bet we're gonna love it.
- Oh, it's heavy.
- I want the white one!
- Hey, take it easy, take it easy.
- You can't do that, that's mine.
Oh, look at this. Isn't this...?
Yes, sir.
Pick me up in about a half-hour?
- So long. Bye.
- So long.
- Emmy Lou, look.
- Isn't it adorable?
That's one of the most beautiful pieces of merchandise I ever seen.
- Come in.
- Come in.
- Betty.
- Hello, Mary.
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
Girls, this is my kid sister, Betty, that I've told you so much about.
How do you do?
- Oh, Betty, this is Louie, our designer.
- Designer?
Yes. You see, our store is giving a fashion show...
...and they sent him up with some models that we are to wear.
And, well, we were rehearsing.
That is, Emmy Lou was.
Weren't you, Emmy Lou?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
- You have to rehearse for a fashion show?
- Sure. Just like being an actress.
And you have to keep on rehearsing, don't you girls?
Sure, sure.
Louie, we'll see you back at the show room.
Show room?
So this is the sister you're always talking about, huh, Mary? Nice-looking girl.
Nice-looking coat too.
It looks like... Sure, I remember.
I sold it to you a year ago.
- I said goodbye, Louie.
- Yes, goodbye, Louie.
- What about the money?
- You can send us the check.
Send you a check? Are you crazy, or am I?
- Come on, Louie.
- Now, wait a minute.
Cut it out, will you? What is this?
Halloween. We're putting on a masquerade.
Can't you get it through your skull...
...that she doesn't want her sister to know what she's doing?
- I get it now.
- I thought you'd get it sooner or later.
Oh, come on, will you, quit kidding.
You've never seen so much excitement in your life.
For weeks the whole school has talked about nothing else but this football game.
See, the boys who we're playing come from college right near us.
We know most of them all, and...
And, you know...
- Sweet.
- Like sugar.
So we decided to come and see it.
It didn't cost much, Mary.
Besides, I was dying to see you.
Oh, I'm glad you came, darling.
Gee, it must be fun going to school.
Oh, it's not exciting, if that's what you mean.
Mostly going to classes and studying.
Of course, once in a while we have dances and parties, and that's about all.
I don't think you'd like it.
It sounds easier than standing on your feet all night...
- How long are you going to stay, Betty?
- Just for the day.
We're going to the game, then going right back.
You're coming with us, aren't you?
No. No, you go with your friends.
I... I think I'll just stay home and rest.
You're tired, aren't you?
You all look so tired.
You must work awfully hard in that dress shop.
Oh, no, no. It just happened that this week was a very busy week.
Yeah, sugar. They practically rushed us right off our feet.
I wish there was something I could do, Mary.
- You keep right on going to school.
- I know.
But it sort of makes me feel so helpless.
I go to school and a have good time...
...and you have to work so awfully hard to keep me there.
I'll pay you back for it someday, Mary.
You'll pay me back every time I look at you.
That must be my friends. I'll answer it.
- Which one of you is Mary Dwight?
- I am.
Know a fella named Ralph Krawford?
Ralph Krawford?
Yes, I was out with him last night.
Did you ever see this before?
Sure. Sure, I gave it to him.
- What about it?
- Nothing.
Only it was in his pocket when we found him. Murdered.
- Murdered?
- We found him in an alley this morning.
What's that got to do with me?
You'll find out when we get down to headquarters. Get dressed.
No, I don't want to go. Tell me what I'm being arrested for.
Well, if you must know, sister, we're holding you on suspicion of murder.
The rest of you get your clothes on.
Well, you don't think it took all of us to kill him.
You'll get a chance to answer that. Get going.
And these four men approached you and asked you to recommend a nightclub?
Yes, sir.
- Why did you send them to Club Intimate?
- No particular reason.
It was just the first place that popped into my head.
Because you were paid so much a head by
Vanning for steering suckers in there?
Vanning? Who's Vanning?
Never heard of him.
Never heard of two years in jail for perjury either?
I make a living out of tips.
If a guest in the hotel asks me a question, it's part of my job to answer it.
What he does and where he goes after that is none of my business.
That's all. Thanks.
Well, I guess that's that.
He was lying, and so were the rest of them.
They all know how and why that man was murdered and who was back of it.
Just as you and I do.
It's marvelous, isn't it?
One man, Johnny Vanning, completely terrorizes the city.
Commits every crime from murder to mayhem.
We all know it, yet we can't do a thing about it.
Look, son.
My files are bulging with quashed indictments...
...hung juries, verdicts of "not guilty. "
So long as Vanning is able to buy politicians and hire unscrupulous lawyers...
...who take advantage of every technicality of the law...
...who coach and buy perjured testimony...
...and so long as Vanning is able to continue intimidating witnesses, it's futile.
Well, how long is it gonna keep on being futile?
I don't know.
We've got to wait for Vanning to make that one false move.
Yeah, well, I don't like waiting.
- Do you wanna take the case into court?
- Sure.
- With those witnesses?
- Sure, why not?
If Vanning can get away with intimidation, why can't I?
You're a young man, Dave.
At this stage of your career, a fiasco isn't going to help you much.
- Yeah, well, I'll take that chance.
- All right.
From now on, it's your case. Go to it.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
- Did you pick up those girls?
- They're in with the others.
- Would you mind stepping into my office?
- Not at all.
You too, Casey.
Right this way, gentleman.
Step right over here.
- Oh, Casey, will you close that blind?
- Yes, sir.
Ferguson, have all those girls line up facing this way.
Stand up, please.
Those the girls you were with last night?
You've got nothing to be afraid of. They can't see you.
- Were those the girls?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.
- All except that one on the end.
- Which one?
The one with the leather coat.
The girl with the leather coat, step forward.
- Sure you didn't see her around the club?
- Yes, sir.
All right, which one was with Krawford?
- The one on the end, the blond.
- That's Mary Dwight.
Ferguson, bring Mary Dwight into my office right away.
All right, thank you. That's all.
- Mary Dwight?
- That's right.
Sit down.
Go ahead, sit down.
All right.
- You work at the Club Intimate?
- Are you telling me or asking me?
- Those other girls, they work there too?
- You know everything.
That little girl with the leather coat, what does she do?
She's got nothing to do with this.
- We'll find out about that later.
- No, we'll find out about that right now.
That kid's my sister.
And she was down here visiting me...
...when those gorillas of yours blew in and pulled us all in.
And I'll tell you something else. If you get her mixed up in this, I'll...
I'm not. If she had nothing to do with it, I'll let her go.
Just as I'll let you go, if you had nothing to do with it.
Now, last night about 10:00 four men came into the club.
And they sat down with you girls.
You had some drinks and you danced.
There isn't any law against that, is there?
One of those men was Ralph
Krawford. He was with you.
The other four left about
1:00. You and he stayed.
He lost a lot of money gambling.
Then you left together in a cab.
- Where'd you go?
- Home.
- What'd you do when you got there?
- Nothing.
I got out, and he went off in the cab.
Where?
I don't know.
The cab driver testified minutes ago...
...that you told him to take
Krawford to the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel.
How do you account for that?
- Supposing I did?
- Then you did know where he was going?
Well, I knew where he was starting for, but I didn't know where he'd wind up.
You didn't see him between the time he checked out of his hotel...
...and the time we found him murdered?
- No.
Can you prove you didn't?
Can you prove I did?
- You're a pretty smart girl.
- So they tell me.
Much too smart to be protecting a murderer like Vanning.
I'm not protecting anybody but myself.
Now, Mary, we're trying to help you.
- I'm doing all right.
- For how long?
Until Vanning gets as much as he can and throws you in the ashcan...
...just like he's done with everything he's ever laid his hands on.
And we're trying to put a stop to that, help people like you.
But there's nothing we can do unless you're willing to help yourself.
Now, why don't you give us a break.
What kind of a break have you ever given us...
...outside of kicking us around every chance you could get?
There's only one kind of a break we want from you, and that's to leave us alone.
And let us make a living in our own way.
Or is that asking too much?
Anything else you wanna know?
How do you like the inside of a jail?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Because that's where you're going.
Maybe you don't know it, but there's a law in this state...
...that makes an accessory to a murder equally as guilty as the murderer himself.
Now, unless you tell me exactly what happened and who did it...
...I'm going to indict you for murder.
Nice. Just when I got everything running fine.
- It'll blow over.
- Yeah.
In the meantime, every one of my joints gets a bad reputation.
What do you suppose people thought they were before this happened?
- Ice-cream parlors?
- Never mind that.
I want it stopped.
What kind of a guy is this Graham?
Young, ambitious.
What's his price?
Did you ever hear the story about the virtuous young man?
Someday you're going to give me one of those answers...
...and I'm going to bust you right in the nose.
Tell it to me in English.
He can't be bought.
Is that plain enough?
Yeah.
Too plain.
Anybody that wouldn't take dough is crazy. Crazy men are dangerous.
A guy like that is liable to get too big and really put the clamps down.
And where will we be?
Oh, I've got something worked out that will take care of that.
- Is it cute?
- Everything I do is cute.
When I get through with him...
...he'll be lucky to be able get a job as a second assistant to a notary public.
Swell.
- Did you spring the girl yet?
- No.
What are you waiting for?
When I promise to get my girls out in case they get jammed up, I mean it.
- Get her out.
- She stays in jail.
Listen, Gordon.
You're doing all right as my lawyer.
But I don't like it when you start trying to be my boss.
Get that girl out before she starts squawking.
- That's just what I want her to do.
- What?
Only she's going to squawk the way I tell her to.
How do you do, Miss
Dwight? Sorry I was delayed.
I got here as soon as I could.
Now, before we accept this case, there are several things I'd like to discuss with you.
- Who sent you?
- Vanning, and keep it under your hat.
It's about time.
- Well?
- Sit down.
Look, that's all I've been doing for the past two days...
...is standing up and sitting down.
I don't need a lawyer to tell me that.
- When do I get out of here?
- You don't.
- Oh, I see. A little conniving.
- Yeah, that's right.
I go to bat for Vanning...
...and I get paid off by taking the rap for him.
Listen, jurisprudence, I pay Vanning good money to settle little things like this...
...and he's going to get me out of here.
Now, listen, you know Vanning takes care of all the people that play ball with him.
- You've got to stay here and help him.
- Help him?
What is this, a charity affair?
He's gonna help me, and do it fast.
Now, if he doesn't get me out of here by tonight, I am going to...
Do nothing.
Vanning was telling me that you said something about a girl...
...that was found in the river by the name of Audrey Fleming.
Now, you don't wanna be found in that spot, do you?
You sit down and listen to what I got to say.
What did you want to see me about?
- How long are you going to keep me here?
- That entirely depends on you.
You wouldn't do this to me if I were somebody important, would you?
No.
You'd be afraid. Somebody higher up might find out.
You might lose your job.
But with me, you can get tough.
People like us, we don't count.
We're nobodies. Setups to be kicked about by whoever feels like it.
Well, I won't stand for it.
- Either you let me out of here, or I'll...
- Or what?
Coming in here like this isn't gonna help you at all.
There's only one way for you to get out.
Tell me what happened the night Krawford was murdered.
- I can't.
- Why not?
- I'm afraid.
- Of Vanning?
Yes. He'll kill me.
- He did have something to do with this?
- No, he didn't. He was...
Oh, please don't ask me to talk. He'll kill me.
Help me to prove he's responsible, I'll put him where he won't kill anybody.
You don't know what he's like. He stops at nothing.
People disappear and are never heard of again.
I don't want that to happen to me. I'm young and I wanna live.
I don't wanna die.
All right. Come on, now.
Pull yourself together.
Here, use this.
Thanks.
- Pretty tough going for you girls, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Sometimes it's too tough.
There's no use crying about it.
That's the way it is.
That's the way it's gotta be.
No, it doesn't.
You're not the only one that was born with two strikes against him.
I probably got kicked around just as much as you did.
I didn't like it any better than you do.
The only difference between us...
...is that, well, I did something about it. You won't.
Now, Mary, if you'll help me to put
Vanning and his crowd where they belong...
...you'll not only be helping yourself...
...but you'll be helping thousands of other girls just like you.
If you won't...
...well, then you'll just keep on getting in deeper and deeper until...
Well, I... I guess you know the rest of the story just as well as I do.
- Now, you see that, don't you?
- Yeah, I see.
Well, now, why won't you tell me what you know?
Well, what have you got to lose?
Nothing. Not a thing.
Then you'll talk?
- Why not?
- Good girl.
Oh, Smith, come in here and bring your book.
And now, Miss Dwight...
...you've testified that when you arrived at the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel...
...you saw the deceased being dragged into a taxicab by two of the defendants.
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.
Can you identify these men?
Yes, sir.
Will the defendants please rise?
Will you indicate the men you saw that night?
Go ahead, Miss Dwight, you have nothing to be afraid of.
Which are the men?
Those men standing there behind Mr. Vanning.
And you positively identify
William Borno and James Meller...
...as the two men you saw drag the deceased, Ralph Krawford, into the taxicab?
Yes, sir.
- Have you ever seen these men before?
- Oh, sure.
They're a couple of
Vanning's strong-arm men.
They work as bouncers at the club.
Thank you, Miss Dwight.
Your witness.
- You say your name is Mary Dwight?
- Yes, sir.
Is that your true name?
Answer the question.
- Is that your true name?
- No, sir.
- Then what is it?
- Mary Strauber.
Why did you have to change it, Miss Strauber?
- For professional reasons.
- What is your profession?
I object. That's immaterial.
I'm merely trying to establish the character of this witness.
- Overruled. Proceed.
- I repeat the question.
- What is your profession, Miss Strauber?
- I'm a hostess in a nightclub.
Now, will you please explain to the jury just what your duties as hostess are?
Well, we have to entertain all the men that come into the club alone.
And just how do you entertain these men?
I object. That's a deliberate attempt to degrade the witness.
Overruled. I believe it's material.
And now, just how do you entertain these men?
Well, we dance with them and get them to buy us drinks.
Is that all?
Well, we're nice and pleasant to them and see that they have a good time.
In other words, you've got to be nice and pleasant to men you don't know...
...who ordinarily you'd have nothing to do with, isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.
- Now, Miss Strauber...
...isn't it true that a week previous to the night in question...
...you were threatened with dismissal by Mr. Vanning...
...for exceeding your duties as hostess?
Objection, Your Honor. It's irrelevant and immaterial.
I believe it both relevant and material to inquire into the motives of this witness.
Overruled.
I ask you again, is it true that in spite of repeated warnings by Mr. Vanning...
...that he would not tolerate such conduct in any establishment of his...
...you persisted in entertaining the men outside the club?
- Yes, but I...
- That's all, Miss Strauber.
Thank you.
The people rest.
The defense calls John Truble.
Will you please take the witness stand, Mr. Truble?
Put up your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- What's your name?
- John Truble.
- Please be seated.
Mr. Truble, as sheriff for Maco County...
...do you recall arresting two men named William Borno and James Meller...
...for drunken driving?
- Yes, sir.
What disposition was made of that charge?
They both pleaded guilty, so they got a $50 fine and 10 days in jail apiece.
Please look around this courtroom and see if you see...
...either William Borno or James Meller or both.
There's the two of them, sitting there behind the table.
Will you two men rise, please?
- You mean these two men?
- That's right. That's them.
May the record show that the witness has indicated the defendants Borno and Meller.
Now, Mr. Truble...
...you positively identify them as the two men remanded into your custody...
...at Maco County Jail from
October 4th to October 14th?
Yes, sir.
And you're certain that you didn't permit them to leave the jail...
...so that they could be seen dragging the deceased into a taxicab...
...on the night of October 9th?
No, sir. I'm very strict about that.
Your Honor, I wish to offer into evidence...
...these duly attested records of the arrest, conviction and imprisonment...
...of the defendants, William
Borno and James Meller...
...on the charges and for the period just stated by the witness.
They may be so received.
And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...you can understand why the district attorney...
...floundering in his desperate attempts to prosecute my client...
...has the effrontery to bring into this court such an obviously trumped-up charge.
And as if this were not enough...
...he expects an intelligent jury to convict the defendants for murder...
...on the testimony of a woman he tells you is an innocent victim of circumstances...
...but who, by her own admission, is not only unreliable, unscrupulous...
...and unfit to be heard and believed in any court of justice...
...but is definitely objectionable...
...in the eyes of all decent and upright men and women.
"We, the jury in the above entitled action, find the defendants, and each of them...
...not guilty. "
The clerk will record the verdict as read.
The jury is excused and the defendants are discharged.
Boy, I've been in some rotten ones, but this smells to high heaven.
Nice going, kid.
Thanks.
Yes, it's reached my nose by now.
Oh, just a minute.
You know, for a little while, you had me believing in you.
I thought maybe you were different.
My mistake. Thanks for the ride.
You know, if I weren't in such a hurry, I'd break right down and cry.
So long, chump. I'll be seeing you.
I wish it was all over.
It's getting on my nerves.
Yes, and your talking about it is getting on mine.
- Well, what happened? Where's the kid?
- Inside.
- Vanning won, didn't he?
- Yeah, Vanning won.
- How's she taking it?
- Pretty tough.
If you want me to, I'll talk to her first, Mary.
No, thanks, Estelle.
Had to happen sooner or later. So I...
Suppose I might just as well go in and face it now.
Hello, Betty.
Betty?
You know, this isn't gonna get us anywhere, darling.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you let me believe that...?
Well, I...
I just couldn't.
I guess I didn't ever want you to find out.
I wish now I had.
I've hurt you, haven't I, darling?
Betty...
...you're not going to let this make any difference between us, are you?
Are you?
You can't.
You'll see.
You'll forget all about it.
And in a couple of weeks, you'll be going back to school.
Mary...
...I'm not going back to school.
Not going back to school?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.
I just don't like school anymore, that's all.
I've been thinking of leaving for a long time.
- That's not the reason.
- Yes, it is.
Betty, I want you to tell me the truth.
I wanna know why you're not going back to school.
All right, I'll tell you.
I can't.
Don't you think my friends have read the papers?
Don't you think they've seen your picture and mine plastered all over the front pages?
I couldn't go back and face them now.
I'd be too ashamed.
- Ashamed of what?
- Of you.
Mary?
Mary, please, I didn't mean it.
Oh, please, don't. I didn't...
I know you didn't, Betty.
That's all right. Let's forget all about it.
Pretend you never said it.
Hello?
- Oh, it's you. You scared me.
- I'm sorry.
Don't you ever get tired sitting around in the dark all by yourself?
- I like it.
- I like it too, but not by myself.
I'm going to a party, gonna get dressed up.
Wanna be a sweet gal and give me a hand?
- Love to.
- It's gonna be a great big party.
I'm gonna wear the prettiest dress I got. Everybody in town is gonna be there.
Which one do you want?
The silver one with the little black jacket. It's hanging toward the back.
Oh, this one.
- Why, Emmy Lou, it's beautiful.
- Well, all my dresses are beautiful.
They gotta be in this racket.
There's nothing like clothes, honey.
That's the sugar that makes the flies come around.
I'll bet it'd look nice on you too.
I once had a dress like this.
Of course, it wasn't nearly so pretty, but it was silver.
I wore it to the junior prom.
Gee, I had fun that night.
- Lots of boyfriends, huh?
- I never missed a dance.
You miss dancing, don't you?
Kind of.
How'd you like to go the party with me tonight?
- Party?
- Sure.
Vanning's throwing it. One of the classiest affairs in town.
You'd have the time of your life. Come on, what do you say?
- Why, I'd love to, but...
- But what?
It's all right for an old maid to sit around...
...but a swell-looking kid like you ought to go out and enjoy life.
Get some fun out of it.
You could use a little fun, couldn't you?
- Yes, I...
- That settles it. You're going in this dress.
- But, Emmy Lou, I...
- Come on, get out of these pajamas.
And you're gonna have a marvelous time. You're gonna meet loads of people.
All right, but, Emmy Lou...
- Swell, isn't it?
- Marvelous.
Very lovely, Johnny. Where have you been keeping them?
- The one in silver?
- Like it?
- What do you think?
- It's yours.
- Who's the kid?
- Friend of mine.
Is she all right?
Think I would have brought her along if she wasn't?
Okay.
Particular friend of mine I want her to meet, understand?
- Sure, Johnny. Where is he?
- Over at the bar.
Big fellow by the end.
- What's his name?
- Crandall. Bob Crandall.
Okay, Johnny.
Come on, sugar.
Well, if it isn't Bob Crandall.
- Well, where you been keeping yourself?
- Well, hello. How are you?
I want you to meet Betty
Strauber. Bob Crandall.
I've known him for years.
- How do you do?
- Will you have some champagne?
- Champagne?
- Oh, why, sure, we'd love it.
- More champagne.
- Yes, sir.
Would you excuse me? There's somebody I've gotta see.
I'll pick you up later.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I'm way ahead of you. Do you think you can catch up?
- I'll try.
- Great. Here's to a large evening.
Tickled? Good.
- How you doing, sugar?
- Swell.
Eighty cents.
Wait a minute. I ain't got no change for no $ 100 bill.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- Where were you?
- At a party.
- Who took you?
- Emmy Lou.
I'm sorry for having come in so late, but we were having a marvelous time, and I...
Where did you get that money?
- Oh, this. Mr. Crandall gave it to me.
- Why?
I told him I had to leave, and he gave it to me for taxi fare.
I guess he must've been drunk.
- I suppose you're going to see him again?
- Yes, tomorrow for lunch.
You little fool.
- Take it easy.
- Shut up!
- Mary, what's wrong?
- Get upstairs.
- What have I done?
- I said, get upstairs.
- The kid didn't know.
- I told you to shut up. This is my affair.
I wanna know why it's all right for you to go to Vanning's parties and not for me.
So that's where you were.
Betty. Betty, you listen to me.
If you wanna go to a party again, you get advice from me.
Do you hear?
But you still haven't answered my question.
Well, you're different, that's why.
- Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm just like you are.
- Betty.
Think I'm gonna stay cooped up forever because you're afraid...
...I'm liable to do the same things you do?
- Oh, Betty, be quiet.
- No, I won't. It's the truth.
You're afraid. Well,
I'm not. Not anymore.
I've got the whole thing figured out.
Betty. Betty, listen to me. You know, I've done an awful lot for you.
All you've ever done for me is mess up my life.
Fixed it so the things that I wanted to have, I can't have anymore.
All right. If I can't live one way, I can live another.
- Why not? I'm young and pretty and...
- And dumb.
But you're smart.
You can teach me the rest.
All right.
If that's the way you feel, you can go anywhere you want to from now on.
You can even go back to Vanning's party.
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
Hello, beautiful. You back again?
Hello. I'm looking for someone.
You can stop looking right now, because you've found him.
That's something to celebrate about, isn't it? Or is it?
- Yes, it is.
- You look sad, beautiful.
I don't wanna see you look sad.
- What you need is champagne, lots of it.
- Maybe I do.
Not there, out on the terrace. All by ourselves.
That something to cheer your little heart up?
The champagne, the terrace and me. That worth a smile?
Come on, give it to me.
That's better.
Well, now for a little champagne.
Well, here we are.
Big, isn't it?
Yeah, but it's not so big you can't have anything that's in it.
It's too big. It makes you feel lonely and scared.
Well, if that don't suit you, there's the moon.
You can ask me for that.
Or the stars.
But you don't need them.
They're right in your eyes.
- You say pretty things.
- Pretty things, pretty people.
I say them and give them.
- Please don't.
- You're a funny kid.
Don't, please. No, please don't.
No, you don't. Come on, honey. Don't act that way. Give me a little kiss.
That's right, beautiful. Go right up to the sky. I'll meet you there.
- Emmy Lou.
- Why, Betty, what's the matter?
Take me home. Please take me home.
What's eating her? She stewed or something?
Come on, kid, stop putting on an act.
- Oh, Johnny, wait...
- Shut up. You heard me, come on.
- Let go of me!
- Johnny.
- You're going to go nice?
- No, I won't do it!
Looks bad. She ain't breathing so good. Shall I get an ambulance?
And have her talk? Don't be a sucker.
Where's Betty?
Betty?
You heard me. Where's Betty?
- Well, didn't she come home?
- She did, but she went back.
She didn't come back to the party. At least, I didn't see her.
- Emmy Lou, you're lying.
- Well, why should I lie to you?
- Where did she go?
- I tell you, I didn't see her.
- I could kill you.
- You leave me alone.
- Who told you to take her?
- I didn't take her, she wanted to go.
She's not the kind of kid to get mixed up in a party like that.
- Why didn't you look after her?
- Why didn't you look after her yourself?
She was your sister, not mine.
If anything happens to her...
Nothing's happened to her.
- How do you know?
- I just know, I'm telling you.
I just know.
- Where you going?
- I've got to find her.
Stick around a while. She might show up.
Oh, I can't wait, Gabby.
- Where's my sister?
- Your what?
- My sister.
- How should I know?
I never saw your sister in my life.
You're lying. She was here last night at your party.
She came with Emmy Lou.
- Oh, was that your sister?
- Yes.
Nice-looking kid.
Yeah, she was here, but went home about 2:00.
- Ain't that right, Charlie?
- Yeah.
- You're lying. Both of you.
- Now, take it easy.
You're lying and you know it.
Betty came back here again, and I can prove it.
- Yeah, by who?
- Never mind that.
- Where is she? What happened to her?
- What's the matter with you, Mary?
Don't you think I'd tell you if I knew?
- Why should I wanna hold out on you?
- I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.
All right, I tried to be nice to you.
- Now get out, and fast.
- You don't scare me.
Oh, hot-headed, eh? Just like...
- Like who?
- Like me.
I'm the same way.
Now, go home and cool off.
I'll send some of the boys out.
Maybe they'll help you find her.
Listen, Vanning, all I know is that kid sister of mine came back here again last night...
...and nobody's seen her since.
And get this straight:
If I find out that you or anybody else has laid a finger on her...
You'll what?
I'll get you.
Even if I have to crawl back from my grave to do it.
Her sister, eh? That's bad.
- Who do you think tipped her?
- Who do you think?
Emmy Lou. Go over there and grab that ditzy blond before she shoots off her face.
I know she went back to the party, and I can prove it.
Emmy Lou is just covering up for Vanning.
He just tried to pawn the same story off on me.
And you know that Vanning doesn't start ducking around corners for nothing.
That's what's driving me crazy.
- And that's why...
- All right, now. Take it easy.
You reported her disappearance to the missing persons bureau?
Yes.
Then there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm sorry, but that's out of my department.
Did they cut your heart up into departments too?
That kid's my sister. Any one of a million things could have happened to her.
- What do you expect me to do about it?
- Arrest Vanning.
- Will you testify against him?
- Yes.
Like you did last time?
You'll pardon me, but I don't believe a word you're saying.
You think I'm pretty low, don't you?
Now, what do you expect me to think?
I meet a lot of people in this job.
Some of them I feel sorry for because they... They just can't help themselves.
They don't know any better.
They're the misfits of the world. But you're not that kind.
You know what's right and you know what's wrong.
You know better, but won't do anything.
You choose to think that you can get through the world by outsmarting it.
Well, I've learned that those kind of people generally end up by outsmarting themselves.
And that's exactly what's going to happen to you.
And I won't feel a bit sorry about it, because, lady, you've got it coming to you.
Thanks for telling me.
The coroner's reports.
Oh, Mary, will you come here a moment, please?
Sit down.
They found your sister.
Where?
In the river, dead.
It isn't true.
It isn't true.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.
No, you don't have to be sorry for me.
You were right.
I had it coming to me.
Oh, but why did it have to happen to her? Why did it have to happen to her?
All right. Now, let's go back.
You say that Emmy Lou looked as though something terrible had happened to her?
Did she say anything?
- Well, when she came...
- She didn't say a thing.
I told you before, she went into the bedroom and didn't say a word.
I suppose you didn't hear her say anything?
Well, I was kind of tired and
I wasn't paying much attention.
Oh, why don't you all stop stalling?
You know you heard every word she said.
I said we didn't hear a thing.
Not a thing.
I suppose you girls realize that Emmy Lou is the key witness to this whole business.
Now, you know as well as
I do who murdered Betty.
For years we've waited for Vanning to make one false move, and this is it.
And... Oh, what's the use?
- I thought they were your friends.
- So did I.
If they're not, I don't have to handle them with kid gloves any longer.
Let's understand each other.
I've given you a chance to come on the right side, you turned it down.
Now, when I get Vanning, which I will...
...I'm gonna get everybody connected with him, and that means all of you.
- Mary.
- Get away from me.
- Mary, you got this all wrong.
- Get away from me.
I know you got us down, but what else could we do?
You know the law isn't for people like us.
Then what is?
That's another thing I've been trying to figure out.
Well, I'm sick of figuring things out.
Sure, we know all that. We know how hard it's hit you.
We know what you'd like to do about it. So would we.
We're in a spot.
Remember, once, I wanted to quit this.
You told me there was nothing else we could turn to.
That we didn't know any other way of making a living.
Well, you're right, Mary, we don't.
But if we go to Graham now...
...we're gonna really find out just how tough it can be for us.
That is, if we're lucky enough to be alive that long.
Oh, you can understand that, can't you, Mary?
I only understand that
Betty was my sister...
...that Vanning killed her, and that you won't help me do anything about it.
Mary, there's nothing we or anybody else can do to bring her back.
We can get Vanning, make him pay for it, put him where he belongs.
So what?
So somebody else will take his place.
There will always be somebody else.
Sure, as long as they are gals in the world like us who are afraid of guys like that.
I said that once to a guy I was crazy about.
He worked for Vanning and got into a jam.
I thought I saw a chance for us to get out of this racket without being afraid.
I told him. He listened to me.
They killed him.
I was crazy about him, Mary, just like you were about Betty.
Oh, what's the use?
It all adds up to the same thing if you wanna live.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
What did you tell that DA?
- Did she say anything?
- Nothing.
- Did any of you?
- No.
Why did you go to the law?
Why did you kill my sister?
- Answer me.
- You answer me.
- Why did you kill my sister?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe Emmy Lou does.
Where is she?
- What did you do with her?
- You listen to me.
You lay off that guy Graham, understand?
You got any beefs, you come to me, I'll straighten them out.
Not this one. You can't.
You heard what I said.
Stay away from that guy.
- And that goes for all of you.
- Not for me, it doesn't.
I'll tell him, and plenty more.
You'll tell him nothing.
All right, get out of here.
Charlie.
- Johnny.
- Shut up, or you'll get the same.
Go ahead, Charlie.
No, no.
Oh, please. Please don't.
Remember, if anybody asks any questions, you came home and found her that way.
Mary. Mary.
All right, break it in.
All right, keep your seats, everybody. This is a raid.
Put that stuff down and stay where you are.
All right, here you are. Break that in.
You better get up there and search that floor.
- Take those girls and line them up here.
- There's not enough room.
Yeah, I know Graham is working fast, but we got to beat him to it.
Tell Williams to put up all the bail they want. The sky's the limit.
Okay. Keep me posted.
Better think fast, Gordon.
It don't look like that
DA is fooling this time.
Either Graham is trying to put on a show to shut up the newspapers...
...or he's got something on you we don't know about.
Nobody's ever got anything on me I don't know about.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll tell him.
Graham is on his way here.
He's after that girl.
He wants to sweat it out of her.
And if he does, you'll fry.
- Get her out of here, fast.
- Take it easy, Gordon.
Nobody's going to get a chance to sweat her.
Charlie.
In a series of raids, police are swooping down on nightclubs and gambling joints...
...owned or controlled by Johnny Vanning.
Neither police nor the DA would disclose the reason...
...for this sudden interest in Mr. Vanning.
It's not hard to guess that it all ties in with the killing of Betty Strauber...
...and the beating of her sister, Mary...
...who is still in serious condition at the General Ho...
All right, Johnny, you wait out here.
Come on, sister, you're going places.
- Where to?
- Never mind. Just places.
Get her stuff out of here.
No. No, I won't go.
I won't. Johnny promised me. He promised me he'd take care of me.
He can't double-cross me. He can't. He cant. No.
Oh, no! No!
No.
Wait a minute, Charlie. Vanning's phoning down. Let's take her to the lobby.
Come out.
Gotta open it.
Get on the phone. Tell the doorman to stop her.
- Tell him she's drunk.
- Right.
Around the back.
- Did you see a blond come through here?
- No, sir.
Get that dame and get her fast.
You feel better now, don't you?
Yes.
- We'll have to go soon.
- Goodbye.
Oh, don't take it so hard, Mary.
The doctor outside told me he could fix that scar so nobody'd ever notice it.
I got things wrong with me that all the doctors in the world can't fix.
Mary, we were figuring that when you got out...
...we'd send you away, maybe to Florida...
...and you could lie in the sun and rest for a few weeks.
It'll do you a lot good.
You'll forget all about this.
How?
By just closing my eyes and pretending it never happened?
I wish it was as easy as that, but it isn't.
You see, I keep seeing that poor little sister of mine...
...lying there with that fear still in her eyes...
...and her pretty little head all twisted.
Me too.
- I see her too, just like you do.
- Emmy Lou.
Mary.
Oh, Mary.
You go on back to headquarters and I'll see you there later.
If you pick up any news of Emmy
Lou, call me here at the hospital.
All right, Mr. Graham.
I didn't mean to take her there, Mary.
- You know I didn't.
- Never mind.
Never mind, Emmy Lou. It's all over now.
There's only one thing that I'm interested in.
- Estelle, call Graham's office, will you?
- What are you gonna do, Mary?
Have Emmy Lou tell him the same story she just told us.
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Sure, I do.
I swore that I'd make Vanning pay for this if it was the last thing I ever did.
Well, why make her pay for it too?
Once she tells Graham, she's gone. Don't you realize that?
And you'll be just as responsible for her being bumped off as Vanning will.
Well?
Go ahead, Mary. It doesn't make any difference anymore.
My number's up anyhow.
He'll get me, just as he'll get every one of you.
As long as we're alive, there's a chance of someone telling.
And Vanning doesn't take chances.
One by one, he'll get us.
Well, maybe if we went to him and said:
"Look, Johnny, you know we won't talk. "
Maybe we could make a deal.
I'm sick of making deals.
Well, you wanna keep on living, don't you?
If this is what you call living,
I don't want any part of it.
Always being afraid.
Never knowing from one day to the next what's going to happen to you.
I'm fed up with being afraid of Vanning or anybody else.
There must be some other way for me to live.
If there isn't, I...
Well, I'd just as soon put a bullet in my head right now and end it.
- Hello, Graham.
- Hello, Mary.
Emmy Lou? What does she know?
- Everything.
- Will she talk?
Yeah, she'll talk, and so will we.
I'm telling you, Johnny, we've got to make a deal.
What do you mean?
Plead guilty. Throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
Mercy? Don't make me laugh.
They've been waiting to get me in a spot like this for years.
We haven't got a chance with that Emmy Lou testifying for them.
- Our only way out is a deal.
- Me?
I don't make no deals with nobody. They make deals with me.
All the time I've been that way, ever since I was that big.
You think I care for money?
All I care about is to make people do what I tell them.
You're crazy, Johnny.
Yeah, maybe I am.
Maybe I ain't.
I just know one thing.
I ain't going to let no five crabby dames put the skids under me now.
You wanna deal? Here it is:
You get word to those dames that maybe I get them before the trial...
...and maybe I got to wait until after it's over.
But if they talk, sure as my name's Johnny Vanning...
...I'll get them.
I wish that guy Graham would stop sending these banquets.
He's ruining my girlish figure.
- Don't have to make a pig out of yourself.
- Well, it's free, why not?
- Come on, Mary, your stuff's getting cold.
- No, I'm not hungry.
Gabby, look.
See that guy down there across the street with the gray hat on?
He looks like Joe Donnera, one of Vanning's pet executioners.
Right. Get away from that window, Mary.
That little hophead isn't out there walking for his health.
That's all.
Be seated.
Proceed with the case of The State v. Vanning.
The state calls Florrie Liggett.
And when Betty got out of the taxi and came up the stoop...
...she had money in her hand, didn't she?
- Yes, sir.
- It was a hundred dollar bill, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Where did she tell you she got that hundred dollar bill?
- From a man at the party.
- Just as a sort of a little present?
No, sir. She said she got it for taxi fare.
She told you that she accepted a hundred dollar bill for taxi fare?
Yes, sir. We always got that at Johnny's parties.
Thank you. That's all.
The state calls Estelle Porter.
- You knew the deceased, Betty Strauber?
- Yes, sir.
Will you speak a little louder so the jury can hear you?
Yes, sir.
- What kind of a girl would you say she was?
- She was the sweetest kid you ever saw.
And up until very recently...
...she didn't know the kind of work you and her sister were doing?
No, sir. She thought we were models in a dress shop.
Mary kept her in a swell school.
Wanted her to grow up to be a god kid, and...
Objection, as irrelevant and cheap pathos...
...in an attempt to play on the sympathies of the jury.
I merely offer it in rebuttal to the cheap insinuations cast upon the character...
...of the deceased Betty Strauber.
Overruled. Proceed.
The state calls Dorothy
Marvin, known as Gabby Marvin.
Then why did you refuse to talk about this case to the district attorney at first?
I had a reason.
And was it for the same reason that you tried to persuade the other girls not to talk?
- Yes.
- And just what was that reason?
- Vanning.
- What do you mean, Vanning?
A boy I was crazy about used to work for him.
He wanted to get out of this racket so we could go away together.
But he knew too much.
Vanning wouldn't let him out.
So the boyfriend got sore and talked.
George, he was that kind of a guy, sort of hotheaded and wild...
Never mind that. What happened?
They found him in a ditch, full of slugs.
The state calls Mary Dwight.
When you defied Vanning's command to stay away from the law...
...and threatened to tell me all you knew about him, what did he do?
- He slapped me hard right across the mouth.
- And then what happened?
He ordered all the other girls to leave the room.
And after they left?
Charlie and another member of the gang went to work on me.
And by that you mean?
They started slapping me around.
They'd keep crashing their big fists in my face.
And threatening me with worse...
...if I didn't keep my mouth shut like Johnny said.
Then when I fell down, they started kicking me.
Oh, I begged them to lay off, but they wouldn't stop.
Then when I saw Charlie...
...lean over me and take out his knife...
...I screamed and fainted.
And you don't remember anything that happened after that?
No, not until I woke up in the hospital.
Was there any particular reason why
Charlie cut that cross on your cheek?
Sure.
Sure, that's Johnny's little trademark for anyone who double-crosses him.
Emmy Lou Eagan, take the stand.
Then Betty pleaded with Vanning not to make her go with Mr. Crandall.
And that only made Johnny mad.
He grabbed her, and when she tried to fight him off...
...he hit her and she fell down the stairs.
- She fell down the stairs?
- Yes, sir.
Then Vanning didn't deliberately push or throw her down the stairs, did he?
Well, no, sir. He hit her so hard she lost her balance and...
Accidentally fell down the stairs, isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.
- Then Vanning didn't kill her?
- He did. He did.
- But you said it was an accident.
- Now, which is it?
- He killed her, I'm telling you.
I saw him, and that's why he wanted to kill me too.
And in summing up, I cannot impress upon you too strongly...
...you must never lose sight of the background of this case...
...a viciously ruthless background from which sprang the motive...
...for this killing of an innocent girl.
You should consider not only Vanning the murderer...
...but also Vanning the vice czar...
...who at this very moment is exacting his staggering tribute...
...from a supine and cowardly city.
To defend this empire of vice and crime...
...Vanning is pursuing the same methods he used in building and maintaining it:
Insidious bribery to corrupt, brutal violence to intimidate...
...and cold-blooded murder to silence any who dared protest.
Had all these succeeded as they had so often in the past...
...I wouldn't be here prosecuting Vanning for murder.
And why did he fail?
Was it because our leading citizens had risen in righteous indignation...
...to rid the city of this criminal racketeer?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...these leading citizens, men of reputation, men of standing, men of righteousness...
...who cried to high heavens that the city was overrun with crime and corruption...
...when they were called upon to testify, to do something about it...
...to risk even a little, did they? No.
They were either too busy or too afraid.
Out of all the teeming millions of this great city...
...only five girls had the courage to take their very lives in their hands...
...and accuse Johnny Vanning.
In spite of all threats of reprisals, the horror of which they knew too well...
...they were ready to appear before you to testify.
And let me be the first to admit the truth of the accusations...
...that were brought against these girls in a desperate effort to discredit them.
Frankly, they're... They're everything the defense has said they are.
Their characters are questionable.
Their profession, unsavory and distasteful.
Oh, it's not been difficult to crucify them, but it has been difficult to crucify the truth.
And that truth is that these girls...
...in the face of sheer, stark terrorism, did appear in court...
...exposed themselves to the public gaze, told the truth about themselves...
...told the world what they really are.
Then surely you must believe that they were telling the truth...
...when they testified that
Johnny Vanning was responsible...
...for the death of Betty Strauber.
And if you do believe that...
...there is but one verdict you can reach, and that is guilty.
Be seated.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.
- Hand it to the clerk.
Read it.
"We, the jury, in the above entitled cause...
...find the defendants guilty on counts one, two, three and four. "
Your Honor, at this time we give oral notice of our intention...
...to move for a new trial.
An intelligent, courageous and discriminating jury...
...has found you, Vanning, guilty of heading a combination...
...to commit and profit from every vicious and reprehensible crime.
This makes you responsible, in law and morals, for every foul and cruel deed...
...performed at your command by your henchmen.
The evidence against you is overwhelming.
Your previous record shows you to be an incorrigible criminal...
...a low and brutal character...
...an unprincipled and aggressive egotist.
It is my sworn duty to administer to each of you...
...the justice and punishment of an outraged community.
But before I do, let me warn you...
...that should any of the people's witnesses be injured or harassed...
...specifically, if anything should happen to those five girls...
...the court will request the parole authorities to retain in prison...
...the defendants against whom such witnesses testified...
...for the maximum terms of the sentences to be imposed.
Since all of you have been found guilty on every count in the indictment...
...it is the judgment and sentence of this court that you be imprisoned...
...for a term of not less than 30 nor more than 50 years in the state penitentiary.
Well, that's that.
Come on, kids.
Let's go.
- Congratulations.
- Nice work, Dave.
Just a minute, Mr. Graham.
Look this way, please.
Joe.
Johnny says to lay off.
Okay.
Mary.
Yes.
Aren't you gonna wait?
What for?
- It's all over, isn't it?
- Over?
Why, sure.
You better go back inside.
They all wanna congratulate you.
Oh, no, you're the one that should be getting the congratulations, not me.
I don't want them.
- But where will you go?
- Places.
- But what will you do?
- Do?
Oh, I'll get along. I always have.
Mary, I'd like to help you.
- Why?
- Why? Because I...
Because I think you've got a break coming to you.
And?
And I'd like to see that you get it.
What's the use of stalling?
We both live in different worlds, that's the way we gotta leave it.
I don't want to leave it that way.
I said to you that if you ever started helping yourself...
...I'd be the first one to go to bat for you.
And that still goes.
No matter what you do or where you go...
...we'll meet again.
Goodbye, Graham.
I'll be seeing you.
- Here's Graham.
- Been looking all over for you.
How about pictures of our next DA?
What do you mean DA?
He'll be our next governor.
Come on. Give that old personality smile.
You know, Graham, the old chin out.
- Attaboy.
- Just a couple of more now, Graham.
Wait a minute, Graham.

NICE WORK.
IT WASN'T ME.
IT WAS BREWSTER.
THEY JUST SENT ME
UP WITH IT.
YEAH. YOU SEE, PHELAN IS
TOO BUSY DOWN AT THE MORGUE
TRYING TO KEEP THE STIFFS

STAND JUST THE SAME WAY.
THAT'S A GREAT THEORY
YOU GOT THERE, PHELAN.
IS THAT HOW YOU
IDENTIFIED BARNEY SCOFIELD?
YES, INSPECTOR.
YOU'D BETTER GET ALONG
BACK TO THE MORGUE.
THOSE DEAD ONES MAY START TROUBLE
IF YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE TOO LONG.
OK, INSPECTOR.
A NEW ONE
YOU'RE RIDING?
NEW ONE? HA!
WHY, HE'S BEEN WITH THE
DEPARTMENT EVER SINCE I HAVE,
ONLY HE'S
ON MORGUE DETAIL,
WHILE I'M
AN INSPECTOR.
FUNNY THING.
HE SOMEHOW GOT THE IDEA
HE WAS A GREAT DETECTIVE,
MADE ALL KINDS
OF PINCHES,
TILL ONE DAY, HE MADE THE WRONG ONE.
TALKING
ABOUT PHELAN?
YEAH. REMEMBER HIM PUTTING
THE FINGER ON BARNEY SCOFIELD?
AND FINDING OUT
HE WAS WRONG
AFTER THEY BURNED
SCOFIELD IN THE CHAIR.
NO FOOLING.
HE DID THAT?
ALL RIGHT, JOHNNIE.
LET ME KNOW WHEN
YOU'RE READY TO GO.
I GOT A POLICE ESCORT
OUTSIDE FOR YOU.
OK, INSPECTOR, AND
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
THEY'RE YOURS, MR. CHAMP, AND
YOU CAN CARRY AWAY THE BOX.
WRAP IT UP. HERE'S MORE OF YOUR PUBLIC.
HELLO, JOHNNIE.
GREAT FIGHT, BOY.
THANKS A LOT. I GOT
TO BE RUNNING AWAY NOW.
THERE'S A GANG OF
NEWSIES WAITING OUTSIDE
FOR A FEE I PROMISED THEM
AFTER THE FIGHT, SO...
THERE'S A GRAND GUY.
WINS A CHAMPIONSHIP,
AND THE FIRST THING
HE THINKS ABOUT
IS THE NEWSIES.
AND HIS POOR, OLD,
GRAY-HAIRED MOTHER.
Â¶ "M" IS FOR THE MILLION
THINGS SHE GAVE ME Â¶
YOU THINK THAT'S
FUNNY, DON'T YOU?
LAY OFF, JOHNNIE.
HE'S CANNED.
DON'T GET SORE. I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
OK.
JUST BECAUSE A GUY DOESN'T
DRINK AND FOOL AROUND WITH WOMEN
AND RESPECTS HIS MOTHER, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO MAKE A MONKEY OUT OF HIM.
DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM, JOHNNIE.
THE REST OF US
THINK YOU'RE OK.
Man: WE SURE DO,
JOHNNIE.
GOOD NIGHT.
SO LONG,
JOHNNIE BOY.
GOOD NIGHT,
JOHNNIE.
THERE GOES ONE GRAND GUY.
AM I RIGHT,
OR AM I RIGHT?
ONE GRAND GUY.
Announcer: TONIGHT YOUTH
WAS SERVED AGAIN
WHEN YOUNG JOHNNIE BRADFIELD WON THE
LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD
IN THE SEVENTH ROUND
OF A SCHEDULED 15-ROUND BATTLE.
JOHNNIE FIGHTS
LIKE A REAL CHAMPION.
WHILE HIS RIGHT JABS
WITH LIGHTNING PRECISION,
HIS LEFT IS PACKED
WITH DYNAMITE.
RED DYNAMITE,
I'D SAY.
SOME PARTY,
DOC, HUH?
HA HA HA!
YEAH.
Announcer:
LIVE AT HOME WITH MOTHER
AND STAY AWAY
FROM BOOZE AND WOMEN
IS THE NEW CHAMP'S
FORMULA.
SAYS YOU,
BUT HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE
WOMEN, ISN'T HE, JOHNNIE?
NO WOMEN
IN THE CHAMP'S LIFE,
JUST LITTLE GOLDIE.
YEAH.
WHAT'S
THE MATTER, DOC?
YOU'RE SORE BECAUSE
YOU AIN'T GOT A GIRL?
NO.
I AIN'T SORE.
COME ON.
POUR US A DRINK.
YEAH, YEAH. A BIG ONE FOR ME, TOO, DOC.
WELL, YOU
GOT A DRINK.
WELL, GIVE ME
SOME MORE.
I WANT MUSIC.
COME ON. CHEER UP, DOC.
YOU'RE MY MANAGER,
AIN'T YOU?
WE WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP,
DIDN'T WE?
WE WERE RIGHT
UP THERE ON THE MONEY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF DAMES.
YEAH. HERE.
NOW I'VE GOT
SOMETHING.
COME ON. COME ON. GET UP. LET'S DANCE.
COME ON. GET UP.
I WANT TO FINISH
THIS DRINK.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FINISH THAT.
COME ON. LET'S DANCE, DANCE, DANCE.
WILL YOU PUT THAT
DOWN? YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.
NOW COME ON. DANCE.
OH, DON'T!
OH, JOHNNIE, NO!
HA HA!
HA HA HA!
I KNOCKED OUT
JOHNNIE BRADFIELD!
AW, WHO IS THAT?
MAYBE IT'S BUDGIE.
I TOLD HER TO COME UP.
AW, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO DO THAT FOR?
DON'T BE THAT WAY, BABY.
SHE'S NOT GONNA STAY.
WELL, DARLING,
HERE WE ARE.
SO GOOD YOU
COULD COME.
THIS IS MY FRIEND
CHARLIE MAGEE.
HELLO. COME ON IN. I WANT
YOU TO MEET EVERYBODY.
THIS IS DOC WARD.
DOC, THIS IS BUDGIE
MASSEY AND MR. MAGEE.
HIYA, DOC.
AND THAT IS JOHNNIE.
JOHNNIE! OH, JOHNNIE,
AM I CRAZY TO MEET YOU, EH?
DID YOU HEAR ME YELLING
FOR YOU TONIGHT?
I ALMOST BROKE UP
THE JOINT,
DIDN'T I,
CHARLIE, HUH?
YOU CERTAINLY DID.
JOHNNIE,
IS THAT FOR ME?
WELL, IT'S
STRAIGHT RYE.
OH, I CAN TAKE IT.
I TOLD YOU
I COULD TAKE IT, SEE?
HEY, WHY DON'T GIRLS
BE PRIZEFIGHTERS?
ANYONE AROUND HERE
WANT TO FIGHT, HUH?
HEY, JOHNNIE.
JOHNNIE, HEY.
YOU WANT TO FIGHT
WITH ME?
HEY, JOHNNIE,
COME ON.
SHOW ME
HOW TO FIGHT.
COME ON. LOOK AT
THAT LEFT OF MINE.
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?
HOW ABOUT YOU?
BUDGIE, WHY
DON'T YOU RELAX?
AW, SHUT UP.
HEY, COME ON.
HIT ME CHAMP.
I'M WIDE OPEN.
HA HA HA!
OW!
WILL YOU
CUT IT OUT?
OOH, THE CHAMP
CAN'T TAKE IT.
PIPE DOWN,
WILL YOU, BUDGIE?
YOU'LL WAKE
MR. BRADFIELD'S MOTHER.
SHE'S A SOUND
SLEEPER.
SURE. SHE'S
A SHLOUND SHLEEPER.
SHE'S A SHLEEP
SHLOUNDER.
WHY DON'T YOU
GO HOME?
OH, JOHNNIE, DON'T BE LIKE THAT.
BUDGIE WAS ONLY KIDDING,
WEREN'T YOU, HONEY?
WELL, I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF KIDDING.
SHE'S
SLUG NUTTY.
LISTEN. YOU CANT TALK
THAT WAY TO MY FRIENDS.
FRIENDS,
NOTHING.
NOBODY HAS GOT
ANY FRIENDS.
COME ON, HONEY.
GIVE ME
ANOTHER DRINK.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NOBODY HAS GOT FRIENDS"?
AIN'T I
YOUR FRIEND?
YEAH,
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
FOR 50%, YOU'RE
MY FRIEND.
THAT AIN'T RIGHT.
YEAH. YOU'RE MY FRIEND
NOW BECAUSE I'M UP,
BUT YOU AIN'T
FOOLING ME.
YOU'D TAKE MY ROLL,
MY WATCH, AND MY GIRL
IF YOU THOUGHT YOU
COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.
IF YOU WERE SOBER, YOU
WOULDN'T TALK LIKE THAT.
EH, GO ON.
IT'S A SUCKER'S GAME.
YOU MEAN,
THE FIGHT RACKET?
I MEAN,
BREATHING, LIVING.
NOBODY DOES ANYTHING UNLESS
THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT.
IF YOU DO,
YOU'RE A SUCKER.
EXCEPT
YOUR MOTHER, HUH?
HA HA HA!
THAT'S A LAUGH.
MY MOTHER.
MY DEAR, OLD MOTHER.
I HAVEN'T GOT
A MOTHER.
THAT GRAY-HAIRED OLD
LADY STUFF IS JUST A LINE,
A LINE FOR SUCKERS.
WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD LINE, AT THAT.
SURE IT IS.
SO IS THE ONE ABOUT
BOOZE AND WOMEN.
WHY, I'VE LAPPED UP
MORE BOOZE
AND RAN AROUND
WITH MORE WOMEN,
AND THE MOTHER ANGLE,
WHY, THAT'S JUST STANDARD.
CAN YOU DIE?
THAT JOHNNIE BRADFIELD
AIN'T GOT A MOTHER.
SHE WAS JUST A PROP
TO CATCH SUCKERS.
WELL, THERE'S A STORY FOR
YOUR PAPER, CHARLIE, HUH?
YEAH, SURE.
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT SHE SAY?
SHE SAID PLENTY. THAT MUG IS A REPORTER.
REPORTER?
HEY, CAN'T YOU TAKE
A JOKE, JOHNNIE?
THAT'S RIGHT,
THE "MORNING GRAPHIC."
YOU WOULDN'T PRINT
WHAT JOHNNIE JUST SAID
IN YOUR PAPER,
WOULD YOU?
NOW, WOULDN'T I?
CAN YOU THINK
OF A BETTER STORY?
WELL, SO LONG,
FOLKS, AND THANKS.
JUST A MINUTE, MAGEE,
YOU'RE GONNA
STICK AROUND A WHILE.
OH, YEAH?
YEAH!
YOU DAMES GO
POWDER YOUR NOSES.
YOU WOULDN'T
DO ANYTHING.
NOT UNLESS WE HAVE TO.
SCRAM.
LISTEN, MAGEE. YOU
AIN'T GONNA PRINT THAT.
I'D BE A SUCKER
IF I DIDN'T.
AND I'D BE A SUCKER IF I
DIDN'T TAKE A POKE AT YOU,
AND THAT GOES FOR EVERY TIME I SEE YOU.
Doc: JUST A MINUTE, MAGEE.
YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING YET.
OH!
WHAT GOES ON OUT HERE? JOHNNIE!
JOHNNIE,
ARE YOU HURT?
NO. HE'S ALL RIGHT.
CHARLIE!
CHARLIE, WHAT HAVE
THEY DONE TO YOU?
CHARLIE. CHARLIE.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
HOLY...
WHAT?
NOTHING.
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S DEAD!
SIT DOWN! SHUT UP!
WHAT DID YOU
DO THAT FOR?
SHE HAD IT
COMING TO HER.
COME ON. LET'S BLOW.
WE CAN'T.
JOHNNIE IS OUT COLD.
WE GOT TO.
GET YOUR WRAPS.
COME ON. HELP ME GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
BUT WHERE
ARE WE GOING?
OUT TO MACKEY'S.
THERE'S NOBODY THERE.
OH. GRAB THOSE
HATS AND COATS.
ALL RIGHT.
GET IN THERE FIRST.
GO AHEAD.
GRAB HIS ARM.
TRY AND MAKE
A SUCKER OUT OF ME.
COME TO YET?
NO. HE'S STILL DEAD
TO THE WORLD.
SWELL. LET'S GET HIM IN THE HOUSE.
HERE.
BETTER HAVE A SHOT.
THANKS.
WE'LL NEED IT BEFORE
THE NIGHT IS OVER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
COME HERE.
WE GOT TO SCRAM OUT OF HERE, AND QUICK.
NO. I'M GONNA STICK.
I GOT TO STICK.
ALL RIGHT. YOU STICK. IT'S
ALL THE THANKS YOU'LL GET.
DOC, ARE YOU
SURE HE DID IT?
I'M TELLING YOU, HE SOCKED
HIM WITH THAT LEFT OF HIS,
AND WHEN HE
DOESN'T GO DOWN,
HE HITS HIM A TERRIFIC WALLOP
OVER THE HEAD WITH A WHISKY BOTTLE.
THEN THE GUY GOES DOWN AND
CONKS HIMSELF OUT FOR KEEPS.
THE WHISKY BOTTLE? THAT
DON'T SOUND LIKE JOHNNIE.
I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S A
KILLER WHEN HE'S DRUNK.
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT THAT
DAME WILL DO WHEN SHE WAKES UP.
WE'RE ALL IN IT,
YOU AND ME, TOO.
WELL, WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.
YEAH? WELL, WE WERE
THERE, WEREN'T WE?
DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
SAY WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?
DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA TAKE
THE RAP WHILE WE WALK OUT?
BUT WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.
OH, SHUT UP.
YOU SAID THAT ONCE.
I'M EXPLAINING
TO YOU, AIN'T I?
IT AIN'T, "DID YOU DO ANYTHING?"
IT'S, "CAN YOU PROVE IT?"
CAN YOU PROVE
YOU DIDN'T DO NOTHING?
WELL, JOHNNIE
WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
NO. HE'D GO TO THE CHAIR
FOR YOU, WOULDN'T HE?
YOU JUST HEARD HIM SAY
HE'S NO SUCKER.
WE NEED
TO STICK TOGETHER,
YOU AND ME, KID.
HE SAID YOU'D TAKE
HIS ROLL AND HIS WATCH.
YEAH, AND HIS GAL.
I'M NO SUCKER,
EITHER.
COME ON.
UHH...
OH!
DOC. DOC,
I'M SCARED.
I'M SCARED
STIFF.
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE
SCARED ABOUT, HONEY.
WE'LL BE ACROSS
THE BORDER LIKE THAT.
THEN WE'LL HIDE OUT UNDER COVER
UNTIL THIS WHOLE THING BLOWS OVER.
COME ON.
COME ON, DOC.
GET SOMETHING HOT.
OK, BABY.
Radio announcer:
LICENSE NUMBER 2A-1243.
LOOK FOR JOHNNIE BRADFIELD,
POSSIBLY TRAVELING
WITH MANAGER DOC WARD
AND HIS GIRL, GOLDIE WEST.
REPORTER KILLED
IN HIS APARTMENT.
DOC, THEY'RE
AFTER US.
DON'T LET THEM
GET US, DOC.
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
BABY.
I WON'T.
I WON'T.
Announcer: PICK UP
GRAY CONVERTIBLE PHAETON
LICENSE NUMBER 2A-1243.
THOSE COPS,
THEY'RE AFTER US.
EXTRA, EXTRA.
"RUNAWAY KILLER DEAD IN
SMASH-UP!" READ ALL ABOUT IT.
EXTRA, EXTRA. READ ALL
ABOUT IT. PAPER, MISTER?
EXTRA, EXTRA. "RUNAWAY
KILLER DEAD IN SMASH-UP!"
READ ALL ABOUT IT.
EXTRA, EXTRA.
OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
I DIDN'T HIT HIM WITH NO BOTTLE.
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.
Johnnie:
NO, I AIN'T DEAD.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
THAT WAY FOR?
YOU KILLED
THIS MAN MAGEE.
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.
WELL, LISTEN. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE, THEN?
I WANT TO ASK YOU WHAT ALL
THIS IS ABOUT, SAYING I'M DEAD.
THE WRISTWATCH.
YEAH. I KNOW.
I CAN READ.
I READ ABOUT IT
IN THE PAPERS, TOO.
HE STOLE MY WATCH,
MY GIRL, AND MY CAR.
EH, SERVES HIM RIGHT.
I'M SORRY
ABOUT GOLDIE.
SHE WAS OK.
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
DOUBLE-CROSSED ME. IT WAS HIM.
LISTEN. DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GUILTY
OF THE MURDER OF
THIS NEWSPAPER MAN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
THAT WAY FOR?
I ARTED TO HIT HIM,
AND THEN I DON'T REMEMBER.
YOU STARTED TO HIT HIM,
AND HE'S DEAD,
AND HE, A NEWSPAPER MAN.
YOU'RE AS GOOD
AS DEAD.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
THAT WAY FOR
YOU'RE AS GOOD
AS DEAD.
WHAT ARE YOU...
OFFICIALLY,
YOU'RE DEAD.
YOU'RE THE GUY THAT
BURNED UP IN THE CAR.
YOU CAME TO ME
FOR ADVICE.
THIS IS MY ADVICE.
STAY DEA
LET JOHNNIE BRADFIELD
STAY DEAD.
YOU BE SOMEBODY ELSE.
BE, UH, JACK...
JACK DORNEY.
NOW GET OUT
OF NEW YORK.
YEAH, YEAH, BUT I...
I NEED SOME MONEY.
I GOT 10 GRAND
IN THE NATIONAL TRUST BANK.
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BANK.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
IT'S IN A VAULT. ALL I
HAVE TO DO IS OPEN THE BOX.
I GOT THE KEY RIGHT ON
ME. NOBODY WILL SEE ME.
NOBODY WILL SEE YOU.
WELL, LET ME HAVE THE
KEY. I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.
WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WHY, SURE.
HERE. GO TO
THIS ADDRESS.
STAY THERE UNTIL
YOU HEAR FROM ME.
KEEP OUT OF SIGHT.
I HAVEN'T ANY MONEY.
I HAVEN'T GOT A CENT.
WELL, HERE.
HERE'S $10.
WHAT AM I GONNA
DO WITH $10?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NIGHTCLUBS.
OK, AND WHEN WILL I
HEAR FROM YOU, TOMORROW?
YEAH, TOMORROW.
THIS IS THE ADDRESS?
YEAH.
NOW, DON'T BE SEEN
BY ANYBODY.
I GET YOU.
IF YOU'RE SEEN, YOU'LL
BE TRIED FOR MURDER.
DON'T TALK THAT WAY,
WILL YOU?
GROW A BEARD. DO SOMETHING
TO CHANGE YOUR APPEARANCE.
OK. I'LL DO SOMETHING.
I DIDN'T
FIGURE THAT...
"AND WE FIND THE DEATH OF
JOHN BRADFIELD AND GOLDIE WEST
"DUE TO ACCIDENTAL CAUSES
WHILE EVADING ARREST
FOR THE MURDER
OF CHARLES MAGEE."
WELL, THE PAPERS
CAN'T SQUAWK THIS TIME.
A GUY IS MURDERED,
AND 6 HOURS LATER,
WE NOT ONLY DISCOVER
WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME,
BUT WE ALSO KNOW
THAT HE'S DEAD.
Man: CAN YOU
IMAGINE THE HOWL
IF THIS HADN'T
HAPPENED?
KILLING A REPORTER
IS ONE THING
THE PAPERS
WON'T STAND FOR.
BOY, YOU SAID IT.
WELL, THAT'S THAT.
CAN I SEE YOU
A MINUTE, INSPECTOR?
SURE. GOT A CLUE
ON THE MAGEE MURDER?
THAT'S IT EXACTLY.
I DON'T THINK
THE GUY THAT BURNED UP
WAS JOHNNIE BRADFIELD,
AT ALL.
OH, YOU'RE NUTS.
REMEMBER ME PUTTING THAT
WATCH ON HIS RIGHT HAND?
WELL, THE GUY THEY BROUGHT IN
HAD THAT WATCH ON, ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT WAS
ON HIS LEFT HAND.
SO WHAT?
CAN'T A GUY
CHANGE HIS WATCH
FROM HIS RIGHT WRIST TO HIS
LEFT, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE?
WELL, THERE ARE SOME THINGS A
GUY ALWAYS DOES THE SAME WAY,
LIKE THE SIDE HE STARTS
TO SHAVE ON THE MORNING
AND THE WAY HE
STARTS TO DRESS.
SAME THING
WITH A WRISTWATCH.
OH, PHELAN, YOU'VE BEEN
HANGING AROUND STIFFS SO MUCH,
YOU'RE SEEING THINGS.
THAT'S WHAT...
SEEING THINGS.
I TELL YOU
ANOTHER THING.
THAT WATCH WAS
IN THE THIRD HOLE.
WHEN I STRAPPED IT ON
JOHNNIE BRADFIELD'S WRIST,
I PUT IT
IN THE FIRST HOLE.
YOU HEARD HIM TELL ME TO DO IT HIMSELF.
SO ONE WRIST IS BIGGER
THAN THE OTHER.
DIDN'T YOU EVER
HEAR OF THAT?
MAYBE.
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU REOPEN
THE CASE AND ASSIGN ME.
REOPEN THE CASE?
NOW GET THIS, PHELAN.
JOHNNIE BRADFIELD
MURDERED MAGEE,
AND IT WAS JOHNNIE
BRADFIELD WHO BURNED UP
ON THE HIGHWAY THIS MORNING AT 5 A.M.
NOW LISTEN, CHIEF.
LISTEN TO WHO?
THE TROUBLE WITH YOU,
PHELAN, IS,
THAT EVER SINCE YOU RAILROADED
THE WRONG GUY TO THE HOT SEAT,
YOU BEEN SEEING THINGS.
YOU'RE SCREWY.
WHY DON'T YOU RETIRE?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
BECAUSE I'M
NOT THROUGH.
OH, YES, YOU ARE,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT.
I'LL SHOW YOU IF I'M THROUGH. YEAH? HOW?
I'LL PROVE THAT GUY THEY BROUGHT
IN ISN'T JOHNNIE BRADFIELD.
YOU WILL, HUH?
LET ME TRY.
YOU'RE AFRAID TO.
WHO, ME?
YES! YOU!
FOR 10 YEARS, YOU'VE
BEEN PICKING ON ME
JUST BECAUSE
I MADE A MISTAKE.
WELL, MAYBE THIS
IS YOUR MISTAKE.
MAYBE IF I PROVE IT, THEY'LL
PUT YOU ON MORGUE DETAIL
LIKE YOU DID ME.
I'D LOVE TO SEE IT.
ALL RIGHT, PHELAN.
YOU GOT YOURSELF
AN ASSIGNMENT.
THANK YOU,
INSPECTOR.
NOW, BRING HIM BACK
DEAD OR ALIVE.
WHAT DID I
TELL YOU, FELLAS?
HE'S CUCKOO,
JUST PLAIN CUCKOO.
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
FOR TWO DAYS.
I'VE BEEN BUSY.
I WANT TO GET OUT OF
HERE. YOU GOT MY MONEY?
YES. I GOT YOUR MONEY RIGHT HERE.
THERE'S 50, 100,
WHAT'S THIS?
THAT'S YOURS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THAT'S MINE?
NOW, IF I WERE YOU,
I'D PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE
BETWEEN MYSELF AND THIS CITY...
WHERE'S MY MONEY?
WHERE'S MY 10 GRAND?
THE 250 YOURS. THE REST OF IT IS MY FEE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHERE'S
THE REST OF MY 10 GRAND?
I'VE EXPLAINED IT
TO YOU. IT'S MY FEE.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,
MAKE A SUCKER OUT OF ME?
WHAT DO YOU
THINK I AM?
YOU HAND OVER THE REST OF
THAT 10 GRAND, OR I'LL...
OR YOU'LL WHAT? WELL,
YOU'LL GO TO THE CHAIR.
NOW LISTEN TO ME, AND
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE.
DON'T USE YOUR FISTS,
OR YOU'RE COOKED.
IF YOU TAKE THAT
COCKEYED STANCE OF YOURS
WITH YOUR RIGHT STUCK OUT
AND YOUR LEFT PULLED WAY BACK,
SOMEONE IS GONNA
SPOT YOU.
WHAT YOU DON'T SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND, DORNEY...
WHAT?
JACK DORNEY.
REMEMBER THAT?
JACK DORNEY.
THINK YOU CAN
REMEER THAT?
JACK... DORNEY.
WHAT I STARTED
TO SAY, DORNEY...
DORNEY.
DON'T TAKE THAT
COCKEYED STANCE OF YOURS.
DON'T USE
YOUR FISTS AT ALL,
NOT AT ALL.
YOU'LL BE KILLING
SOME OTHER MAN,
OR IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL GIVE YOURSELF AWAY.
YOU'LL
GIVE YOURSELF AWAY.
ONCE THEY GET YOU,
YOUR LIFE ISN'T WORTH...
BUT DO AS I SAY,
JACK DORNEY.
STAY AWAY FROM PLACES.
STAY AWAY FROM ALL PLACES,
OUT OF SIGHT, AFRAID.
FROM NOW ON, YOU'VE GOT TO BE AFRAID.
GET ME?
YEAH. YEAH.
I GET YOU.
THAT'S MY ADVICE,
AND IT'S WORTH 10 GRAND.
HERE.
NOW BEAT IT, SUCKER.
WHAT CAN I DO
WITH THIS?
WELL, IT'LL SEE
YOU A LONG WAY,
AND WHAT DO YOU
WANT MORE FOR?
YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANY
TRAIN WHERE THERE'S PEOPLE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO USE AN AUTOMOBILE.
YOU GO HOP A FREIGHT SO
IT WON'T COST YOU ANYTHING
AND KEEP THE MONEY
FOR FOOD.
THAT OUGHT TO LAST
YOU AT LEAST 6 MONTHS.
HEY, YOU GOT YOUR
FOOT ON MY MONEY.
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG, BUDDY.
THAT'S MY MONEY,
NOT YOUR MONEY.
HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE.
TAKE IT EASY, MEL.
OH, SHUT UP.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
NOTHING.
NOTHING.
TAKE A WALK.
HEY, PEGGY.
HEY, PEGGY. COME HERE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
LOOK. ANOTHER TRAMP.
HEY, PIPE THE DUDE,
WILL YOU?
IMAGINE THAT... ONE LESS TREE TO PICK.
WELL, THAT WOULD
BE SWELL, HUH?
JUST ANOTHER CITY SLICKER ON THE MOOCH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HEY!
WHAT'S THE IDEA?
LOOK. WE GOT COMPANY.
A DAME?
WHERE'S THE DAME?
NO DAME, YOU DOPE.
WHY DON'T YOU CUT IT
OUT? YOU PICK ON ME.
I WONDER IF THERE'S A CHANCE THAT...
YES. THERE'S
A BIG CHANCE.
THERE'S A LADDER
BACK THERE
AND SOME BASKETS
AND SOME DATES,
AND AFTER YOU PICK 3
BASKETFULS, YOU GET A HANDOUT.
OH,
I'M NO TRAMP.
HAW HAW.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE A BIG OIL MAN,
AND YOU CAME ALL THE WAY DOWN
HERE TO STUDY ABOUT ANTICLINE.
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A
LIMOUSINE PARKED DOWN THE ROAD.
SUPPOSE I TOLD YOU I
DID HAVE A LIMOUSINE,
TWO OF THEM.
LOOK. I KNOW
ALL THE ROUTINES,
BUT IF YOU WANT TO EAT,
YOU GOT TO PICK.
I GOT A HUNCH I WOULDN'T CARE
FOR THE MEALS HERE, ANYWAY.
HMM.
ALL RIGHT WITH ME.
YOU KNOW, THE WALDORF
IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.
YOU OUGHT
TO TRY THE CAVIAR.
THANKS. I'M A SUCKER FOR CAVIAR.
GRANDMA!
GRANDMA RAFFERTY!
QUICK!
OH, NOW WHAT'S
THE MATTER?
OH! OH!
HERE, HERE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
HE'S FAINTED.
WELL, COME ON. GET HIM OUT
OF HERE. WE DON'T WANT HIM.
NOW LOOK OUT. HE'S
SAGGING IN THE MIDDLE.
COME ON.
NOW GET HIM UP.
GOLDIE.
IS THAT YOU, GOLDIE?
NO, IT ISN'T GOLDIE.
WHERE AM I?
WHERE'S DOC?
TAKE IT EASY, PAL.
I WANT TO KNOW.
WELL, YOU'RE
AT RANCHO RAFFERTY,
ABOUT 20 MILES FROM
COLINGA, ARIZONA,
IF THAT MEANS
ANYTHING TO YOU.
ARIZONA.
YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I GET IT.
I MUST HAVE
TAKEN THE COUNT.
LONG COUNT, I'D SAY.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT
FOR TWO DAYS.
WHERE WAS I HIT?
IN THE STOMACH.
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
EATEN FOR A WEEK.
HERE.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S MILK.
EVER HEAR OF IT?
HA! SURE, SURE.
THEY MAKE UMBRELLA HANDLES OUT OF IT.
UGH.
NICE AND QUIET
AROUND HERE, HUH?
MM-HMM.
NOBODY MUCH AROUND?
NOPE. JUST ME AND GRANDMA AND THE KIDS.
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH YOURSELF ALL DAY?
RANCH.
I DON'T GET IT.
YOU'RE NOT THE KIND THAT...
NO.
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE THE
RANCHER'S DAUGHTER TO ME.
LOOK. SUPPOSE YOU
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.
ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN. YOU DO THAT AGAIN,
AND YOU'LL BE OUT FOR A WEEK.
I TOLD YOU ONCE
I WASN'T GOLDIE.
WELL, YOU CAN'T
ARREST ME FOR TRYING.
WELL,
HERE WE ARE.
HELLO, PEGGY.
HELLO,
SHERIFF.
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS.
THAT'S GOOD. OH.
SO THIS IS THE YOUNG FELLA
THAT PASSED OUT ON YOU, HUH?
AYE, SHERIFF.
THIS IS THE BOY,
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE ARE YOU
FROM, BOY?
UM, TEXAS.
I'VE BEEN CUTTING
DOWN THERE.
THROATS?
UH, NO. BEEF.
GOT ANY FOLKS
AROUND HERE?
NO, NO, NO. MY FOLKS ARE BACK IN TEXAS.
I'VE BEEN JUST
LOOKING FOR WORK
TILL THINGS
PICK UP DOWN THERE.
OH. OH, LEAVE THE BOY
ALONE, SHERIFF.
HE'S BEEN OUT OF HIS HEAD FOR TWO DAYS.
SURE, SURE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE
ON MY WAY NOW.
JUST WANT TO STOP IN
AND SEE ABOUT THE KIDS.
I GOT TO MAKE MY REPORT
TO THE BOARD, YOU KNOW.
EH, LIKE THEY
CARE ABOUT IT.
HEY, SHERIFF, HOW'S ABOUT ME
GETTING A PICTURE OF YOU, HUH?
MY PICTURE?
SURE. WHY NOT?
OK. OUT HERE
WHERE IT'S LIGHT.
HUH. THAT'S A
LIKELY-LOOKING YOUNG FELLER.
YEAH. HE'S LIKELY
TO GET OUT OF HERE
AS SOON
AS HE CAN WALK.
HA HA HA!
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YOU SPONGE?
YOU'RE WALKING OUT
ON THE JOB, AREN'T YOU?
HEY, GRANDMA AND PEGGY!
EH, SHUT UP, YOU.
WHY, YOU BIG...
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU
PUNK. PUT UP YOUR DUKES.
BEAT IT, KID,
OR YOU'LL REALLY GET HURT.
A FINE THING TO BE HITTING A
LITTLE BIT OF A BOY HALF YOUR SIZE.
FOR TWO PINS, I'D BOX
THE SIDES OF YOUR EARS.
OH, I JUST
TOUCHED HIM.
CAN'T A GUY
TAKE A WALK
WITHOUT SOME KID FIRING
OFF A 21-GUN SALUTE?
OH, SO YOU WERE RUNNING AWAY
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANYBODY.
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT ME TO HANG
AROUND HERE FOREVER, DO YOU?
I TOLD YOU I WAS
LOOKING FOR WORK.
WELL, IT'S 20 MILES
TO THE NEAREST TOWN.
OH, WHY DON'T YOU
LET HIM GO?
THE SHERIFF HAS
A PLACE FOR HOBOES.
I TELL YOU, I'M
LOOKING FOR WORK.
THEY CAN'T DO NOTHING TO A MAN FOR THAT.
YOU TALK LIKE
I WAS A CRIMINAL.
SEE HERE. IF IT'S ONLY
WORK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,
YOU KNOW, THERE'S PLENTY
OF THAT HANGING AROUND HERE.
I GET IT. YOU KEPT ME A COUPLE OF DAYS.
NOW YOU WANT ME
TO WORK IT OFF, HUH?
FOR WHAT ELSE
WOULD I BE ASKING?
A GREAT, BIG, LAZY
LUMMOX OF A FACE LIKE YOURS
TO BE STANDING
AROUND HERE.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?
WELL, TILL YOU GET A BIT OF
COLOR INTO THAT FACE OF YOURS,
YOU CAN SIT AROUND
IN THE SUN
AND AMUSE THE KIDS.
BAH.
AMUSE THE KIDS?
Boy: HA HA HA!
HA HA!
WE'RE NOT AMUSED.
HEY. YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK, AIN'T YOU?
YEAH.

BOY, DO I MISS
THAT EAST RIVER.
YEAH, AND THAT REFORM
SCHOOL YOU WAS GOING TO.
I GUESS YOU MISS
THAT, TOO, HUH?
EH, REFORM SCHOOL

UP THERE TWICE.
HE DON'T GET OUT

YEAH. HE GOT
A LEASE ON THE JOINT.
JUST WHAT IS
THE SETUP HERE?
OH, WE GOT TOO HOT
IN NEW YORK.
SO THEY SENT US OUT
HERE TO REFORM US.
YEAH? WHO DID?
FATHER RAFFERTY. DID
YOU EVER HEAR OF HIM?
HE WAS NEVER
IN MY CHURCH.
MINE, NEITHER.
WELL, ANYHOW, HE WAS A PRIEST
DOWN ON THE EAST SIDE, SEE,
TILL HE DIED
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
HE GOT UP THAT "HELP
THY NEIGHBOR" FUND
TO SEND TOUGH KIDS
OUT TO HIS SISTER.
THAT'S
THE OLD LADY.
WHAT FOR?
TO GET
DEGENERATED.
REGENERATED,

REGENERATED.
THAT MEANS
REFORMED.
A REFORM SCHOOL
FOR KIDS, HUH?
HA!
YEAH, BUT THEY AIN'T
GONNA REGENERATED ME
BECAUSE I'M GOING BACK TO THE EAST SIDE.
HOW YOU GOING, BY PULLMAN, OR

I'M GONNA TOUR BACK
LIKE HIM.
EH, YOU AIN'T
GOT THE NERVE.
YOU AIN'T GOT
THE NERVE.
HEY. WHO'S THE DAME?
OH, THAT'S
TOMMY'S SISTER.
Johnnie: YEAH?
AND WHAT DID SHE DO?
SHE DIDN'T DO NOTHING.
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO WATCH
TOMMY GET DEGENERATED.
REGENERATED!
AW, CUT IT OUT.
YEAH. THE JUDGE WOULD'VE
SENT TOMMY TO REFORM SCHOOL
IF SHE HADN'T PROMISED
TO PLAY COPPER TO HIM.
UNTIL HE

EH, SHUT UP.
HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO, MURDER ME?
NO, ONLY
CUT YOUR THROAT.
YOU KNOW, TOMMY IS
A PRETTY TOUGH GUY.
THEY CAUGHT HIM
ROBBING A WAREHOUSE.
THEY GOT ME FOR SLASHING
TIRES ON CHERRY STREET
IN A PARKING GARAGE.
GOT A MATCH?
WHAT DO YOU
GOT THERE?
OH, THE CORK-SILK BUTT. YOU WANT ONE?
NO. ONE OF YOU KIDS
WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE A GUY COULD GET
SOME REAL BUTTS, WOULD YOU?
YEAH. THEY SELL THEM
OVER AT THE STAND.
YEAH? WELL, WHAT'S THE
USE OF SMOKING GRASS
WHEN YOU CAN
HELP YOURSELF?
NAH. THEY WOULDN'T STEAL
NOTHING AROUND HERE.
NO STEALING FOR ME.
I THOUGHT YOU KIDS
WERE TOUGH.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
AFRAID, KID?
AFRAID? HMM. I AIN'T
AFRAID OF NOTHING.
HOOKING BUTTS AIN'T
MY LINE, THAT'S ALL.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I DARE YOU

OH, A DARE. DARE.
YOU GOT TO TAKE A DARE.
EHH.
HEY, AIN'T YOU GONNA TAKE A DARE?
TOMMY, YOU GOT TO TAKE A DARE.
HELLO, SIS.
WELL, HIYA, TOMMY.

UH-UH, NOT YET.
WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU'RE
NOT QUITTING SO SOON, ARE YOU?
WELL, I AIN'T
QUITTING.
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S
KIND OF HOT, THAT'S ALL.
HEY, CAN I
HAVE A DRINK?
YEAH. YEAH.
I'LL GET ONE FOR YOU.
HERE YOU ARE.
OH, THANKS.
BOY, THAT JUST
HIT THE SPOT.
YOU GET THEM, KID?
YEAH. HERE YOU ARE.
NICE WORK.
THANKS.
VERY NICE WORK,
GETTING KIDS
TO STEAL FOR YOU.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
LOWER THAN THAT,
I HAVEN'T MET IT YET.

WHAT DID I DO?
SHUT UP.
HEY, YOU SAW IT,

WE DIDN'T
SEE NOTHING.
SURE, IT WAS A FOUL. HE
CAN'T PUT NOTHING OVER ON ME.
AS LONG AS THE REFEREE
SEES YOU, IT'S A FOUL.
SURE. I KNOW MY MARKWIS
OF QUEENSBURY RULES.
MARQUIS.
AAH!
CUT IT OUT, YOU...
YOU'RE GONNA BE SMART,
YOU DO IT IN THE IN-FIGHT.
COME HERE.
I'LL SHOW YOU.
HERE, TOMMY.
STAND UP THERE.
SEE, YOU'RE LEADING
WITH YOUR RIGHT,
AND YOU'RE MOVING
LIKE THAT.
WHILE YOU'RE TURNING
YOUR RIGHT AROUND,
YOU FAKE
A LEFT HOOK,
AND YOU JAB HIM IN THE
GUTS WITH YOUR LEFT ELBOW.
SEE? YEAH, BUT THAT AIN'T FAIR.
OF COURSE, IT AIN'T IF
THE REFEREE SEES YOU.
THE TRICK IS TO GET THE OTHER
GUY BETWEEN YOU AND THE REFEREE
SO'S HE WON'T
SEE YOU.
COME ON, JACK.
LET'S BOX.
EH, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
OH, SAYS YOU.
COME ON.
HA HA HA!
COME ON, JACK.
HIT HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE.
WATCH THAT RIGHT,
TOMMY.
WATCH THAT RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WAS ONLY
TAKING YOUR PICTURE.
LAY OFF. DON'T YOU
EVER DO THAT AGAIN, SEE?
WHAT'S EATING YOU?
NEVER MIND, BUT LAY
OFF WITH THAT CAMERA.
OK, OK.
WHAT YOU GETTING SORE ABOUT, JACK?
COME ON.
COME ON, JACK.
COME ON, JACK. SHOW US SOME MORE TRICKS.

GET UP AND...
NOW LOOK. IF YOU CAN'T
GET TO STAND ON HIS FEET,

IN THE EYE LIKE THIS.
OW! I GET IT.
Johnnie: ONLY HARDER
AND QUICKER,
BUT MAKE SURE YOU GOT THE OTHER
GUY BETWEEN YOU AND THE REFER...
OK, KIDS.
BEAT IT.
BEAT IT. BEAT IT.
GEE WHIZ, PEGGY,
YOU'RE ALWAYS BUTTING IN.
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE
US MEN ALONE?
WHY, YOU SURE CAN
GET IN MY HAIR.
I WAS JUST TEACHING THE KID
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.
YEAH,
WITH DIRTY TRICKS.
WELL, SOMEBODY WILL
PULL THEM ON HIM,
AND HE MIGHT AS WELL
LEARN TO PULL THEM FIRST.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING
IS ON THE LEVEL, DO YOU?
DO YOU? I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?
YOU'RE PLAYING PROBATION
OFFICER, AREN'T YOU?
SO WHAT? GETTING DOUGH FOR IT?
NO.
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT
PRIEST IN NEW YORK.
HE'S DEAD.
YEAH? WHAT ABOUT
THE FUND?
THERE ISN'T
ANY FUND.
IT STOPPED
WHEN HE DIED.
YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
YOU AND THE OLD LADY
ARE SUPPORTING THESE
KIDS ON THE CUFF, HUH?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT FOR?
YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND.
EH, YOU MUST HAVE
SOME ANGLE.
I WONDER IF YOU'RE AS
TOUGH AS YOU THINK YOU ARE.
I AIN'T SO TOUGH,
BUT I AIN'T
A SUCKER, EITHER.
WHAT DO YOU CALL
A SUCKER?
WELL, YOU'RE A SUCKER IF
WHAT YOU TELL ME IS TRUE.
SO'S THAT OLD LADY.
SO'S THAT DEAD PRIEST.
WHY, BECAUSE HE
PUT OUT A HELPING HAND?
"HELP YOURSELF"
IS MY SLOGAN.
AND WHAT DOES
THAT GET YOU?
WELL,
A LOT OF THINGS.
THANKS FOR THE LESSON.
ALL RIGHT. B-16.
"SINGLE-PUMP, 500-GALLON,
FIREPROOF TANK.
INSTALLED."
SO WHAT?
TOMMY IS FIGURING ON
OPENING UP A SERVICE STATION.
YEAH? WHERE AT?
OH, IN FRONT
OF THE STORE.
TOMMY JOINED THE BIG BROTHER MOVEMENT.
YEAH. WELL, A FELLA
HAS GOT A RIGHT
TO LOOK OUT AFTER HIS
OWN SISTER, AIN'T HE?
WELL, WHAT'S THE
MATTER WITH YOUR SISTER?
SHE WAS DOING ALL RIGHT
WHEN I SEEN HER LAST.
SHE'S PLENTY WORRIED
ABOUT THE RANCH.
ONLY SELLING ENOUGH DATES
TO PAY FOR FOOD AND UPKEEP.
WE'VE BEEN BEHIND IN TAXES EVER SINCE
MONEY STOPPED COMING FROM NEW YORK.
MIGHT LOSE THE PLACE
BEFORE LONG.
WELL, WHO TOLD
YOU ALL THIS?
THAT'S ALL SHE
AND GRANDMA TALK ABOUT.
YEAH.
I HEARD THEM, TOO.
SO WHAT?
SO WE FOLD UP THE RANCH
AND GO BACK TO NEW YORK.
BOY, THAT WOULD
BE SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, THERE AIN'T A
GAS STATION ON OUR ROAD
42 MILES ONE WAY
AND 28 THE OTHER.
ABOUT 200 CARS A DAY PASS
OUR PLACE DURING WEEKDAYS
AND TWICE AS MANY
ON SUNDAYS.
I FIGURE WE COULD SUPPORT
THE RANCH SELLING GAS.
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
DEGENERATED, ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY THAT GAS
STATION WAS GONNA COST?
OH, ABOUT TWO GRAND.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT TO USE FOR MONEY?
HE THINKS HE'LL
STICK UP A BANK
WHEN HE GETS
BIG ENOUGH.
OH, SHUT UP.
THAT AIN'T FUNNY.
EH, IT'S TOO HOT
FOR PIPE DREAMS.
IS THAT THE TANK
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
YEAH! THAT'S IT! THE
EAST RIVER OF THE WEST.
WHOA!
NOW LISTEN, KIDS.
GET THIS.
WE WENT DOWN THE ROAD SEVERAL MILES TO THAT
NEW DATE RANCH WHERE THEY'RE IRRIGATING.
WE WATCHED THEM FOR A WHILE AND
SORT OF FORGOT ABOUT THE TIME, SEE?
ANYBODY THAT SQUEALS WE WENT
SWIMMING GETS THE WORKS, UNDERSTOOD?
RIGHT. CHECK.
LAST ON IN IS A YELLOW DOG!
FIRST ON IN
IS A HEEL!
SHUT UP, WILL YOU?
WANT OLD MAN HENRY
TO COME AROUND AND CHASE US?
DON'T RUSH.
WE GOT ALL DAY.
BOY, WAIT TILL I
GET IN THAT WATER.
LET'S GO!
BOY, THIS IS THE LIFE. I'M COMING.
HERE I GO!
HOW'S THE WATER, JACK?
IT'S THE CAT'S!
YAHOO!
WAIT FOR ME!
THE OLYMPIC CHAMP
IS COMING NOW.
BABY!
WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON IN?
OH, WHAT ARE YOU
SCARED OF?
I AIN'T SACRED.
HEY, HE'S FROM
EIGHTH AVENUE.
NONE OF THEM KIDS
KNOWS HOW TO SWIM.
WHO DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SWIM?
I'LL SHOW YOU.
HEY, FELLAS, LOOK HOW LOW THE WATER IS.
I CAN JUST
REACH THE TOP.
THEY MUST BE
IRRITATING.
IRRIGATING, YOU DOPE. IRRIGATING.
OK, OK.
IRRIGATING.
HEY, JACK!
I CAN'T REACH THE TOP!
JACK, YOU BETTER HELP HIM
BECAUSE HE CAN'T SWIM VERY GOOD.
OK, KID.
UP YOU GO NOW.
OH, JACK! GET ME UP!
SHUT UP. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
I WANT TO GET UP!
YOU ALL RIGHT NOW?
OF COURSE, YOU ARE.
COME ON.
HEY, JACK! THE WATER IS RUNNING OUT.
I KNOW. HERE.
HOLD HIM, WILL YOU?
TOMMY, COME HERE.
DIPPY,
YOU HOLD ANGEL.
NOW LOOK. I'M GONNA GO DOWN,
LIFT YOU UP BY YOUR ANKLES,
AND LIFT YOU RIGHT UP ON THE
TOP, AND YOU GRAB HOLD OF IT.
OK. LET'S GO.
READY?
TRY AGAIN.
YOU READY?
YEAH, I'M READY.
SPIT, ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
TELLING ME THE TRUTH?
CROSS MY HEART.
HONEST, PEG, I DON'T
KNOW WHERE THEY WENT.
WELL, DIDN'T THEY SAY
WHERE THEY WERE GOING?
JUST TOOK THE TRUCK AND LEFT.
HOW LONG AGO?
ABOUT AN HOUR.
IT'S DOWN TO 10 FEET
AND STILL FALLING.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS STICK TOGETHER
AND WAIT TILL THE WATER GOES
DOWN, AND WE CAN TOUCH BOTTOM.
YOU GETTING TIRED?
NO. NAH. NO.
HEY, JACK! THE WATER STOPPED GOING DOWN.
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH. YOU SEE? IT'S
STILL AT THE SAME MARK.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
HEY!
HERE. I'M GONNA GO DOWN AND SEE
WHAT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS TANK.
WILL YOU HOLD HIM
FOR A FEW MINUTES?
YEAH. I'LL HOLD HIM.
DON'T LET ME GO, TOM.
THERE'S A VALVE DOWN THERE
THAT LETS THE WATER OUT,
BUT YOU GOT
TO KEEP IT OPEN.
I'LL GO DOWN THIS TIME. TAKE THE KID.
OK.
HERE I GO.
I COULDN'T
HOLD IT VERY LONG.
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
TOMMY.
I THINK
IT'S GONE DOWN.
HERE. HOLD HIM,
WILL YOU?
I'M GONNA
TAKE A TRY.
TAKE IT EASY, KID.
TAKE IT EASY.
DID YOU GET IT?
I TOUCHED BOTTOM.
ONE MORE TIME
OUGHT TO DO IT.
GO AHEAD, JACK.
OH, PEG, WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
WE CAN'T FIND
THOSE GUYS.
YEAH. WE WAS ALL THE
WAY DOWN THE ROAD, TOO.
GRANDMA, THEY COULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN THE TRUCK TO TOWN.
OH, WELL,
DON'T WORRY, PEGGY.
MAYBE THE TRUCK
BROKE DOWN.
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
NOW COME ON. GET UP.
HERE WE GO. UP!
NOW TOMMY AND ANGEL.
REACH FOR THAT LADDER
AND BRING IT DOWN.
OK, GUYS.
COME ON.
YEAH.
LOOK ALIVE.
ALL RIGHT, KIDS.
UP ON IT.
THAT'S IT.
WAIT TILL HE
GETS UP ON IT.
HEY, THIS GUY IS SPOUTING
WATER LIKE A FOUNTAIN.
KEEP HIS FACE DOWN.
THIS BUMPING UP AND DOWN
WILL DO HIM GOOD.
JOHNNIE, DO YOU THINK
HE DROWNED MAYBE?
NO, NO.
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
NOW, LISTEN.
NOBODY TALK, SEE?
HE GOT AWAY FROM US AND FELL IN
THE WATER, AND WE FISHED HIM OUT.
GET THAT?
UNDERSTAND?
YEAH, SURE.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM SINCE
ABOUT 2:00 THIS AFTERNOON.
THEY LEFT
IN THE TRUCK.
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW, SHERIFF.
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
HEY, LOOK.
HERE THEY COME.
Peggy: NEVER MIND, SHERIFF.
THEY JUST CAME IN. THANKS.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WE TOOK THE TRUCK AND WENT WAY DOWN...
DOWN TO WHERE THEY WAS
IRRIGATING THAT NEW RANCH,
AND WE STOPPED
TO WATCH THEM, AND...
YEAH, AND BEFORE WE KNEW
IT, IT WAS GETTING DARK,
WASN'T IT, ANGEL?
YEAH.
WHY, YOU'RE WET
TO THE SKIN!
OH! GET SOME TOWELS, QUICK,
AND GET A BRANDY.
COME OVER TO THE STOVE
AND GET WARM.
WELL, WHAT DID
YOU DO TO HIM?
HE FELL IN
AN IRRIGATION DITCH.
YEAH, SURE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
DID YOU ALL FALL IN THE
SAME IRRIGATION DITCH?
YEAH. WE GOT WET
FISHING HIM OUT.
WELL, THEY'VE GOT
TELEPHONES, YOU KNOW.
NOT WHERE WE WAS.
I DON'T EXPECT TO GET
THE TRUTH OUT OF YOU
OR OUT OF ANY OF THEM
WHILE YOU'RE AROUND.
IN FACT, I THINK WE
HAVE ENOUGH OF YOU.
GET OUT.
IT'S OK WITH ME. WHEN
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?
THE SOONER,
THE BETTER.
I'LL LEAVE RIGHT NOW, IF
THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.
PEGGY, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT HE...
SHUT UP.
COME ON.
EH, IT AIN'T RIGHT,
I TELL YOU. IT AIN'T.
EH, THAT'S OK.
THERE WE WAS, CAUGHT
LIKE CATS IN A TRAP.
YOU MEAN, RATS. I MEAN,
CAT. YOU KNOW, JACK.
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU DROP A BUNCH OF
KITTENS TO DROWN IN A BUCKET OF WATER.
SURE. THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE WE WAS,
ON THE DRINK OF DEATH.
BRINK.
AW, CUT THAT OUT,
WILL YOU?
EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT, YOU
MAKE ME NERVOUS ALL OVER.
THINK THAT'S
GOOD FOR ME?
WELL, ANYWAY, IN THE
WATER, IT'S DRINK OF DEATH.
WE'D ALL BE DEAD DUCKS
IF IT WASN'T FOR JACK.
SURE. OF COURSE.
CERTAINLY.
WHY WON'T YOU
LET US TELL HER?
WELL, SHE'D SAY IT WAS
MY FAULT FOR TAKING YOU.
YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF TAKING
ANYBODY WITH YOU, HAVE YOU?
WHO? WHO DO
YOU MEAN? YOU?
WELL, LOTS OF RANCH HELP TRAVEL
AROUND IN PAIRS LIKE THAT.
WHAT ABOUT THAT
GAS STATION?
WELL, THAT CAN WAIT TILL I
EARN ENOUGH DOUGH AND COME BACK.
EH, I'D LIKE
TO TAKE YOU, KID.
BUT YOUR SISTER WOULD HAVE THE
MILITIA OUT AFTER ME FOR KIDNAPPING.
WELL, I ONLY
THOUGHT THAT...
SURE, TOMMY,
AND I APPRECIATE IT.
BUTTING IN
AGAIN, HUH?
HAVEN'T YOU CAUSED ENOUGH
TROUBLE FOR ONE DAY?
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO JACK ALONE.
OK, KIDS. BEAT IT.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
NOTHING, JOHNNIE,
EXCEPT THAT...
WELL...
ANGEL TOLD ME THE TRUTH ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON.
I SAID I WAS SORRY,
DIDN'T I?
I CALLED YOU A HEEL, BUT
I GUESS YOU'RE A HERO.
IS THIS A BUILDUP FOR
ANOTHER SOCK IN THE NOSE?
NO. I THINK
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
SURE. I AIN'T
A BAD GUY.
I TOLD YOU SO BEFORE.
I KNOW.
SO DID GRANDMA,
BUT I DIDN'T
BELIEVE IT TILL NOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON
I WANT TO STAY HERE...
YOU.
DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY?
WELL, UH,
THAT'S THAT.
UM, AS LONG AS YOU'RE ALL
CLEANED UP AND EVERYTHING,
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DRIVE ME TO TOWN?
I GOT SOME ERRANDS.
IT'S A DATE.
WELL, THEN YOU BETTER GRAB YOURSELF
SOME SUPPER, AND I'LL CHANGE.
15 MINUTES.
MIND?
UH-UH.
SAY, I KNOW A SPOT ON
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
WHERE NO CARS
EVER PASS.
SUPPOSE
WE PARK AND...
TALK.
WHAT FOR?
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
AIN'T THAT ENOUGH?
YEAH. IT'S A LOT, BUT
IT STARTS THE WRONG WAY.
HOW, THE WRONG WAY?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
OR WHO YOU ARE,
EXCEPT YOUR NAME,
AND MAYBE IT
ISN'T YOUR NAME.
YOU SOUND LIKE I WAS
PROPOSING MARRIAGE.
WHAT ARE YOU
PROPOSING?
OH, NOTHING
LIKE THAT.
OH.
WELL, YOU'RE
FRANK, ANYWAY.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
BE FRANK, TOO?
YOU WANT ME TO?
SURE.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE
A NICE-LOOKING MAN...
THANK YOU KINDLY.
WITH THE RIGHT HEART...
AHH.
BUT THE WRONG HEAD.
BECAUSE I TRY
TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU?
NOPE. BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.
YOU KNOW, I'M
FROM THE BIG CITY, TOO,
AND I'VE HEARD
A LOT OF LINES BEFORE.
AND SO IT'S UP TO ME TO
THINK OF A NEW LINE, HUH?
MM-HMM.
WOULDN'T HURT.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL THINK OF ONE.
I'LL BE WAITING.
HI, JACK!
HI, PEGGY!
HIYA, SPEED.
YOU GET SOME GAS.
I'M GOING OVER
TO THE HARDWARE STORE
TO SEE MR. HAYMAN
ON SOME BUSINESS.
BACK IN A MINUTE.
RIGHT.
FILL 'ER UP?
YEAH, WITH THE CHEAP.
OH, WHY DON'T YOU GET
SOME GOOD GAS THIS TIME
SO YOU CAN TRY OUT
MY NEW PUMP?
IF I EVER TRY TO PUT GOOD GASOLINE INTO
THIS JALOPY, SHE'D PROBABLY EXPLODE.
SAY, I'VE GOT SOME SWELL NEW OIL
OVER THERE, IF YOU CAN USE ANY.
JUST CAME IN.
YEAH? HOW MUCH?
30 CENTS.
30 CENTS?
THAT'S TOO MUCH.ENTS.
HEY, YOU GONNA
TAKE THAT IN?
I HEAR HE'S GOOD.
EH, IF HE
WERE ANY GOOD,
HE WOULDN'T BE
BARNSTORMING IN THE STICKS.
WELL, HE MUST BE PRETTY GOOD
IF THEY'RE GONNA GIVE $500
TO ANYBODY WHO CAN
STICK WITH HIM.
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
YEAH. I GUESS THAT IS A
LOT OF MONEY, ALL RIGHT.
Speed: THAT NOT ENOUGH
TO TEMPT ME, THOUGH.
NO?
SAY, I WOULDN'T GET IN THE
RING WITH THAT BIG, UGLY MOOSE
FOR $5,000 A ROUND.
"WILD BULL OF EUROPE."
HUH. LOOKS LIKE
A KILLER TO ME.
HMM? UM, ALL SET?
YEAH. SHE TOOK 8 GALLONS. THAT $1.28.
CHARGE IT.
SAY, JACK, THAT BILL
IS GETTING KIND OF HIGH.
OW ABOUT A LITTLE
ON THE ACCOUNT?
EH, WHAT ARE YOU
SQUAWKING ABOUT?
YOU'LL GET PAID...
SOMETIME.
OK.
I GUESS I CAN DO MY BIT
FOR PEGGY AND THE OLD LADY
TILL THINGS GET
BETTER FOR THEM.
THAT'S A NICE PUMP.
SAY, YOU DO PRETTY GOOD
AROUND HERE, DON'T YOU, SPEED?
OH, I CAN'T
COMPLAIN.
THAT'S ONE THING THEY
CAN'T SAY ABOUT THEM.
WHEN THEY GOT TO HAVE
GAS, THEY GOT TO HAVE GAS.
WHAT THIS PUMP SET YOU
BACK, ABOUT TWO GRAND?
JUST ABOUT, AND SAY, WHAT
A BIG IMPROVEMENT THAT IS
OVER THIS
OLD HAND PUMP.
LISTEN. I'M GOING ACROSS
THE STREET FOR A FEW MINUTES.
IF PEGGY COMES, TELL HER
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, HUH?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT BIG ENOUGH. YOU'RE TOO LIGHT.
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH IT IF I'M WILLING?
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
YOU. IT'S THE CUSTOMERS.
THEY DON'T PAY DOUGH
TO SEE SETUPS, YOU KNOW.
I'LL GIVE THAT GUY
PLENTY OF FIGHT.
LOOK. I'M HAVING
A FIGHT, NOT A MURDER.
GO ON.
SCRAM, WILL YOU?
I GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.
LISTEN. I WANT A CHANCE AT THAT MUG.
GO ON. SCRAM.
I'M BUSY.
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ME,
OR I'LL CLIP YOU.
OH, YOU WILL?
OOH!
COME ON. DO I GET
THAT FIGHT, OR DON'T I?
YEAH. YOU GET IT.
IT'LL BE A PLEASURE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?
YEAH. I THOUGHT THAT TAD
HAYMAN WOULD HELP US OUT
WITH AN ADVANCE
ON THE NEXT CROP,
BUT HE'S STRAPPED
ALL HIMSELF THIS YEAR.
EH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING.
YOUR TROUBLES
ARE OVER.
WE'RE GONNA OPEN
A GAS STATION.
A GAS STATION?
SURE.
WELL, HOW DID YOU
HAPPEN TO THINK OF THAT?
WELL, UM, UH,
STATISTICS.
YOU KNOW, THERE ISN'T A
GAS STATION ON OUR ROAD
42 MILES ONE WAY
AND 28 THE OTHER.
WHAT YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT A GAS STATI COSTS?
OH, I LOOKED
INTO THAT.
WELL, YOU HEAR ABOUT THE
BIG FIGHT THEY'RE HAVING
AT THE LEGION STADIUM
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
ABOUT THE PALOOKA THAT'S
OFFERING $500 A ROUND
FOR ANYBODY THAT WILL STICK
WITH HIM MORE THAN TWO ROUNDS?
YEAH. I READ
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
WELL, I'M GOING IN THERE AND FIGHT HIM.
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS STAND
ON MY FEET FOR 4 ROUNDS.
4 TIMES 500...
THAT'S 2,000 BUCKS.
WHY, IT'S
IN THE BAG.
OH, BUT, JACK,
YOU'RE CRAZY.
WHY, HE'S
A PROFESSIONAL FIGHTER.
YOU'D GET BADLY HURT.
AW, GEE, ANYBODY WHO WOULD STAND UP
AGAINST A FIGHTER LIKE THAT WOULD BE A...
A SUCKER?
YEAH, A SUCKER.
AND IF I DID GET HURT,
WOULD IT MATTER MUCH TO YOU?
YES, JACK, IT WOULD...
LOTS.
THAT'S ALL
I WANT TO KNOW.
WITH YOU ROOTING FOR ME,
I'LL GO IN THERE
AND BANG THE EARS OFF THE
BIGGEST GUY IN THE WORLD.
Tommy: COME ON.
KEEP ON HITTING HIM.
Dippy: HIT HIM
WITH A RIGHT, BOY.
RIGHT. RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT.
RIGHT! RIGHT!
OH, CUT IT OUT!
FLATTEN THAT GUY!
COME ON! KNOCK
HIS BRAIN OUT!
BEAT HIM UP!
OH, WHAT A FIGHTER!
YOU COULDN'T LAST
A HALF A ROUND
WITH FOOTWORK
LIKE THAT.
YOU COULDN'T STOP
A TRUCK MOVING THAT SLOW.
GO ON!
MOVE FAST! JUMP!
EH, WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT IT?
PLENTY, YOU BIG, FAT,
CLUMSY LUMMOX.
SO HOW'S YOUR WIND?
MY WIND?
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'LL FIND OUT
ABOUT THAT LATER.
GO ON NOW. HIT IT.
DON'T MAKE LOVE TO IT.
HIT IT, I TELL YOU.
HIT IT! THAT'S IT.
WORKING HARD?
YEAH. I KIND OF
LIKE IT.
WILL YOU BLOW, PEG?
I WISH YOU WOMEN WOULD
STOP AGGRAVATING THE CHAMP
WHILE HE'S WORKING OUT.
MIND YOUR OWN
BUSINESS, WILL YOU?
THAT IS MY BUSINESS,
TRAINING THE CHAMP.
YOUR
BUSINESS?
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU TRAINING HIM?
COME ON, JACK.
ABOUT 3 MORE MINUTES,
AND WE'LL BREAK.
Â¶ BY A WATERFALL Â¶
Â¶ I'M CALLING
YOU-OO-OO-OO Â¶
Â¶ BY A WATERFALL Â¶
HEY, HURRY UP WITH THAT
WATER, WILL YOU, YOU GUYS?
TAKE IT EASY, CARUSO.
YOU'LL LAST LONGER.
HOW'S THE WATER, CHAMP?
BRR. HOW DID YOU
GET IT SO HOT?
Â¶ BY A WATERFALL,
I'M CALLING YOU-OO-OO-OO Â¶
HEY, FELLAS! GET A
LOAD OF THIS, WILL YOU?
WHAT DO
YOU GOT, T?
I JUST WON 3 BUCKS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU JUST WON 3 BUCKS?
THE AMATEUR PICTURE CONTEST
IN THE "SALT LAKE TIMES."
HERE'S THE 3 BUCKS
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.
WELL, COME ON. SHOW US THE PICTURE.
WHERE IS IT?
YEAH, SURE.
COME ON. GET IT OUT THERE.
LOOK. RIGHT THERE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? IT'S JACK!
JACKIE.
HEY, JACKIE, LOOK.

WHEN DID YOU
TAKE THAT?
ONCE WHEN YOU
WASN'T LOOKING.
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO
LAY OFF OF THAT STUFF.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT TAKING MY PICTURE?
OH, WHAT HARM
DID I DO?
I OUGHT TO FLATTEN
YOU FOR THIS,
YOU DOUBLE-CROSSING,
LITTLE CHISELER.
AW, LAY OFF ME,
WILL YOU?
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.
I MADE 3 BUCKS, DIDN'T I?
EH, SHUT UP.
BUT LOOK AT THE WAY HE'S
GOT HIS RIGHT HAND STUCK OUT.
SO A GUY GETS UP
OUT OF HIS GRAVE,
STICKS OUT HIS RIGHT HAND
JUST SO YOU CAN MAKE THE PINCH
AND PROVE THAT ALL THE REST
OF US AROUND HERE ARE DOPES.
I TELL YOU, I GOT A HUNCH
THAT'S JOHNNIE BRADFIELD.
IT'LL TAKE ME MAYBE
A MONTH TO FIND OUT,
BUT IT'S
WORTH TRYING.
SWELL. TAKE TWO MONTHS. TAKE TWO YEARS.

PICTURE POSTCARDS.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA.
GO ON. LAUGH.
WELL, YOU'D LAUGH, TOO, PHELAN,
IF YOU KNEW HOW FUNNY YOU WERE.
MAYBE I WOULD.
MAYBE I'LL
LAUGH LATER.
"THESE GLOVES USED BY KID McNEIL
"WHEN HE KNOCKED OUT
SAILOR O'SHEA.
A BUY AT 8 BUCKS."
I'LL BET THAT'S
LUCKY LEATHER.
YEAH. WE COULD GET THEM FOR JACK
IF WE HAD
$7.60 MORE.
HA! IF MY AUNT HAD
WHISKERS, SHE'D BE MY UNCLE.
HA HA HA!

OH, IT AIN'T

HE'S BREAKING
MY HEART.
HEY,

HEY, WHAT KIND

WE'RE GONNA
PLAY POKER.
YOU KNOW HOW
TO PLAY POKER?
NO.
OH. WE COULD TEACH YOU
HOW. IT'S VERY EASY.
WE AIN'T GOT NO TIME
TO LEARN BEGINNERS.
Dippy: EH, HE'S
TOO YOUNG, ANYWAY.
BUT I'M 12,
AND I COULD LEARN.
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU SAY, GANG?
SHOULD WE
LET HIM IN?
Dippy: SURE. WHY NOT?
COME ON,
DOUGLAS.
STEP RIGHT OUT.
THAT'S THE WAY.
I'VE ONLY GOT
25 CENTS.
OH, THAT'S OK, KID.
YOU DON'T NEED NO DOUGH
TO PLAY STRIP POKER.
WHAT'S
STRIP POKER?
YOU'LL FIND OUT.
GIVE ME SOME CARDS, WOULD YOU?
GIVE US A COUPLE
OF GOOD ONES.
Douglas: I GOT
6, 7, 8, 9, AND 10.
ISN'T THAT ANY GOOD?
NOPE.
NOPE.
KEEP THE 10, SEE?
WE'LL TRY TO DRAW
SOMETHING BETTER.
HEY, DIPPY.

WHAT DO YOU
GOT, ANGEL?
I GOT A PAIR OF 7s.
OH, BUT MINE ARE
ALL THE SAME SUIT.
YEAH, YEAH, THEY ARE, BET

ANGEL'S PAIR OF 7s WINS.
OH, I SEE NOW.
YOU GOT
TO HAVE PAIRS.
SURE. YOU'LL
CATCH ON TO THIS.
YEP. DOUGLAS JR., NOW YOU CAN
TAKE OFF THE COAT AND BELT.
OH, YOU MEAN,
I LOSE, THEN?
YOU DON'T WIN.
WELL, MAYBE YOU'LL
WIN IT BACK NEXT HAND.
JUST PUT IT
OVER THERE.
Dippy: DON'T
GET IT WRINKLED.
YOU GET TO COME BACK ON
ANOTHER LITTLE HAND LATER.
HEY, COME ON.
HURRY UP. WE'RE TRYING
TO LEARN YOU SOMETHING.
COME ON. HURRY UP
WITH THEM CARDS.
Douglas: I GOT

I'M TAKING 3.
I GOT THEM.
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU GOT, TOMMY?
OH, JUST A MEASLY
PAIR OF TWOS.
I WIN, DON'T I?
NO. HE'S GOT TWOS.
YOU ONLY GOT ONES.
KEEP YOUR MITTS
OFF IT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, DOUGLAS.
YOU'RE LEARNING ALREADY.
NOW, THAT DIDN'T TAKE
LONG, DID IT, DARLING?
DOUGLAS!
WHY, WHAT
HAS HAPPENED?
DID YOU GET BY
ALL RIGHT?
HUH? YEAH.
DOCTOR SAID
I WAS 100% OK.
I HIT THE SCALE
AT 153.
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
IF I GET
IN THAT RING FIRST,
YOU'LL NEVER GET
A WHACK AT THAT GUY.
WISH I FELT
THAT WAY ABOUT IT.
IT'S FUNNY WHAT US GUYS
WILL DO FOR MONEY, ISN'T IT?
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU
FIGHTING FOR?
MY WIFE IS GONNA
HAVE A KID.
YEAH?
TOUGH RACKET,
AIN'T IT?
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.
GOT ANY GOOD SEATS LEFT
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT?
YEAH. I HAVE
A FEW LEFT.
WHERE ARE THEY?
HOW NEAR DO YOU
WANT THOSE?
CLOSE AS I CAN GET.
WELL, HOW ABOUT
A RINGSIDE?
FINE.
SAY, THIS GUY
JACK DORNEY,
IS HE A SOUTHPAW?
YOU CAN SEARCH
ME, MISTER.
THAT'LL BE
$3.30, PLEASE.
OK.
THANK YOU.
HEY, YOU THINK WE NEED SOME MORE CREEP?
NO, WE DON'T NEED
NO MORE CREPE.
YOU ASK ME,
YOU'RE A DEAD PIGEON.
WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE.
HEY, HE PASSED!
HE PASSED!
HE PASSED
THE MEDICAL EXAM.
HE PASSED
WITH FLYING COLORS.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
CY KIMBALL
JUST TOLD ME.
HE JUST DROVE BY
IN HIS TRUCK,
AND HE SAID THAT THE DOCTOR SAID
THAT IF JACK WAS ANY HEALTHIER,
HE COULDN'T LIVE.
HERE HE COMES.
COME ON.
TAKE YOUR PLACES.
Peggy: SURPRISE.
Spit: GO ON.
SIT DOWN.
NOW?
YEAH.
OK.
QUIET!
CHAMP, ON BEHALF
OF THE GANG AND MYSELF,
AND GRANDMA AND PEGGY,
WE TAKE THIS OCCASION
ON THE EVE OF THE BIG FIGHT
TO PRESENT YOU WITH THIS
LITTLE TOKEN OF OUR ESTEEM.
HERE.
SPEECH!
SPEECH, CHAMP.
LOOK. I'M SORRY
YOU DID THIS.
YOU SEE,
I CAN'T FIGHT.
THE DOC TURNED ME DOWN.
THERE'S SOMETHING THE MATTER
WITH MY TICKER.
COME ON, BOYS.
COME ON.
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH EVERYBODY?
THEY KNOW
YOU'RE LYING, JACK.
WHO, ME?
YOU PASSED THAT
MEDICAL EXAMINATION.
LISTEN, PEGGY. I TOLD YOU.
THE DOCTOR SAID THAT...
CY KIMBALL WAS HERE AND
TOLD US WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID.
ALL RIGHT.
SO I'M YELLOW.
YOU'RE NOT THAT,
EITHER.
I'M A LIAR,
AND I LOST MY NERVE.
LET IT GO AT THAT.
JACK, TELL ME
SOMETHING, WILL YOU?
WE'RE YOU LYING TO ME WHEN
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU LOVED ME?
NO. NO.
WELL, WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH IT?
EVERYTHING
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
LOVE SOMEONE,
YOU DON'T
LIE TO THEM.
YOU DON'T HOLD
ANYTHING BACK.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? HOLD WHAT BACK?
LISTEN.
LISTEN TO ME, JACK.
I LOVE YOU, TOO,
AND I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT A QUITTER.
THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE.
YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE.
SOMETHING ELSE
TURNED UP.
I HEARD ABOUT A SWELL JOB,
SEE, AND I WAS GONNA...
EH, WASN'T IT MY IDEA
ABOUT THE FIGHT?
WELL, I CHANGED
MY MIND, SEE?
THE GUY IS TOO BIG.
HE'S TOO TOUGH.
I'M NO SUCKER, SEE?
WHY SHOULD I GET
MY HEAD KNOCKED OFF
WHEN I CAN GET THE DOUGH SOME OTHER WAY?
THAT'S ALL
THERE IS TO IT.
LEAVE ME ALONE,
CAN'T YOU?
JACK.
WILL YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?
HE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THAT
STUMBLEBUM HE'S SUPPOSED TO FIGHT,
AND HE GAVE UP,
THAT'S ALL.
HE LOST HIS NERVE.
Angel: YEAH. THEY GET
THAT WAY SOMETIMES.
Dippy: NOT IF THEY
GOT WHAT IT TAKES.
NO MOXIE.
NO MOXIE.
Spit: BOY,
IS THAT GUY CHICKEN.
SHUT UP.
JACK AIN'T AFRAID
OF NOBODY, SEE?
OH, NO.
JACK AIN'T AFRAID.
NOT MUCH, HE AIN'T.
SHUT UP!
OH, LEAVE
THE KID ALONE.
SURE,
HE'S AFRAID.
QUIT LIKE
A YELLOW DOG.
WHAT A SLUG, BLAMING IT ON HIS TICKER.
JACK.
GOING AWAY, JACK?
WHY?
OH, NOTHING.
IF YOU ARE, WELL...
WHAT I SAID ABOUT GOING
WITH YOU STILL GOES.
FORGET IT, KID.
NOBODY GOES WITH ME.
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE...
I DON'T NEED NOBODY.
I...
I TRAVEL ALONE.
YEAH.
YEAH, SURE, JACK.
IT DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE TO ME
WHAT THE KIDS
AND THE WOMEN SAY.
I KNOW YOU AIN'T
AFRAID OF THAT GUY.
NO, I AIN'T
AFRAID OF HIM.
YOU AIN'T AFRAID OF
ANYBODY. I KNOW THAT.
SHUT UP.
STOP TALKING ABOUT IT.
DON'T GET
EXCITED, JACK.
WHAT I WANTED
TO SAY WAS
THAT IF YOU
MADE UP YOUR MIND...
YEAH.
I MADE UP MY MIND.
YOU MUST HAVE
YOUR REASONS.
SURE, I GOT
MY REASONS.
I SUPPOSE THAT'S OK,
IF THAT'S HOW YOU
FEEL ABOUT IT.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL
YOU IS THAT I'M WITH YOU
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ME.
EH, WHO'S
GOING AWAY?
YOU AIN'T GOING?
I'M GONNA
STAY RIGHT HERE.
YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT WAS A RIB.
IT WAS A RIB. I KNEW
IT WAS ALL THE TIME.
BOY, WAIT TILL
I TELL THE GUYS.
ATTABOY. YOU TELL THEM. TELL THEM ALL!
WHAT DO YOU SAY, FATHER?
SUPPOSE THAT DICK DIDN'T
SEE NO SOUTHPAW IN THE RING.
HE WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
IT WAS JOHNNIE BRADFIELD,
WOULD HE?
HAVE YOUR TICKETS
READY.
HE'S GOT
THE TICKETS.
I'M WITH HIM.
TICKETS.
TICKETS.
TICK...
TICKETS.
HEY! THERE'S
ONLY TWO HERE.
WHERE'S THE OTHERS
FOR THEM?
WHO'S THEM?
THERE'S ONLY TWO OF ME.
THAT'S ALL.
JIM, WATCH THAT GATE.
SURE.
OVER THERE.
THAT'S WHERE...
GOOD SEATS OVER THERE.
HEY, YOU FELLAS!
Angel: HEY, WHAT'S
EATING YOU, MISTER?
YOU AIN'T
GOT NO TICKET.
HEY, WHO AIN'T
GOT A TICKET?
WHAT'S THAT, WOOD?
COMING THROUGH.
HEY, FELLAS.
HEY, ARE THESE
THE GUYS I'M GONNA FIGHT?
YEAH. SHAKE HANDS
WITH THE BOYS.
HE DON'T
SHAKE HANDS.
HE'LL SHOW THEM PLENTY
OF HANDS IN THE RING.
HEY, COME HERE, YOU.
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.
ALL RIGHT.
SAY, WAIT
A MINUTE.
WE AIN'T
IN THE RING YET.
HE'S ONLY KIDDING.
COME HERE.
COME OVER HERE. WHAT'S
THE MATTER? YOU SCARED?
NOPE.
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF ANYBODY.
ATTABOY.
HEY, TAKE IT EASY,
WILL YOU?
HE'S ONLY KIDDING. HE'S
JUST A BIG BABY, THAT'S ALL.
HEY, YOU. COME HERE.
WHAT'S YOUR WEIGHT?
GET YOUR SMEARY
HANDS OFF ME.
I KNOW THAT RACKET.
OH, YOU'RE
A FIGHTER, EH?
I'M NO FIGHTER.
WHAT DID YOU COME UP
HERE TO FIGHT ME FOR?
I SEEN YOUR PICTURE
IN THE PAPER,
AND I COULDN'T WAIT
TO GET YOU ALONE.
OH, YEAH?
GO AWAY.
COME HERE. CUT IT OUT. WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU GUYS?
I'LL TAKE HIM FIRST.
GO ON. GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
NOW THAT GUY WILL CUT YOU
TO PIECES IN ONE ROUND.
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK.
BOO! BOO! BOO!
WHAT A STUMBLEBUM!
ALL SET.
THEY'RE READY.
SWELL.
NOT YOU, KID.
HE CHANGED HIS MIND.
COME ON, KALUTCHEE.
HURRY UP. THEY'RE WAITING ON YOU.
I CATCH ON. HE TRYING TO GET MY GOAT.
SOFTEN HIM UP
FOR ME, KID.
COME ON, LYNCH. WE'RE
GONNA NEED YOU UP THERE.
HE'S MAKING ME
WAIT, TOO.
SURE.
HE'S AFRAID OF YOU.
THINK SO? REALLY?
SURE.
I'LL BOX
HIS EARS OFF.
COME ON.
SIT DOWN, WILL YOU?
RELAX.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THE WIFE?
I'LL STAY IN THERE TILL I
GET THAT HOSPITAL BILL PAID,
OR I'LL... GO ON. SIT DOWN, WILL YOU?
BUCK UP. BUCK UP.
WONDER HOW KALUTCHEE
IS DOING.
WE'LL FIND OUT
PRETTY SOON.
WELL, THE BULL AIN'T
AFRAID OF FELLAS LIKE HIM.
HE AIN'T AFRAID
OF HITTERS.
HE'S AFRAID
OF BOXERS.
SURE.
DON'T LET HIM
WORRY YOU, KID.
OH, HE AIN'T
WORRYING ME.
WHAT'S THAT?
MUST BE KALUTCHEE.
THINK SO?
SURE.
SEE? SEE?
THAT'S WHAT HE GETS
FOR COMING IN.
HE SHOULD STAY
AWAY FROM HIM.
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO,
UNLESS YOU TAKE HIM FIRST, EH?
YOU WANT TO LET HIM
COME INTO YOU, EH?
BOX HIM. BOX HIM.
SPEAR HIM.
SPEAR HIM GOING AWAY.
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA
DO... BOX HIS EARS OFF,
UNLESS YOU
TAKE HIM FIRST.
NEXT COMING UP.
LISTEN.
WHERE KALUTCHEE?
JUST TOOK HIM AWAY.
ALL
BUSTED UP.
YOU SEE? YOU SEE?
THAT'S WHAT HE GETS
FOR COMING IN.
YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW.
OK. OK. LET'S GO.
NO, NOT YOU, KID.
HE WANTS SMITH.
WHO, ME?
STILL TRYING
TO GET MY GOAT, EH?
ALL SET, KID?
WELL, YEAH, BUT,
WELL, NO.
I'VE ONLY GOT
ONE HAND BANDAGED.
OK. WE'LL TAPE THE
OTHER ONE IN THE RING.
COME ON.
WELL, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
NOW, AREN'T YOU, DORNEY?
ARE YOU TURNING CHICKEN?
ME? I'LL BOX
HIS EARS OFF.
HIS EARS ARE UPSTAIRS. COME ON.
Johnnie:
GOOD LUCK, KID.
RIGHT TO THE JAW,
A LEFT TO THE FACE.
BOY, IS HE A KILLER.
IS HE MURDEROUS.
THE BULL LANDS A TERRIFIC RIGHT
TO SMITH'S JAW, AND SMITH IS DOWN.
YOU CAN FORGIVE SMITH IF HE STAYS
DOWN BECAUSE THIS IS DOWNRIGHT MURDER.
SMITH'S FACE IS RED PULP,
RED, RED, PULP.
AND SMITH IS OUT.
PHEW. AM I GLAD THAT'S OVER.
NOW, THE NEXT FIGHTER

PIPE DOWN!
PIPE DOWN, YOURSELF.
GET LOST,

RUTCHEK IS WORKING DORNEY
ACROSS THE RING.
HE RIPS A TERRIFIC RIGHT
TO DORNEY'S HEART
AND DRIVES DORNEY
UP AGAINST THE ROPES.
"JACK WILL KNOCK
HIS EARS BACK."
HA!
THAT'S IT, JACK!
CUT HIM! CUT HIM, JACK!

COMING AROUND THE CORNER.
THE BULL IS RIGHT AFTER HIM.
HE JABS WITH HIS LEFT.
HE SENDS DORNEY'S HEAD BACK.
HE LANDS A TERRIFIC RIGHT
TO DORNEY'S JAW,
COMES THROUGH
WITH A LEFT TO THE JAW,
AND ANOTHER HARD RIGHT
TO THE HEART.
AND DORNEY IS DOWN.
ON YOUR FEET,
JACKIE, ME BOY!

FINISH HIM UP THIS
TIME, KID. FINISH HIM.
YOU CAN BET THIS ROUND.
HE AIN'T BEGUN THE FIGHT.

I'M WAITING.
EH, PUT A ZIPPER
ON THE TRAP, WILL YOU?
NOW GET HIM!
THERE GOES THE BULL AGAIN.
HE'S GOT DORNEY
BACKED INTO A CORNER.
RIPS LEFTS AND RIGHTS
TO THE BODY.
LIFTS DORNEY OFF HIS FEET
WITH A TERRIFIC RIGHT UPPERCUT.
THERE HE GOES. DORNEY IS DOWN
FROM A TERRIFIC RIGHT TO THE JAW.
GET UP, JACKIE!
GET UP!
DO YOU HEAR ME?
DIDN'T I HEAR SOMEONE SAY
SHE TRAINED THAT PALOOKA?
HA!
HE'S UP! HE'S UP!
BUT NOT FOR LONG.
GO AFTER HIM
WITH YOUR LEFT, YOU...
OH. I'M...
JACK, I COULD MAKE A
GREAT FIGHTER OUT OF YOU
IF THAT GUY
DON'T KILL YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I'LL NEED A MANAGER OR NOT.
THIS IS ONLY COSTING US 1,500 BUCKS.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S HAY, YOU DOPE?
WELL, THE BELL
SAVED HIM.
"THE BELL
SAVED HIM."
IF YOU HAD TAKEN HIM IN THE FIRST ROUND,
THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NO BELLS.
HOW'D YOU LIKE
TO FIGHT?
THIS GOES
ONE MORE ROUND,
YOU'LL PAY, SWEETHEART, NOT ME.
AH!
JACK! YOU'RE
STANDING AROUND!
BUT HE FALLS
ALL RIGHT.
YOU AIN'T GONNA LET
THAT BIG PALOOKA LICK YOU,
ARE YOU, JOHNNIE?
COME ON.
QUIT STALLING.
STICK OUT THAT RIGHT
AND SIC THAT LEFT.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
SOUTHPAW.
YOU AIN'T FOOLING ME.
Referee:
SOUTHPAW, HUH?
YEAH!
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
AW, PIPE DOWN.
SAY THAT AGAIN.
PIPE DOWN.
GOOD BOY, JACK.

ATTABOY, JACK.
ATTABOY.
WE GOT THE DOUGH NOW.
YOU CAN QUIT.
NOT YET.
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ALL
CUT UP, JACK,
AND WE DON'T NEED
ANY MORE DOUGH.
WE STILL NEED SOME MORE.
GO ON. SCRAM. SCRAM.
BUT, JACK,

KID IS HARD

OF THIS.
Man: COME ON!
GET UP, JACK,

PLEASE GET UP!
WHAT YOU THINK, DOC?
WELL, HE TOOK A PRETTY BAD BEATING,
BUHE'LL COME OUT
OF IT ALL RIGHT.
JACK. JACK.
JACK, ARE YOU

HOW IS HE,
DOCTOR?
JUST ABOUT
THE SAME.
OH, JACK!
GET UP, DO YOU HEAR? GET UP!
DID YOU TRY VINEGAR?
WE'VE DONE
ALL WE CAN FOR HIM.
WELL, YOU AIN'T
GOING TO DO MUCH
WITH THAT SILLY LITTLE
TIN EAR TRUMPET, YOU KNOW?
Peggy: OH, JACK!
COME OUT OF IT, PLEASE!
OH, JACKIE.
JACKIE, COME OUT OF IT.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN. OH, HE DID IT
ALL FOR US.
HE WENT OUT
AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED
JUST FOR US.
OH, JACKIE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
WE GOT THE MONEY.
OH, MY HEAD.
GO AHEAD, JOHNNIE.
JACK'S THE NAME.
WHO'S HE?
OH, HE'S JUST
A FRIEND OF MINE.
OH, BOY.
YOU FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT.
YOU KNOW YOU DID.
WHAT A FIGHT!
YEAH, SO I SAYS,
"WHO'S GOT A BETTER RIGHT
IN THERE BUT HIS BROTHER?"
HOW YOU FEELING,
JACK?
I FEEL FINE.
THERE.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
JUST A LITTLE WINDED,
THAT'S ALL.
GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE
WITH THAT GORILLA,
AND HE'D TAKE HIM,
WOULDN'T YOU, JACK?
I, UH,
I GOT TO GO NOW.
GO?
I MEAN, UH,
I GOT TO GET DRESSED.
COME ON NOW, BOYS. COME
ON. GET OUT OF HERE.
SEE YOU
AT THE RANCH, JACK.
GO ON! GO ON! GO ON!
I'LL WAIT
OUTSIDE FOR YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
GO ON. I'LL CALL YOU.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
COME ON. GET DRESSED.
I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU, PHELAN.
JACK, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT NOW?
YEAH. I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.
WILL YOU WAIT
JUST A SECOND, PHELAN?
I GOT TO TELL
PEGGY SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT.
MAKE IT SNAPPY.
COME ON. I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU, PEGGY.
NO KIDDING. HE'S BOOKED A COUPLE
OF FIGHTS FOR ME BACK EAST.
HE'S MY MANAGER.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS
TO IT. HONEST.
YOU'RE LYING TO ME,
AREN'T YOU, JACK?
NO, NO.
HE'S LYING TO ME, ISN'T
HE? TELL ME THE TRUTH.
NO. HONEST, I'M NOT. HE'S
MY MANAGER, AREN'T YOU?
SURE,
I'M HIS MANAGER.
YOU SEE, HE'S GONNA
TAKE ME BACK EAST,
AND HE'S GOT A LOT
OF BOUTS LINED UP FOR ME.
I'M GONNA PICK UP
SOME EASY CASH,
THEN I'M GONNA
COME RIGHT BACK TO YOU.
HONEST, I AM.
IN ABOUT
10 YEARS.
UH, HE'S JUST CLOWNING,
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL HE EVER DOES.
ANYTHING FOR A GAG.
MAYBE IF HE BEHAVES HIMSELF REAL GOOD,
YOU'LL SEE HIM
SOONER.
YOU KNOW, HE WANTS ME TO
GO ON A BARNSTORMING TOUR.
YOU KNOW, ONE-NIGHT STANDS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
BUT NONE OF THAT
FOR ME.
I'M COMING
RIGHT BACK TO YOU.
I'M GOING WITH YOU.
NO, NO. YOU CAN'T.
YES.
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE...
BECAUSE, WELL,
THIS IS A STAG. HUH?
WE'RE GOING STAG,
AREN'T WE, PHELAN?
HUH? YEAH. NO WOMEN.
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG, JACK.
WHAT IS IT?
TELL ME, PLEASE.
NO. THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING WRONG.
I'M COMING
RIGHT BACK TO YOU.
I SWEAR I AM.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE
DONE ANYTHING WRONG, HONEY.
I'M STICKING
WITH YOU.
YOU GOT TO STICK WITH
GRANDMA AND THE KIDS.
COME ON, SON.
WE GOT TO GET GOING.
I WON'T GO TO THE
STATION WITH YOU, JACK...
IF YOU'LL JUST KISS ME
ONCE AND THEN GO QUICKL
BECAUSE
IF YOU DON'T,
I'M GONNA MAKE
AN AWFUL MESS OF IT.
TAKE ME WITH YOU, JACK.
TAKE ME WITH YOU, JACK!
YOU KNOW, PHELAN, YOU WOULD
HAVE MADE A GREAT DETECTIVE
IF YOU HAD
STARTED SOONER.
WELL, I'M NOT
COMPLAINING.
DON'T KNOW WHY
TODAY I'M NOT.
SURE, SURE.
WHEN YOU GET BACK
TO TOWN,
THE MAYOR WILL PROBABLY
GIVE YOU A RIDE DOWN BROADWAY
WITH CONFETTI
AND EVERYTHING.
YOU'LL PROBABLY
BE A BIG SHOT
IN HEADQUARTERS
FROM NOW ON.
YOU SAID IT.
SAY, KID, WE GOT TO
TRAVEL TOGETHER FOR 3 DAYS.
CAN I DEPEND ON YOU?
DON'T WORRY. I WON'T
GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE.
OK. COME ON.
SIT DOWN.
HELLO, JACK.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"HELLO?"
GO ON HOME.
GOING AWAY?
NOW GO ON.
BEAT IT, KID.
WE DON'T NEED YOU
AROUND HERE.
WHO'S TALKING
TO YOU?
HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO COME WITH YOU?
I TOLD YOU,
GO HOME.
YEAH, BUT YOU SHOULD TAKE ME WITH YOU.
I YOU
TO GO HOME!
MR. PHELAN AND I
HAVE GOT A DEAL ON,
AND IT'S KIND OF PRIVATE.
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU
WITH ME, BUT I... I CAN'T.
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
AIN'T IT SO?
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW GO ON AWAY, KID.
YOU SEE,
YOU GOT TO GO BACK
AND GET THAT
GAS STATION STARTED.
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
THAT KID KIND OF
THINKS YOU'RE THE WORKS.
YEAH.
HE'S A GOOD KID.
WELL, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME, SEE?
I'M A COP.
I GOT TO DO MY DUTY.
I KNOW.
WHETHER I LIKE IT
OR NOT.
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU DON'T.
I'LL GIVE YOU
ONE TIP.
WHAT?
MAGEE WAS SLUGGED
WITH A RIGHT HAND.
YEAH?
YEAH.
IF YOU GET YOURSELF
A GOOD LAWYER,
YOU MIGHT
CLEAR THAT UP,
YOU BEING A SOUTHPAW
AND ALL THAT.
IF I GET A GOOD LAWYER.
WELL, NOT THAT IT'S
ANY BUSINESS OF MINE.
HERE SHE IS NOW.
WELL, LET'S GO.
THAT'S
A SWELL-LOOKING DAME
YOU'RE LEAVING
BEHIND, KID.
I FEEL KIND OF SORRY
FOR HER.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
THAT GUY I SENT OUT,
THE GUY THEY BURNED?
HE HAD A WIFE.
WHEN THAT DAME SAID
GOOD-BYE TO YOU,
SHE LOOKED
JUST LIKE HER.
HER MOUTH
ALL TWISTED UP LIKE
FROM THE HURT
INSIDE.
THAT OLD LADY
AND ALL THE KIDS.
THEY SURE THINK YOU'RE THE
WHITE-HAIRED BOY, DON'T THEY?
LOOK, PHELAN.
I'M GOING BACK
AND TAKE WHATEVER
IS COMING TO ME,
BUT THIS SORT OF STUFF
AIN'T INCLUDED, SEE?
OH, I WAS JUST THINKING
A SMART GUY LIKE YOU...
IF YOU HADN'T LAID YOURSELF WIDE OPEN
FOR A DAME
AND THEM KIDS,
I'D NEVER
HAVE FOUND YOU.
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE
SUCKER.
YOU'RE TELLING ME?
BUT I'D DO IT
AGAIN, SEE?
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
LAY OFF OF ME?
WELL, I MADE ONE
MISTAKE IN MY LIFE.
SAY, MAYBE
I'M MAKING ANOTHER.
MAYBE I GOT
THE WRONG GUY.
MAYBE...
YEAH. MAYBE YOU HAVE,
WISE GUY.
I'M NOT QUITE SURE.
Man: ALL ABOARD.
GO ON, KID. BEAT IT!
AND, SAY, KEEP THAT KISSER
OF YOURS OUT OF THE CAMERA.
YOU NEVER
PHOTOGRAPH GOOD!
SO LONG, DORNEY!
SO LONG!
SUCKER.
TOMMY!
YOU DARN FOOL KID.
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?
WITH YOU.
THEN COME ON.
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
TURNER ENTERTAINMENT GROUP
CAPTIONED BY THE NATIONAL
CAPTIONING INSTITUTE www. ncicap. org...
Gentlemen of the jury, have you decided on your verdict?
We have.
The prisoner will rise.
Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty of willful murder?
According to the evidence, we have no choice but to find the prisoner not guilty so do we all find and may god forgive us.
Prisoner, at the bar and you have heard the verdict.
Under the law, no other verdict is possible.
Yet, it is undoubtedly a gross miscarriage of justice.
It is deplorable,
Professor Moriarty, that a man of your intellectual attainments should be standing in the prisoner's box charged with a crime of murder.
And in setting you free,
I cannot in my conscience exonerate you.
Let the prisoner be discharged.
Let me in, let me in.
My Lord, my lord,
I have important new evidence.
You come too late,
Mr. Holmes.
The prisoner has been discharged.
But my lord, you can't let Moriarty go free.
He killed Loray.
I can prove it.
I can destroy his alibi.
That alibi has been established by three hundred fellows of the Royal Society.
Your lordship, my client has been acquitted.
He cannot be tried twice for the same charge.
Oh there you are, Holmes.
I'm afraid you have a bad opinion of me.
On the contrary, I hold you in the highest esteem but only as a maid.
It's gratifying to know that one's talents are appreciated by such a distinguished connoisseur.
May I give you a lift?
Cabs are scarce in this rain.
Thank you.
Two twenty one
Bakers Street.
Very good, sir.
After you, my dear Holmes.
By no means,
I prefer that you precede me at all times.
Such a creature of habit you are.
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.
I admire it.
I admire it so much
I'd like to present it pickled in alcohol to the
London Medical Society.
That would make an interesting exhibit.
Holmes, you only now barely missed sending me to the gallows.
You're the one man in England clever enough to defeat me.
The situation has become impossible.
Have you any suggestions?
I'm gonna break you Holmes.
I'm going to bring out right under your nose the most incredible crime of the century and you'll never suspect it until it's too late.
That will be the end of you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
And when I've beaten and ruined you then I can retire in peace.
I'd like to retire, crime no longer amuses me.
I'd like to devote my remaining years to abstract science.
Well here, we are at my lodgings.
I'm so sorry
I can't ask you in.
Good night,
Professor Moriarty.
Good night.
I was just coming in when you rang, sir.
Well there you are, Dawes.
Mr. Bassick is here, sir.
I'll see him at once.
Come to me as soon as he's gone, Dawes.
There's something
I want to say to you.
Yes sir.
Well Bassick.
Don't that bloke ever stop.
That music gives me the creeps.
Does it Bassick?
I rather like it.
I want you to post that letter at the box at
Portland Square just a few minutes before twelve.
Then drive directly to your lodgings by way of Oxford Service.
Wait there till
I send for you.
That's all.
First, I want to know what I'm getting into.
You have your orders.
That's enough.
I have a right to know the layout in case there's trouble.
I'll take care of that.
That's what you promised Higgins in that Emosmith job.
Oh poor Higgins.
They found nothing but his boots.
One boot.
You know, Bassick,
Higgins was a valuable man and a clever craftsman.
But he had your unfortunate habit of asking too many questions and now all that's left of him is one boot.
Don't take me wrong, Professor.
I'll do what you tell me right enough.
I'm sure you will, Bassick, and just to prove how I trust you
I'm going to tell you my plan although you haven't the imagination to appreciate its subtlety.
My whole success depends upon a peculiarity of Holmes brain, its perpetual restlessness.
Its constant struggle to escape boredom.
Holmes again?
Always Holmes until the end.
He's like a spoiled boy who picks watches to pieces but loses interest in one toy as soon as he's given another.
So I'm presenting the ingenious but fickle
Mr. Holmes with two toys, in the order in which
I mean him to have them.
The first, that letter.
If I know Mr. Holmes that will interest him very little, after this comes to fascinate and tantalize his imagination.
Blimey, what it mean?
That is what I'm depending upon to absorb
Mr. Holmes' interest while I'm engaged elsewhere.
I'll give him a toy to delight his heart so full of bizarre complications that he'll forget all about the first toy, that letter.
What you know it, Professor?
The germ of a crime, Bassick, a truly great crime, a crime that will stir the empire, that children will read about in their history books and you're going to be part of it, Bassick.
Off with you now.
You wanted to see me, sir?
I'm away for a few weeks, Dawes, and I come back to find my emfurium magenta, my incomparable emfurium magenta withered, ruined.
I can't understand it, sir.
I take good care of all the plants.
Did you water them?
Every day, sir, just as you told me, sir.
Then how did it happen that I find a spider's web spun across the spout of a watering can?
That can happen overnight, sir.
Overnight, uh.
Then you didn't water them today.
There has been so much to do, sir, preparing for your coming back and all.
Nothing is as important as the care of my flowers.
Through your neglect this flower has died.
You murdered the flower.
I'm sorry, sir.
And to think that for merely murdering a man
I was incarcerated for six whole weeks in a filthy prison cell.
A pity, sir.
A travesty on justice.
Quite so, sir.
But for this crime, Dawes, you should be flogged, broken on the wheel, drawn and quartered.
Yes sir, will that be all sir?
And boiled in oil.
Thank you, sir.
Go away.
Yes, sir.
Well Billy, when you finish sweeping you can dust.
Yes ma'am.
Well good morning,
Dr. Watson.
Good morning, Mrs. Hudson.
Is Mr. Holmes in?
Go right up doctor.
Ah good.
Is he busy?
Well you might say he was busy and then again, you might say he was not busy.
Huh?
Say he was busy, not say he was busy.
Well, well, well, well Billy.
That's a fetchy little froth that you're wearing.
Mrs. Hudson made me put it in, sir.
I was afraid Mr. Holmes or you would see me.
I think it's very becoming.
Come in, Watson.
I trust I don't come inopportunely.
My dear fellow as if you ever could.
Come on pull up a chair.
As a matter of fact, you're just in time to help me decide a matter that is certainly delicate and possibly of the greatest importance.
Of course, anything I can do.
I received this note last night.
My dearest Mr. Holmes.
I'm taking the liberty of calling on you at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning.
That's very soon now, to ask you what may appear a silly question whether or not I should go to a garden party on Saturday of Lady Conynghams.
I beg you to see me.
I'm in desperate need of advice.
Sincerely yours,
Ann Brandon.
What you make of it, Watson?
Somebody's pulling your leg.
No, no, no.
I checked on the young lady.
She lives in town with her brother.
She's very rich, mining fortune.
Her father died somewhat mysteriously about ten years ago.
As for
Miss Brandon's dilemma,
Lady Conyngham is imminently respectable but she gives the kind of parties that one comes away from with a feeling that one hasn't been anywhere.
Oh, how can you trifle with such inconsequentiality when Moriarty's lose on London?
My dear Watson, you astound me.
It's the very inconsequentiality of Miss Brandons message that engages my interest.
And Moriarty, what of him?
I've taken the most efficient steps of keeping in touch with Moriarty.
You're having him followed.
Oh don't be so crude, Watson.
Well what are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing?
My dear Watson you needn't check me back as if I didn't have a voice
I said nothing.
That's the best thing
I can possibly do at the moment.
Moriarty is as curious about my movement as I am about his so I sit here and wait for him to come to me
And he'll come, never doubt it.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
So, you fiddle while Rome burns.
A daring metaphor Watson.
And what are you doing with that inferno fiddle, with those flies.
I was observing the reaction on the common housefly of the chromatic scale.
A brilliant experiment.
Yes it will be, if I can find a note that annoys the housefly then might need only play that one note and all the houseflies disappear.
Amazing.
No, no, no.
Elementary, my dear Watson, purely elementary.
I expect that will be the young lady.
On the contrary,
I suggest an elderly gentlemen perhaps a touch of gout in his right leg.
Sir Ronald, I'm delighted to see you.
How do you do, Holmes?
Let me take your hat and stick.
Oh thank you.
I don't think you know
Dr. Watson, do you?
Watson, this is
Ronald Ramsgate,
Constable of the town London where all he has to do is to keep his eyes on the crowned jewels.
How do you do, sir?
Holmes has often spoken of you, Dr. Watson.
You haven't dropped in like this for a long time,
Sir Ronald.
Won't you sit down and have a cup of tea.
Thank you no, no.
I've come to consult you on a rather peculiar matter.
Now just have a look at that.
Doesn't it strike you that the handwriting is...
Yes, yes.
That's because it's written with a left hand.
Star of Delhi will never reach the Tower of London.
Huh.
Curious, and anonymous.
And what is the star of Delhi?
Probably the largest emerald in the worid, a gift to her majesty from the Maharajah Rapur.
Oh, I shouldn't worry about this, Sir Ronald.
It's a typical crank letter besides no professional thief would risk stealing so famous an emerald.
You can't break it up.
He certainly couldn't sell it as it is.
Perhaps not but in my position of trust
I can't afford to take any chances.
I wonder whether you could possibly manage to be on hand when the jewel is delivered.
Now when will that be?
This weekend.
It's coming on the
Cruiser Invincible.
Oh, Sir Ronald, even though I'm convinced that the threat means nothing and that a routine police guard would be quite adequate, you can depend on me.
Thank you.
Now I feel sure the jewel will be safe.
Little enough to do for you, Sir Ronald.
Excuse me.
I don't know what you must think of me but I'm sure I was followed here.
You are Miss Brandon?
Yes.
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
Yes, I know.
Let me introduce you to my associate, Dr. Watson.
How do you do?
Sir Ronald Ramsgate.
Mr. Holmes, I, I...
Well, I've got what I wanted, so I think I'll be going along.
Good day, Miss Brandon.
Goodbye doctor.
Goodbye, Sir Ronald.
Your hat and stick Sir Ronald
Thank you.
I'm depending on you.
I'll not fail you.
I'm sure of it.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye.
Yes, Miss Brandon?
I shouldn't have written you as I did Mr. Holmes and then burst in, in this melodramatic way but I had to see you.
It doesn't matter,
Miss Brandon.
There's no more resolutely informal household in all of
London than mine.
You're very kind.
Not at all, only I don't understand why you wish to consult me about a garden party.
You couldn't possibly find a worse guide to social etiquette.
It's because my brother and Gerald Hunter he's the family solicitor.
He insist on my going and I don't want to.
I don't want to.
Yes but how should I know how to advise you,
Miss Brandon.
Perhaps you should do as your brother and family solicitor suggest.
Lady Conyngham is imminently respectable.
Oh Mr. Holmes,
I'm so frightened.
What are you frightened about, Miss Brandon?
Murder.
Sit down, Miss Brandon.
Now suppose you tell us all about it.
Well this came for my brother, Lloyd, in the post two days ago.
Hmm.
This seems to be a field day for crank messages.
Look at that, Watson.
Huh?
Curious.
May the eleventh, that's today.
My father received just such a note before he was murdered.
Murdered?
Murdered.
Ten years ago on
May the eleventh.
Scotland Yard couldn't make anything of it but I saw him, my father, lying there on the pavement with the back of his head all...
Now tell me,
Miss Brandon, do you associate
May the 11th with anything else besides your father's death,
I mean, perhaps with some other incident in your family history?
No, no nothing.
My family has no history.
My father was a self-made man.
I see.
Oh Mr. Holmes, you must save my brother.
Don't let them kill him as they did my father.
Jerrold?
It was very wrong for you to come here, Ann, after I expressly asked you not to.
No more so than for you to follow me.
Where's the paper you took off my desk?
Here in my hand and I'll keep it until I find out what it means.
I apologize for the intrusi髇, gentlemen.
My name is Hunter.
I'm a legal representative for
Miss Brandon's brother.
That note was placed confidentially in my keeping.
It's of no concern to anybody except
Mr. Brandon and myself.
Murder is a concern of every right-minded person, Mr. Hunter.
You make too much of a trifle.
There's is nothing trifling about murder.
Miss Brandon fears this drawing may be a threat.
Oh, she's been reading too many novels.
It's merely some kind of joke or the word of a mental incompetent.
Isn't it true, Mr. Hunter, that Miss Brandon's father received such a drawing before he was killed?
Since my client attaches no significance to that, Mr. Holmes,
I don't see why you should.
It's pure coincidence.
Yes.
But it would be unfortunate if the coincidence turned into a tragedy, wouldn't it?
That is our responsibility,
Mr. Holmes.
I regret that you've been troubled.
I'll send you a check for your fee.
As of yet there is no fee.
I haven't accepted the case.
You see, Ann, you've only made yourself ridiculous.
Well, if Mr. Holmes won't help me
I'll go to Scotland Yard.
Don't you trust me, Ann?
But Jerrold there's too much at stake.
My brother's life.
Darling, you must trust me.
If you don't what's to happen to us?
I don't know, Jerrold.
I can't think.
I've decided to accept your case, Miss Brandon.
I shall help you all I can.
Oh thank you.
We don't want your interference, Mr. Holmes.
I interfere whenever and wherever
I like, Mr. Hunter.
I think you better go, Jerrold.
Come with me.
No.
Very well if that's how you want it.
Good day, gentlemen.
Am I being very foolish, Mr. Holmes?
I don't think so.
May I keep that note?
Yes, of course.
It struck me that
Mr. Hunter behaved rather curiously.
Yes.
He's my fiance.
I understand that.
You have no idea what kind of bird this is supposed to be, have you?
I don't know anything about birds.
I noticed that it isn't just a bird.
It's a definite kind of bird.
I think it belongs to the
Procellariiformes family.
We should go to the Kensington
Museum and look him up and I'd like you to come with me, Miss Brandon.
Oh yes, yes of course, anything you say.
Come in, Billy.
Yes, Mr. Holmes?
Now Billy, I'd be obliged if you'd take this young lady down to Mrs. Hudson and give her a cup of tea.
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
Then Billy I want you to get me a cab.
I know sir.
Not the first, not the second cab in the line but the third.
I don't think that precaution would be necessary in this case but use your own judgment.
Yes sir.
And by the way Billy.
Yes, sir?
When you found that cab, you might remove the dust that you kicked under the rug on the landing.
Billy's studying to take over my duties when
I retire, Miss Brandon.
I'll join you below in just a few minutes.
I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Holmes.
Please don't try.
Holmes, you can't get involved in this case.
Your duty is to guard the Star of Delhi.
Now what?
Oh, bother the star of Delhi.
What?
Here's a case where a man's life may be involved and there's something grotesque about this business.
The young Hunter knows a great deal more than he proposes to tell.
Find out what you can about him, will you Watson and report to me at the museum.
It's time for lunch.
Lunch, one can have lunch anytime.
Oh go on, Watson, please hurry up.
You're certain there was no one unearthed a grievance against your father or your family.
No, I told you.
My brother and I live very quietly.
My father, well I admit he was a hard man but men who got into new worids have to be but he was honorable and fine.
And Mr. Hunter?
We've known each other ever since we were children.
My brother and I have always trusted him completely.
Tell me, have you ever through your family or Mr. Hunter heard the name of a man called Moriarty.
Moriarty?
No.
You're quite sure?
Quite.
Why do you ask?
Somehow,
I have the feeling of renewing an old acquaintance.
Here we are.
Procellariiformes, west wing, section 4-A.
I'm sure everything will be taken care of to your satisfaction.
I depend upon you implicitly.
Well there'll be no difficulty.
Lloyd?
I thought you were asleep.
How can I can sleep with this threat over me?
We've got to do something about it, Jerrold.
Who's that man here just now?
A client.
Who was he?
See here, old man.
You mustn't let yourself go like this.
I know.
I haven't slept a wink since that note came.
You've got to sleep if you're to keep your wits about you.
This is May the 11th, the day on the paper.
He's going to kill me, Jerrold.
Wherever I go, whatever I do, he's going to kill me.
Is there nothing anyone can do about it?
Why don't you go home and go to bed.
Can't do yourself any good pacing my office.
Now the safest place in
London for you just now is your own home.
Perhaps you're right.
You know I can't go on like this.
I'll go home.
You'll come with me, Jerry?
I'm afraid I can't, Lloyd.
Probably wouldn't matter.
If anything should happen to me, you'll look after
Ann, won't you?
Don't be absurd.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
But if it should.
You know how
I feel about Ann.
Goodbye.
Thanks.
You'll be alright, Lloyd.
I think it's just a bad dream.
I think I'll walk home, get some air.
And why not?
Nothing can happen to you on a public street.
I hope you're right.
Goodbye Jerrold.
Goodbye old man.
See the beak, the nostrils, the whole formation of the body is the same.
In sea lore, the companion of ships and the good old men of honest mariners but an 醤gel of destruction to those who do him ill.
The albatross.
It looks the same.
I wonder what it means.
Are you certain that the albatross doesn't suggest some memories, an association with your family?
Think.
I am thinking.
No the only thing it reminds me of is the poem, water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink.
Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink.
You've hit on it.
And instead of the cross, the albatross about my neck was hung.
This is no childish prank, Miss Brandon, but a cryptic warning of a venging death.
We must go to your brother at once.
Holmes, Holmes.
Come on Watson quick.
Holmes, this is important.
Well Watson, you're bursting with news.
What it is man speak up.
We've no secrets from Miss Brandon.
Moriarty.
I knew it.
What have you found out, Watson.
That fellow Hunter is working for Moriarty.
They were together in Hunter's office.
I watched Moriarty leave.
Excellent.
And what did
Mr. Hunter do then?
I don't know.
You don't know.
No, I came away directly to tell you what I discovered.
Have I done something wrong?
I hope not.
I particularly wanted
Mr. Hunter's movements kept in view today.
Sorry?
Mr. Holmes?
Yes, Miss Brandon?
Regardless of appearances, don't condemn
Jerrold too quickly.
I know he's keeping some secret from me but he could never do anything vicious I'm sure.
I trust you're right, Miss Brandon, but we must be on our guard.
And I was gonna say...
Well what were you about to say, Watson?
Nothing.
Watson?
Yes.
I'm afraid you're an incorrigible bungler.
Oh Mr. Holmes, I wish you could go faster.
He's going as fast as he can, my dear.
Will we be in time?
I'm sure we will,
Miss Brandon.
He's dead all right.
Lloyd?
Lloyd.
Yes?
Oh, Mr. Holmes?
Can I give you a hand sir?
No, thank you, I can manage all right.
Oh my.
She's only fainted.
Take care of her, will you Watson?
Get me some smelling salts.
Yes, sir.
Where's Inspector Bristol.
In there.
I don't think you ought to go in.
He's questioning a witness and you know the inspector.
I'll take responsibility.
Oh it's you, Mr. Holmes.
How do you come to be here?
I just happened to be passing.
I know the family.
Hi, Mr. Hunter.
And you, inspector?
I don't know how much you know about this business Mr. Holmes, but this time,
I'm a little bit ahead of you.
Excellent Bristol.
And you've already solved the crime?
I found the murderer.
Yes, but that's not quite the same thing you know.
I didn't kill
Lloyd Brandon.
Has anyone said you did.
Oh, it's plain enough what's in the inspector's mind.
And he's wrong.
Well he's wasted time badgering me the murderer's got away.
Well if you're so anxious to save my time supposing you explain how you came to be found bending over the corpse with this in your hand and him with his head bashed in?
Well if you won't talk,
I'm gonna hold you on suspici髇 of murder.
I didn't kill him I tell you.
You clubbed him to death with the butt end of this revolver from behind.
I wouldn't go too far along that line, inspector.
And what would you propose that I should do,
Mr. Holmes?
Find the murderer?
What?
If that man didn't club
Lloyd Brandon to death, who did?
Nobody.
What?
Brandon was strangled to death.
Strangled?
The wound to the back of his head were administered post-mortem.
Are you sure of it, Mr. Holmes?
Absolutely.
Talk to the medical examiner if you have any doubts.
You wait here.
How do you know he was strangled?
The marks around the neck.
Cigarette, Mr. Hunter?
No thanks.
So, that blow on the back of the head becomes an interesting element.
It was unnecessary therefore vicious.
Intelligent criminals are seldom vicious except on special occasions.
Though the apparent method of the crime was brutal,
I'm convinced that the crime itself was intelligently planned.
And Bristol thinks I did that.
The nose of a police dog, although long and efficient, points in only one direction at a time.
What do you mean?
Simply that you're the obvious suspect.
It's so ridiculous.
Why should I want to kill him?
You should know that better than anyone else, Mr. Hunter.
You're his lawyer.
You manage the estate.
You'll have to explain that, Mr. Holmes.
The Brandon estate is quite considerable.
Miss Ann inherits and you're about to marry Miss Ann.
Why you...
I was merely demonstrating how the police mind works.
Yes I'm afraid our friend the inspector has quite set his heart on arresting you.
Arresting me?
You mustn't allow them to do that, Mr. Holmes.
I must be let free to protect Ann.
From what, Jerrold?
Answer me.
Ann, I'm sorry.
First they murdered my father and now they've murdered Lloyd.
Do they want to kill me too?
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
I did my best to guard him day and night yet they found him all the same in an empty street.
Oh I may have lost him for a moment but I couldn't have been far behind.
Who are they?
Jerrold you're lying.
You've been lying all the time.
You knew from the first that note was a real threat.
That's why you tried to send me away, why you followed Lloyd.
Oh Jerrold, if you know who killed him why won't you tell us?
Why won't you tell us everything?
I'll tell you why.
I've been watching you, Mr. Hunter and I found out...
What have you found out, Dr. Watson?
Whatever Watson has found out you'll know inevitably.
I have unbounded confidence in his lack of discretion.
Meanwhile, time presses and we've work to do outside before it gets too late.
Mr. Holmes.
Excuse us.
You pushed me out of the room as if I were a child.
What am I to make of this, Holmes?
Anything but such a petulant face old fellow.
Come along.
In another moment
I would have made him confess about Moriarty.
That's exactly what I didn't want.
If Moriarty's behind this case,
Hunter will lead us to him.
Well, Mr. Holmes,
I just coming to find you sir.
Have you seen the body?
He was strangled to death, just as you and I thought.
So now I'm gonna arrest this fellow Hunter, take him down to the yard.
I can really question him there and I thought perhaps you'd like to come along, sir.
No I think not, inspector.
Dr. Watson and I are going across the way to take a look at the scene of the crime.
You'll be wasting your time, sir.
My men have already covered the ground.
Well we'll just take a look all the same.
Incidentally, inspector, if I were you
I shouldn't arrest Mr. Hunter, in any case not now.
Nor I shouldn't question him any further.
Why not?
Well it won't get us anywhere.
He won't talk until he's ready.
Anyhow you haven't a case against him yet.
Why not leave him at large.
Have him watched and see what happens, for a day or two at least.
Hmm.
You've always found my advice pretty sound, haven't you, inspector?
It's got you a lot of attention in the newspapers.
Then you'll work on the case, sir, in the usual way?
In the usual way, inspector.
I'll do as you suggest, sir.
Good.
Come on, Watson.
Come in.
Oh, Mr. Hunter, we shan't be wanting you any longer.
You're free to go whenever you like.
Thank you, inspector.
You see, darling, they don't think anything of the kind.
Ann, you must believe.
I don't know what to believe anymore that Lloyd's gone.
If I can't believe in you, Jerrold, there's nothing in the whole worid
I can believe in or count on.
Yes.
But if you knew
Lloyd was in danger why did you try to keep me from seeing
Sherlock Holmes?
Why did you follow Lloyd with a revolver in your pocket?
Makes me afraid sometimes even of you.
Darling, how can you say such a thing?
Oh, I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm so tired and confused.
All right, Holmes.
I found it.
Ready when you are.
I say there, has something happened?
Definitely.
Would you mind moving back a few paces.
Not at all.
Thank you.
Perhaps I can find a doctor.
I'm a doctor.
What's the matter with you?
I'm all right.
I was thinking of you.
Why?
But aren't you ill?
Certainly not.
I'm dead.
Well I'm afraid
I must be getting on.
Don't let me detain you.
Stupid fellow.
Watson, come here.
Coming Holmes.
Look at that, Watson.
What have you found, Holmes?
Footprints?
Yes.
A club-footed man about five foot eleven I should say from the length of his stride.
Do you observe anything singular about these footprints, Watson?
I can't say that I do.
Club-footed people invariably bring their full weight down on the toe.
If you look closely you'll observe that the weight of the man who made these footprints is normally balanced from toe to heel.
Well what can you make of that, Holmes?
Oh just one more unnatural element to this rather peculiar case.
The clubfoot must have some other compensating deformity to explain these footprints.
What?
You think these are the footprints of a murderer?
It's possible.
Yes, yes it's quite possible.
What Holmes?
Well a man standing just about here would command a view of the park.
He might project some kind of weapon.
Not a weapon's been found except Hunter's revolver.
It could easily have been retrieved in the excitement.
And what kind of weapon thrown from here could both strangle a man and crush his skull in?
If we knew that, my dear Watson, we'd be a great deal nearer to the solution of the crime.
Look at that.
Here.
Yes, it was torn from that tree perhaps by something hurdling past.
The sap's not dry yet.
That means it was torn off within the last few hours.
Ahh.
What have you found, Holmes?
It's a watch guard.
Looks like a rabbit's foot.
No, no, no.
It's chinchilla.
Unquestionably chinchilla.
Well rabbit or chinchilla.
What's it matter?
No, no. Perhaps it doesn't matter at all, Watson.
We'll see.
I've always thought those things were in very poor taste.
Fancy going about with a dead animal's foot dangling from your pocket.
Yes, and then losing it at the scene of a murder.
Very careless.
Scream!
She's in here, sir.
Who is it?
It's Mr. Holmes.
Oh, Mr. Holmes, I'm so glad you're here.
This may sound foolish to you but after Mr. Hunter left
I went up to be with my brother.
While I was with him
I heard...
Yes?
The sound of music from the street, strange music.
It didn't begin, and it didn't end.
It just went on and on.
What was it about the music that frightened you?
I heard it once before, Mr. Holmes, only once when
I was a little girl in South America, the night my father was killed.
It's quite possible that under the circumstances this impressi髇 was a hallucination.
This was no hallucination,
Dr. Watson.
Take my word for it.
Did you see who was playing?
I went to the window.
There was a street beggar standing in front of the house.
I could just see the outline of its figure and then I became so frightened I screamed and
Yes I don't wonder.
Do you think you would remember that melody?
Remember it.
I should never forget it as long as I live.
Miss Brandon, I wish
I could spare you this but time is so important.
I understand.
What do you want me to do?
It's not going to be easy.
Anything if it will help you clear up my brother's death.
Do you think you could bear to repeat it for me?
I'll try.
That's definitely every note of it.
Mr. Holmes, would you mind going out, please?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
You must try to get some sleep.
It's been a terrible day for you.
Thank you, Billy.
What's that, Mr. Holmes?
Huh?
Yeah, that's a chinchilla foot, Billy.
Chinchilla?
Yes.
You know what a chinchilla is?
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
It's a little animal that grows in South America and its fur is very expensive.
Ahh, you should remember that, Billy.
It'll save you a lot of money when you grow up.
May I look at it, sir?
Uh, yeah, yes, certainly, Billy.
Well what do you make of it, Billy?
I'd like to have one of these.
They must bring you lots of luck.
Well why do you say that?
Well I bet in Chile or
Bolivia they carry around a chinchilla's foot for good luck the same as we carry a rabbit's foot.
Ahh.
You hear that, Watson?
My hearing is in no way impaired, thank you.
And you think that the man who lost this comes from
Chile or Bolivia?
Yes, sir, cause that's the only places chinchillas grow.
Well, Watson.
What do you say to that for a simple deduction?
I've listened to seashells that made better sense.
Why do you waste your time like this, Holmes?
Half the women in the worid own chinchilla wraps.
You exaggerate, Watson, and half the women in the worid wish they didn't.
No, Dr. Watson.
You see they make the coats out of skins.
Oh really?
Yes, sir, and the only place you can get a chinchilla's foot will be where the chinchilla lives.
There Billy, there's sixpence for you.
Blimey me a tenner.
Oh, thank you.
No, thank you,
Billy, thank you.
I don't know why you let that insufferable little brat come in here.
I was pulling your leg, Watson, merely relaying to you through Billy certain observations, which may or may not coincide significantly with what I found.
You found something?
I think so.
I've identified the death music, Watson, the melody Miss Brandon played for us last night.
It's an ancient
Inca funeral dirge still used by the Indians in the remote
Chilean Andes as a chant for the dead.
What on earth has that got to do with Professor Moriarty or the Star of Deli?
I wouldn't know, Watson.
I really wouldn't know.
Would you mind?
Inca funeral dirge.
Ahh, how do you do, doctor.
How are you sir.
Holmes, how lucky to find you at home.
Sir Ronald, well won't you sit down.
Here, sir.
Thanks.
Oh I hope I'm not interrupting you.
Oh no, no, no.
But I'm very anxious to know have you had any idea, in the connection with that note?
The note?
Oh, I'm afraid
I haven't had much time to think about it and after all the Star of Deli is not the immediate problem.
Oh but it is.
You will help me as you promised, won't you Holmes?
Lmagine the scandal, if anything should happen to a crown jewel.
Yes.
When does it arrive?
Tomorrow night.
I've had to arrange for delivery at ten o'clock, a most inconvenient hour for everyone of course but I can't leave the jewel out of the vault overnight, you know.
Once it arrives it's technically in my custody.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
What do you want me to do?
Could you possibly be at the tower tomorrow night at ten.
I'll take care of everything.
Good.
You'll have your own men there, of course, and as an added precaution
I'll see to it that a few policemen are on hand.
Excellent.
I can't tell you, how grateful
I am to you, Holmes.
Not at all, Sir Ronald.
Well goodbye.
Goodbye, sir.
You'll forgive me bothering you like this.
But I'm sure you understand the emergency of the matter.
Certainly, Sir Ronald.
Thank you again.
Goodbye doctor.
Goodbye Sir Ronald.
How do you do,
Miss Brandon.
How do you do?
Will you excuse me please?
Port Authority, pier nine.
Miss Brandon, is anything wrong?
Two are not enough.
They don't even give me time to bury my dead.
Please sit down.
No, I don't want to sit down thank you.
This is exactly like the drawing your brother received and it bears another date,
May the thirteenth.
That's tomorrow.
Was this left at your door?
Yes, about half an hour ago.
I came here directly.
You didn't happen to notice the messenger who left it?
No, one of the servants answered the door.
He just took it.
He didn't notice anything.
Mr. Holmes, what shall I do?
Isn't May the thirteenth the night you're supposed to go to
Lady Conyngham's party?
Well yes, but...
I know Lady Conyngham is irreproachable but there's too much emphasis on this date,
May the thirteenth, whether you should go to the party or whether you shouldn't.
You mean Jerrold?
Miss Brandon we feel that...
Mr. Hunter has much to explain, Miss Brandon.
As yet he's not been proved guilty.
But I must know.
You really want to know?
I must.
I'll do anything rather than bear this uncertainty, the suspense.
Then go to Lady
Conyngham's party.
But I can't, not now.
After Lloyd...
I understand your feelings but you must go to
Lady Conyngham's just the same.
She's an older woman.
She's very fond of you.
Now you're alone in a time of trouble.
What more natural than that you should go to her?
But she's giving a party and my brother's...
You only have to make an appearance.
Yes, but...
That's what I want, Miss Brandon.
I want you to make an appearance, perhaps take a walk through the grounds.
I warn you it may involve considerable risk but I think the kind of woman I take you to be would rather risk everything on one venture than live the rest of her life in the shadow of doubt and death.
Am I right?
You are right, Mr. Holmes.
I'll do as you say.
Thank you and goodbye.
No.
This time we'll say au revoir.
Miss Brandon?
Yes.
Are you quite sure you're not afraid.
Of course I'm afraid but I'll go through with it.
Good.
May the thirteenth.
That's tomorrow night.
Well Holmes you've certainly let yourself in for a busy night tomorrow.
What about the
Star of Deli and you promise to Sir Ronald and what about your duty to the crown?
All that will be taken care of.
Never fear.
I'm going to delegate the most dependable man I know to guard the star of
Deli in my place while I keep an eye on Miss Brandon.
Oh really, who may that be?
You my dear fellow.
Huh?
You'd like to let that razor slip, wouldn't you, Dawes?
No sir.
By no means, sir.
You're a coward, Dawes.
If you weren't a coward you'd a cut my throat long ago.
Why I give you my word, sir.
That thought never entered my mind, sir.
Then you're worse than a coward.
You're a fool.
You have as much hatred for me as I have contempt for you.
Excellent.
Without your beard, sir, you look like your own son.
It's unlikely that I shall be back tonight Dawes
You may as well take the evening off.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Dawes.
I'm engaged.
Of course you are, Bassick.
Why do you think
I'm paying you?
I never would have recognized you, professor.
Yes, sir?
What'd you find out, Bassick?
Just like you said.
They're taking the goods off the boat tonight.
The men is waiting.
Excellent.
Now let's hurry.
Yes sir.
Excuse me.
Hello darling.
Are you feeling all right, my child.
Yes, I think so.
And has that young son of mine been behaving himself?
He's been awfully kind.
I'm afraid I'm very tiresome this evening.
Nonsense.
No man on the bright side of senility could possibly call you tiresome.
Ann, you're glad you came aren't you?
Very glad.
Good.
You see I was right.
It was quite the best thing for you to do to come down here.
You shouldn't have thought of staying alone in that house, so soon after.
Perhaps you're right.
You're going to stay on here over the weekend.
If you want me.
As long as you like, my dear.
Thank you.
Has anyone asked for me tonight?
Why no?
Are you expecting someone?
I'm not sure.
Well it doesn't matter.
Oh mother.
May I take Ann away.
I want her to see some of this entertainment.
Of course, dear.
I hope it will be good.
Sit here, Ann.
I want you to see this musical chap.
He may be amusing.
Everyone delights to spend their summer holidays
Down beside the side of the silvery sea
I'm no exception to the rule in fact if I had my way
I'd be down beside the side of the silvery sea
But when your just a commoner a Smith or Jones or Brown a business up in town
You've got to settle down
You save up all the money you can till summer comes around then away you go to a spot you know where the shells are found
Oh I... do like to be beside the sea side
I do like to be besides the sea
I do like to stroll along the
So just let me be beside the sea side
I'll be beside the silver sea for there are lots of giris beside
I should like to be besides
Beside the sea side besides the sea.
Funny fellow, isn't he?
Yes.
Ann, I wish there was something I could do.
Could I get you an ice?
You're very kind to me.
I'd like that.
All right.
You stay here.
I'll see what I can pillage, be straight back.
Thank you.
Good evening,
Miss Brandon.
Everything all right?
What do you want?
We did have an appointment, you know.
Mr. Holmes, you're...
Shhhh...
We mustn't be seen together.
Has anything happened?
Have you seen anything unusual?
No nothing yet.
Mr. Holmes, do you think
I could possibly be in danger here?
There's no doubt of it but don't worry.
I'll be watching.
I'll be glad when it's over.
Yes, I know.
Don't take any unnecessary risks.
Don't talk to strange people and above all don't wander far from the lights and the crowd.
You must go back.
Good luck.
Here we are, Ann.
Thank you.
Tell me, that's a
South American gaucho orchestra, isn't it?
Yes.
Rather good aren't they?
Yes.
Shall we go in.
It's rather chilly out here.
Just as you like, Ann.
You're being too hard on Holmes, Sir Ronald.
He gave me his word he'd be here, sir.
He sent me in his place.
You?
Well, sir, I've been with Holmes on a good many cases and I can assure you, you might have done considerably worse.
Where are these other policemen he promised to send me?
They'll be here directly.
A sergeant and two policemen, picked men sir.
What is it, sergeant?
Police officers to see Dr. Watson, sir.
Bring 'em in.
It's about time.
Is Dr. Watson here?
Yes, I am Dr. Watson.
Sergeant Bullfinch at your service, sir.
Good evening, sir.
My I see your identification, sir?
I told you
I am Dr. Watson.
I don't doubt that, sir, but the inspector said
I was to be particular about identification, sir.
Well you seem to be a law-abiding citizen.
I suppose you'll be wanting to see mine?
Yes, please.
Everything seems in order, Sir Ronald.
Company halt.
Captain Mannery,
Royal Navy, with escort reporting to Sir Ronald Ramsey.
Just a moment, sir.
Is that you, Sir Ronald?
Yes.
Captain Mannery?
Yes, sir.
Raise the gate.
Well here it is, Sir Ronald.
Ahh.
The Star of Deli.
This has been a great anxiety to me,
Captain Mannery.
I can't tell you how relieved I shall be when I have this jewel safely locked up in the tower.
Would you like us to go with you, sir?
No, there's no occasi髇.
I have ample protection.
Then I bid you goodbye, Sir Ronald.
Goodbye Captain Mannery.
I am most grateful to you.
Thank you, sir.
All right, Gentlemen.
Guard, about face.
Halt.
Ahh.
It's the longest short walk I ever had.
Hold that for a moment, will you?
The crown jewels, gentlemen, the accumulated wealth of ten centuries of English kings, a grave responsibility.
It's not often this door is unlocked and this is the key to all this treasure.
The emerald, where is it?
Somebody snatched it.
The policemen, where are they?
They're not policemen at all.
After them.
Sir Ronald, look.
The Star of Deli.
They've dropped it.
You see, Sir Ronald.
Every thing's turned out all right after all.
And all thanks to your brilliant friend,
Sherlock Holmes.
So my fears were ridiculous and that note was merely the work of a crank.
Nobody would steal the star of Deli.
No one there, Sir Ronald.
Never mind Sergeant
I have the jewel.
I have a good mind to give this story to the press.
It will put
Holmes in his place.
Oh, I wouldn't do that, Sir Ronald.
You have got the jewel back.
I have indeed, as safe as the
Crown Jewels of England, but no thanks to Holmes.
Well he did send me in his place.
Yes, and it's a capital thing he did.
You're a splendid fellow, Watson.
You've done me a great service tonight.
I shall see to it that it is reported in due course to the proper authorities.
Come along, Sergeant.
Turn out the light.
Yes.
They got away, sir, in the direction of Cog Hill.
But they left what they came for.
The emerald is safe.
Oh good, sir.
All right Sergeant.
Goodbye, my dear.
I'll drive over and see you tomorrow.
You're terribly tired, my child, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
You better go to bed.
I'm going to look in on you later and if you're not asleep,
I shall be very severe.
Uh-uh.
Whatever is the matter with you, my dear?
I just noticed the time.
That clock on the landing.
It's seven minutes to twelve.
In another eight minutes it won't be May the thirteenth anymore.
You must go to bed at once, You really must.
I'll go with you.
I'd like you to.
I shouldn't take you away.
Nonsense.
They've all gone.
Besides no one misses a middle-aged hostess.
Have a good rest, my dear, and be sure to sleep late.
It's an invariable custom of the house.
I'll try.
Good night.
Good night, my dear.
I was just coming to find you, Miss Brandon.
There's a gentleman on the terrace asking to see you and he says it's most important.
Mr. Holmes, thank you.
Ann, my dear.
What are you doing here?
Am I so unwelcome?
Why did you come?
I've been terribly worried about you, darling.
I wanted to be sure you were safe.
Why did you think
I might not be safe?
Ann, whatever has come over you?
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Surely you're not afraid of me?
You are afraid.
That's how much all the years have counted.
You think I want to hurt you.
I don't know why I don't.
Ann.
Wait.
Come here, Ann.
Come along this way quick.
Ahh!
Holmes, you all right?
Never better, Watson.
And Miss Brandon?
She'll be all right, the poor child she's fainted.
Look after her will you, Andrews, and take her back to the house.
What on earth is this, Holmes?
This, Watson, is a
South American bolas, the instrument that killed Lloyd Brandon.
What?
Yes.
Come and take a look at his murderer.
He's badly hurt.
Can he be moved, doctor?
Yes.
Then I'll take him to the Yard.
Yes, it's just as I suspected.
This club footed shoe was a very clever device but not quite clever enough, my friend.
I'll wager you didn't think of it yourself.
Who put you up to it?
The professor.
He's said he'd fix it so I don't get caught.
Professor Moriarty.
Si, Moriarty.
I kill him.
I scarcely think you'll have the chance now.
So that clears up our case.
Clears it up, we've only just begun.
Come along Watson.
Don't move.
Stay where you are and keep your eyes open.
All right come on Watson.
There's nobody here.
Well why didn't you say so before?
Oh, lilly pond.
It's damp.
Damp, I'm wet through.
He's been shaving.
Moriarty's worn that beard for years.
Why would he shave it off?
To disguise himself, of course.
Obviously, Watson.
But why tonight especially for what purpose?
Huh?
A Baedeker.
What would Moriarty be doing with a guidebook?
He knows London like a cab driver.
Look, Watson, look.
The Tower of London.
Sergeant Bullfinch.
Moriarty without his beard.
Then he stole the emerald.
I wonder what exactly he did do, or rather is doing.
What do you mean, Holmes?
Don't you see, my dear Watson.
Moriarty concocted that Brandon case with all its fantastic convolutions expressly to divert my attention till the time the
Star of Deli was delivered.
So that he could steal the emerald but he didn't get it.
We fooled him.
That's exactly the point, Watson.
He didn't want the Star of Deli.
What?
No.
A real crime has not yet come to light.
He caused a man to be murdered solely in order to distract me.
He staged that fiasco at the Tower of London.
Why I don't know but one thing I'm certain.
It was all done with a purpose.
Somewhere in London at this very moment something tremendous is happening.
He said he was going to do it and he's doing it now, the most stupendous, the most incredible crime of the century, the crowning act of his career, the crowning act.
Crowning?
St. Edward's crown.
This was the crown stolen from the
Tower of London in 1671 by Colonel Blood and his accomplices, the total value of the regalia is estimated at three million pounds.
Watson, the crown jewels.
We're wasting time.
Ay, cabby.
Never mind, get in, Watson.
I say drive carefully old boy.
What is it, McKenzie?
An accident, Sergeant.
Give me your hand.
Get this man out of here.
Well, what were you trying to do, batter your way right into the Tower of London?
Of course not, course not, it's preposterous.
Well what were you doing?
Well I...
Where is your cabby
Well where is he?
I don't know, I haven't the faintest idea.
Bring him along to the posting room.
Did you hear a shot?
I did, sir, I thought it came from the tower.
Follow me on the double.
Well, Ann Brandon 21, and Jerrold Hunter 29, were married this morning at the Castone Hall
Register Office.
Well that takes care of that but I still don't understand how young Hunter became involved in the mystery.
Alfred?
Can I borrow your violin?
Certainly, governor.
I said, I still don't understand how young Hunter became involved.
Perfectly simple.
Whatever Gerald Hunter did was done to protect Miss Brandon.
But I saw it myself talking with Moriarty.
My dear Watson,
I expected even you to see through that trick.
Moriarty went to him with a trumped up lawsuit to pull us off the track.
Those flies again.
Very effective, my dear Watson.
Elementary, my dear
Holmes, elementary.

Are you bad luck!
Hiya, Doctor.
Hiya, babe.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Inside, inside.
No, you ain't.
Only stiffs go in there tonight.
- No kidding.
- No kidding.
- What's keeping you out?
- I'm... What?
- Listen, we're pals, ain't we?
- Yeah.
Get a flash of that.
Yeah, well, it won't do you any good tonight.
Now, look, I got me orders.
Nobody's going in there, and that goes for you newspaper guys, too. Now...
Sergeant, all I want to do is identify a body.
Now, look, walk down the street, because somebody might think I know you.
- Go ahead.
- That's an idea. Bones.
- Hello, Dee.
- Hello.
- Say, say, what's the hurry, big boy?
- I just want to use your telephone.
Oh, yeah? Well, there's one down at the corner drugstore.
Listen, I haven't got time.
Will you be a sport? Come on, act natural.
All right, but step on it.
This is no telephone exchange.
Haven't I...
Say, didn't I meet you in Havana?
Yes... What?
Hello, World?
Give me the night desk, please. Yeah.
Willard Keefe. Yeah, this is Lee Taylor.
I'm down at the Mott Street Morgue.
Just now they bring in the body of an old scrubwoman murdered under very peculiar circumstances.
No, they won't let me see it.
I can't get any dope. Police...
Very good. I say very... What?
I say I can't get any dope on it.
Police orders.
Just now, Stevens, O'Halloran and a guy named Dr. Xavier arrived.
- Something's doing.
- Yeah, I've heard that one, too.
Listen, you lunkhead, I'm not clowning.
Look out the window, will you?
- What do you mean, the moon?
- Certainly I mean the moon.
I'm laying 10 bucks to a dime it's another Moon Killer murder.
Well, that's different.
Now, listen, Lee, stick right on it.
Fine.
I thought I...
Oh, Rachmaninoff.
How about the Prelude, huh?
Hey, Mike, just a minute. Please!
Hello, Mike. Hey, listen, what's going on across the street tonight?
I don't know a thing, Lee.
I'm walking my beat and minding my own business.
- Well, have you got a cigarette?
- I never use them.
Here, smoke this. Paddy, the bartender down at the corner, gave it to me.
- Oh, much obliged, Mike. Thanks!
- Yeah, no problem.
- Good gracious! What you got there?
- Nothing, just a little handshake buzzer.
You see, fits right in the palm of your hand.
You wind it up like that, and it discourages these professional handshakers.
I ought to have one on each hand for my beat here.
- Well, I gotta be going now. Goodbye.
- So long.
I forgot all about that thing.
Don't ever bring any of those darned tricks around here again.
What's your theory, Doctor?
Strangulation by terrifically powerful hands.
You will notice how deeply the thumbs are embedded in the sternocleidomastoid.
And what do you think of this incision at the base of the brain?
Obviously made by some type of scalpel used for brain dissecting.
But it's peculiar that this left deltoid muscle should be missing.
- It's been torn right out.
- Gentlemen, it wasn't torn.
This is cannibalism.
- This portion of the body was...
- Impossible!
There's no doubt about it.
Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate your professional opinion.
I'm only too happy to be of any service to you, gentlemen.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have rather an important experiment in progress that demands my attention every few hours.
I hardly think I can be of any further use to you, so if you don't mind, I'm very, very sorry, but I'll say good night.
Just a moment, Doctor, if you don't mind.
One thing more.
- Very well, sir.
- Yes, what?
Now, look here, Doctor, this is the sixth murder in the same number of months, all committed in the full of the moon with no apparent motive, by means of strangulation and an incision with a strange surgical knife.
- Yes, it is peculiar, isn't it?
- Most peculiar.
- What's your theory of the killer, Doctor?
- A neurotic, of course.
- Some poor devil suffering from a fixation.
- Fixation? What do you mean?
A knot or kink tied to the brain by some past experience.
A madness that comes only at certain times when the killer is brought in direct contact with some vivid reminder of the past.
- It's hard to believe that.
- Yes, for a policeman, I suppose it is.
But I tell you that locked in each human skull is a little world, all its own.
Yes, well, what would these reminders be, for instance?
Anything. The sight of the sea, the full moon. Anything.
The poor devil, sane at all other times, is forced to live over the scene of the action that first drove him mad.
Very interesting.
Particularly in view of the fact that all these murders occur in the vicinity of your medical academy.
Are you implying that someone in my academy could have done this?
- I am convinced of it.
- This is preposterous!
I'm familiar with the character of every student and professor, and they're all men of the highest integrity.
There are other academies in the state...
But they don't have that kind of knives.
The surgical supply house swear they import them from Vienna especially for your institute.
It's the only place in the country that they're used.
Commissioner Stevens, if you jump at a hasty conclusion like this, you'll ruin the integrity of an institution that has one of the finest reputations in the world.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I have to start an investigation.
I tell you this first, because I'm hoping for your cooperation.
Naturally, I shall do everything to protect your institution.
- But the newspapers, the publicity.
- Don't worry about them.
We don't want publicity any more than you do.
If my academy is under suspicion, give me a chance to conduct an investigation of my own first.
Surely, with our knowledge of the human brain,
- we have every facility to catch a madman.
- How would you proceed?
By immediately studying the pathological reactions of every man placed under suspicion.
Then trap the guilty one by a brain examination.
May I examine the records of your students and faculty?
Why, assuredly, assuredly. You can come to my office now, if you wish.
But, I beg of you, no publicity, please.
- No, don't worry.
- Please.
Not one newspaper in the country shall hear of this until you've had every opportunity to clear your academy of suspicion.
Thank you. Thank you.
I appreciate your gesture.
What is it? What do you want?
- Father!
- Oh, it's you, Joanne.
What is it, dear?
Nothing. I just came in here to say good night to you.
Father, what are you doing in here in the dark? You frightened me.
I'm sorry, Joanne.
I just came here to get those records.
It's late. You're looking very tired, darling.
You're only heading for a nervous breakdown unless...
That moon, mixed with this other light, it's too ghastly.
Father, you worry me.
You promised me you'd take a rest.
Lately you've been so...
No, my dear, I'm all right.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Now, I have some gentlemen next door in the office.
- You run along. I'll be through shortly.
- But, Father...
Now, Joanne, please.
This is very important.
Good night.
But, really, gentlemen, this investigation is useless.
The academy is closed.
The students are away on their vacations.
It surely isn't wise to spend your time on this.
What's that?
Probably Professor Wells.
He's in his laboratory.
What's he doing here if the school's supposed to be closed?
It's not an unusual thing for the faculty to spend their evenings here at this time.
Vacation period is the only opportunity they have to do their personal research work.
What's the history of this man?
- Well...
- I'm waiting, Doctor.
Professor Wells is a student of cannibalism.
He's written a book about it.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
It's as good as a conviction.
I hardly think so.
I'm very fond of Dr. Wells.
He couldn't possibly do a thing of this sort.
- May I talk to him?
- Why, certainly. Certainly.
Come this way, gentlemen.
What a very strange, uncanny place you have here, Doctor.
What are all these doors?
They are the laboratories of my faculty.
Dr. Wells, Dr. Duke, Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines.
And all those men are here at this hour of the night?
They seldom leave.
They live for their work.
After all, this is a research institute.
I should like to have a little talk with these gentlemen.
Of course.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Professor Wells, but I would like to introduce some friends of mine.
- May we come in?
- Of course, of course, gentlemen.
Come in. Come closer.
- This is Mr. Stevens. Mr. O'Halloran.
- Professor, how do you do?
How do you do?
That's interesting, isn't it?
If this experiment is successful, we will be a little nearer the secret of life.
What is that?
That's a heart.
I've kept it alive for three years by electrolysis.
Electrolysis?
Professor Wells is accomplishing remarkable findings in nerve reflexes.
- You flatter me, Doctor.
- Oh, no, no.
I understand, Professor, that you live just for your work,
- that you seldom leave the institute.
- Not necessarily.
I played truant a short while ago. I was down by the waterfront for a breath of air.
- What time was that?
- You're not feeling well?
- Your arm is troubling you?
- Yes, it's very annoying.
Well, you're foolish to sit there in discomfort.
- lf you gentlemen don't mind, I...
- Why, of course not, of course not.
I put it on just as I heard you coming.
An empty sleeve is revolting to most people.
Well, I think we've taken up enough of Professor Wells' time.
- Oh, not at all, Mr. Stevens.
- Thank you, Professor.
Well, gentlemen, shall we be going?
There are many other interesting things to see.
Yes, let's be going.
- Good evening.
- Good night. Thank you for calling.
You know, this is a tough case.
There isn't much chance of his strangling anybody with one hand.
- Oh, I agree with you.
- Well, that lets him out of the picture.
- Whose room is that?
- Professor Haines'.
Is there anything about him that might justify my putting him under observation?
Well, of course, if you're just looking for someone to hang suspicion on, there's not a man on my faculty that wouldn't come under that heading.
Then, you do know something about this man Haines.
- No, not exactly, except...
- Except what?
- Well...
- Come on, come on.
Well, what is it?
Dr. Haines and two other scientists were shipwrecked off Tahiti about a year ago while making a study of the coral reefs for the Killary Foundation.
Now what's that got to do with it?
- You say they were shipwrecked?
- Yes, they were adrift for 24 days.
Their supplies were exhausted.
When they were picked up,
Haines and one other were delirious.
The third had vanished.
There was no explanation at the time.
Haines later claimed the man had died, and he had thrown the body overboard.
- I should like to meet him.
- Surely.
But I am sure that he's not the guilty party.
The killer is a maniac, and Dr. Haines is one of the most brilliant men in the medical world.
- However, if you insist...
- I do.
Very well.
Professor Haines?
Yes. Yes, yes, come in. Come in, Doctor.
I want you to meet
Mr. Stevens and Mr. O'Halloran.
They're making a tour of scientific investigation and intend to honor our academy for a short time.
- How do you do, gentlemen?
- Hope we're not disturbing you, Professor.
Not at all. I was just relaxing.
Professor Haines is a most intensive worker.
I've just been telling Mr. Stevens of your phenomenal experiments in brain grafting.
Oh, Doctor, Doctor, come.
Come. I want to show you.
I want to show you a new type of brain cell.
- That should be interesting, Professor.
- I'm sure you'll find it so.
- On the slide?
- Yes.
Look.
Relaxing.
Why did you bring the police in here?
Get them out quickly, or I'll...
Professor, do you experiment with all these animals?
Mankind's benefactors.
Those little animals whose blood most nearly resembles the human.
Yes. Yes, yes, of course. Of course.
But it's getting rather late, Professor, and Mr. Stevens wants to see the rest of the laboratories.
Now that he's met you, he can call some other time.
- Delighted.
- Thank you, Professor.
- Glad to have met you. Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, gentlemen.
There's always a certain amount of danger in a laboratory so...
He's certainly a strange type.
Well, such men are naturally strange,
Mr. Stevens.
Sometimes in the overdevelopment of one part of the brain, another part is weakened.
There's a type who looks capable of anything.
Oh, I assure you, he's as timid as a lamb.
He's inclined to be attentive to my daughter, so I see a lot of him.
- Who's the next?
- Dr. Rowitz.
He's the scientist who was with Haines during the shipwreck.
If you'll step this way.
- Are you busy, Dr. Rowitz?
- Always, but it's a pleasure, gentlemen.
Oh, excuse me.
Mr. Stevens. Mr. O'Halloran.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
- Can I be of any service?
- Well, we are just looking around, Doctor.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Good evening, Professor Duke.
- How are you feeling tonight?
- Horrible.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, if it makes you feel sorry to hear things like that, then don't ask questions.
Oh, Professor Duke,
Mr. Stevens, Mr. O'Halloran.
How do you do? How do you do?
He's Dr. Rowitz's collaborator.
You're an astronomer, Doctor?
Not that, sir.
I have an interest in the light qualities of the moon.
If you might suffer sunstroke, might you not suffer some similar evil
- from the rays of the moon?
- Moonstruck, you mean?
Exactly, what we call lunacy, from the word luna, meaning the moon.
Latin, you know.
However, the luna rays will never affect you or me, sir.
- Because we are normal people.
- Sure.
It affects strangely certain neurotic types.
Yes, moon is powerful.
Why, twice a day it lifts billions of tons of water at high tide that wash the shores of the world, like an eternal old scrubwoman.
Like what?
Pardon my poetic effort.
Yes, but just what do you mean by that?
I'm afraid we've taken up too much of Dr. Rowitz's time.
Thank you, Doctor.
That was very, very interesting.
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You know, this is the doctor's particular hour for observation, and the moon doesn't wait, you know.
Did you notice the face on that fellow?
That sailor who saw the scrubwoman killed tonight says the murderer had a face that was horribly disfigured.
Rowitz certainly fits the description, all right.
Gentlemen, I don't believe that Dr. Rowitz could commit a crime.
He has such a lovely nature.
Why, he's the author of several volumes of poetry.
Hello?
- What are we gonna do?
- We're powerless unless he helps us.
You know that as well as I do.
We've exhausted every clue.
He can help us find the murderer, if anybody can.
And I'm gonna put plenty of pressure on him and make him do it.
A little nervous perhaps, but nothing more.
Oh, ridiculous.
All right. All right.
You go back to sleep, dear.
Good night.
Doctor, if I permitted you to conduct your own investigation, how long would it take you?
If you leave me alone,
I can conduct a series of tests, which in 48 hours will conclusively prove whether or not the killer is a member of this academy.
In the meantime, I should like to check up on all your collaborators.
Who's there?
Hey, what're you doing up there?
I'm a building inspector.
I work nights so I won't get sunburned.
I asked you what are you doing up there?
I'm a somnambulist. I probably came up here to have my head examined.
You come down from there, or I'll...
Now, just a minute,
I'll be right down, honey. Just relax.
Everything is gonna be all right and on the up-and-up.
I'm not used to these.
These fire escapes are a sideline with me.
Now everything is gonna be...
There's nothing to worry about.
See, Police Commissioner Stevens is upstairs, and I'm taking care of the outside.
- By the way, what are you doing here?
- I'm Miss Xavier.
And we're not accustomed to having strange men climb all over our fire escapes.
I'm not accustomed to having strange girls sticking guns in my stomach.
By the way, you're just the person I wanna see.
I wanna ask you a few questions.
Could you tell me the whereabouts of your father during the last four hours?
How do you spend your evenings?
I mean, have you ever noticed the Doctor acting strangely?
I'm sorry, but I can't answer those questions.
The Doctor hasn't been very well lately, and I don't like policemen or anyone to disturb him.
- Good night.
- Just a minute.
- Have you got a permit to carry that gun?
- Yes, I have.
Good night.
All right. I'll agree to lay off for 48 hours.
But I give you my word, if you don't succeed,
I'll come in here, seal every door, place everybody under technical arrest, take fingerprints, conduct a rigid inspection.
I don't care if the whole world knows it.
There have been six murders committed all in the same circumstances.
The evidence points here.
- But, Commissioner, all I want is a chance.
- You've got it.
- Forty-eight hours. Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.
Good night, gentlemen.
Meddling fools.
This way out, gentlemen. If you please.
- Who're you?
- I am Dr. Xavier's butler, sir.
My nerves are all shot.
That dumb, potbellied, flat-footed cop.
I dashed that off in five minutes.
I think it's pretty swell.
- What do you think?
- It's okay.
But you stick on Dr. X's trail, and you get a picture of the Doctor and a statement, too.
Oh, no, not me.
Listen, I wanna get off this story.
Put me back on crossword puzzles, covering woman's clubs,
- anything, will you?
- Say, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me? Nothing at all.
Only I spent all last night laying next to a bunch of stiffs, looking at a lot of goofy guys.
I let a dame poke a gun in my stomach, and then I let a dumb policeman slip me a trick cigar.
Say, you want to draw another paycheck, don't you?
Certainly, that's my aim in life, but I'd like to keep out of the bughouse to enjoy it.
Eddie, when is Lee Taylor's week up?
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Can't you take a joke?
All right, keep moving, but get a picture of the Doctor.
Here, have a cigar.
How do you do? I'm Mr. Taylor.
- You ain't a reporter, are you?
- I should say not.
Well, that's good. We've been overrun with them all morning.
- Gee, they got us goofy.
- I know just how you feel, Miss Xavier.
- I ain't Miss Xavier.
- Well, that's funny.
I was told that she was a good-looking girl of about 20.
I'm 21-and-a-half.
Oh, fine. Pleased to meet you.
Gee, ain't you the kidder, though.
That's another thing in your favor.
That shows that you have a sense of humor.
What do you want the miss for?
- My grandmother sent me.
- Your grandmother?
Won't you take these flowers?
- For the miss.
- Come in.
Just a minute.
Miss Joan, there's a man down here wants you for his grandmother.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, how do you do?
I didn't know you... I'm awfully sorry.
You know, I felt sure that
I'd hear you coming before you entered.
Well, I suppose I could go back and cough.
Oh, no, no, please don't bother.
Stay right here.
- You're sure I'm not disturbing you?
- Not at all. Why do you ask?
You're so obviously at home here that I feel like a guest.
- You don't mind if I sit down?
- Oh, please do.
Oh, how nice. Thank you.
And since you're my guest, won't you...
- Won't you want a cigarette?
- No.
What I want is to know if you're really going to take it.
- Going to take it?
- Yes, my picture.
It's sticking out of your right pocket.
Well, isn't that the funniest thing?
You know, this is really all your own fault.
You have absolutely no business photographing so attractively.
- Thank you.
- And I have a habit of collecting pictures
- of beautiful girls.
- Yeah.
- Well, and pictures of their fathers, too?
- Pictures of their fathers...
What fathers?
My father's picture's sticking out of your left pocket.
Well, can you beat that?
How do you suppose that got there?
Just who are you, anyway?
Because you're such a good scout,
I'm gonna break down and confess and tell you.
I'm Lee Taylor of The Daily World.
- Then you did it.
- Me?
It was you who printed that horrible story of Father in this morning's paper.
- Horrible? You ain't read nothing yet.
- What do you mean?
What I mean is... Well, don't you see?
Your father's a famous scientist.
He's been called in on a sensational case.
- That's news.
- But you've upset him terribly.
Now, on account of that newspaper story, he has to go some other place to carry on his investigation.
- He hates publicity.
- You mean to tell me he's leaving town?
Who's going with him?
What time are they leaving?
- What station...
- That's none of your business.
I refuse to say another word to you.
You're just contemptible and impudent enough to publish it.
Oh, impudent, maybe, but not contemptible.
- Don't call me contemptible.
- You are contemptible.
You deliberately fooled me last night into believing that you were an officer.
Well, I merely showed you my police press badge.
Don't you think you've been here a very long time?
Listen, honestly, I am ashamed.
But don't you see?
This is the biggest thing that's happened in this town in six months.
If I don't get something on this story, why, I'll have to join the army of the unemployed,
- and you wouldn't want that to happen.
- I'd be very grateful to you if you'd leave.
I didn't quite get that.
Yeah, would you say it again?
A little closer.
You hard of hearing?
No, no, but don't you see?
That's the closest thing to anything coaxing that you've said yet.
- You get out of here.
- Oh, don't be angry.
Come on, let's laugh it off.
- Won't you shake hands and be friends?
- No.
Lucky.
I've got to get something on this story, or I'm out of a job.
Hey!
Take this home to your grandmother.
Bad luck.
There is no need to be temperamental.
We are here on a matter of the utmost gravity.
That's why I've sent for you so unceremoniously.
We are all under suspicion of murder.
- What?
- Absurd.
- Ridiculous.
- What imbecile thought that up?
Gentlemen, I know you're all acquainted with these recent horrible murders.
Moon Killer murders, as the press calls them.
The investigation has proven that, in every case, the killer has made use of a surgical instrument, a type to be found only in our academy.
- But, Doctor...
- One moment, please.
Naturally, I prefer to believe that everyone in this room is innocent, but circumstances point to the conclusion that one of us may be guilty, any one of us.
Confound it, Xavier.
Bring us up here on a night like this.
Why couldn't you have told us this at the academy?
For a simple reason.
I wish to conduct an investigation of my own, alone, quietly.
And I want your help.
This is a lot of tommyrot.
Don't you realize what the publicity of a police investigation would mean to us?
You are quite right, Doctor.
What do you propose to do?
I want every one of you to submit to a psycho-neurological test, an experiment that I have devised, which I hope will prove each one of us innocent.
But if it should prove otherwise?
Then, my dear Doctor, surely one's own farewell to life is preferable to that demanded by the law.
- This is preposterous. I refuse.
- Good. Then the police will give it to you.
Gentlemen, I consider it a privilege to have an opportunity of proving my innocence.
- Doctor, I'm ready.
- Thank you, Dr. Rowitz.
- Dr. Wells?
- Yes.
- Professor Duke?
- I agree.
- And you, Professor Haines?
- Well, if they all agree.
- Good.
- Oh, I think it's a lot of nonsense.
Gentlemen, I suggest you all retire to your rooms and unpack.
In 10 minutes we shall all meet in the laboratory.
A still?
Wonder where they bottle it.
Bad luck.
You and me both.
Very well, Doctor. At once.
Your room is at the end of the corridor.
Mine's over there.
I just fixed yours for the night.
Is there anything else, miss?
Why, Mamie, what's the matter with you?
Your teeth are chattering.
This terrible house.
It gives me the horrors worse than ever.
Well, don't be absurd.
Go to bed and go to sleep.
Well, I hope you get a good night's sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mamie.
Good night.
Come, Mamie. Come.
Come, Mamie.
How would you like to meet a ghost in here, eh, Mamie?
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
He'd be a lot pleasanter than you.
Stop that, Otto.
Stop it.
There ain't anything in this room to be afraid of.
So you can just stop trying to make me nervous.
Well, well, Mr. Zilch, how are you?
The smells, don't they remind you of an embalming parlor, eh, Mamie?
The only thing in this room that does that right now is you.
Yes, you can laugh now, if you want to, but you won't laugh tonight when you have to wear these for the experiment.
- Where did Dr. Xavier get that?
- From the morgue.
The old scrubwoman wore these the night that she was murdered.
Look, Mamie, look here.
You can see some of the blood on them.
- No, Otto! No, please, Otto! No, no!
- Look, Mamie. Look, Mamie. Yes.
- I take back what I said, please.
- Look, Mamie, look.
Otto, Mamie, what's wrong with the switchboard? What's going on here?
- Nothing, sir.
- Yes, there is, Doctor.
- He's trying to scare me.
- Otto, stop this foolishness.
- Yes, sir.
- Now, pay attention, both of you.
- You have the dress, Otto?
- Right here, sir.
Mamie, you'll kindly put it on.
- Put in on? But, Doctor...
- Now, I want your help.
You and Otto will enact the last murder of the so-called Moon Killer before an audience I've selected.
Otto knows all about it and will instruct you in your part.
- What part do I play?
- The scrubwoman, of course.
- The one who was murdered last night.
- Murdered?
But, Doctor, please, please.
Couldn't Otto play it?
No, Otto has his own part, that of the killer.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Remember our signals, Otto.
Just as I explained.
Yes, sir.
You see, Mamie, there's nothing to be afraid of. There's nothing...
How've you been, babe?
Now, cut it out, now, will you? Cut it out.
You're right.
There's nothing like this way.
How utterly absurd.
Good heavens, Doctor, what have you done with your laboratory here?
It's nothing like it was at my last visit.
- I've made a few changes, that's all.
- A thousand, I should say.
Thermal tubes, huh?
A blood reaction, by high frequency current, as well.
Dr. Xavier is still working on his theory that strong mental repressions, phobias, hidden in the darkest corners of the subconscious mind can be brought to the surface and made to register through certain reactions of the heart.
- Am I correct, Professor?
- Precisely.
And tonight I hope to prove my theory.
Now, gentlemen, would you kindly be seated in these chairs?
We'll begin the experiment.
Well, if we must, then let us get it over with quickly.
Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines and Professor Duke.
And now, gentlemen, with your permission,
Dr. Wells will assist you in clamping these contact wires to your wrists.
Are yours included?
Certainly.
As close as possible.
But, see that the connections aren't too tight. You'll be quite comfortable.
Pardon me a moment, Doctor, as I attach the contact clamp.
That's it. Thank you.
Did I have to come all the way down from the city to play guinea pig for you?
I'm sure you'll forgive me in just a few moments.
- We're ready, Professor.
- The moon.
Perfect.
- Just as though we'd ordered it.
- Close those curtains.
Give me the shivers.
Moon shining right in my face.
- Oh, no, no. No, leave them alone.
- Close them!
- Shall I?
- All right, you may close them, Wells.
Now, listen, please, to what I have to say.
One of us in this room may be a murderer.
A murderer who killed by the light of a full moon, leaving his victim's body mutilated.
A cannibal.
Evidence shows the killer has two hands.
Therefore, only Wells is eliminated.
So I shall ask him to work the apparatus.
Wells? Wells? How about me?
A hopeless paralytic.
Silence, please, Professor.
Wells, will you take your place outside in the recording cabinet?
Yes, Doctor.
I'm going to leave you for a moment now, while I check the variability of your blood reactions.
I suggest that you remain silent during my absence.
Wells, the young quack.
Had him for an intern before he could grow a beard.
If you ask me, I think Dr. Xavier is using very unethical methods.
Necessity has no ethics, sir.
Gentlemen, I am now turning on the 100-milliampere, high-frequency coil.
Your pulses are connected with the magnetic rotators, and each variation of your heartbeat reaction is amplified 4,000 times.
The rotor of the electrostatic machine is connected in multiple series with a bank of glass-plate condensers, and the discharge causes irradiations to the thermal tubes, which, in turn, indicate your increased pulse rate and nerve reactions.
We can proceed now.
One moment, Doctor.
Were the murdered women attacked?
Does your mind never run into any other channel?
What do you mean by that statement?
I mean that your sadistic tendencies may someday carry you too far,
Dr. Haines.
- You, you...
- Silence, gentlemen, please.
Now, it is my theory that one of us in the past, through dire necessity, was driven to cannibalism.
The memory of that act was hammered like a nail into the mind of that man.
Shrewd and brilliant, he could conceal his madness from the human eye.
Even from himself.
But he can't conceal it from the eyes of the radio sensitivity.
Every time his heart beats from mental excitement, the thermal tubes will betray him.
You are all now connected with these tubes. I am myself.
But I alone know which tube is yours.
Your heart beats are being reflected before you.
Doctor, I protest!
As the heart beats faster and faster, so does that red liquid begin to pulse and rise until terror takes hold of the subject, and the liquid rises to the very top of the tube.
He whose tube does that is the guilty man.
Here are a line of wax figures, lifelike reproductions of the pitiful victims, people whose lives were snuffed out and whose bodies were torn to satisfy the desires.
First, a woman of the streets, killed in the tenement district.
Her body found late at night in a gutter.
The next victim, a middle-aged woman, killed just before dawn as she was on her way to market.
Her bleeding body found under a dock by the waterfront.
Then, a dope fiend, strangled and mutilated in the doorway of a dance hall.
Next, a beautiful young girl, violently killed as she lay on a hospital bed recovering from an illness.
Oh, I'm so afraid. I'm shaking like a leaf.
Keep quiet. Get ready.
Watch.
You're about to see reenacted the murder of the killer's latest victim.
An old scrubwoman.
She's coming home from work. It's late.
A full moon shines down upon her.
She's passing through an alleyway when suddenly a terrible figure steals out, starts creeping towards her.
As old Annie stoops to pick up a newspaper, the figure suddenly takes her throat in his powerful hands.
Get your hands off me, Otto.
You're hurting my throat.
- Turn on the lights!
- Someone's coming in the room!
Stop it, stop it, I can't stand any more!
Xavier, turn on the lights!
I can't get my breath.
- The lights!
- Look at that tube.
It's a success. The guilty man is...
The guilty man is Rowitz.
Rowitz. Look, what's happened to him?
- He's been murdered.
- Let me see.
What's the matter? What has happened?
Stabbed in the base of the brain.
Murdered like all the other
Moon Killer victims.
- Who was sitting on his left side?
- I was, but I didn't see anything.
I was watching the experiment.
Duke, you're walking!
I walked. You saw me.
You saw me, I walked.
I walked.
- You walked? You faker, you killed him.
- Quiet, Haines.
Don't you recognize hysteria reaction when you see it?
- Otto, help him.
- Take it easy, Doctor.
You'll need all your strength for your work tonight.
Wells? Where's Wells?
The contacts are broken.
Why doesn't he come in?
Take him to another room.
Wells! Wells!
Wells! Wells!
Wells!
Wells! What's wrong, man?
I don't know. The lights went out.
Someone called my name.
I started for the laboratory, and someone struck me.
Oh, this is terrible!
Easy, now. Let me help you.
I will be all right in just a moment.
Watch your head.
Are you sure you heard no one approaching the room when we started the test?
No one. Nothing unusual happened until I was struck.
Father, something terrible has happened to Dr. Rowitz.
- I just saw him...
- Now, Joanne, dear, be calm.
Dr. Rowitz has met with an accident.
- I wish you'd go back to your room.
- He's dead?
You can't do anything here, Joanne.
It's best that you go back to your room.
- Your father will explain everything later.
- Now, come, Joanne. Come.
Doctor. Doctor.
- What is it, Haines?
- There's someone hiding in this closet.
What?
Another one? Who is it?
He's the young man who was at the house today.
He fainted.
- Some water, Otto, quickly.
- Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of having something on hand
- for just such an occasion, sir.
- Thank you.
Here, young man, drink this.
How's that, huh?
It's not bad. How much do you pay for it?
He's all right now.
What were you doing in that closet?
- Hiding.
- Who are you?
Lee Taylor, The Daily World.
You wouldn't give me a break, so I had to take it.
- You're lying.
- Don't be absurd.
He is a newspaper man.
He's the one who printed the story about you in yesterday's World.
I'm sorry. You see, I had to get the story.
I was hiding in there, and everything was going great, when all of a sudden, well, I guess I just fainted.
It's gonna be kind of tough if I have to lug smelling salts around with me the rest of my life.
Yes, well, newspaper man or not, you're an impostor.
I don't like your methods.
I shall hand you over to the police.
- Otto...
- That suits me.
I'll phone my story in from the police station.
- You'll phone no story.
- Father, let me talk to him, will you?
I can't let this story get out now.
It'd ruin everything.
But, Father, please let me talk to him.
Mr. Taylor.
Just in case.
- You're not gonna let him go?
- Certainly not. Otto, watch him.
Don't let him get near a phone or leave this house.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no, no. I'm absolutely all right.
Now don't...
Don't you worry about me.
I gotta dash off to my newspaper.
- See, they won't wait.
- Mr. Taylor.
You don't have to report to the paper what you've just seen, do you?
I'm sorry, but I've got to.
You see, this is the most sensational case that's broken in six months...
I know. But can't you wait?
Won't you give Father a chance to find out who's doing it?
What difference does it make to the public what happens or how he does it so long as he catches him?
It makes a lot of difference.
The public want to read about it.
The more sensational it is, the more the son-of-a-guns love it.
Is that all you think about?
Sensationalism?
Don't you ever think about people's feelings?
Can't you realize what a scandal would do to my father's institution?
Certainly I can, but don't you realize that I'm in a hard-boiled racket?
Then, why don't you help us instead of making it so much more difficult for us?
Aren't we going through enough trouble?
Look at the trouble I've been through to get this story.
I lay down at the morgue with a bunch of stiffs.
I looked at a lot of goofy guys.
I let a dumb policeman...
Will you at least stay the rest of the night and talk it over with Father in the morning?
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll hold off on this story, and I'll stay, if you let me have breakfast with the family in the morning.
I think it can be arranged.
Father usually has breakfast at 7:30.
- And you?
- Oh, I am lazy. I have mine at 9:00.
Oh, you have no idea how lazy I am.
- Could I have mine at 9:00?
- Possibly.
And will you take me for a swim afterwards?
- A swim?
- At the beach.
If you're so helpless you can't find the water, you've no business in it.
But I like the water and...
I am sorry, miss,
I had no intention of disturbing you.
That's okay, Otto.
- There's old man bad luck again.
- I am sorry.
That's all right, Otto. I'm glad you're here.
Mr. Taylor's staying for the night.
I'd like you to prepare a room for him.
I have already done so, miss.
May I suggest that you do not disturb your father any further tonight?
- He is very tired.
- That's a good idea, Otto.
Are you going swimming with me in the morning?
No, thanks. Good night.
What will you do if I start to sink and yell for help?
Throw you an anvil. Good night.
This way, sir.
- Do you sleep very soundly, sir?
- Like a rock.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Why?
Because this is a very strange house.
- You're telling me.
- This way, if you please.
Father.
Father.
Father?
Father!
Joanne.
What are you doing here?
Well, dear, I just wanted to be sure that the incision was made by a brain scalpel.
Come.
- Professor Haines.
- Haines, why are you here?
I couldn't sleep.
So I came down here to make a more thorough examination of the body.
Professor, I...
Father, will you please come to bed?
All right, darling, now, you run along, and I'll be right up.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Professor, since we retired, this body has been...
- It has been...
- I know, but I don't want her to know.
What are you laughing about?
Oh, I know. This.
"Hate, friendship, love."
I don't blame you. It's so banal.
Like those postcards you buy. You know?
- Yes.
- About "I wish you were here," and "Two little doves billing and cooing."
Oh, no, really.
I was just thinking of something.
Of what?
- Come on, let's go in the water, shall we?
- Oh, no, no, no. Oh!
Water and I are not very good friends.
No, listen, when was a little kid,
I was very, very delicate, see?
- But very good looking.
- Yeah?
Yeah, well,
I won a first prize in a beauty parade.
- A baby parade at Asbury Park.
- How sweet.
But my mother was constantly dunking me in a tub of water, and I would get soap in my hair and in my eyes and my thing.
And water and I are not very good friends.
So, let's stay right here, huh?
Why not?
- There's somebody watching us.
- Where?
Look.
Oh, this is a terrible place.
I wish I were away from it.
If you only knew the things that have happened.
Listen. Forget that I'm a newspaperman.
I wouldn't betray your confidence.
Don't you see the only thing
I'm concerned about is your safety?
Are you worried about your father?
Yes, I am, terribly.
I wouldn't be. He's very tired.
He's working under a terrific strain.
- He's bound to show it.
- I know.
But last night, after everyone went to bed,
I saw my father bending over
Rowitz's body.
I saw... Oh, it's a terrible thought.
Oh, snap out of it.
Let's get dressed, and we'll...
Oh, we'll have breakfast.
That's right.
Well, I'll let you know, your eyes...
Your eyes are so blue, when I look into them...
That's right, Mamie.
You drink it, and you'll go right to sleep.
Nothing's going to hurt you.
She'll be all right as soon as this sedative has taken effect.
But the Doctor will be mad if I can't go through with it.
No, Father knows you're sick.
Of course he won't be angry with you.
Don't you worry about the experiment.
I'm sure the Doctor will make other arrangements.
I can't do it. I can't.
Something tells me if I go in that room tonight, tomorrow I'll be in my coffin.
Now, now. You just be quiet and forget about everything.
Oh, Miss Joan, something horrible is gonna happen.
I feel it in my bones.
Last night I dreamed
I was walking up to a casket, and when I looked inside, it was me.
Here, now, now, now.
You'll be getting hysterical again.
You'll be all right. Just go to sleep.
In the morning you'll feel fine.
I think we'd better leave her alone, Joanne.
No, Miss Joan, please don't go.
I don't wanna die.
I'm too young to die.
I've got too much to live for.
No.
- How's Mamie?
- She'll be all right. Don't worry.
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.
- It's quite all right.
What's become of that newspaper fellow?
Have you seen him?
Not since dinner.
He went directly to his room.
I've been looking for him everywhere.
I have a feeling that he's sneaked out and phoned the story of Rowitz's murder to the papers.
Publicity of that sort would ruin everything.
I don't think he'd do that.
He gave you his word.
I asked you not to let him out of your sight, dear.
- Why don't we look in his room?
- Oh, will no one obey me anymore?
Bad luck.
Skull, crossbones.
Death.
Hello?
- Oh, yes.
- Did you find him, dear?
- No, not yet, Dad.
- He's right here, sir.
- For me?
- The Commissioner of Police, sir.
Thank you.
- Hello, Commissioner.
- Look here, Doctor,
I've decided to send an undercover man up there tonight when you start your tests.
No, there won't be any tests tonight.
You'll have to give me another 24 hours.
Well, the woman I was depending upon was taken sick this afternoon, and it spoils all my plans.
Well, I'm sorry, but if things have gotten beyond your control,
I'm coming down there right away to take charge.
I'm in a tough spot.
I've got murder enough already to explain to the press and public.
- And if you think for a moment...
- One moment, Commissioner.
The 48 hours aren't up yet.
Well, I have to make some other arrangements.
Hold your men up just a little longer.
Give me one more chance, please.
All right!
I'll give you until midnight.
If you haven't got your man then,
I'm coming down there and slap the whole place under arrest.
Yank you all up to headquarters whether you like it or not.
Father, I want to help you.
You can't count on Mamie.
- Let me take her place.
- You?
No, I couldn't ask you to do that, Joan.
But please, Dad.
You get a squad car down to Blackstone Shoals at midnight, sharp.
Yes, sir.
Put the signal button on the control table and attach the wires to the thermal tubes.
Yes, Doctor.
What's the meaning of all this paraphernalia? Idiotic nonsense.
These chairs are too far apart to protect us from each other.
The contacts have all been checked.
You'll be ready in just a moment.
- Thank you, Wells.
- Doctor,
I still think you're making a mistake using Joanne in this experiment.
After all, gentlemen, this is my daughter's own suggestion.
I have no fear for her safety.
She's a sensible girl and knows what she's doing.
Yeah, and if she were my daughter, she wouldn't be up there on a bed in nothing but a nightgown just to satisfy some lunatic's experiment.
Professor Duke, don't criticize Joanne for her state of undress.
This argument is irrelevant.
Doctor, you forget that last night there was a murderer at large in this room.
And the murderer is still here.
I'm convinced.
But I've taken precaution against that.
You will each of you be handcuffed to your chairs, and you'll notice that each chair is bolted to the floor.
I refuse to submit!
You'll have us in straightjackets next!
I won't sit here handcuffed while you're running around loose.
I intend to be handcuffed also.
That will assure us there can't possibly be a repetition of last night's tragedy.
Oh, Wells.
They're very becoming to you, Haines.
It is time to get ready.
Aren't you afraid, miss?
There's only one thing I'm afraid of, Otto.
That's Father's health.
He's been working so hard, and lately he seems so strange.
The human mind will only stand so much.
We are all a little strange up here.
That's why I want Father to get away from here.
He needs a long rest.
He's promised me that just as soon as this is over, he'll go abroad with me.
You are right, miss.
Don't be afraid tonight.
Be sure you keep your eyes closed.
And relax.
Is that all, Doctor?
Yes, everything's set.
Now, go to the electric cabinet and do exactly as I told you.
Throw on the current the moment you are ready.
Yes, sir.
Doctor, has it ever occurred to you that Wells is free to do as he pleases?
I've guarded against that also.
Wells wishes to be treated the same as we are.
- Otto.
- Yes, sir?
Bolt all the doors so that no one can get in.
- The rest you know.
- Yes, sir.
Here are the keys.
Synthetic flesh.
Synthetic flesh.
And now you are about to witness one of the most gruesome crimes of the Moon Killer.
The death of Florence Johnson.
Murdered and horribly mutilated as she was lying weak and helpless on a hospital bed.
It's midnight, a private room at the Arch Hospital.
The nurse leaves the room for a moment.
The girl is alone when suddenly...
When suddenly the Moon Killer appears.
He crosses softly to his victim.
It's the killer!
- The killer!
- The killer!
Fight him off, Joan!
- Joanne!
- Wells, Wells.
Otto! Wells!
You idiots are calling for Wells? lt'll do you no good! There isn't any Wells!
Look, the keys. Well, take them.
It's Wells.
- Wells!
- Yes, it is Wells. But a new Wells.
A Wells whose name will live forever in the history of science.
Go! Run, Joanne! Run, run!
Joanne, get up, run!
The keys. The keys. The keys.
Look at his hand. Horrible!
Yes, look at it, a real hand.
It's alive. It's flesh.
Synthetic flesh.
For years I've been searching to find the secret of a living manufactured flesh.
And now I found it.
You I think I went to Africa to study cannibalism?
I went there to get samples of the human flesh that the natives eat.
Yes, that's what I needed.
Living flesh from humans for my experiments.
What difference did it make if a few people had to die?
Their flesh taught me how to manufacture arms, legs, faces that are human!
I'll make a crippled world whole again.
Doctor, your name will be remembered.
You've given your life, everything to science.
All but one thing, and now you're gonna give even that to science.
Your daughter.
Oh, if only I were not powerless here in chains.
Run!
Fight him off, Joanne!
Fight him off. Save her!
Joanne! Run! Run!
Club him! Club him!
- Joanne!
- Where'd he go?
Oh, Father! Father!
- Joanne!
- Oh, Father.
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm not.
- Lee!
- Yes.
- Lee!
- Wells. Where's Wells?
What happened to him?
Calm down. He won't ever come back.
I hit him with a lamp.
It was a long throw, but...
You know, I used to be a first baseman in high school.
You know, that old peg over to third.
Take a look at him.
- Are you hurt, Lee?
- I'm all right.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm so glad. Because you... I want to...
I better keep my mind on my work.
You say you can't understand me?
I'm talking too fast?
You'd be talking fast, too, if you'd been through what I've been through.
Boy, am I out. Now listen, listen, Willard,
I want you to give Dr. X full credit for trapping him.
Dr. X. Now I'll call you back in five minutes with more details.
More to follow, more to...
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
I can't tell you how grateful I am for all that you've done for us.
Oh, you've got my heart going a mile a minute.
Your heart? Oh, I'm so glad.
Wait a minute.
Take this to the society editor.
It is rumored that, on her return from Europe,
Miss Xavier will have a very important announcement to make concerning a very promising and prominent young newspaperman.
More later.
Say, tell me how in the world did you ever overpower that terrible monster?
Oh, I...
In the third round, I found out that he was very ticklish in a certain spot.
But I haven't found your weakness.
- Don't you know?
- You don't mean...
Come here to me.
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
English
- That's got you.
- Let's have a look here.
Perhaps you've got me, perhaps you ain't.
- What's that?
- Don't know, I'm sure.
It's your sister.
The petition, have you heard yet?
It- It was rejected.
Well, that's that.
Paul. Paul, listen to me.
You can't give up hope.
- I haven't.
- Oh, what's the use?
- Listen. Geoffrey Richmond has arranged-
- What can he do?
He's been our best friend through all this horrible time.
Now he's arranged for me to meet the home secretary today.
Don't you see how different it will be to talk to them personally?
I'll make them see that they can't-
I'm an ungrateful devil.
I hope she won't be much longer.
We've got to be at the home secretary's office by 12:30.
I don't think it'll do much good, Richmond... though it was decent of you to arrange the interview.
- How is he?
- I think he's a little more hopeful now.
- Shouldn't we be starting?
- Yes, we can just do it.
Miss Gray, every particle of evidence in this case... has been thoroughly sifted... finally before the court of appeal.
There is therefore nothing that can be done to help your brother.
You must understand that in this matter
I am merely the mouthpiece of the state.
But we're supposed to be civilized.
Surely there must be some way of stopping the state from committing murder.
State? Murder?
Isn't it murder if the state kills an innocent man?
Miss Gray, your brother has been tried and found guilty.
The court of appeal sustained the original verdict...
and a petition for reprieve has been rejected.
There is absolutely nothing to be done.
The law must take its course.
I- I've every sympathy, of course, for you.
- Here, Miss Gray, drink this.
- Let me have that.
Thank you.
I'm all right now.
I hope everyone will forgive me for behaving like this.
Hadn't you better rest longer, Miss Gray?
No, thank you.
I'm perfectly all right.
- Will you take me home now, Neil?
- You sure you're all right, dear?
Yes. Only ashamed of myself.
May I lend you my car?
No, thank you.
Neil will drive me.
- Thank you again.
- I wish I could do something that would really help.
Oh, you've been wonderful,
Geoffrey.
Oh, Mr. Kemp, was that Gray's sister who just went out with those gentlemen?
- Yes. Poor child.
- Fancy such a sweet girl like that... having such a fiend for a brother.
That dreadful knife.
They say the head was almost severed from the body.
That will do,
Miss Judson.
You know, I have the most curious feeling about the Gray case.
- Really, Mr. Kemp?
- That poor child's faith makes me wonder... whether, in spite of all the evidence, there could have been a mistake.
I wish that I had the power to help her.
Yes, Sir Lionel.
- Close the Barstow files today.
- Yes, sir.
Has Inspector Chan arrived?
No, sir, Mr. Chan is not here yet.
- Excuse, please. Observe humble presence.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
Sir Lionel,
Mr. Chan has just come in.
- Show him in at once.
- Certainly, Sir Lionel.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
I didn't hear you come in.
Excuse silent movement.
Habit of profession.
Yes. If you will come with me, the home secretary will see you immediately.
Thank you so much.
Inspector Chan, Sir Lionel.
Was that the Chinese detective who caught
Barstow in Honolulu and brought him over here?
Yes, a wonderful piece of detective work.
The British government, Mr. Chan, is therefore very deeply indebted to you.
Much honored to be of humble service to British lion.
It's remarkable, Mr. Chan, how you ever suspected Barstow.
He puts up an excellent front.
Front seldom tell truth.
To know occupants of house, always look in backyard.
- Provided there is one.
- Excuse.
Every front has back... and little things tell big story, even in this room.
Why, what do you mean?
Today you have had most distressing interview... with lady.
Much disturbed lady who is very anxious.
That's quite true.
How did you arrive at that?
Observe, please.
Tearing hands suggest torn heart.
You certainly have sharp eyes, Mr. Chan.
Humble eyes have much practice.
It just bears out what our chief inspector of the police told me today.
We were speaking of the Martin case.
He said no other detective in the world could have solved it.
Extravagant praise.
But thank you so much.
And now, Mr. Chan, perhaps you'll tell me... if there's anything we can do to assist you in your journey back to Honolulu.
Very grateful, but all passport mysteries have been solved.
Hello? Knightsbridge 4243?
Miss Gray, please.
Oh.
This is Sir Lionel Bashford's private secretary speaking.
Would you ask Miss Gray to call me immediately she returns?
Thank you. Yes.
- Mr. Chan?
- That is humble name.
I- I'm Pamela Gray.
Uh, a friend sent me to see you.
I must speak to you.
Much regret, but no time.
In one hour catch train for boat to Honolulu.
Please, I'm desperate.
I implore you at least to listen to me!
Please to enter.
Mr. Chan, I'm in the most terrible trouble.
There's no one in London- no one in the world who can help me except you.
World is large.
Me lowly Chinaman.
Oh, you-you must help me.
You are much troubled.
You rest.
You-You know this trouble?
Yes. My name is Howard.
Neil Howard.
- Miss Gray and I are engaged to be married.
- Oh.
That is good.
If you will honor other room with your presence.
Now you stay here and rest, dear.
I'll explain everything to him.
Thank you.
Excuse, please, but I must catch train.
You talk, I listen.
Begin at best place- beginning.
You must have read in the papers about the stable murder case.
Only headlines.
Miss Gray is Paul Gray's sister- his only relative, in fact.
- That is bad.
- I can give you the facts very briefly.
The murder was committed three months ago in the stables... of a Mr. Richmond's country house in Retfordshire.
Gray was Richmond's hunt secretary.
Hamilton was the murdered man.
He was a weekend guest.
At the trial the circumstantial evidence against Gray was overwhelming.
But his sister is utterly convinced of her brother's innocence...
- and therefore she thinks that-
- One moment, please.
- You are?
- Oh, I should have explained.
Uh, I'm a barrister.
What you would call an attorney.
- I defended Gray at the trial.
- You have appealed case?
Yes, but in England, there's only one appeal.
Gray's was rejected.
He is to be hanged in three days.
Then only way to save brother...
- is to prove someone else real murderer.
- Exactly.
And find him before
9:00 on Friday morning.
Now- Now 4:00 Tuesday.
Only 65 small hours.
Lady's faith in powers of humble self most puzzling.
Detective cannot work miracle.
Yet a miracle is the only thing that could save him.
One question, please.
Very important.
You yourself believe brother innocent?
Well, uh, is that question necessary?
Please.
Please.
You believe brother innocent?
No.
Of course, I-
- You!
- Pamela!
Don't try to excuse yourself!
I never want to see you again!
Pamela, wait!
Well, it's been a great season,
Jardine, don't you think?
- Yes. I'm sorry it's nearly over.
- So am I.
You don't know how swell it is to be back here again.
You Americans mustn't get too keen on hunting or there'll be no foxes left for us.
- Or horses either. What?
- I didn't say anything.
- Where is the meet on Thursday?
- Here.
That means a good day.
And just the country that suits Hellcat.
By the way, Mary, I've decided that you're not to ride that mare again.
She's nappy.
Isn't she, Jardine?
Definitely.
Not a woman's horse.
Reluctantly compelled to agree.
The mare is incorrigibl- incorrig-
She's mine and the best hunter in the country.
Who are you to give me orders anyway?
Your future husband, darling.
Had you forgotten?
Listen. Give you a word of advice.
Never get married.
Bunny, please be quiet.
See what I mean?
Well, in spite of advice,
I'm still going to marry you.
And in a month you'll do as I tell you.
You're just a bully.
I'll go and find someone who really appreciates me.
And I'll help you.
- May I have a word with you, sir?
- What is it, Phillips?
- I agree with Richmond on two counts.
- Mm-hmm.
- One: You're adorable.
- Jerry, please.
Two: You shouldn't ride that mare. She's crazy.
Another bully.
I can't bear the thought of your ever being hurt.
- Garton, excuse us a moment, will you?
- Certainly.
- What's the matter, Geoffrey?
- Pamela's here. She wants to see us at once.
I wonder what's happened.
- Pamela!
- Mary.
- What's the matter, Pamela?
- I hope you don't mind my coming here like this.
Oh, my dear child. You couldn't have done anything better, could she, Mary?
- Why, of course not. - I- I feel as if the bottom had dropped out of everything.
- What's happened, Pam?
- Neil thinks Paul's guilty.
- What?
- It's impossible. Why, at the trial he-
He's never believed
Paul was innocent.
And today he told someone who might have helped.
And now I've got to start all over again.
Oh, my dear.
Geoffrey, what can we do?
My dear, don't worry.
We'll think of something.
I tell you what. You take her upstairs.
Give her the west room.
Then we'll get rid of everyone who isn't staying as quickly as we can.
And then the three of us will talk this thing over properly. Come on, dear.
- Oh, Phillips.
- Sir?
- Miss Gray is staying. She will have the west room.
- Yes, sir.
- See to it that she's not disturbed on any account.
- Very well, sir.
Good evening.
Miss Gray is here?
- Miss Pamela Gray?
- Miss Gray has retired.
If you wish to see her, you must return in the morning.
- Highly important I see her now.
- Miss Gray has retired.
There are strict orders she's not to be disturbed. Return in the morning.
Thank you so much.
Have a nice cup of tea, miss.
It'll make you feel ever so much better.
- No, I don't want anything.
- Not a nice hot cup of tea, miss?
Oh, do.
Please leave me alone.
Saints alive!
Excuse, please.
- Mr. Chan.
- Don't let him get his hands on you, miss!
Don't be stupid, Perkins.
I know the gentleman. Now go, please.
And don't say anything to anyone.
Thousand apologies.
Unceremonious entry due to butler's doubts of humble self.
But why are you here?
- I have seen your brother.
- And you believe?
That what you think may be truth.
Then you are going to help?
Humble endeavors will be in that direction.
Mr. Phillips! Mr. Phillips!
We'll all be dead in our beds!
- What's the meaning of this conduct?
- What'll we do?
- There's an horrible murdering man climbing all over the house.
- Have you been drinking?
I have not! Didn't I see him with me own eyes climbing into Miss Gray's window?
- What?
- So help me, it's the truth. And he's hypnotizing her.
I think most of the people who testified at the trial are here.
There's Mr. Richmond.
Oh, Phillips, take Mr. Chan into the study.
Very well, madam.
This way, please.
Thank you so much.
- Hey, there!
- Oh, hello.
- I say, what about a little drink?
- No, thanks, Bunny.
- Well, what about committing a slight spot of "hoppery"?
- Sorry, Bunny, she's dancing with me.
- What, again?
Oh, Bunny, please be quiet.
Can't we sit this one out?
I want to talk to you.
I thought you wanted to dance.
I just wanted to be with you, that's all.
I wish you wouldn't go on like this, Jerry.
- I can't help myself. You're so-
- Please, Jerry.
- What's the matter, dear?
- I'll explain later.
We've gotta get everyone here who gave evidence at Gray's trial into the study.
Will you get rid of the rest? Make any excuse to get rid of them while I collect the others.
Yes, dear.
And now you all know who Mr. Chan is and why he's here.
And I feel certain that you'll all give him every possible assistance.
Thank you so much.
If you will all sit, please.
Now, please, uh-
If Mr. Gray not guilty... then some other person is murderer.
Only method to save Mr. Gray... is to find this other quick... in 57 hours.
Now, please... tell briefly events of sad night.
Well, after dinner Gray came in here and Hamilton followed.
Please excuse.
They both live in this house?
No, Paul Gray was my hunt secretary and stayed here during the hunting season... but Captain Hamilton was just down for the weekend.
Captain Hamilton was soldier?
No, air force. But he and Gray had never got on very well together.
- They were always-
- Excuse, please.
Ancient history not necessary.
I'm sorry. On the night of the murder...
Hamilton followed Gray into this room.
There was no one else here, but they were heard quarreling violently.
- Who heard?
- Mr. Fothergill...
Major Jardine and Mr. Garton.
That's right. Devil of a row.
Hamilton shouting.
Gray shouting.
Sounded like a politic- a polit- a political demonstration.
Bunny, please sit down!
Thank you so much.
- Other witness, please.
- Yes.
They were quarreling, all right.
I heard them from the hall.
It was about that chorus girl.
- Excuse, please. Only events.
- Sorry.
And third witness?
Where's Garton?
He wasn't anywhere about.
I sent Phillips to look for him.
Where could he have gone?
Do you want to wait?
No. Time is enemy here.
I think Mr. Jardine... can tell events that took place after quarrel.
Well, I, um-
I thought I'd better stop the row before any of the women heard.
I was just outside the door.
- Fothergill was behind me.
- That's right.
Continue, please.
Through the door
I heard Hamilton say...
"Remember what
I've told you."
And then Gray shouted something.
And then I heard those windows...
opening and slamming shut.
Opening and slamming shut.
- Yes. You enter?
- No.
Obviously one of them had left the room and I-
I decided to mind my own business.
Admirable British quality.
And, uh, next event, please?
Two hours later Garton and Jardine went over to the stables... and found Hamilton's body.
As they were walking over, Garton noticed
Gray coming back towards the house.
I wonder where the deuce Garton is.
Why were you going to stable so late at night?
One of Garton's horses was sick.
We were going to have a last look at it before going to bed.
I understand.
Then nobody see Hamilton alive after bang of window?
No.
I haven't been able to find Mr. Garton, sir... but I'll continue to look for him.
Thank you so much.
There is something which belongs here.
Is it twin of this?
Yes.
And murderer use missing knife?
It was lying by the body.
The police have it now.
I see.
There were fingerprints?
No. It was maintained that Gray wore gloves.
Strange that crime of passion should be committed with gloved hand.
Yes, but the prosecution held that this was a premeditated crime...
- and unfortunately a pair of gloves were found-
- Wait, please.
If Mr. Gray not murderer... must forget all evidence at trial.
No time to expose lies.
Must expose truth.
Now, please, would much like... everybody to go with me to stables.
Stables? What for?
Crime to be reconstructed.
Method of French police.
Sometime very good.
Garton was over there when he saw Gray disappear behind that hedge.
And, uh, where was body found?
In the stables near the end box.
I see. Please, in absence of Mr. Garton... you and Mr. Jardine help proceed with reconstruction.
Certainly. Jardine.
Let us proceed. Uh-
Humbly suggest you be Hamilton, you be murderer.
It seems like a lot of childish nonsense to me.
Look here, Richmond, do we really have to do this?
Mr. Chan is in charge, Jardine.
Maybe I not clear.
Crime to be-
- Yes, I understand, I understand.
- Thank you so much.
Here, here!
What's all this?
It's all right, Lake.
You can go back to bed.
Very well, sir.
Beg pardon, sir.
- Who?
- That's Lake, my stud groom.
Regret do not understand
English, only American.
Well, he's my chief groom- my head lad- boss horseman.
Oh, I catch.
- And now.
- What the deuce!
Only knife from study.
You are murderer.
You are Hamilton.
Kindly go into stable.
Right.
Please take.
Look here, this is outrageous!
Take knife, please.
Now, you go in.
Pretend to strike... as prosecution say real Hamilton was struck.
Then leave knife where you find real knife.
Now, please, proceed with murder.
Steady, old girl, steady.
- Can't we get out of here and do this somewhere else?
- See what your nonsense has done?
What troubles noble animal?
Lake! Lake!
Here, steady, old girl. Whoa. Steady. Easy.
- Hurry, Lake!
- Whoa there!
Steady!
What's all the noise, you old cow?
That's Lady Mary Bristol's horse.
See what happens with your foolery?
Why, you might have gone-
That'll do, Jardine.
Hellcat will be quiet now that Lake's here.
He can do anything with her.
Control of noble animal by lowly man.
Most interesting.
That light, it was on when you find body of Hamilton?
No, Garton switched it on after.
Then not on now.
If you think I'm going through with this tomfoolery now-
The least we can do is to follow instructions.
Oh, all right, all right.
I wonder if they've forgotten all about us? I wonder. Hmm?
Come on, Jardine.
Oh, Betty, please be quiet.
Look here, I've had about enough of this.
Please, now drop knife in place where you find other knife.
- That is right?
- Yes.
Please rise.
When can I do something?
- What's going on here?
- I'll explain.
It's the "reconstriction" of the "crim."
No, the re- "reconstruction-striction" of the "crim-" the crime.
You know. It's French.
Practically infallible.
You know, you act what's happened... and then you know who's done it, see?
- Oh, Bunny, please.
- I won't!
Where have you been,
Jerry?
Just walking.
Then in my room.
Heard an awful racket in the stables.
What horse is cutting up?
Hellcat. She always gets like that if Lake isn't with her.
Where have you been?
We've been looking all over the place for you.
This is Mr. Garton.
Do you want to speak to him?
- Not now. All this is finished.
- Right. Shall we go back?
Wait, please.
One question.
Mr. Gray was secretary to hunt.
Is there new secretary?
- Yes, Major Jardine.
- Oh.
Please, take ladies and gentlemen back to house.
- I stay here.
- On to something?
Want to talk to number one horseboy.
- Right. Can you find your way back?
- Yes, thank you.
All right, everybody, come along.
Mr. Chan will join us when he's ready.
- Excuse, please.
- What do you want?
- I am very curious man.
- I ain't got no time to waste answering questions!
I've got my sleep to get, the same as other people.
It is unasked question which prevent sleep.
What are you tryin' to do?
We don't like foreigners messing around here.
Englishman mind own business.
Not always Chinaman.
If you've got anything to ask me, ask me.
And get it over.
Not as though I'll answer!
Three questions only.
Very simple.
First: You were here upstairs in your apartment when murder was done?
Apartment. That ain't no blooming apartment. That's me loose box.
You were in this, uh, box when murder was done?
No. Why don't you read the newspapers?
I wasn't here because it was me night off.
I was out, see?
With me girl, see?
I can prove it.
- I did prove it!
- I understand.
You make holiday.
Thank you.
Now, second question.
This noble animal, he was here in same place on night of murder?
If you mean Hellcat, she's a mare.
Yes, of course she was here.
She's always here!
- What of it?
- I see. Thank you.
Third question.
You did not then see body of Hamilton lying there?
I tell you I wasn't here!
I was out!
It was me night off!
Ain't it enough for you?
Yes, enough for present.
Perhaps more later.
Thank you so much.
Mr. Chan.
Tell me, have you found out anything?
Yes.
- Something I do not understand.
- What is it?
You were in house here... the night
Hamilton is killed?
Yes, I was here for the weekend. Why?
Did anyone in house hear noise... from noble animal the night of murder?
Oh, you mean a horse cutting up?
No, I remember no noise, and I haven't heard anyone else say there was.
Perhaps it wouldn't be heard.
Oh, yes, Mr. Garton hear noise from house just now.
Really?
No noise was mentioned at trial?
- No.
- Very good.
Tell me what all this means, please.
- Don't you realize there's less than three days before- - I know.
I will tell you.
Certain noble animal,
Cat of Hell... always cut up when strangers near... unless Lake is present.
But noble animal make no noise... when Hamilton killed outside its apartment.
Oh, I see. Yes.
Yes, and Lake was supposed to be out that night.
Mr. Chan, have you spoken to him?
A little, but enough.
- What'd he say?
- Many words meaning nothing.
- Except that he is afraid.
- You mean you think he is really-
Thoughts are like noble animal- unchecked, they run away causing painful smashup.
But what are you going to do? Aren't you going to see him now and make him tell?
No.
- Later, after sunrise.
- But why waste time?
Oh, please, don't you see how little time there is? Why must we wait?
Lake now with himself.
Alone. He thinks.
He is afraid.
He will be more afraid.
More fear, more talk.
More talk, more chance for us.
What else can you expect but to have your throat cut when there's murdering men... climbing all over the house?
Roger said he looked like a nice, kind gentleman.
Kind? He's a sneaking, murdering-
Look at him now, creeping about.
Why did he leave the house at 6:00 and pretend he wasn't coming back till afternoon?
Oh.
- Good morning.
- Why, what-what are you doing down here?
What I am asked to do.
You-You mean you're helping Pam- Miss Gray?
That is humble endeavor.
But may I return question to giver?
What you do here?
Well, I- I wanted to see Pamela, but I was thrown out.
- Thrown out?
- I mean, she wouldn't see me. She gave orders.
But you're still here.
Yes, I-
Yes, like the fool that I am, I-
Oh, what's the use of trying to explain?
You wouldn't understand.
No, there are many things
I do not understand.
- What do you want?
- To see, please, Mr. Lake and talk to him.
You can see him, but you can't talk to him.
How this?
Suicide. And what's it got to do with you?
There's no need to take that tone, Thacker.
This is Mr. Chan. He's staying with me.
He's a detective himself.
Chan, this is Detective Sergeant Thacker of the county police.
- Delighted to meet.
- How are ya?
What on earth induced Lake to kill himself?
- When you talked to him last night, did he-
- One moment, please.
Yes, it is all there.
Nearly good imitation.
- Imitation? What do you mean?
- Murder.
- Murder?
- Mr. Chang enjoys his joke.
Murder not very good joke.
Quite unfunny.
I don't understand what your idea is.
No idea. Facts.
Little things tell story.
See? Money talks.
What are you driving at?
Man in lowly station... does not kill self when possessing much money.
Aren't you rather jumping at conclusions?
No. Conclusions jump at me.
Note man's hand.
Observe. Gun held with finger on trigger.
But death wound in center of brow.
Only way to make that wound... use thumb on trigger.
- So.
- By Jove, you're right.
To make that wound with... finger on trigger, impossible.
But who on earth would want to murder Lake?
Answer to that question highly desirable.
I see what you're driving at, Mr. Chang.
You mean it wasn't suicide.
That was humble deduction.
I must make a note of this.
That's our method here- make notes of everything.
Large sum of money.
Wound, center of forehead.
Humbly suggest only authorities should know this not suicide.
I don't quite understand.
Let murderer feel safe.
That's a good idea.
Dead against regulations, sir.
I'll have to take this up with the chief constable.
It's all right. I'll speak to him.
He'll understand.
- Hello, Geoffrey.
- Hello.
They told us in the stables about poor Lake.
Awful thing.
Anything we can do?
No. Nothing, thanks.
Everything's been done.
I'd have said he was the last fella in the world to kill himself.
- If you're sure we can't help- - Quite sure, thanks. Everything's been taken care of.
Thank you.
I noted it all down,
Mr. Chang.
Thank you so much.
Oh. Mr. Phillips.
- What do you want?
- Have they told you about Lake?
I heard that the unfortunate man had committed suicide.
Suicide or not, it's death.
Don't forget the words of Alice Perkins.
There'll be death in this house until we get rid of that... creeping, murdering foreign man.
This is no time for gossip.
Go on about your work.
Who's gossipin'?
- Oh, Phillips.
- Yes, madam.
- Have you seen Mr. Chan?
- No, madam. I have not.
But, uh... lowly Chinaman here.
Saints alive!
Really, madam.
I had no idea the, uh... gentleman was here.
Habit of being sometimes invisible.
Very useful.
Oriental. Not British.
Is there anything further that you require, madam?
- No, thank you. Nothing.
- Very well, madam.
- Mr. Chan, have you seen Lake?
- Yes.
What did he say?
What did you find out?
Nothing. He is dead.
What?
Someone killed him, trying to make it seem as if he killed himself.
Lake dead?
Then all that you hoped for last night-
Oh, I told you to see him then.
I'm sorry.
I was wrong.
- We must start again.
- Start again?
With less than 48 hours?
Oh, I wish to heaven
I'd never seen you.
You give me hope and then-
Hope is not gone.
Lake cannot talk, but death talks.
It tells something we did not know before.
That real murderer of Hamilton is here.
Oh.
- It does.
- For lowly man, Lake had too much money.
Hush money... given by murderer.
When I frightened Lake, murderer must kill.
Couldn't we tell them about Lake's murder?
And make them see that this proves that Paul is innocent?
Wait, please.
Murder of Lake proves nothing.
Except to us who believe your brother innocent.
But what are we going to do?
There's so little time.
I work here.
Your work is to see that brother is told of hope we have for him.
Yes.
Yes, you're right.
And thank you.
- Good morning, Phillips.
- Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Morning.
Want something?
I'm busy. A lot of hunt business to attend to.
Yes. I see.
Business of chasing fox.
Very interesting.
Yes. Last meet tomorrow.
Hmm.
Military training useful for business of chasing fox?
Now, what the deuce do you mean,
"military training"?
You are major.
Therefore soldier.
You are hunt secretary.
Therefore I think perhaps-
Now look here, my good fellow.
In the first place, foxhunting has nothing whatever to do with the army.
- No?
- Second, I was never a soldier.
Third, would you mind not interrupting me?
So sorry, but understood major army title.
If you must know, I was in the air force, not the army.
Thank you so much.
- Pam!
- Paul, darling.
- What have you come for?
- To tell you that Mr. Chan has-
Has he found out anything?
What's he on to?
- Wait, darling. He has found out something.
- What is it?
- There's been another-
- Speak up, lady.
I'm sorry. Something's happened down at Geoffrey's.
Something that makes it certain that the real murderer is still there.
Has he told them at the home office?
If they knew-
His case isn't strong enough yet, Paul.
They wouldn't realize any connection with you.
But he knows.
Oh, Paul.
There's no time.
It's all useless.
Oh, but it isn't useless.
There is time.
Two days.
Not quite two days.
Why can't they kill me now?
Why do they make me wait?
Please, darling.
Please take hold of yourself.
Get out! Don't worry about me!
Don't think about me! I'm dead!
I've got a rope around my neck, and in 40 hours, they're gonna pull it tight...
- and my neck's gonna break, and I'll be dead, dead!
- Stop! Stop!
- For heaven's sake, stop!
- You best leave him be, miss.
- Do you really think I should go?
- Yes, miss.
He's much better when it's quiet-like in here... with just me and Bostock to look after him.
All right.
I'll go.
- Is Miss Gray with her brother?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you. I'll wait.
Pamela.
Please, dear.
I've got to talk to you.
Why wouldn't you see me this morning when I was down at Richmond's?
Please leave me alone.
But you've got to listen to me.
- You must give me a chance to explain.
- Let me go.
Haven't you done enough? Can't you understand
I never want to see you again?
But how could Lake's death possibly be connected with the Gray case?
Case like inside of radio- many connections, not all related.
Do you mean you've got something?
Much.
But do not know what is.
Frequent state of mind for detective.
I want to think you're right about Gray, but sometimes I-
Well, I can't imagine all that evidence was wrong.
Lot of evidence.
Too much.
You can lend automobile in morning?
- Why, of course. Where do you want to go?
- To airdrome at Farnwell.
Air force camp?
What on earth for?
Charlie Chan very curious man.
Want, uh, answer to many questions.
Yes, but what-
Oh, Geoffrey.
I've been looking for you.
- Good evening.
- Chan and I were just talking about-
Humbly suggest such topics not interesting at moment.
Excuse, please.
Don't think about it, dear.
But, Geoffrey, what's happening to us?
All these dreadful things one after the other.
- You mustn't worry so, Mary.
- But-
Well, I'm frightened. I-
I keep feeling some other dreadful thing's going to happen.
Oh, darling.
Don't be foolish.
But, Geoffrey, with poor Pam in the house...
I think it's awful to be leading our normal useless lives.
Why, we're even going to hunt tomorrow. It seems-
We're only doing exactly what Chan wants us to.
- I suppose I'm being really silly.
- No, darling.
You're being what you can't help being- a very lovely person.
Now, madame, bed for you.
It's going to be a hard day tomorrow.
What on earth?
Excuse, please.
When death enters window, no time for life to go by door.
- What do you mean?
- I will show you.
Intended for my address.
Very curious missile.
From strong air pistol.
Yes, but why should anyone want to-
Someone is afraid.
Here.
What's going on here?
Have been acting part of bull's-eye.
- I don't follow you, Mr. Chang.
- Somebody's just tried to kill Chan.
- What?
- We must have the grounds searched immediately.
- I'll call my men.
- Wait, please.
Whoever tried to kill humble self... has had much time to hide.
- Good night, Phillips.
- Good night, sir.
Now come on here.
Let's have a look at ya.
As I was coming up from the terrace,
I didn't see anybody... but I heard this drop.
- What's that?
- I think original home of this.
I must make a note of this,
Mr. Chang.
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?
Two of the constables are asking for Sergeant Thacker.
They've captured a man lurking in the grounds.
- Tell them to bring him in here.
- Very good, sir.
There you are, Mr. Chang.
My men got him after all.
Maybe.
Howard!
I don't know these affectionate gentlemen... but if they'd let me alone for a moment,
I might take off my hat.
You needn't hold him.
Who are ya?
Explain yourself.
Uh, surname: Howard.
Christian name: Neil.
Profession: Barrister-at-law.
Financial position: Sound.
Health: Good.
Social standing: Somewhat-
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I can't write as fast as that.
- Oh, this is ridiculous, Thacker.
- I'm very sorry, sir. I got my duty to do.
This man has got to explain why he's loitering about in your grounds at this time of night.
- Mr. Richmond's a friend of mine, and I-
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Excuse me, sir, but were you aware of this gentleman's presence in the, uh, vicinity?
I- I know
Mr. Howard well. He-
What is this? What's half the county police force doing here anyway?
The police are here because Lake's dead... and they are investigating his death.
And what's more, a murder has just been attempted in this room.
Immediately afterwards, you're arrested in the grounds... having no satisfactory explanation for your presence.
- I shall have to detain you.
- Excuse, please.
But Mr. Howard has business here.
Why? What do you know about it, Mr. Chang?
- He come to see me.
- To see you?
Certainly. I want private talk with Mr. Howard...
so I telephoned him this morning.
I see, Mr. Chang.
I see.
But why didn't he come to the house in the ordinary way?
Answer that.
- Well, I- I, uh-
- It is plain.
Mr. Howard is man of feeling.
He does not want to disturb household.
I must say I can't follow this, Mr. Chang.
- Well, it's perfectly simple, isn't it?
- I'm very sorry, sir.
I know my duty under regulations.
I shall have to detain this gentleman.
Please.
Before you make arrest... there is something you should see.
There is nothing to see.
- Well, what-
- Shh.
Not loud, please.
Want to talk to you privately.
I follow, Mr. Chang.
I follow.
Very smart trick,
Mr. Chang.
If you insist that marksman was Mr. Howard...
I insist whole affair one great big joke.
Meaning that you won't give evidence or make a charge, Mr. Chang?
You are good marksman,
Sergeant.
You hit bull's-eye.
Regulations are clear.
I ought to detain him.
If you want wild bird to sing, do not put him in cage.
Wild bird... sing... cage.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Colonel. How are you?
Of course it's true.
Richmond just told me so.
Under the circumstances, do you think we should hunt?
Yes. They particularly want us to go on as if nothing had happened.
Say, what's all the trouble? You fellows look as if you're going to a funeral or something.
Someone tried to kill
Chan last night.
- What?
- Yes. Shot at him with some sort of an air gun.
Through the window of that study.
Have they any idea who did it?
Apparently not.
It was very late and nobody was about.
- Why should they want to kill Chan?
- I haven't the remotest idea.
Thank you.
Oh, Phillips.
Have you seen Mr. Chan?
Not since 7:00,
Your Ladyship.
- He went away in the Rolls-Royce.
- Did he say when he'd be back?
- No, Your Ladyship.
- All right, Phillips. Thank you.
Mary, whatever's the matter?
You look as though something awful had happened.
Oh, I don't know what to do.
If only Chan had been here.
But what is it? What's happened?
Last night, just before I went to bed...
I happened to look out of my window, and... I saw someone.
It seemed strange at the time, but I didn't think anything of it until... just now
I overheard something.
But what is it?
If I leave a note for Chan, would you promise to give it to him as soon as he arrives?
Of course I will.
- Morning, master.
- Morning.
Well, Mr. Chan, what can I do for you?
You were here when there was unfortunate young officer, Hamilton... who was murdered?
- Yes, I was.
- He was good officer?
Excellent.
Splendid in the air and brilliant at theory.
He was quite an inventor too.
Inventor?
Very interesting.
What are things he invent?
Oh, small improvements.
Gadgets, you know.
Uh, one of them was the adaptation of the Merton gyroscopic stabilizer.
Do not understand, but, uh, sound useful.
I should say it was. It was taken up by the Air Ministry and is now in general use.
I see.
Can you say, please... when was last invention made by Hamilton?
Oh, let me see. Oh-
I think about 18 months ago.
No more inventions since?
No. About that time he got a lot of new outside interests.
Took up foxhunting.
Got tangled up with that girl and so on.
Been better for the lad if he had stuck to his work.
He was, uh... in habit of talking about invention work?
To you? To anyone?
No. He was a queer chap.
Kept pretty much to himself.
And not very popular with his brother officers.
- He had no friend?
- One.
Flight Commander King.
Commander King.
He is still here?
- Oh, yes.
- Uh, may I see him, please?
Yes.
Please think.
There is perhaps man's life on your answer.
There was one thing.
But I don't know how far he went with it.
This was big invention, yes?
He had a wild scheme for silencing warplanes.
Silencing warplanes.
You remember he do work on this, drew plans?
Not that I know of.
But he'd never show anything to anyone until he was sure it was right.
Other question, please.
None of this was mentioned at trial of Mr. Gray?
Why, no. Of course not.
Why should it? That had nothing to do with anything-
I don't catch your drift,
Mr. Chan.
Drift catch me.
Thank you so much.
But I tell you. Chan has made me realize that Paul is innocent.
- Oh, it's all so useless.
- But, Pam, dear.
Even if Paul is saved, I can't ever forget that you told Chan he was guilty.
- Suppose he believed-
- But I did that to help you.
I believed Paul was guilty.
But I didn't want anyone else to have the chance of making you believe it.
Oh, please understand.
I love you, and I-
I'm trying to help you.
Oh, Neil. My darling.
Then you-you do believe me?
Yes. But... don't you realize that there's less than a day and a night before they take Paul and-
Don't lose hope, dear.
I believe Chan's going to save him.
But there's so little time.
Only 22 hours.
Good morning.
I have looked for you.
- Oh, Mr. Chan. What-
- Wait, please.
- No time to lose. You have fast car?
- Yes.
You know this fox chase today, which way they go?
- I could make a good guess.
- You must guess right.
- You take me now?
- I'll get the car.
- Oh, Mr. Chan, what's happened?
- I return to house just now.
They give me this.
- What does she mean?
- Lady Mary in much danger.
If murderer find she know something, he will strike.
Remember Lake?
Remember attempt on humble self?
Must find lady at once.
- This is speedy automobile?
- I've got 120 out of it.
120? How very nice.
There you are.
Told you I'd find them.
And nearly find ancestors.
They must be going off to draw another cover.
What are you doing here, Chan?
Where is Lady Mary?
I don't know. I haven't seen her for the last 15 minutes.
- Say, Garton, where's Mary?
- I can't say.
I haven't seen her since we passed Old Spinney.
- Have you seen Mary?
- Perhaps she's cast a shoe.
The last I saw of her she was going strong.
- I say, where's Mary?
- I don't know.
Richmond!
- Hellcat, Mary- the chalk pit! Come on!
- What?
- Look at her. Right here.
- Oh!
There she is.
Look at her. Right here.
Look. We can get down around over the other side.
Great. Come on.
- Can't you tell me something?
- A serious fracture at the base of the skull.
With care and luck we may pull her through.
- There is a chance then?
- Oh, a very good one.
- Nurse.
- Yes?
Is there-
How is she?
I think she has a very good chance.
- Has she come to?
- Oh, no.
She'll be unconscious for at least 24 hours.
Only few hours to save Mr. Gray.
Therefore this conference necessary.
This is all nonsense.
You've got no facts.
Why, you're no nearer anything than you were when you first arrived.
Oh, yes.
I know why real murderer kill Hamilton.
You mean you know definitely that Gray didn't kill Hamilton?
- Yes.
- But Gray was the only person...
- that had a motive for killing him.
- You are wrong.
There was another who had big motive.
Today I find...
Hamilton had secret invention to silence warplanes.
What's all this got to do with the murder?
Plans of invention stolen to sell for much big money.
Hamilton find thief, then thief must kill.
- This is all wild theorizing.
- Let him go on, Jardine.
Remember. He's trying to save Gray's life.
Everything nice for murderer until I come.
Then certain people to be made quiet.
Lake because he knows truth.
Me because I near truth.
But where does this all lead to?
To this.
Someone here, in this room... is murderer.
This is just another of your asinine tricks.
You pretend to find out all sorts of things, but really you know nothing.
I know this: I can catch murderer if I find plans stolen from Hamilton.
But how would finding the plans prove anything?
On plans will be fingerprints.
And fingerprints will match those of someone here.
- Is he asleep?
- I don't know. Shut up.
I'm not asleep.
- What's the time?
- Pretty early.
- I said what's the time?
- Quarter to 5:00.
Quarter to 5:00.
5:00 to 6:00. That's one.
6:00 to 7:00. That's two.
7:00 to 9:00.
Four more hours.
Would you like anything, mate?
A cup of tea?
No, I don't think so.
No. I don't want anything.
What in the deuce do you want?
No noise, please.
I want your help.
It didn't seem like that to me when all the others were in here.
You looked at me as if I might be your man.
Much regret, but necessary to point suspicion to all.
I don't see what you expected to gain by telling everyone everything you know.
There is, uh, one thing
I have not told.
Today murderer tried to kill Lady Mary.
What do you mean?
Mary's accident?
No accident.
Alone with lady, murderer blinds eyes of noble animal.
- You mean-
- Tonight I examined defunct noble animal.
On face were dry tears.
And something else.
I wipe it off.
Mr. Howard take it to analyst.
He telephone me just now report.
It was pepper.
- Pepper?
- Yes.
- Who was it? Tell me!
- I do not know.
- That is why I want your help.
- Yes, but how?
Now murderer much afraid of fingerprints.
He will try to destroy plans.
We catch him then.
Do you mean you know where the plans are?
Downstairs.
Somewhere in study.
But that's impossible.
Attempt on my life made there.
Must have been nearing hiding place.
I see.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
Come with me to study.
We wait for murderer.
- Shh.
- What's the matter?
Look.
Someone has been here.
Perhaps we're too late.
I was here in this room before I go up to fetch you.
That was not opened.
Here. You watch.
Please excuse blank cartridges in pistol.
Stand back there. Stand back!
The police are in charge.
I find these plans earlier this evening... but regret no fingerprints.
Now fingerprints not necessary.
Thank you so much.
Geoffrey Richmond,
I arrest you on a charge of murder.
Better get him right,
Sergeant.
Richmond's an alias.
He's not even an Englishman.
His real name's Paul Frank.
And you?
You have real name?
I'm Captain Seton, military intelligence.
We've been after Frank for years.
We nearly caught him when he worked England before.
But this time he'd put us off with all this front.
- Very expensive front.
- Yes. He was playing for high stakes.
But he won't play anymore.
All right, Sergeant.
Take him away.
You call the governor of the prison.
I'll get in touch with the home secretary.
Yes.
Perhaps I return to London, uh, by and by, and bring family.
Twelve children and one wife.
And I've got another toast.
To the greatest detective in the world.
Oh, not very good detective.
Just lucky old Chinaman.
Well, I think it was miraculous the way you built up that chain of evidence in three days.
Chain not complete.
Most important link not yet in place.
Whatever do you mean,
Mr. Chan?
Link you dropped in my hotel room.
Observe, please.
Case now complete.
Joe, Bill’s here.
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello, Joe.
Bill’s here.
Come on, Baby. Scram.
- Boy.
- What’s the matter, cold feet?
- Am I glad to get rid of those!
- Take a drink!
- Did you get it all?
- 250 Grand.
Is that all?
From that mail job delving polls in New Orleans,...
...from that Casey Bank robbery and that purple mob,...
...stock we’ll get later.
Listen Jake, if I were you
I’d unload those as quick as possible.
What’s the matter?
Well, I have a hunch that
Dick has been tailing me.
Don’t worry, hide out
‘till I send for you.
Take another drink.
- Fill them up.
- Who’s this one on?
The guy who can’t turn the egg.
Oh, I see, go ahead.
- Watch this. There you are.
- You did pretty good, Tony, but...
...me! I'll blow this over Telegraph Hill.
Izzy, the great world egg blower.
Come on, turn it over.
One… You’ll never make it that way, Izzy.
Two, this is your last chance.
Come on, turn it.
- Three, you’re flop.
- Yeah, I guess it must be the wrong egg.
All right, set them up.
The drinks are on Izzy.
- Silver Fizz for mine.
- Clover Club for me.
- Atsap Flip for me.
- Go ahead, drink up, drink up,...
...I’ll have a headache.
No, wait a minute. The drinks are on the house.
It’s ok with me, boys, I don’t care how many drinks you mooch of me,...
...but you’ve been laying down on my space lately.
Why don’t you kick in with some notices?
- Go jump in the lake.
- I can’t swim.
The journals have given you plenty of publicity in...
...the last 2 years, but you ain't so crazy about it!
Why, boys, this is a new deal, ain't it?
Well, Arlene Bradford, it's good to see you again.
- I thought you'd forgotten us.
- Well, aint' that Joe,...
- ... it's marvellous to be here.
- Come this way.
Come on, boys, head it up for Arlene.
Hello, Arlene.
- Thanks, Bill.
- That's all right.
Gee, Arlene Bradford and Spencer Carlton.
I haven't seen her in a night-club since they became engaged.
Oh, a perfect set up from here, perfect.
Hello, Arlene.
Where have you been lately?
Hello, dear, it's good to see you.
Well, Joe, same old place!
Same old place, but your old friends have missed you.
- That's encouraging.
- Of course we've been glad to hear about...
...your engagement but it's sure been bad for business.
- Hello, Arlene.
- Hello, Tony.
- Tony, this is a pleasant surprise.
- Val, what are you doing here?
Spencer, you know Tony Sterling.
- Of course, how are you?
- Hello, Carlton.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
- Have a cigarette?
- Thank you.
- Hello, Arlene.
- Hello, Dick.
- What do we play for you?
- Oh, let's have...
..."Why don't I dream those dreams"?
All right. You can have anything you want in this place, you know that, don't you?
That's a rash promise.
Anything you want, Arlene.
All this hobnobbing,...
- ...that's why I didn't want to come here.
- They're just good pals of mine,...
Don't crap, darling, don't be a whim!
Let's dance.
City desk, Gertrude…
Hello, Joe, this is Archie. They got a hot little squib on Arlene Bradford.
Back on the primrose path and acting as mentor to her little sister.
Yeah, make it spicy.
When did you start running around with Arlene?
Please, Charlie, don't think
Arlene is a bad influence.
Her engagement proved a marvellous thing. She is really a dear.
You'd never know Arlene, she's changed entirely.
It's about time.
Hey, society! Who's the gal dancing with Tony?
She's the only real Bradford daughter. Arlene's her stepsister.
She must be respectable.
I never saw her before.
I picked Arlene off the blather for everything. From speeding...
...to being pinched in Chinatown raids.
- Oh, that I were young…
- And old Bradford's got more millions...
...than there were Indians out here when his family landed.
I'm sorry to trouble you, Miss
Bradford, but your car is blocking...
...in a couple of others in the parking space. May I have your keys to move it?
Surely.
- Thank you..
- Cheer up, darling.
I'm alright.
- Did you get your picture?
- I'm just getting it now.
- How do you like the wine?
- Fine!
- Vintage 1911, right?
- Right, Arlene!
Oh, Spence!
- Well, let's go.
- That suits me. Cheque, please.
- But we've only been here a minute.
- Well, Spencer doesn't like it here,...
...and besides I have a headache.
- All right.
- I'm darn sorry you have to hurry away.
I might go dancing with you alone some day if you'd think to ask me.
- That's a bet. How about Saturday?
- All right.
Oh, hold it. Hey, hey, hey. Just a minute. Hold it.
- Everything's ok now, Miss Bradford.
- Sorry to have troubled you. I didn't...
- ... know we were going home so soon.
- Well, that's alright.
Only don't be such a stranger.
- Miss Bradford's car.
- Saturday then?
You promised to keep
Arlene's name out of all...
...the newspapers. Be fair, give her a chance.
- I'll pass the word around among the boys.
- Ok, so long.
Good night.
Good night, darling.
Sorry I was the bad girl.
- It's quite alright.
- See you tomorrow. Shall I drop you off?
- No, I'll take a taxi, thanks.
- Night, darling.
- Night.
- Thanks for the good time.
Good night!
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
That's you…
- The crack still goes.
- Oh, yeah?
Grand tune, isn't it?
It's grand for dancing.
Arlene, I'm so glad I went with you tonight.
It was good to see Tony
Sterling. You like him?
- Don't you?
- Fit, rough and ready, but...
- ... I suppose he'll settle down.
- Say, Arlene, you think there's much...
- ... of a future in reporting?
- Probably for Tony.
If his uncle dies, he'll own the journal.
I didn't mean that.
Hello you, Radsy, old rascal, you'll wake father, come here.
- Be a good boy.
- Good night, Val.
Good night, Arlene.
Good night, Arlene. Hope your headache goes, let me know if there's anything you need.
Thanks, I'll be all right.
Listen to this, boys. Just came:...
..."Chief O'Malley, police department, San Francisco,...
...believe country wide organisation using San Francisco as distributing...
...point for stolen securities.
Stop. Appreciate you cooperation.
Walling, departing of justice".
What do you think of that?
- I wonder where he got his tip.
- Never mind, we'd better...
...get right on it. You cover the bank and security houses.
Whatever you do, don't tip your mitt.
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.
- How are you, dad?
- Did you have a good time last night?
Oh, lots of fun. Spencer's so cute with Arlene.
Oh, we ran into Tony
Sterling, he's a grand fellow.
- What kind of time did you have?
- Oh, I had lots of fun too,...
...with my rheumatism.
It must have been quite a party to have caused this story.
Arlene, you promised to turn over a new leaf after...
...Now you're dragging...
- ... Val's name into your notoriety.
- Let me see it, Arlene.
You're asking too much, both of me and of Val.
But father, we didn't stay in Bello's half an hour.
- Long enough to cause plenty of damage.
- This is not Arlene's fault.
It was the most innocent party in the world. We were with Spencer and...
...the only other man we spoke to was Tony Sterling.
Don't try to alibi me, Val.
Trouble with you is you have too many of your mother's qualities:...
- ... unstable, violent...
- Please, father, please!
- Bad blood. A rotten heritage.
- Sour grapes.
You couldn't hold my mother because you're a mean worn out…
Shut up!
I'm sorry if I hurt you but it had to happen.
Well, I think you were unnecessary cruel.
No, we had to have it showdowned.
Aren't you making it terrifically difficult for Arlene's fiancé?
Well, there's another face of this situation I haven't discussed with you.
What's that?
Carlton's work has suffered greatly in the past few months.
They tell me at the office he's been worrying.
And we can only attribute it to his association with Arlene.
- What?
- Yes, Arlene.
I tell you the girl is a pathological case fit for a sanatorium…
...and I'll have her commited for insanity if...
...she gets mixed up in just one more scandal.
She's really been wonderful lately and I want to help her.
I'm going down to the journal and give those reporters a piece of my mind.
We're trying to trace some stolen securities...
- ... said to be floating around.
- We'll inform you immediately...
- ... if anything suspicious occurs.
- Yeah, but we got orders to make...
- ... that third checkup here.
- Having a very conservative clientele,...
...we naturally take the greatest precautions to protect it. Just a moment.
Carlton, will you come into my office a moment?
All right, I'll be there just as soon as I can.
Really, I was anxious about you last night, darling.
I'm perfectly fit, thanks.
Frightfully worried.
Arlene, you... havent started that again...
Now, don't start moralizing.
I swore I'd never touch a stolen bond again and I mean it.
I've been going crazy to get rid of all this stuff in the vault now.
Truly, sweetheart, I was forced into this.
That's what you told me two years ago when you first started this.
Arlene, you tricked me time and time again and I won't stand for it.
- Honestly, this is the end.
- Oh, that's what you said so many times.
Darling, you've got to help me this time, 'cause I'm in a jam.
Arlene, how did you get tangled up in this racket anyway?
Well, I went into it with my eyes open.
You can't imagine the terrific thrill out of walking around under the nose...
...of the police carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars worth the blute.
Do you realize what you're saying?
Well, it's all over now, we're going to be married.
Arlene, you return those bonds.
No, I gave my word of honour I'd get rid of them.
Oh, you gave your word of honour. Well, that's easy, you're in the clear,... they can't touch you. I'll be the one who'll take the blame.
Spencer, don't be such a child.
And another thing: I've made personal aid for you over eight hundred thousand...
...dollars in the market and what have you done with it? You've hidden it from me.
I've told you I'm putting it away in a safe place for my dowry.
Should certainly satisfy you…
Be a good boy and write me out a check for fifty thousand…
A. B Bouchard usual.
Good morning, Mr. Bradford. It is very good to see you again, Sir, we missed you.
It's good to get back occasionally, Jim.
- Do be careful, darling.
- Don't worry, dearest.
Val, I had nothing to do with this.
Your attitude towards life and people is cheap and cynical.
Honestly, Val, you got me all wrong.
It must have been Archie Van Ness.
It sounds like him, he saw you at Bello's.
Don't put the blame on anyone else. I know reporters.
They put their papers above everything fine and decent.
I'm terribly disappointed in you.
Young lady bought out young man. I should have had a picture of that.
Where's that rat, Archie Van Ness?
I saw him going just exactly where he belongs.
Come in.
A radiogram for you, Miss.
Oh, thank you, Thorne.
Thorn,...
...if you don't stop snooping
I'll have you discharged.
Hello!
What are you looking at?
Why, Arlene, you're trembling!
- Arlene, what's the matter with you?
- I want you to do something for me.
- Come here.
- I was afraid you'd be upset after...
- ... the scene with father this morning.
- Never mind that.
Oh, and by the way, I gave Tony Sterling the...
...devil for allowing that story to be printed.
Oh, don't be too hard on the poor boy.
Reporters make enough for a bust in their lives as it is…
...here, I want you to take care of this. It contains some valuable papers...
...and you're so much more dependable than I.
Are you planning to go away or elope with Spencer?
You romantic child, of course not!
I'm too commercial, think of wedding presents.
- Arlene...
- Well, if it's too much trouble…
Not at all, I'll put it in a safe place gladly. Bye.
Bye.
And please keep away from father until
I can get things straightened out.
Will I?
Thorne's speaking.
Thorne, I'll take here any incoming calls this afternoon.
Very well, Miss.
Is that you, Arlene?
Did you get my message?
Be careful, darling, might be overheard.
- When are we going to get together?
- Ten thirty, Bello's.
All right, ten thirty at Bello's. Be good.
Bye, darling.
I'll take it.
- Thorne's speaking.
- Thorne,...
...will you come up to my room, please?
Come in.
- You wanted me, Miss.
- Yes, Thorne.
Will you have a messenger deliver this to Mrs. Spencer Carlton...
- ... at the Sherman Arms?
- Sherman Arms, yes, Miss.
Hello.
You'd better come right over.
We want to talk to you. Hurry up.
He'll be right along.
Good.
How did you come to know all this?
It was really by accident that we discovered...
...stocks and bonds lists had been stolen...
...among the deliveries from the home office at the Honolulu branch.
- We cabled you immediately.
- Being a comparably recent addition...
...to Bradford and company, I feel doubly upset over the situation.
You've done fine work at the islands. It's we at this end...
...who are entirely to blame.
It's going to be a delicate job to make restitution...
...without injuring our reputation.
We have an organisation capitalized at twenty-five millions,...
...every penny of which will be jeopardized if we lose the confidence to our clients…
This scandal must not become public property.
- Oh, by no means.
- There will be no prosecution.
I personally will bear the losses because
I feel that I am personally responsible.
You've not been actively in charge.
We'll all contribute.
- How much is it?
- May amount to two o three millions.
Well, no wonder Carlton was worried.
I have a strong hunch we haven't scratched the surface yet.
Pardon me, gentleman.
Hello, Spence.
I want to have a talk with you before we go in to Maynard and Porter.
- Maynard is here?
- Yes, we sent for him.
I don't care. Have me arrested.
I knew it!
Now you must pull yourself together. We're going...
...to straighten this out from a different,...
...angle but you must tell me the truth: is Arlene implicated?
The truth, she got you into this mess.
I knew it.
I knew it, if it weren't for your engagement…
There isn't any engagement,
Arlene has broken it.
What? Thrown you over?
After wrecking your life?
I'd shoot her. Thorne!
- Sir?
- Is Miss Arlene in her room?
No, Sir, she isn't in the house, Sir.
Hold on to yourself, son. Go home now.
I'll take care of Maynard and Porter alone. Keep away from the office...
...until this blows over. And don't worry, I'm protecting you, son...
Good night.
Hello, Spence, is Arlene…?
Well, what's the matter?
- There you are…
- How much are you making out of this?
You had your cut, don't ask questions.
Listen, Arlene, I'm not one of those society punks that'll take...
...anything you wanna give them, including the air.
You can take what you get and like it!
Come this way.
Well, I hope you care to enjoy this. This is my last job.
- What do you mean?
- Just that.
You ought to know you can't get out of a racket as easy as that.
Lots of important guys are dependent on you.
I've got personal reasons and…
- Who's there?
- Bill.
Arlene, he's waiting in the private room.
Thanks so much.
Darling,...
...how wonderful to see you! Had a good trip?
- Perfect.
- I was so surprised to get your wire.
I came on business. I can only stay a few days.
- Well, what's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
- Are you trying to high hat me?
- No, but things have been...
- ... different the last few months.
- Different? Not with me.
What about your engagement?
You know that was purely for business reasons.
- Now give me my letters.
- No, not in a million years!
Now, don't be obstinate. Those letters don't mean anything.
Nothing to you perhaps, but everything to me!
You seem to forget that it was I that got you a job at Bradford and Company.
You were marvellous to me, I realize that.
I just don't love you any more.
- You mean that?
- Of course!
- You're not joking?
- Now, let's be reasonable.
You used me when you needed me and now you're through with me.
Perhaps the same plan that you followed with the young Carlton.
- How did you know that?
- I've been to the house tonight...
...and there is a very devil to pay.
You take my advice. Stick to young Carlton who loves you.
Go away and start life again a long way from here.
- I'm going to the Islands with you.
- That's impossible.
Perhaps you'll change your mind by tomorrow.
Give me those letters. Let's call this incident closed.
Arlene.
Arlene, you can't go like that. Arlene.
Arlene.
Yes, it certainly is. It's a ghastly business all around.
The personal problem with Arlene and
Spencer worries me more than anything else.
Oh, don't let that worry you.
It's decidedly for the best.
- You can't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean that. I'm glad...
...the engagement is broken.
- Thorne, you give me my hat and coat.
- Yes, Sir.
I'm going out for a breath of fresh air.
- I'll be back in a few minutes.
- Yes, Sir.
- Good night, Everett.
- Good night, Oren.
Oh, that's Arlene.
Be still, Ragsy!
Be a good boy. I'll be right back.
Arlene.
Now keep quiet, Ragsy.
Arlene!
Why don't you answer me?
- Thorne.
- Yes, Miss.
Thorne, who was using the elevator?
I was just going to see, Miss. I thought it might be Miss Arlene.
- I thought so too.
- I'll see if her car is in the garage.
I'm going with you.
It couldn't have been
Mr. Bradford, Miss.
Isn't father in the library with Mr. Porter?
No, Miss. He left with Mr. Porter a moment ago. Said he was going...
- ... out for a breath of fresh air.
- Oh, no, it couldn't have been he...
...I can always tell when it's father.
It must have been Arlene. But I can't...
...remember her ever going in like this and going right out again.
Just seems rather strange, Miss.
Her car is here.
- Then she must have come back.
- But where is she?
The doors are open.
There's nobody here.
- There's a taxi.
- Oh, no, it couldn't be.
Arlene. Arlene.
Arlene.
Are you sure Miss Arlene used her car this evening, Miss?
I'm positive. It wasn't here when I came home.
Strange she didn't say something to me.
Who is… Oh, father…
What on earth are you doing here at this hour?
Something very funny has happened.
Arlene came home in her own car...
...and then went away in a taxi without saying a word to anyone.
- And I hope she never comes back.
- Oh, father.
I won't talk about it know, but
Arlene has reached the end of her rope.
But you'd help her if she needed it, wouldn't you?
I tell you all about it tomorrow.
Good night, go to bed.
Good morning, Ragsy.
How are you this morning?
Dear Val. I'm through.
You have been kind to me.
But I can't stand your father's way of living. Keep...
...the envelope I gave you.
I may send for it but...
...I'm not coming back. Ever.
Good bye. Arlene.
Father, Arlene has left, left for good.
- I almost wish that were true.
- Oh, you don't mean that. Be fair.
Oh, don't worry about Arlene. She's like a cat: bound to land on her feet.
I'm afraid something terrible has happened to her.
- No doubt, no doubt.
- Oh, but father this is serious.
Oh, you're wasting your sympathies, my dear.
We can't leave her like this.
- ¡Thorne!
- Yes, Miss.
Get me the journal on the phone right away. Hurry, please!
Right away, Miss.
Louise, quick! Get my things. I'm going out.
Oui, mademoiselle, tout de suite.
Hello. The journal?
Tony Sterling, please.
What? He's not there? Oh, no. No, I'll get him later.
Hurry, Louise, hurry!
One moment. Mr. Carlton's apartment does not answer.
Perhaps he's on his way down here, Mrs. Bradford.
All right. Will you get me Tony Sterling at the journal on the phone for me?
Tony Sterling at the journal. Quickly, please.
Just tell Mr. Carlton when he comes in that I may be back to see him later.
And do me a favour, have this put that on the vault for me.
Yes, indeed.
One moment. Mr. Sterling is not at his office just now.
- Would you like to leave a message?
- No. No, thank you.
That's all.
You've no idea, Miss
Bradford how many of these...
...scares turn out to be simple misunderstandings.
Oh, I know it sounds silly, but I know something's happened.
- Arlene has never acted this way before.
- We'll do everything to locate...
- ... your sister.
- I'm very grateful to you.
Everything will be all right. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if she was at home...
...when you got there. You leave everything to me, Miss Bradford.
Thanks, Chef O'Malley.
I feel much better now.
I've been driving around for hours trying to make up my mind to come through.
- Oh, and one more important thing. …
- What is it now?
Don't say anything to the
Newspapers. My father hates publicity.
- Oh, not a word.
- Thank you.
Hold on your cigars, boys. Here's O'Hagen.
Oh, yeah? Well, you guys will loosen up with...
...a box of cigars when I tell you what I'm gonna…
- You.
- Right.
All right. Come on, boys.
You. No?
- You.
- Wrong.
All right. Try it again.
All right, boys, let's go now.
It better…
You.
Right. And don't let it happen again.
Your phone is ringing.
Hello.
Hello, Joe? This is
Spike. Got something for you.
Spill it.
Well, now comes a hot young blond mama-
...named Valkyr Bradford.
Then disposes that…
Named what?
- You better call her Val.
- Go on.
Well, this dame's all blows in the Chief O'Malley's office...
...office just now and tells him that someone walked off with her sister,...
- ... Arlene Bradford, you know her.
- Hold on, Spike.
Say, Ed. Rip off that front story. We got a good kidnapping story coming in.
All right, Joe.
Wilson, get me the clips and the pictures from the morgue and Miss Arlene Bradford.
And Drew, jump on your horse. Take a camera down to the hall of justice,...
...get an interview with and a photograph of Miss Val Bradford, who's down there...
...interviewing the police about her missing sister.
Listen, Boss, let me go down there, will you?
You stick right with that phone and write everything that Spike's got.
Get me all you can for the first run. I got...
...about twenty minutes left before deadline.
But I'm a personal friend of the Bradford's.
That's swell! Sneak in all the inside stuff you know.
Come on, Spike. Is this Joe on the level?
Well, looks like your playmate got in a jam.
Hall of justice. Step on it.
There are no pictures and no information...
...on the younger girl.
These are all Arlene's.
Joe, the Bradford dame dodged the boys...
...at the hob before they could snatch a picture.
- Here's the stuff, I'm gonna beat it.
- Sure you are. Get an interview...
...of the old man
Bradford and his daughter.
Take Izzy Wright. Take pictures of them both,...
...especially the daughter and keep it exclusive.
Ah, you mean futuristic pictures…
Get out of here. And don't forget you're newspaper men.
Oh, are we?
Look, those buzzards beat us to it.
Come on, Tony, take it easy. Val isnt here yet.
Oh, is that so?
Well, we'll se you later.
Drive around the corner.
You see that stuff? You can't get to anybody here,...
...not even that old man Bradford.
You hide in the garage. I'll stand here and catch her if she comes in.
Ok.
Hello, Val.
Got it. Come on, Val, give me the story, quick.
- Is that your man?
- Sure, but…
- Give me that camera.
- Oh, Val, listen.
Give me that camera. Will not have my pictures on the paper.
Val, Val, dont take it so big.
So that's the way you help me, is it?
Tony, don't take it so big.
Val, wait a minute, let me explain. Val, please.
Val, you know I wouldnt let anything get...
...in the papers that would hurt you. Val, Val!
- Come on. Izzy, let's get out of here.
- Wait a minute, Tony.
What's the matter?
You don't suppose…
Good Lord!
Cold. Dead for hours.
This is the car Miss Bradford's been running around in?
Sure, Val used Arlene's car and she's been...
...driving this way all over town.
- Oh, what a picture, what a picture.
- Thorne, this is Tony Sterling,...
...let me talk to Miss
Bradford, it's important.
Just a minute, please.
Miss Valkyr, Mr. Sterling on the house phone for you.
I don't want to speak to him.
Hello…
But I tell you it's…
All right.
Tony Sterling's speaking, city desk.
Hello, Hogue, this is Tony. I'm in the Bradford garage and I have the…
- ... biggest story printed since…
- As for the next, I've seen it once.
Izzy and I just found Arlene
Bradford dead in the back of her car.
Her sister was driving all over town not...
...knowing she had the body right there with her.
- Hold it, hold it. Got it.
- Izzy has pictures of everything.
How's that for a break?
Shall I call the cops?
Call the cops? You do it and you're fired!
Don't tell anybody, not even the Bradfords.
You and Izzy get down here with those plates as fast as you can and...
...lock that rumble seat until the deadline of the last edition.
All right.
- Gotta get another one right from here.
- The boss says to keep everything…
Yeah, well the… get these plates printed.
- Open it up.
- Hey, are you crazy?
- There's somebody coming.
- Is it?
Tony, what was it you wanted to say to me?
Listen Val, there's something you should know.
- But it's for you only. Arlene…
- Arlene!
That is, I mean, Arlene's car…
What he wants to say is leave everything to the journal.
They'll do more towards finding your sister than anyone in the world.
Oh, that's wonderful of you.
Oh, Tony, I've needed you all day, I've been so worried.
And father wouldn't pay any attention to me. He was furious when I…
Well, Val, we'll straighten everything out.
Miss Bradford, your father wishes to see you.
All right, Thorne. I'm in for it now.
Oh, Tony, will you come with me? Father's been so upset of my going to the police...
- ... that I dread facing him alone.
- You bet I will.
That's a swell idea, swell idea. Tony's the best man in San Francisco for the job.
Tell Hogue I'll be along in about half an hour.
You'll bet, I'll see you later.
- Val, what made you go to the police?
- Some very odd incidents that happened...
...happened last night and a note from Arlene that I found in her room.
And then there was Spencer
Carlton, he acted so queerly.
I havent been able to reach him all day.
Well, that's the way it looks to me. Don't worry about Carlton,...
...I told him to keep away from the office 'till things get cleared up.
The accounts will be finished either late tonight or in the morning...
...and we'll need him then.
- Better not.
- Don't be afraid, I'll handle him alone.
Sterling, how the devil did you get in here?
I came in place of Miss Val to talk to you about…about Arlene's disappearance.
Val made a great mistake in going to the police.
You're making the mistake.
There's absolutely nothing to have fears.
But the journal is in possession of vital information...
…which leads us to believe that Arlene is…
- ... well, at least in great danger.
- Sounds like a newspaper trick.
- If this a hoax…
- Believe me, it isn't.
Oh, I cant give you information now but...
...I want to know what happened exactly last night.
Literally nothing.
- Come on, be a good fellow.
- He's a tough fellow that guy.
Well, Louise, we know just as little now as we knew this morning.
Come in.
- A telegram for you, Miss Bradford.
- Thanks.
Dear Val, I'm in trouble and
I want to come home. Stop.
Bring my car and that envelope
I gave as soon as you can...
...to the end of the Butcher Town
Bridge. Stop.
Come alone. Love=Arlene.
It's from my sister. She's all right. I'm gonna go and pick her up.
Quick, my hat and coat.
Thorne, wait a minute.
Yes, Miss.
Thorne, give this to father and tell Mr. Sterling I'll be right back.
Yes, Miss Bradford.
Then you can't tell me anything?
Well, I'm not at liberty to divulge the reason.
Arlene's departure was no surprise as these gentlemen will agree.
- It was a natural move to expect.
- Of course I'm not the police,...
...but it's a mistake for you to withhold any information.
It's not relevant. Don't say anymore, Everett.
Come in.
Pardon me, Mr Bradford,...
...Miss Valkyr was called away suddenly. She told me to give you this.
Didn't I tell you the journal's fears were groundless?
Arlene is alive and will be home shortly.
Give me that wire.
That's marked 2.50. That's only an hour ago. She couldn't have sent this.
- It's a phoney.
- What the devil do you mean?
Arlene is dead. Murdered
I think. Her body is...
...is in the rumble seat of her car.
Don't sit there like idiots. Do something!
Butcher Town Bridge. Don't you understand? The murderer's after Val.
Mr. Bradford, Sir, I'll get your car.
Press room. Spike Smith. Spike,
I want cops and lots of cops.
At the Butcher Town Bridge. And hurry!
The Bradford case is blown wide open.
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Yes, Sir.
Start the motor, driver!
Butcher Town Bridge and hurry.
- Hey, wait a minute, that's my cab.
- You mean it was…
You're sure you're headed for Butcher Town Bridge?
- I couldn't miss, boss.
- Give it all she's got.
We're flying now.
Come right along with me over the bridge.
Don't worry. I'll take you to your sister.
- I am very sorry, Mr. Bradford.
- Not a lucky day for you, Sir.
What are we gonna do now?
Listen. I'll hide out so she won't spot me. You grab the letters...
...from the girl. And then get what's in the rumble seat.
- Ok, boss.
- Look out, here she comes.
Whatever you do, don't hurt the girl. We don't want her on our hands.
Where's my sister?
Where is the envelope you were supposed to bring?
I haven't it. Where's my sister?
Come on, cross her.
I'll get what she got.
Let go off me.
- Come on, give us that envelope.
- I couldn't get it, it was too late.
- Come on, where is it?
- On the phone, at my father's office.
Let go off me. Let go off me I say.
- Where is my sister?
- Gimme your hand. You take her hand.
- Jake. Jake, there ain't no letters.
- Don't let her tell you that.
- Jake Bello!
- Get them, slug. Why did you call me?
Now we've got to take her along with us. Go grab her.
- The cops are coming.
- Arlene is stiff for long…
Take the sister, take the dame with us.
Help! Help!
Help!
- Val! Hold out.
- Help!
Val, hold out!
- Help!
- Grab him, grab him. Easy, easy.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Grab him, grab him. Easy, easy.
Is he all right?
Yeah, he's got a bad gash back at the ear,...
- ... but I guess he's ok.
- Pull it over here. Now catch...
...that boat before they get away with the girl. Come on. Pull it here.
Go on. Shove off!
Bradford sisters victims of murder and kidnapping.
Police launch loses abductors in fog.
Arlene Bradford slain;
Step-aister abducted!
Murder and kidnapping strike prominent family.
Arlene Bradford murdered.
Step-sister kidnapped.
We have a few details on the Bradford case which has shocked the whole city.
Arlene Bradford, step-daughter of the multi-millionaire...
...banker and philanthropist was murdered.
And Valkyr Bradford, the younger daughter kidnapped by a gang of thugs.
Mr. Bradford had offered a reward of fifty-thousand dollars.
No, madam. We've heard nothing new.
Wipe your shoes, men. This way.
- Clean your feet!
- I didn't step on anything. Right?
Be careful with those boxes of yours and don't scratch the furniture.
Now after shoving the body of Miss
Bradford in the rumble seat of the car,...
...the intruder came up in the elevator and stood quietly into the suite here.
- Coming up in the elevator. Are you sure?
- Miss Val and I were affected...
...by the sound of the elevator running.
Seeing no-one on the upper floors,...
...we both went down to the garage to investigate.
When we got down there we found no-one.
But I did notice that the garage doors...
...were open. In any event, he read the note left...
...by Miss Arlene for Miss Val.
It was pasted on the mirror there.
- But it was found here.
- Hold it! Hold it!
- What the devil are you doing?
- I just wanna give it a futuristic touch.
- Get down!
- But I gotta be up.
You'll be up for thirty days if I I get my hands on you.
Come here!
The telephone conversation you told us about, Would you recognize...
- ... the man's voice if you heard it?
- Well, I'm not sure.
But I do know where the rendez-vous was.
Come on, who is the guy she met here last night?
- I don't remember and that's the truth.
- Maybe Jake saw them.
Sir, who are you and what are you sticking your nose in this for?
Come on, come on. Lay off the butler.
- We wanna see Jake.
- Oh, well Jake isn't here at all.
- He left yesterday for Sacramento.
- Yeah, where is he stopping up there?
I don't know. He said he'd be back tomorrow.
You tell him we wanna see him...
...and don't you be taking any little trips.
Well, according to his brother,
Jake Bello, he went to Sacramento.
Send out a dragnet for him. He might be any place but Sacramento.
I'm not taking any chances.
- Who was around the house that night?
- Mr. Bradford, Mr. Porter -one of his...
...partners, and Mr. Maynard- manager of this Honolulu branch and Mr. Carlton,...
...Miss Arlene's fiancé
- at least he was until yesterday.
- Don't forget yourself.
- Fortunately Mr. Bradford,...
...and Mr. Maynard, Porter and I were all at the house when the telegraph came.
That's a punk alibi. Carlton looks like the best bet. Where does he live?
Sherman Arms.
Dead since some time last night.
Shot right through the temple.
Ah, the girl's ring.
- Might have been the motive.
- "Forever in my heart, Arlene"
Hah, chief. Looks like an open-and-shut murder suicide case.
No, no, Carlton has been dead too long.
Mr. Bradford might know something about the gentleman.
- Don't forget the guy from the Islands.
- Yeah, the fireworks didn't start until...
- ... he showed up.
- He brought bad news.
Carlton and Miss Arlene were up to their necks in the stolen securities racket.
You sure got good ears.
We had a tip on that.
- Go on, spill the rest of it.
- Well, there is a lot of money involved.
You see, Carlton's system was to substitute... stolen securities for bona fide bonds...
...and stocks belonging either to us or held for our clients...
He then sold the good securities and credited them...
- ... to Miss Bradford's account.
- Except in our case.
He shipped off the stolen stuff, never dreaming we'd check...
- ... the serial numbers.
- No news, eh?
Keep up the search.
Increase the reward if you think best.
Do anything. Anything to save my daughter.
Well,...
...Let's go home, Everett. We can do nothing more until the vault opens.
I don't want to go home now. I feel closer to things down here.
We've been checking over Arlene's personal account. It's staggering.
She's had over eight hundred thousand dollars to a credit at one time.
And practically all of it has vanished into thin air.
That's the least of my worries.
Well, son, did you get fixed
- up?
Never mind me. Is there any word about Val?
No! And if you hadn't put your rotten newspaper above common decency,...
...Val's life would be in danger.
Don't rub it in.
I'm sorry. I know you did fine work in trying to save her live,...
...and I know how you feel about Val.
Oh, thank you. Just put them here.
They belong to Arlene.
I want to look at them.
To whom it may concern.
January 12th, 1932. I leave everything to my husband.
- Who?
- Arthur Burchard.
Signed, Arlene Bradford- Burchard.
Married? Impossible.
Married and engaged to another man at the same time.
- Who is Arthur Bouchard?
- I haven't the faintest idea.
I've never heard of him.
I do remember Arlene mentioning this man three or four years ago.
- But I never met him.
- Where did he live?
Los Angeles. I think. I'm not certain.
Say…. I better get down to the office. Get a line on this.
Well, thanks. So long.
Good morning, boys. Let's get going. Listen to this:...
A.B. Burchard hasn't been around
Los Angeles for several months.
Plenty of money. Mysterious financial connections.
Owns a hundred-foot cruiser yacht, the N.H. Siwon.
Slim thinking, boys.
What do you make of it?
- The yacht.
- Mmh. The N.H. Siwon of Los Angeles.
I think Tony's hunch is right. Now you two boys get down to the walk...
...the first thing in the morning and if you find...
...anything that looks like the N.H. Siwon, let me know.
We can spill the story to the police and we...
...can get photographs of them boarding the boat.
And if there is a rescue of the
Bradford girl, you'll be there to cover.
Val Bradford still missing.
Where is Jake Bello?
Who is Arthur Burchard?
Have you seen this man?
The greatest man out in the history of the...
...state marks the progress of the Bradford-case.
Every law enforcing body has been pressed into service.
Airplanes will assist as soon as daylight permits.
Say, look at that one!
That answers the description of the
N.H. Siwon but it's got the wrong name.
NOWISHN. What a screwy name for a boat.
Now if that was only the N.H. Siwon, Oh, what a beautiful picture that would make.
Hey, holy smoke, take a look at that!
Well, what do you know about that!
Hello, chief. This is Daly, Harbour
Detail. I've got some news for you.
What? Are you sure? Well, that certainly fits Jake Bello.
Now get up to the Bradford girl!
Then our case is knocking into a cock hat.
The Harbour Detail has just fished Bello out of the bay.
Well, Carlton is out and Bello is out.
Goes right back to Bradford.
No.
- No, no, no!
- Mr. Bradford, weren't you at the scene...
...of the crime a few minutes after it'd been committed?
And didn't you say your stepdaughter should be shot?
- Now, this is outrageous here!
- Be quiet, please.
How dare you imply Mr. Bradford?
Somebody waited for Arlene in the garage and killed her when she came home.
And then I suppose I kidnapped my other daughter.
Thorne, have you been giving the police all this information?
He has. That's his business. He is a secret service operative assigned to...
...breaking up the stolen securities racket.
And after he had gotten the goods on Jake Bello, Arlene and Carlton,...
...all this happened.
Then I think you should concentrate on Jake Bello.
- Ah, somebody bumped him off.
- What?
Bello may have had something to do with the stolen bonds but...
...he has nothing to do with the murder of Miss Arlene.
There's only one mayor suspect: a mysterious bird that...
...met Miss Arlene the night before out at Jake Bello's.
Well, if it's any help to you I might say that I…
You're the man!
I recognize your voice.
- You'll have to do some explaining.
- Gladly. You see, I tried...
...to get Miss Bradford to return some intimate letters of mine.
- She refused and then you had a fight.
- An argument, rather.
You see, I expect to be married next month. And those letters in the hands...
...of a woman like Arlene Bradford…
…Had you on the spot. What happened?
She left the room in a huff, and
I returned to my hotel. That's all.
- Those letters must be very important.
- Only to me.
Where are they?
I wish I knew.
Gentlemen, I just recall. Val had me place an envelope belonging to Arlene...
...in the vault. Could that be?
Right under the nose.
Let's have it.
The vault will be open in a few minutes.
I think we're jumping at conclusions.
Where the devil is O'Hagen?
He ought to be here by now.
Gentlemen, I doubt whether I can be of any further service. If anything...
...comes up, get in touch with me. Good morning.
- I am sorry, but I think you'd better stay.
- Your order, chief?
- Yeah.
- Here are some letters from the vault...
Oh, thank you.
After me, Mr. Maynard.
Come on, boys.
- Let's look these things over.
- Ah, they are nothing but a lot of sappy...
...love letters, chief.
I protest against having my intimate correspondence...
- ... bandited in this manner.
- Be quiet.
You're mixed up in a murder case.
Arlene, darling. I hope you will be able to meet my agent from St. Louis.
He has been a lot of help to me in times passed.
Particularly at Bello's fall some years ago.
He informed me that quick action on the deal is necessary.
We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
Well, this doesn't seem to be all there is to it.
We'll see how it raids under the rays...
Why don't you hunt up Arlene's husband? This man Burchard.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
Hello, hello, hello!
Go on, scram! There's nothing for you in here.
Hello, chief. We've located Arthur Burchard.
What? Where'd you find him?
- He'll be here in a few minutes.
- You don't say.
Would you like to see some pictures?
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? What did you do?
...He is sorry...
Take a peek at these.
- They're pictures of my cruiser.
- Yeah, I took them this morning.
I thought you might like to see them.
Have you had it long?
About five years. I use it for business on the Islands.
I've just sailed it over from Honolulu.
Oh, some more pictures of my boat…
Yes and no. Look at that negative through the light.
You see, that's the way Izzy caught it through the finder in his camera.
NHSIMON or NOWISHN. The letters are reversible.
A very easy matter to change.
Just turn the boards over.
NHSIMON and NOWISHN are the same. So are the owners.
Gentlemen, meet Joshua Maynard alias Arthur Burchard,...
- ... Arlene Bradford's secret husband.
- Keep your hands off!
I did nothing you can hold me for!
Val! Poor Val. How did you get here?
Don't move!
Stay here!
- Well, he tried to shoot it out.
- Good work.
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Get an ambulance for O'Hagen...
- ... and call the coroner.
- Ok, chief.
Well, I guess that finishes my butler job.
Thorne, you better watch yourself, you're liable to become...
...a well-known secret service man…
Here is to crime.
Ah, they did nail you, didn't they, O'Hagen?
Ah, it's just a little nickle in the arm, that's all, chief.
Don't mean nothing to a guy from the south of the slug.
Gosh, O'Hagen, I'm sorry. We have the cops staked out,...
- ... but I couldn't tiff you off.
- It's ok, Tony.
Val, dear. Where have you been? What's happened?
I've been enjoying Mr. Maynard's hospitality on his yacht.
Jake Bello extended the invitation.
On that boat, I heard of everything that took place.
Jake Bello followed Mr. Maynard and Arlene home. They continued...
...to quarrel about the letters which, written in code, implicated Maynard...
...in the bond racket.
Jake left his taxi outside. It was the one we saw driving away.
Maynard must have lost his head completely,... for he killed her.
Jake saw everything that happened inside.
. Maynard, realizing what he had done, shoved the body...
...body into the rumble seat and using
Arlene's keys, he took the elevator...
...to her room.
During his quick search, he discovered Arlene's note to me,...
...pasted on the mirror, which told him that the letters have been left in my care.
He must have hidden when I came in.
Jake Bello waited in the garage until Maynard came down,...
...and then Jake tried to blackmail him.
I see. Maynard was too smart and hooked him,...
...into the deal with a promise of big money.
He got Jake to send that phoney telegram.
They didn't mean to kidnap Val at first, but she recognized Jake...
...at Butcher Town Bridge and they had to take her along.
Then Maynard's men threw Jake into the water and he couldn't swim.
Did you get it, chief?
I guess that's it.
Ah, Mr. Bradford, how about the reward money?
What, you?
Yes, sure. You know what, my picture was responsible for the evidence.
You know, the futuristic touch.
What, you aren't laughing me out, are you?
- All those angles.
- Give me the city desk.
Tony Sterling speaking.
Gee, it's good to see you again sweetheart.
Joe Hogue, hurry. And
I'm gonna marry you.
No, no, no; not you Joe.
Hang on a minute. How about it sweetheart, yes or no?
- The story is important!
- I don't suppose I dare...
...spoil a good story.
Listen, Joe, tell that rat Archie Van Ness...
...to announce the approaching marriage of Valkyr Bradford and Tony Sterling.
Yeah!
Well, that's not all.
Here's the real story:...
...Joshua Maynard alias Arthur
Burchard, yeah sure, that's the one!
Well, he was shot to death...
- ... while trying to escape from…
- Hold it!
Just a minute!
Got it! Got it!
I've got it!
I've got it!

Yes, sir. It's the biggest little city in the world.
And by gosh, it's the liveliest.
I guess these divorcées figure that as long as they're changin' partners... they just might as well dance.
- This your first trip here?
- Yes.
I thought you were strange.
Some of them come back so often,
I was thinkin'of printin'up commuter's tickets.
Oh, well.
I guess divorce ain't much more than a matter of traveling.
You check out of the state of matrimony and land in the state of Nevada.
I ain't got no complaints though.
Owe my livin' to divorces, same as most of the people in this town.
And, by gosh, it's the one business that even the depression don't hit.
- Now, you take me for instance-
- How much farther to the hotel?
Oh, you in a hurry, are you?
Don't matter how soon I get you there, lady, it still takes six weeks.
- Good evening.
- Good evening. I'm Mrs. Curtis Whitman.
- I have reservations.
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Whitman. We have your room ready.
I'll notify our social directress that you're here.
Is that necessary?
I'm rather tired.
Not necessary, but we try to make each guest feel that he or she is more than a guest.
Especially during these trying days.
If you'll just register, please.
Miss Wells' office.
- Try the bar.
- Try the doc's office, I'd say.
Ring Dr. Ainsley.
Dr. Ainsley, this is the front desk.
Does Miss Wells happen to be there?
Certainly. It's for you.
Hello? All right, I'll be right out.
Another lost soul here for the cure.
- Shall I give her the bright approach or the sympathetic?
- I prefer the bright.
So I've noticed lately.
I'll leave the sympathy for you.
You do it so well.
106. You'll find there's never a dull moment at the Hotel Sierra, Mrs. Whitman.
We have sunrise trips to points of interest... alimony breakfasts, bridge luncheons or-
Oh, here's Miss Wells.
Mrs. Whitman.
How do you do? You've had a long trip, haven't you? Let's have a drink.
Thank you, but I don't think I care for one.
L- It's rather late.
Oh, come on. You don't want to spend your first evening in that room alone.
- You're right. I don't.
- Fine.
It's this way.
I'll show you your room later.
Seventeen and the black.
Well, that washes me up.
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh, hello, Ainsley.
You're a doctor. Save my life and let me have a hundred, will you?
Sorry. My office hours are from 2:00 to 4:00.
But I'll buy you a drink.
That's awfully generous of you.
Here. Cash these for me.
Maybe that'll help your credit.
- Meet you at the bar.
- Place your bets.
- The same, Mrs. Bentley?
- Yes.
- Where's your shadow?
- Shadow?
The official greeter.
Greeting a decidedly attractive new arrival.
I wouldn't mind having her job myself.
What's the matter?
- I'm amused.
- That must be obvious to everyone in the place.
- Do you know her?
- Know her? I'm going to marry her husband.
Want to meet her?
Come on.
Number 25 and the red.
Well, well!
Greetings, salutations, and my heartfelt thanks.
Curt wrote me he'd finally talked you into a divorce... but I didn't expect you so soon.
Dr. Ainsley finds you so attractive, he asked for an introduction.
Since you're doing so much for me, why shouldn't I do something for you?
The doctor's a bachelor. You'll find him most amusing while you're here.
I know I have.
- Mrs. Whitman, Dr. Ainsley.
- How do you do?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Whitman... but this seems to be one of those situations that we try to avoid here.
Why, going to marry her husband.
So what?
This is 1939. We're modern.
Let's talk things over.
Besides, there's lots of things
I want to ask you about Curt.
You know, how he likes his eggs and toast.
And is he sometimes cross in the morning or always as charming as I've found him?
- And all the little things you did that upset him.
- Let me out, please.
Mrs. Whitman, what are you doing here?
- Thanks.
- Don't you know?
- Why, no.
- I haven't had the heart to tell the poor boy.
Tell me what?
I've decided that Curt will make me a better husband. He's more mature.
Why, you cheap, lying-
- Don't you call me names, you stupid fool!
- Oh!
My goodness!
Is it my fault you're sap enough to trail me everywhere I go?
Will you show me my room please?
Are you both going up and have a good cry?
- Shut up.
- I won't shut up!
Mrs. Bentley,
I have to ask you to leave my hotel.
- What?
- You've done nothing but cause trouble since you came here.
- Why, you can't-
- I shall expect you to be gone by morning.
Behave yourself and sit down.
- I want a drink.
- You've had too much to drink already.
And you've talked too much.
You used to be smart.
Keep on like this and you'll hang yourself.
What's the matter?
Afraid you'll hang with me?
Where have you been? Mrs. Bentley's been ringing for you all evening.
What was she ringing for?
She knows it's my night off.
- She's leaving the hotel. You've got to pack.
- Tonight?
And if you want to know, she was thrown out.
Oh. Now she'll really be hard to work for.
What happened?
Mrs. Bentley won't be leaving until morning.
All right, Mrs. Russell.
I'll have her bill ready.
Mrs. Bentley.
- What's the trouble? Is someone hurt?
- Mrs. Bentley.
- What's happened here?
- In there-
- How did it happen?
- I don't know. Mrs. Bentley.
- Keep back everybody.
- Who is she?
- What's going on?
- Did they send for a doctor?
- Is she dead?
- I think so.
Get Dr. Ainsley.
I'll telephone the police.
Don't look at me like that.
I didn't do it.
Don't! I didn't do it, I tell you!
I didn't! I didn't!
Lieutenant Chan,
Mr. Curtis Whitman is here to see you.
Always pleased to see Mr. Whitman.
This way, please.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Please pardon experiment... but must reproduce elusive Easter rabbit for number one grandchild.
So glad-Words of welcome freeze when friend appears troubled.
You couldn't have seen the papers, Charlie.
Please forgive question, but is concern for living or the dead?
Mary is still my wife, in spite of what we'd planned.
But she didn't-
She couldn't have done this.
Man yet to be born who can tell what woman will or will not do.
But you know her.
You've known her all her life.
Yes. Very difficult to believe ill of those we love.
Oh, I knew you'd feel that way, Charlie.
That's why I want you to go with me.
Why, they might build up a case against her that we can't break.
- Oh, she's in a jam and it's-
- Please.
Ancient ancestor once say,
"Words cannot cook rice. "
Then you will go?
Swell!
I've reserved seats on the Clipper for both of us.
Can you be ready in an hour?
Will go pack and notify family in person... just so honorable wife will not misunderstand contemplated visit to Reno.
Oh!
Phew! Very objectionable odor,
Mr. Chan. Ah, what is it?
Just one of my experiments in chemical criminology, sir.
You see, I'm working on a new method to bring out fingerprints on cloth.
Bring them out?
My dear boy, that'll drive them out.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't think it turned out just right.
Hey, a telegram just came for you, Jimmy.
Telegram?
Oh, gee, thanks.
Whew!
Do you have to make that stuff?
Hey, listen to this.
It's from Pop.
"Honorable sprout, unexpectedly find self on way to Reno, Nevada.
Will visit you before return home. "
Reno? Is your Dad gonna get a divorce?
Oh, gee, no.
I- I don't think so.
Say. You know that murder we read about and I said I knew the people?
- Yeah.
- That's what Pop's on his way to Reno for.
- No kiddin'!
- No foolin'.
Say, Jack, the Easter holidays start tomorrow, and you're not going anywhere.
- Can I borrow your car?
- Well, the tank's empty.
- I'll fill it up.
- How long are you gonna use it?
Oh, I'll be back before vacation's over.
Hey, wait a minute!
That's a week.
Oh, don't worry. With me helping Pop, it won't take that long.
We'll have this case cleaned up in no time!
Young man, you'll clean that up before you clean up any mysteries.
Yes, sir.
- Oh!
- What's the trouble?
My pal here got smacked by a hit-and-run.
- Oh!
- Is he hurt bad?
Looks like it. I got to get him to a hospital.
Say, we're only 20 miles from Reno.
I'll be glad to take you there.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Hey, I'll help you.
Oh!
Hey!
You can't do this to me!
Yes, sir. It's the biggest little city in the world, Mr. Chan.
I knew you was the famous detective the minute I seen you.
Congratulations upon penetrating humble disguise.
Aw, you're kiddin'.
We got a pretty smart police force of our own.
Eager to make acquaintance of same.
Would kindly drive us there first?
- To the police station?
- Please.
All right, but if you're here to solve the killing at the Hotel Sierra, you're too late.
'Cause they've already arrested the woman that done it.
Has unfortunate lady confessed?
Nope. Too smart for that.
But they got her dead to rights.
Motive and everything.
It seems her husband and this-
Yes. We read all about it in the papers.
Yeah, but you didn't see her the night she got here, like I did.
I knew there was something wrong, even then.
She didn't say nothin'.
Just sat back there quiet-like and stared out the window.
I figured she was unhappy about a divorce... but of course, now I know she was just sittin' back there cooking up the murder.
Very interesting evidence.
This man will prove most valuable on witness stand.
Witness stand? Who? Me?
I ain't getting mixed up in any murder trials.
No, sir. Not me!
I ain't saying another word.
Thank you so much.
- What's your name?
- Mr. Jones.
Yeah? And I suppose yours is Smith?
Correction, please.
Lieutenant Chan of Honolulu Police.
I thought so.
Lieutenant Chan! Oh, yes.
The chief is expecting you. This way, sir.
Well, Charlie! You old son of a gun.
I'm glad to see you again.
Sincerely hope status does not change.
- Why should it?
- Quite possible I make large nuisance of self.
Chief of Police King,
Mr. Curtis Whitman.
- How do you do?
- How do you do? L-
Whitman? Oh.
Well, I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances, Mr. Whitman.
I know you're anxious to talk about the case, but I'm on my way to the show-up.
- Like to have you come with me. Won't take long.
- Thank you.
Disorderly conduct, drunk, heaving brick through window, hitting two police.
Take him away, Clancy.
Wow, that helps me.
Boys, we've got a distinguished visitor today- an old pal of mine from Honolulu,
Charlie Chan.
- So this is Charlie, eh?
- How do you do? It's a pleasure.
- So pleased.
- Sit right down here, Charlie.
And we'll show you the choicest collection of con men and crackpots you've ever seen.
- Uh, meet Sheriff Fletcher.
- Most honored to meet illustrious Sheriff.
Oh, are you?
I've heard a lot about you too.
And, uh, this is a friend of Lieutenant Chan's, Mr. Whitman.
- How are you?
- Whitman? That name sounds familiar.
It ought to.
That's the case you're on.
That's where I heard it.
Well, Chan, I reckon you ain't here with Whitman for nothing.
Excellent observation.
Then we might as well understand each other right now.
Me and King got this case well in hand, and we don't need no outside help... or interference.
Don't mind him, Charlie. He's known as "Tombstone. " I guess you can figure out why.
Tombstones often engraved with words of wisdom.
Yeah, and ain't all of them covered with moss either.
Now that you're here, young fella... there's a couple of questions
I'd like to ask you.
- I know as little about this as you do.
- Yeah.
All right, let's get on with the show-up.
Bring 'em in, Mac.
All right, come on, you guys, and make it snappy.
- Get up on there.
- Quit pushing!
Quiet!
Hurry it along.
- You're gonna be sorry for this.
- Get up on there!
Take off your hats.
- Anything wrong, Charlie?
- Sudden shock to eyesight. Not permanent, I hope.
Step forward.
You too!
What's the charges on this kid?
Violation of ordinances 106, 109, 214-A.
And suspected of being nuts.
I am not nuts.
I told 'em how some hitchhikers stole all my clothes, and-and a car I borrowed.
Violent too.
What's your name, bub?
It's Jimmy Chan, sir. And my father's
Charlie Chan. Everybody's heard of him.
Mm-hmm, and I suppose you'd recognize your famous pa if you was to see him?
- Of course I would.
- Well, here.
Pop! Am I glad to see you!
You mean, he's really your son?
Must admit to dubious honor.
Pop, tell these guys I'm not crazy.
Parent must first convince self of same.
Possible to release offspring in my custody?
Sure, now that he's been identified.
Thank you. Now, will kindly explain presence here?
I just came up during the holidays to help you catch the murderer.
Pop appreciates valuable help of number two son... but first use talent to catch new pair of pants.
Thanks. Don't do anything on this case until I get back.
Is he gonna be on the case too?
- Self-appointed.
- He ain't the only one.
What's your name?
Who me? I'm Charlie Chan's number three son.
Me go home now?
Charlie. Oh, Charlie,
I didn't do it!
You know I didn't do it!
Have brought somebody.
Curt.
Thank you for coming, Curt.
Are you all right?
I mean-
Don't worry about anything.
Charlie's here to help you.
Sit down, please.
Now, want you to tell me exactly what occurred on night of murder.
Well, I was in bed, but not asleep.
- What time, please?
- About 12:30.
While I was lying there,
I- I heard a scream... not loud, but close to my room... and it was cut off sharply.
It frightened me, and I got up to see what was wrong.
How long after scream before you reach hallway?
Oh, I don't know.
A minute, maybe longer.
You saw no one in corridor?
No. But the door opposite mine was open a little, and the light was on.
I looked in and saw her lying on the floor.
Even when I reached her,
I didn't recognize her at first.
She was wearing some sort of beauty mask that completely covered her face.
Police have pictures?
Yes. Here.
You can have this set.
Thank you so much.
Continue, please.
I started to touch her, and- and I saw the blood... and then I recognized her by her hair.
Oh, it all happened so fast, Charlie, and it was such a shock to me.
I don't know what I did.
I just stood and looked at her, I guess.
And then suddenly the Chinese maid was screaming... and people ran into the room and... they accused me.
Police have reason to doubt truth of story?
We ain't got no reason to believe it.
She had plenty of motive too.
Why, only an hour or two before Mrs. Bentley was stabbed... this woman and her had a fight in the hotel bar, over her stealing her husband.
Oh, but I wasn't the only one she quarreled with.
You were the only one found standing over the body.
May humbly request one more favor?
Please arrange for Mrs. Whitman to return to hotel.
What? Turn loose the only suspect we got?
Can promise she will not attempt to leave Reno.
Chief, this Oriental's loco.
If you think you're gonna take her out of here like you did your son...
- you got another think coming.
- Please.
Victim was stabbed, you say?
Victim?
Oh, she was stabbed all right, with some kind of a knife.
Was weapon found on Mrs. Whitman?
Well, no, but she might've got rid of it.
Exactly what kind of knife, please?
How should I know?
We ain't found it yet.
That's what has us stumped, Charlie.
The knife is still missing.
Then police believe Mrs. Whitman foolish enough to kill... leave room to hide death weapon... then return to be discovered beside body of victim?
Well, my theory is, she came back for something- something she dropped.
Such as?
You can ask the doggonedest questions!
Chief, are you gonna be taken in by a lot of polite bowing and scraping?
You know we haven't got enough evidence for an indictment, Tombstone.
Yeah, but who's going to be responsible for her?
Suggest husband number one man for job.
Her husband? First thing I know, you'll be asking me to swear Whitman in as a deputy.
Can think of no one with better reason for wishing to capture murderer.
- I'll see what the D.A. Says about releasing her, Charlie.
- Thank you so much.
Doggonedest detective I ever saw.
He's taking 'em out of here faster than we can put 'em in.
Oh, excuse me, Sheriff.
What you hiding for?
Are you shadowing someone?
I ain't hiding. I got orders to stick around and help your pa... so I'm giving him plenty of rope.
- Where is he now?
- In there talking to the owner of the hotel.
Oh.
So right after the quarrel in the bar,
I took Mrs. Whitman up to her room.
I stayed with her for some time because she was pretty upset.
And I don't blame her. She took an awful beating from that Bentley woman.
- Mrs. Bentley very unpopular.
- That's putting it mildly.
Believe unlamented lady here to divorce self from present husband.
Yes. A George Bentley from San Francisco.
So far, we haven't been able to locate him.
- No one claim body?
- Her family. The police shipped it Back East yesterday.
Murder room still intact?
Yes. And locked, of course.
- Would like to visit same now.
- Certainly.
Mind if I snoop along?
Charming company turn lowly sandwich into rich banquet.
Hiya, Pop.
How do you like my new hat?
Off head at present.
Oh, sure.
Sorry.
Excuse, please. This is number two son, masquerading as Lone Ranger.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Say. Are you getting ready to visit the scene of the crime?
Yes. Would honorable Sheriff wish to come?
Heck, I been through that room so much
I could search it with my eyes shut.
Thank you. Will search then this time with eyes open.
Oh, Mrs. Russell!
Somebody's took the passkey off my ring.
- The passkey?
- Yes, ma'am. I left it hanging outside while I did 108... and when I come out, it was gone.
Gee, maybe the murderer took it.
- The murderer! Oh, oh!
- Quiet!
Call the desk and see if it's been turned in there.
I did, and it ain't.
Oh, ma'am, do you think-
I think you'll find it.
And please don't mention it to anyone.
Why, Dr. Ainsley!
What are you doing here?
I just remembered something that happened the night of the murder.
- Oh, uh, this is Charlie Chan, the detective.
- How do you do?
Most gratifying to meet hostess who remembers job at all times.
I get it. You think I was trying to warn him for some reason.
Is there any reason to warn honorable doctor?
Say, you don't waste any time, do you?
Well, I'm not any good at hiding it, so I may as well confess.
I'm rather fond of the honorable doctor.
But I must admit this doesn't look so hot.
What were you doing here?
Looking for the money Mrs. Bentley won the night she was murdered.
Don't you think you'd better leave the searching to the police?
They did search this room... but it occurred to me that no mention was made of the money.
You see, Mr. Chan, the jealousy angle was so strong against Mrs. Whitman... that no one thought of a simple robbery motive.
Most happy to consider same.
Was it large sum lady won?
Large enough for her to be paid off in a stack of hundred dollar bills.
Wally Burke cashed in her chips.
And handed her the money during the quarrel. I remember.
Hey! Cut it out! That hurts!
Take your hands off me, you big hick!
I haven't done anything!
Come peaceable now, or I'll get rough.
What's all this about, Sheriff?
Burke knows he ain't supposed to leave town.
Yet I just caught him trying to pay his bill and check out.
- Pay his bill? With what?
- Money. What do you think?
- That's funny. I thought he was broke.
- What gave you that idea?
You tried to borrow some from me the other night.
I wired home for it.
Any business of yours?
No. But it might be of interest to Mr. Chan.
- Well, what is all this?
- Was under impression Mrs. Bentley was friend of yours.
She was.
Surprised then, you unwilling to assist police by remaining in hotel.
Since you put it that way, of course I'll stay.
You'll stay no matter which way we put it.
Did Sheriff notice if Mr. Burke have hundred dollar bills?
He was downright filthy with 'em.
- I better lock him up.
- No.
Most inadvisable.
If want wild bird to sing do not put him in cage.
Maybe he won't sing, but leastwise he won't take off either.
Check later with telegraph company concerning story of Mr. Burke about cash.
Okay, Pop. I'll handle that.
If I can be of any further help, I'Il-
I'll trouble you for that passkey you took from the maid.
The maid?
I didn't take any key from her.
This is the one I used. The night clerk gave it to me last week on an emergency case.
I forgot to return it.
It's been in my desk ever since.
With gracious permission of hostess, will resume conversation later.
All right, and I'll be looking forward to it... because never have I so politely been told to scram.
And now, please, would like to occupy this room during stay in hotel.
- This room?
- Yes.
Gosh. It hasn't been three days since Mrs. Bentley was killed in here.
Yet room continues to attract visitors, and passkey still missing.
You mean we're gonna sleep in here and wait for somebody to sneak in on us?
Perhaps sleep more attractive in university classroom?
Oh, no. I don't mind.
Those things don't affect me!
I was just thinking about you, that's all. It might be dangerous.
I agree with him, Mr. Chan.
When searching for needle in haystack, haystack only sensible location.
Very well. I'll have her things packed and moved out when you're ready.
One moment. Have kept
Mrs. Whitman's room?
- Yes. Why?
- Expect her here this afternoon.
- She's being released?
- In custody of husband.
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- Perhaps somebody else not so glad.
Request no mention be made of release as yet.
- I understand.
- Thank you so much.
These police pictures sure are spooky.
- Death usually grim.
- What was she wearing the mask for?
Lady using new psychology on wrinkles.
Scares them away.
Oh.
Gee, this Mrs. Bentley sure liked herself.
She kept a publicity scrapbook, just like a movie actress.
- Where you find scrapbook?
- Hmm? Right here on the trunk.
Police pictures indicate scrapbook on vanity when body discovered.
Then somebody's moved it since the murder.
Say, do you suppose this Burke fellow might've killed her for the money?
Possible. Look for scissors among lady's effects.
Okay. Uh, any particular kind?
Straight edge indicate use of long desk shears.
You mean it might have been used as a death weapon?
If closed, would leave wound as described by police surgeon.
Gee, then I'd better look hard.
And if I don't find any, it'll look like we're right.
I don't see any in here.
Find something important, Pop?
What I do not find is more important.
- What do you mean?
- Pages covering 1935 and '36 have been removed.
Why, do you suppose?
Someone strangely anxious to conceal lady's activities during those years.
- Continue search for scissors.
- Okay.
What's the matter?
What's happened?
Get a load of that
Honolulu bloodhound.
Sounds good.
- Well, what about him?
- What about him?
Looks like his nose just led him straight to the bar.
Did you get me over here just to show me that?
- Ain't it enough?
- Listen, Tombstone. I knew Charlie was throwing this party.
He's doing it for a special reason... and I want you to stay out of it.
I'll stay out of it, but while he's wasting his time in there drinking... where's that murderer he was so sure of catching?
- Well, he may be drinking with him.
- Then why don't he arrest him?
Relax, will you? And for heaven's sake, don't call me again unless it's important.
- There.
- Thank you.
What's in it, Mr. Chan?
Something to loosen the tongue?
Humble Hawaiian drink.
Very mild.
- I'll stick to bourbon.
- Do we toast with humble drink, or just dive into it?
Suggest toast to very gracious woman and unhappy husband... now entering.
You don't have to hold your chin quite that high, Mary.
But they stared so.
How long do we have to stay?
Well, Charlie said for just one drink.
We can go someplace else for dinner.
I just want to get back up to my room.
All right, Mary.
Anything you say.
So, tell me, Mr. Chan, have they dropped the case against Mrs. Whitman entirely?
Police realize evidence very weak.
Personally, I don't think much of the motive.
You do not find
Mr. Whitman attractive?
I couldn't be attracted to any man who was stupid enough to fall forJeanne Bentley.
Well, thanks.
Perhaps acquaintance with murdered lady too brief to learn real character.
It took me a couple of months, but I finally found her out.
It didn't take me long. The minute she walked in the hotel, I had her labeled.
- That was first meeting with Mrs. Bentley?
- Yes.
And you, Dr. Ainsley?
I never knew her before she came here.
Why should you ask me?
Was only asking if you required to have glass refilled.
Oh, uh, yes.
Yes. Thanks.
That was slick, Mr. Chan... but if you're trying to find someone who knew her before she came here, why don't you ask?
Have asked all except Mrs. Russell.
- I didn't know her.
- Mr. Burke, it looks like you're still leading the pack.
- What are you trying to do?
- Oh, don't be stuffy.
If you did do it, I'm all for you.
That woman had at least one murder coming to her.
Would you have killed Mrs. Bentley?
Probably. If she'd annoyed me enough and the knife had been handy.
Lady killed with scissors, not knife.
- Scissors?
- What kind of scissors?
Very sharp. Pointed on end and long enough to inflict very deep wound.
Implying surgical scissors?
Found doctor's office well-equipped with same.
- I didn't know you had called.
- So sorry, doctor not in.
Are you accusing me?
What possible motive could he have had?
None. But Mr. Burke seems to have had plenty.
- Mr. Burke.
- Just a minute.
This is the second time you've tried to pin this thing on me. What's on your mind?
Well, you never explained where you got the money.
Come on. I don't want you to get mixed up in this.
- You stay out there!
- Curt!
Hello. Give me the police station, quick!
Hello. Give me the chief. Hurry!
Yes. King speaking.
What?
I said you knew he was throwing a party... but did you know he was staging a riot?
Well, stop it, you fool, before somebody gets hurt.
Okay. But you told me to keep out of it.
- Think he's hurt badly?
- I hope not.
- Who hit me?
- Are you hurt, Mr. Fletcher?
You're darn tootin' I'm hurt.
I got a good mind to arrest the whole bunch of you.
I'll take him to his room.
All he needs is a sedative.
He'll sleep it off.
Perhaps you had better assist doctor.
If honorable sheriff will permit... think head need examination.
It's not my head that needs examining.
It's the people's that let you come in here and stir up a lot of trouble.
Regret accident, but sometimes must strike innocent to trap guilty.
Yeah? Well, if you think you're gonna use my skull for bait, you're crazy.
Thank you so much.
- Mr. Chan?
- Yes?
- Telephone.
- Oh.
- Yes?
- Hello? Pop?
I just got the report from the telegraph office.
Wally Burke's family cabled him $1,500 yesterday.
- Oh.
- Can I join the party now?
Party all finished.
Hey, Pop, somebody's trying to get in here.
What?
Oh, gee. I-I'm awfully sorry.
- Hello, Pop.
- Pop humbly suggest you assist young lady to rise.
Oh, sure. Gee, I hope
I didn't hurt you.
My dignity is slightly bruised, but no bones broken.
Excuse please.
Can explain presence in this room?
Yes, honorable sir.
Are you Charlie Chan?
Praise in any language very sweet... but young lady have not yet explained presence here.
My name is Choy Wong, honorable sir.
Gee, that's a pretty name.
Uh, isn't it, Pop?
- My name's Jimmy.
- Jimmy Chan is also a nice-sounding name.
If Choy Wong will be so kind... have not yet explained presence in this room.
I was told that I'm now free to pack Mrs. Bentley's clothes.
- Obtain key from clerk?
- Why, yes, sir.
- Gosh, Pop, you don't think that she-
- Shh.
Was personal maid to deceased lady?
- Work for her in 1935 or '6?
- Why, no.
She engaged me in San Francisco a month ago and brought me here.
Ever glance through lady's scrapbook?
I looked at some of the pictures.
Were pages torn out when Choy Wong look at book?
- No, I'm sure they weren't.
- Is it all right for her to pack now?
- Yes.
- I'd better help you.
We might find something important.
You'd better clear out the closet first.
All right.
Oh, Charlie.
We've got something to show you.
I found this in Wally Burke's room.
As you see, the scissors are missing.
Gee, they'd be just the size we're looking for.
And it's got his initials on it too.
Mr. Burke aware of discovery?
No, the doctor spotted it while I was trying to quiet Burke.
- Administer sedative?
- Yes. He'll be asleep for some time.
Will question young man when he wakes up.
Thank you so much.
Assistance greatly appreciated.
Burke's in the clear about that money he got... but he'll have a tough time explaining this.
Can recall last time
Mrs. Bentley wore riding boots?
The day before she was killed.
She went out early in the morning and didn't get back till noon.
Say, if she was on a horse, where'd she get all that mud?
- And those scratches?
- Most clever deduction.
Lady did not remain on horse.
Hold boots, please.
- Do you think we've got something, Pop?
- Time and analysis will tell.
- Can reach me at police station if needed.
- Okay.
Don't worry.
I'll keep an eye on things here.
Am certain can depend on same.
Pop sure is smart. He doesn't miss a thing.
Except his son moving the furniture.
Oh, you mean that bench over there?
That wasn't anything. I just dropped a cigarette and burned a hole in the rug.
Does honorable father think you're too young to smoke?
Oh, no. I'm no kid.
I help him solve his cases.
- You do?
- Yeah.
I've got an idea how to solve this one.
Do you want to help me?
Yes- If I don't get killed.
I wouldn't want you to do anything dangerous.
- I think you're very nice.
- What do you want me to do?
Well, I haven't got it all doped out yet.
Do you mind if I smoke?
It helps me to think.
Drive to police station, please.
Okay, but I still ain't talkin'.
Excellent.
Aw, now, Priscilla.
I told you not to follow me.
I'm workin'.
Well, I just talked with the New York police.
They're putting men on the 1935 and '36 newspaper files right away... and they're going to check up on
Mrs. Bentley's bank account.
- Thank you so much.
- Oh. What did you find on the boots?
Plenty of sand, some pollen from desert flowers, red clay...
- a suggestion of copper shavings and-
- Horsefeathers.
And minute splinters from very old wood.
Copper and old wood suggest abandoned mine.
Yes, well, there are lots of those around here... but the red clay narrows it to someplace south of town.
Distance also limited.
Lady must ride there on horse, transact mysterious business...
- and return to hotel by noon.
- I see.
Honorable chemist suggest... old wood might possibly indicate ghost town.
Yes, that's right.
Oh, wait a minute.
I know one.
Yes. Here it is.
Yeah, there it is, right there.
It's up in the hills, about four miles off the main road.
It's beyond Dead Man's Canyon.
Yes, there's plenty of red clay in that district.
And the old Sully copper mines were there too.
That fits the analysis, and it's about the only one that fits the distance.
Say, if you're interested...
I'll have Tombstone drive you up there in the morning.
Visit to Dead Man's Canyon with Tombstone-
Very appropriate.
Will consider same tomorrow.
You want him to drive you back to the hotel?
Have hotel driver waiting.
Thank you so much.
Good-bye.
Hey, what are you going to do?
I'm going right along after that guy.
He started one riot tonight, and I aim to see he don't start no more.
Darned if I can figure why you want to drive way out here... at this time of night for.
Have strong desire to visit real ghost town.
But it ain't nothin' to look at even in the daytime.
You'll see for yourself in a minute.
It's just around the bend.
Please turn off all lights when entering abandoned village.
- What for?
- Do not wish to alarm sleeping ghosts.
Wish to wait here?
If you don't mind, I think I would.
Oh. It's only you, Sheriff. Hello.
Where is that Chan fella?
He's wanderin' around somewheres...
- lookin' for ghosts.
- Ghosts nothin'.
He's up to something, and I aim to find out what it is.
He can't give me the slip and get away with it.
Are you tryin' to be funny?
I don't think so.
I ain't laughin'.
- What's that?
- It ain't mice.
Come out, whoever you are, with your hands in the air.
- What was that?
- That ain't no... c-c-cow.
You're darn tootin' it ain't. Come on.
Light a match, Chan. I got him bulldogged.
- Why, this is a mining engineer's kit.
- Wait.
Wait'll you get a load of these papers.
Bentley-The dead woman's husband?
How did he get away?
Regret scuffle which occurred in dark... to Mr. Bentley's advantage.
But have written description of car with number of license.
Suggest you circulate same.
And how, I'll circulate it. This puts an entirely new light on the case.
He's been out there all this time in hiding, and I want to know why.
Also why wife visit him in secret.
Mmm. Send out a general alarm for this car.
The driver is thought to be George Bentley... wanted in connection with his wife's murder.
He'll try to leave the state, so notify state and county highway patrols...
- to be on the lookout.
- Yes, sir.
I've got a hunch that when we get him we'll have our murderer.
Sure be a relief to me to get off of this merry-go-round.
Don't you ever solve any of your cases in the daytime?
My feet hurt.
Chief King speaking.
What? All right.
We'll be over right away.
That was your son.
Something's happened at the hotel.
Must hurry.
Excuse please.
All right, break it up, folks.
Break it up. One side, please.
- What's wrong, Peters?
- This fella tried to sneak out of the hotel.
With these, Pop-
The ones we were lookin' for.
I told the officer that somebody might try to do this... and sure enough, it was him.
You've got a lot of explaining to do, Burke.
I want a lawyer.
That won't be hard.
Half the population of Reno is lawyers.
- These are yours?
- Yes.
But I didn't kill her.
Someone's trying to make it look like I did, and I know who it is.
- Just a minute, young fella.
- Sit down.
Please.
Have not explained scissors.
Jeanne borrowed them from me over a week ago, and never returned them... so when I heard she'd been stabbed with scissors, why-
Who said she was stabbed with scissors?
Lieutenant Chan-
And the police surgeon confirmed it.
Go on.
Don't tell me anything.
I'll just wait till the whole thing is solved...
- then read about it in the papers.
- I'm sorry, Tombstone.
I thought you knew it.
All right, go on, Mr. Burke.
Well, I naturally figured she was killed with my scissors.
Explain present possession and attempt to dispose of same.
Dr. Ainsley gave me a sedative... and when I woke up, the scissors were on my table.
Someone put them there, but with all the accusations... that have been made against me, no one would have believed that.
L- Well, I had to get rid of'em.
- Mr. Chan, there's something queer about this.
- You bet your life there is.
Somebody planted these in my room... and if they did it for a joke,
I don't think it's funny.
Excuse please.
You were speaking when lady interrupt.
I was just going to say that I found a pair of desk shears...
- exactly like those in my room tonight.
- What?
- Doctor also find similar pair?
- Yes.
But how did you know?
- Have theory.
- It better be good. They couldn't have all killed her.
Would like to see scissors, please.
- Bring the ones up from my office too.
- Certainly.
Number two son finally win jackpot?
- What do you mean?
- Scissors cost money.
Oh, I had some money left after I bought this suit.
- What are you talking about?
- Think ambitious young detective... can explain confusion of scissors.
Well, I figured that if all the suspects found scissors in their rooms... the one that was guilty would try to get rid of'em.
- And it worked too.
- You mean you planted 'em, son?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm as much to blame as Jimmy is.
He thought of it, but I'm the one who did it.
Oh, boy, am I relieved.
I found these under a cushion of a chair in Mary's room.
But we didn't put any scissors in Mrs. Whitman's room.
What?
- You didn't?
- No, sir. We couldn't get in.
That policeman was on guard outside the door.
Yeah, on my orders.
It looks like I was pretty smart too.
Now what have you got to say, Mr. Chan?
But I didn't have them there.
I didn't know anything about them.
Have you got that leather case, Charlie?
Uh, on desk.
Here they are.
What's happened?
Bring scissors, please.
- These the ones that were found in Mrs. Whitman's room?
- Yes.
These have the same trademark as the letter opener.
I'm afraid there's no doubt that these are the ones she was stabbed with.
You're afraid?
You got the goods on her the second time... and you got him trying to hide incriminating evidence.
So you apologize. Horsefeathers!
I ain't losin' no more time.
Wait a minute, Tombstone.
What are you going to do?
To see the district attorney. I'm gonna tell him everything we got on this woman!
I'll lay you 10 to 1 he'll have it... before the grand jury by morning.
Curt, stop it, please.
You're blaming yourself for showing them the scissors.
Of course I am.
All I want is to help you, and, oh, I've made things worse.
I know you wanted to help.
But what did you think when you found them?
That's what matters.
You must have thought I was guilty.
I didn't think anything except that I was responsible.
Come in, Charlie.
Sometimes tears from woman very happy sign.
I'm pretty scared, Charlie.
No need to be.
At moment police are searching for man who is very likely suspect...
- and when-
- What is it?
Have burned sleeve.
Well, you don't smoke, Mary.
How did you do it?
I don't know.
I- I didn't even notice.
I haven't had it on since-
Since when?
Since the night I... found Mrs. Bentley.
Please, return with me to room.
Jimmy.
Lone Ranger's hat bad enough without wearing horse's blanket.
Oh, you mean these pajamas, Pop?
I didn't buy 'em.
I found 'em in your bag.
They're the ones Mom gave you for Christmas.
Although 3,000 miles away, honorable wife still make presence felt.
Please.
Mary, would like you to repeat actions on finding body.
All right.
I, uh- I saw her from the hall... and crossed over to the dressing table.
She was lying here between the bench and-
Well, the bench wasn't here.
Can remember exact position ofbench?
Not exactly, but, uh-
It was something like that.
What's the matter?
What is it, Charlie?
- First bright light in very dense fog.
- You mean a clue to the murder?
Gee, Pop, I can't let you get sidetracked that way.
I burned it with a cigarette.
Rug burned with acid...
- not cigarette.
- Acid?
How about Mary's sleeve?
Also acid.
Why, there is some there. It must have been spilled here and dripped down.
If Mary leaned here, that explains the burn on the sleeve.
Gee, it's a good thing you didn't get any on your arm, Mrs. Whitman.
Nitric acid leaves a nasty burn.
Number two son think it nitric acid?
Well, it could have been.
It eats through anything but glass.
Have seen one bottle nitric acid tonight... but bottle full.
What would acid be doing here?
Think answer may be found in second bottle-
Not so full.
Nitric acid?
Yes, I have some.
That's funny. I could have sworn this bottle was full.
No one have occasion to use same?
No.
Excuse.
What is purpose of gauze?
It prevents breaking and leakage. Why?
Gauze on this different weave and quality from gauze on other bottle.
It shouldn't be.
They're all shipped from the same firm.
With permission, will keep till morning.
Certainly.
But do you think it's connected with the murder?
Person who remove pages from Mrs. Bentley's scrapbook...
- may have answer.
- Pages from her scrapbook?
Covering years 1935 and '36.
Thought doctor may have noticed when searching lady's room.
No, I didn't.
Thank you so much.
Label this "Gauze from Wally Burke's Room. "
Okay.
- Who's next?
- Miss Wells, but you'd better search her room.
All right.
But what if they catch me?
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll be right behind you.
- Yes? Oh! Good morning.
- You bet your life it's a good morning.
- We've got Bentley, the husband.
- Good.
Tombstone's on his way over to Tonopah to pick him up.
- But I've got some real news from New York.
- Yes?
The police checked on Mrs. Bentley's
New York bank account.
She wrote two checks this month... for 1,500 apiece.
And who do you think they were made out to?
Dr. Ainsley.
That is highly interesting.
You check on newspaper files?
And how. Say, no wonder somebody wanted to get rid of the pages of that scrapbook.
They're dynamite. Get this.
In 1935, Jeanne was married to a man named Russell.
Russell?
Related to Mrs. Russell here?
Her ex-husband.
And he died suddenly in 1936.
What was cause of death?
According to the attending physician,
Russell died of a heart attack... but the attending physician was our old friend Dr. Ainsley.
Must see Mrs. Russell at once.
Very urgent.
Pop!
- They just found Mrs. Russell in her room, strangled.
- Lady dead?
I don't know. The maid found her and called Dr. Ainsley.
- Dr. Ainsley?
- Doctor with her now?
- Yes. - Hurry.
- Come along.
Lift her arm to the outside of the covers, please.
- Doctor. One moment.
- What are you giving her?
Adrenaline. She's got to have a heart stimulant.
- Will take, please.
- What's the matter, Mr. Chan?
Have you gone mad?
Examination of hypodermic will determine that.
- Jimmy!
- I got it, Pop.
- Thank you so much.
- Let me have that, please.
Keep this man covered, Peters.
I'll call the police surgeon.
Choy Wong, stay with lady.
Can help when police surgeon arrive.
Jimmy.
You search rooms for gauze?
Yeah. This was in
Wally Burke's room.
I guess the doctor used it last night to patch him up after the fight.
And this was in Miss Wells' room, in the wastebasket.
Neither one of them matches the gauze on the nitric acid bottle... but I brought them along anyway.
We didn't get a chance to look in here.
- Can look now.
- Yes.
Pop! This is it.
It matches.
That means that Mrs. Russell took the acid from the Doctor's office.
- Do you suppose that she-
- Please.
You will take all exhibits to room and guard carefully.
If lady recovers sufficiently to talk... bring all suspects to scene of crime.
Oh. Also request... everyone wear same clothes as night of murder.
All right, Bentley, come on.
What are you bringing me here for?
Oh, ain't you heard?
We don't put people in jail no more.
We take 'em to the best hotel.
Give 'em music with their meals... and hot and cold running water and-
Horsefeathers.
Come on.
Stick around if you like, Mr. Whitman, but Charlie doesn't want you inside.
Okay. I guess Charlie knows what he's doing. I'll wait downstairs.
Joe, keep your eye on the elevator and the stairs.
You boys stick here and don't let anybody leave this room.
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.
- What's goin' on?
- Charlie's called all the suspects together.
He's going to produce the murderer.
He's going to produce the murderer?
After I drive to Tonopah to pick 'im up?
Go on in, Burke.
Well, I'm a cockeyed son of a gun if this don't beat all.
- What's the matter?
- I knew that Chan fella was fancy... but if he can't hold an inquest without making it formal, I give up.
Relax, will you?
All right, go in, ladies, please.
Come on. He's probably serving cocktails again.
Have been called together because each of you... had very strong reason for hating Mrs. Bentley.
One of you had motive powerful enough to kill.
Here is lady whose husband was stolen from her... by murdered woman five years ago.
Here is young man, blindly in love... until eyes rudely opened by ugly insult in public.
Miss Wells, impulsive young lady in love with Doctor... has admitted she would have killed Mrs. Bentley... if given sufficient provocation.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
If you're takin' 'em from left to right... you just skipped your friend Mrs. Whitman.
She's still the only one found with the body.
Will neglect no one.
Here is husband.
Most anxious to get rid of wife.
Only in a legal, straightforward manner.
Then why were you hiding out in that ghost town?
I'm a mining engineer.
I got a job to look over those mines... afterJeanne had established residence in Reno.
I was afraid if I was seen here it would look like collusion... and the divorce wouldn't be granted.
Or maybe you thought you had a perfect alibi-
That no one would suspect you of murdering your wife if she was giving you a divorce.
Yeah. If you're so all-fired innocent... why did you put up such a scrap last night and then run away?
I didn't know you were connected with the police.
I found a man sneaking around my place, so I jumped him.
- You would have done the same thing.
- Horsefeathers.
- I'm arrestin' you.
- Tombstone.
He's already under arrest.
Why did wife visit you on day before murder?
She was panicky.
Said she needed $5,000 right away.
- Did you give it to her?
- I didn't have it.
- Did she say why she wanted it?
- No.
Think Dr. Ainsley can furnish answer to that.
What do you mean?
Doctor said had known
Mrs. Bentley only three weeks... yet signed false certificate on death of first husband...
Wayne Russell, three years ago.
False certificate?
You mean she killed him?
Canceled checks prove
Mrs. Bentley... paid Dr. Ainsley large sums of money to keep guilty secret.
- If I'd known that I-
- Didn't you?
No.
Then please explain why you visit Mrs. Bentley... with acid bottle.
How did you know-
We know you were here.
I came to disfigure her.
When Mrs. Whitman arrived at the hotel and I saw what happened...
I realized thatJeanne was going to ruin her life... the same as she'd ruined mine.
All the hate I'd felt came back to me.
I got the acid from the doctor's office.
But found lady's face protected by beauty mask.
That's it.
Then you grabbed the scissors and stabbed her.
- Mrs. Russell, I arrest you in the name of the law.
- I didn't kill her.
When Jeanne saw the acid she grabbed for it.
Said she'd give me a dose of my own medicine.
I kept her from getting it, but some of the acid was spilled.
When I left her, she was very much alive.
But now I understand what happened.
When she couldn't get the $5,000 from Bentley...
- the doctor killed her.
- He didn't.
Missing $100 bills found in doctor's room...
- prove he was here on night of murder.
- What ifhe was?
If he was blackmailing Mrs. Bentley, would he kill his meal ticket?
- You keep out of this.
- I won't keep out of it.
Excuse.
Miss Wells very calm young lady... except where doctor is concerned.
Do you think I'm going to let a bunch of blundering fools pin a murder on him?
What time was it when you brought the acid up here?
- After 12:00.
- And she was alive then.
Dr. Ainsley came up here at 10 minutes of 10::00... and left at 11:00.
I know, because I was waiting for him in the office.
- Waiting with watch in hand?
- What do you mean?
Such careful check on time highly suggestive of jealousy.
What are you doing now, accusing her?
Have accused no one as yet.
Merely search for truth.
What about Mrs. Russell?
She admits coming up here with the acid.
Yet you take her word for it that she left without killing her.
Please.
Can explain bandage found in room?
Who found it in my room?
Number two son-
Most ambitions amateur sleuth.
A lot of people found scissors in their room... and they were planted by number two son... so what does that prove,
Mr. Charlie Chan?
Look out!
Your-Your sleeve's on fire.
- Look out. Fire.
- Stop it. Let go of me.
- Stop it! Leave me alone.
- What is it?
Leave me alone.
Stop it!
What happened, Charlie?
Merely experiment with liquid smoke.
Quite harmless, but highly successful... in trapping murderess.
Honorable sheriff may now make arrest.
Who? Her? Uh-uh.
I ain't makin' no more arrests until I got the evidence.
Burn on arm received from nitric acid... when Miss Wells reach for scissors to stab Mrs. Bentley.
Evidence of guilt... quite apparent in desperate desire to hide burn.
Sorry to resort to trick, but lady make fatal mistake... by wearing jacket she did not wear...
- on night of murder.
- Just a minute.
Where do you think you'll get with that evidence?
Never mind.
Mr. Chan's right.
I did kill her.
But I didn't intend to.
I didn't even bring a weapon.
I only wanted to find out what was between... her and Dr. Ainsley, but she wouldn't tell me.
She was drunk and nasty, and when I threatened... to get the truth out of him, she went for me.
She'd have killed me, so I grabbed up... the first thing I saw to defend myself.
You've got to believe me.
Sincerely hope will convince jury of same.
One moment, please.
- May also arrest doctor.
- What for?
Analysis of hypodermic revealed deadly poison, not adrenaline.
What? Has there been another murder?
No, Tombstone.
Attempted murder.
- Dr. Ainsley tried to kill Mrs. Russell.
- Why?
Doctor guessed it was Mrs. Russell who removed pages from scrapbook.
He feared exposure of old guilt... in connection with Wayne Russell's death.
Where was I when all this was goin' on?
- In Tonopah.
- Horsefeathers.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
Back to Tonopah. They got a nice, easy case of cattle rustling over there... and I know I can pin it on the guilty guy... because they found him under the cow.
All right, Doctor.
Is it over?
Are you cleared?
Did you think of that liquid smoke gag all by yourself?
Pop and I worked it out together.
Oh, Jimmy, I think you're wonderful.
Number two son's present idea strictly his own... but not bad as example.
- Hello, Gorman.
- Where is the honeymoon cabin?
Mr. And Mrs. Krozac are in the imperial suites straight ahead.
- Joe's bringin' that dame back is swell.
- Joe gets married like he does everything else.
What gets me is with all those smooth dolls, Joe could have had...
No, not for a wife. This girl is healthy... homespun stock, I imagine.
Joe's smart.
He knows his eugenics.
- You mean, he knows his onions?
- All right, onions, onions.
Well, here's to ya, baby.
Hold it, folks.
Hi, Mrs. Krozac.
Give us the dope on your romance with Joe... From your angle.
- Pardon?
- How it started, the first time you met him,
All that stuff.
I'm sorry, but I not speak english very good.
I'm teaching her. Just enough, huh?
This is real front-page stuff, huh?
Joe Krozac finally married.
A respectable family man.
Somehow it makes you sweeter, Joe.
Could I have shots of Mrs. Krozac alone?
Sure. Why not?
You go right ahead.
Say, you boys aren't drinking.
Ambassador, there's an ex-fellow countryman of yours aboard. Joe Krozac?
- We are not proud of him.
- Some people think there's a lot of glamour about a big shot racketeer.
I do not. I regard him as an enemy of the public, a blot upon your civilization,
A man who makes organized crime and murder a business.
- Well, Joe, How you been?
- Hiya, Joe.
Well, Curly.
See they fixed these canoes-
- Have a drink.
That-a boy.
Sure glad to see you.
Speaking as your lawyer, Joe, does Mrs. Krozac know anything?
Nope. I'm keeping my private life private.
Would it make any difference to her if she did know?
Listen, I won't have any trouble with Talya.
She's hand-picked from my old hometown.
I took her to Paris and put her through everything...
Facial massages, manicures, lace pants, all the works.
All she knows from now on is raising a family.
Another daffy guy you know is getting married, too.
Yeah? Who's that?
Frankie Kile.
I'll have to send him a wedding present.
He took his present two weeks ago.
He and his 3 brothers moved to Brooklyn.
You let him!
The last words you said to me before you sailed- and you spoke 'em into this ear, not this one- was don't do nothin' until I get back. Remember?
And you said as how Napoleon appreciated one thing in a soldier.
Obedience!
I like a guy that uses his head,
A guy smart enough to act in an emergency.
And the Kile brothers moving into Brooklyn is an emergency,
But you wouldn't know it,
'cause your brain is set in cement.
You let the other guy poke his nose around the corner, and soon he's on your front lawn.
Pretty soon, he's you.
I learned that when I was 16 years old.
That's why when any guy put up his head, I cut it down.
That's why I got warehouses and men and trucks
And private telephones from coast to coast.
That's why I got you guys working for me.
The Kile brothers didn't forget you.
Here's your invitation to the wedding.
Ok.
I'll give him a present...
And it won't be Brooklyn.
Frank! Frankie!
It's Krozac's mob.
It's the Kile brothers.
- Are they all dead?
3 of them.
Acey's still alive.
Well...
Not a bad picture of me and Talya.
Not a bad picture of the Kile brothers, either.
Yeah, but there ain't enough of them in it.
- Where's my wife?
- She's coming now, sir.
Joe. Joe!
Oh, Joe!
Please do not go away.
When are you gonna grow up, baby?
Pardons?
Sit down.
Have your breakfast.
That-a girl.
Joe, did you... finish your business... yesterday evening?
Oh, sure, sure.
Everything's fine.
Don't forget to remind me to send him a great big wreath
When they lay him away.
You know, something like me.
Chrysanthemums, huh?
Oh! It's-it's-
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's us. That's us.
What is this?
Oh, just some guys.
Look at the other picture, think how lucky you are. Married to a great big shot,
You know, like Napoleon.
Joe... Napoleon.
Big shot.
Exactly how much English does this doll understand?
Oh, just enough.
Pretty soon, I'll have to spell out things to you.
Yeah, if you could spell.
Oh, sometimes
I speak, and I read english good, too.
You got one thing to be thankful for.
She can't beef much until she can talk better.
Is, uh... Curly married?
Not exactly, but I get by.
What's the matter?
Hey, baby.
Do you think she's sick?
Well, I never had a dame who slept during meals.
- It's Joe.
- Here.
Oh, thanks.
You better now, huh?
Yes.
I fall.
Do I?
Yeah, right at the table, out like a light.
I fall this morning, too.
Yeah, but why do you do all this?
Curly... He go now.
Yeah, sure. Go call Doc Jerry Wertz.
Get him over here right away.
Ok, but I'm warning you.
Wertz will want to take a bullet out of her.
What's the matter with you, Talya?
How i-i tell you...
Don't con me around, baby. What's wrong?
I not speak at all, but I tell you.
Yes...
I'm sure now.
Little Napoleon...
Like Joe.
You-you're happy,
Joe?
Happy?
Why, I'm so happy, I'd like to go up and bust somebody in the nose.
Boy, do I know how to pick them?
Why, I'm the happiest man in the world.
Hello, doc?
This is Curly.
Come on over to Joe's right away.
His wife is takin' dives.
Ok.
Oh, Hello. Too bad you didn't get here a little earlier.
- You could have had a cup of coffee.
- Call Joe.
- For what?
- What do you think? Call him.
All right.
If you insist.
I'll fix it up with Doc Wertz so it! Is a boy.
If he don't make it a boy, he knows he's got to talk to me.
Joe Krozac, you-
I'm gonna be a father!
She just told me.
Yeah? Well, there are a couple of storks waiting for you.
What?
C- o-p-s.
Did I spell it right?
Well, they're here early.
Listen, honey,
I got to go out for a little while.
You just stay here and be quiet.
Doc will be right over, hey?
- Oh, you go away from me, Joe?
- I'll be right back.
Don't you turn any somersaults when I'm gone.
Joe Krozac, Junior.
Well, how are you, boys?
Glad to see you. What's up?
You hear about that target practice down at the Rod & gun club?
Yeah, and I'm shocked.
You know what I mean.
Shocked.
Yeah, we know what you mean.
Ever met Acey Kile here?
They didn't do a good job on me, Joe.
No, I never met him,
But I know his 3 brothers.
That's why I can't get over this.
They were very dear friends of mine.
You always heard them say they were friends of mine, didn't you?
Young and bashful, huh?
Let's go down to
Headquarters, talk it over.
Sure. Glad to help if I can.
Don't give them too much of your valuable time, Joe.
Where do you think you're going?
- Get into your benny.
- Anything to oblige.
It certainly is a terrible thing seeing your old friends getting knocked off
Makes you wonder, don't it?
You ain't kidding anybody.
Only Krozac kills like that.
Someday, if the cops don't take care
- of you, I will, you dirty...
- Take it easy.
Tell my wife
I'll be back in a couple of hours. and call Gorman. Let him know where we're going. You know where.
He ought to.
Danny, I always want
You to feel free to call on Joe Krozac to help you with your little mysteries.
All right, Joe.
Danny is touchy about his mysteries.
He has so many of them.
What's the matter? You lonely?
Want to see me home, too?
No. I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. Mr. Broderick.
Hello, Krozac.
Oh, glad to meet you.
Mr. Broderick's a federal man.
Yeah? Well, you're a long way from Washington, ain't ya?
Oh, that's not so far these days.
- Have a cigar.
- No, thanks.
Have a warrant.
Oh, we get lots of those.
This is a federal warrant, Joe.
What's it for?
Income tax evasion.
- Are you kidding?
- It's on the level, Joe.
Income...
So, Uncle Sam is checking up on a guy's arithmetic, huh?
Well, look here.
We don't earn a cent, see?
My company is practically bankrupt.
- Eh, Gorman?
- The books prove that.
We've had those books gone over by experts. A lot of things don't jive.
Income tax evasion?
That's a laugh. Why, that's the funniest thing I ever heard.
Let me see that.
"United States of America Vs. Joe kro-"
How do you like that?
Big shot Joe Krozac in the can on a bookkeeping rap.
Is that funny, or not?
Yeah, well, that isn't fair. That's just likehitting a guy below the belt.
I suppose all the guys
Are laughing.
Hardly. It's far too serious for that.
What do you mean? What's serious?
Are you daffy?
I'm just burned up that they're sticking a knife in my back, like I was a petty larceny crook!
Joe Krozac!
How much longer is this appeal gonna take?
I've got a conference scheduled for tomorrow morning.
Well, how about that ex-Governor Charlie Burnham
I thought they were gonna-
It takes time, Joe.
They're all working.
Yeah, sure.
In the meantime, I'm in here!
For months, you've been telling me it was going to be ok.
We're doing the best we can.
But the government's as determined to keep you in as you are to get out.
In fact, they intend sending you away.
Send me?
Send me where?
Atlanta... Leavenworth.
I can't find out exactly.
When you get this appeal, everything will stop, right?
If we can get it.
I want to tell you-
You're telling me nothing.
I ain't goin' to no federal pen!
There isn't one big enough to hold Joe Krozac.
You're getting me out, understand?
If you can't do it, you get somebody who can.
I ain't leavin' this place with all my dough.
You ought to be able to get me out of here with-
Your wife's here to see you.
My wife?
Better snap it up.
I don't think she's staying long.
Hello, baby.
Joe!
Oh, Joe!
- You shouldn't have come down to this dump.
- I don't understand all this.
Why they have you here?
They hurt you, Joe?
- Listen, kid, you feelin' all right?
- They give you good food, yes?
You guys better get her home right away, see?
- No.
I no go home for little while now.
I go to the hospital, Joe.
Hospital?
You better get her down there right away.
Oh, don't worry, Joe.
Everything will be all right.
Look here, kid, you sure everything-
- I'm sure.
I came to see you first.
You come to see me when baby there?
Why, sure, sure, I will, kid.
You just hang on.
Sid and Curly will take care of you.
Come on now, kid.
I...
I'm-i'm a small bit afraid, Joe.
Kiss me.
That's it.
You're Joe Krozac's wife, baby.
You see that she gets the best of everything, see?
Let me know the minute it happens.
Just leave everything to me.
Good-bye, Joe.
I think of you all through.
That-a baby.
Good-bye, baby.
It's a tough time to be in here, Joe.
What's so tough about it?
I couldn't help her any.
It's all up to her now.
Hey, you!
Any word for me yet?
Hey! Any word from the hospital?
- Ah, quit hollerin' will ya, Krozac?
They do it all on the way to the hospital.
Hey! Any word from my wife yet?
- Nope.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- Out.
Hey, wait a minute.
Look out now.
You're not going to take me out like this,
Not with all those reporters?
No. You don't get any more publicity.
That's all over.
Hello, Joe.
Wait a minute!
He's clean.
You don't think
I'd rob the government of him, do you?
I knew my old pal would be disappointed if I wasn't around to say good-bye.
All right, Acey, we'll get you a soapbox.
So long, Joe.
I'll see you in 10 years. I'll have a little
Valentine for you when you get out.
Come on, Joe.
Let's go.
That cheap hoodlum don't worry me none.
Look here, why can't we postpone this till I hear about my kid?
- What's the rush anyway?
- Come on, Joe.
Here you are.
Good-bye, Joe.
That's what you think.
All right now.
Special delivery.
Down in there.
Here you are.
Hey, what the-
Hey, that's Krozac!
Hiya, Mr. Krozac!
Well, say, looks like
I'm bunkin' with the captain.
How long did you sign on for, captain?
You talk to me again, and I'll smash your mouth.
No, you won't.
- Where are we going?
- Don't worry about it.
We're going on a world cruise, captain.
Maybe they'll let you steer.
Say, where are we going?
Any of you mugs know where we're going?
This is Joe Krozac talking!
Whoa ho, Josephine!
Still think you're Napoleon, Joe?
Hello, Joe, welcome to dreamland.
I'll save you the paper, pal.
- How's the little suit?
- Hey, that must be Joe.
Ok!
Hello, Joe.
Remember me?
You told me you didn't like me once.
You stepped on a lot of the boys' toes in your time,
But wherever you're going, we're all gonna be with you, Joe.
Happy?
Looks like you're among friends, huh?
I might as well introduce myself.
You remember that fancy work you did in Germantown?
Well, I'm Casper.
- Where are we? I wonder.
- Been ridin' all night and all day.
Must be around Kansas city, huh?
Leavenworth.
That's where we're going.
Yeah?
Gee, I hope they send us to Leavensworth.
What do you want to go there for?
So I could be near me old man.
Boy, I'll bet he'll be glad to see me.
Pop.
Hey, extra!
Just out-evening paper!
Joe Krozac has son!
Gang chief has baby boy!
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
The kid's here!
Did you hear that? It's a boy!
I knew it would be a son!
Sit down!
The papers are always wrong.
Hey! Hey, I got to get a paper.
- Keep quiet.
No kidding. I got to get a paper.
I got to read about it.
- It's a boy!
- Papers aren't allowed.
Now, wait a minute.
Get me a paper, will ya?
You can read it to me, can't you?
Joe Krozac has son!
Extra! Extra!
Sit down!
- Raise that blind, you'll have trouble.
- Why, listen, you!
- Why don't you have him send it-
- We'll all help.
Baby wants his bottle!
We'll give the kid the handcuffs for a rattle.
Will you sit down?!
Ok!
Looks like everybody's giving everybody else something to remember him by, eh?
What's going on?
I tell you, this is it.
We been ridin' 3 days and 4 nights.
- That's coast to coast, ain't it?
- Yeah!
You feel it?
We are rockin'.
Maybe it's Perth Amboy.
They got boats around Perth Amboy.
No, it ain't
Perth amboy.
Hear that?
We're bein' towed. It's a tug.
Hey, maybe it's Jersey city!
It's Frisco, I tell ya.
And if it's frisco, it's the rock!
It's the rock!
Yeah, maybe.
Gee, I don't get to see the old man.
Ok, everybody.
You can raise your blinds now.
What did I tell ya?
There it is.
There she is, boys.
You're gonna snuggle in the arms of Alcatraz.
You ever hit a tougher stir, it'll be when you step out of your coffin.
Ok, now...
Sit back, here.
You got 5 minutes more for conversation, so get it out of your system.
After that, you'll be talking when you're told to.
You through?
No.
Joe.
My Joe.
He'll come soon?
...Yes?
You just be quiet now, dear.
You've got to be a lot better before you can see anybody.
You've had a hard time.
He said he'd come to see baby.
I know he come.
During the entire day, you will observe the rule of strict silence.
In a week or two, you will be assigned to the workshops
For morning and afternoon periods.
Conversation in the shops allowed only in connection with the work at hand.
Recreation and exercise period comes once a week
Saturday-
For 2 hours in the yard,
But this, of course, depends upon your deportment.
If these rules are not obeyed, we have discipline to help you obey.
Bring me number 8429.
The warden wants to see you.
Yeah!
About face!
Thank you.
Hello, warden.
I kind of thought that you and me would have a get-together.
I've been instructed to inform you that your wife had a child, a son.
Yeah, I heard about it coming out on the train. It's a boy!
Born on the 25th. Both your wife and child are in excellent health.
That's all the information I have.
Now, ain't this a silly setup?
Everybody in the country- oh, in the world, I guess- knows more about that kid than his old man.
So if I can get to a long distance telephone-
When you will be allowed to receive mail,
I imagine your wife will write you.
Receive mail?
What do you mean I can't find out about my kid from my wife?
I mean that.
Now, look here, little man.
I've had enough of this.
You get my lawyer, Gorman, on the phone.
This is Joe Krozac.
You ain't talkin' to any sucker that knocked over a corner cigar store!
Now, let's get that straight.
Number 8429.
And if number 8429 isn't a good boy, he won't see anybody for a long time.
10 years, perhaps, or even longer.
Why, listen, you-
And you heard me mention discipline.
All right.
Ok, move along.
- Salt, please.
- What?
Thank you.
I heard about them things once.
We all get tough at the same time, they turn them on.
Oh, them pineapple it's full of tear gas.
Ok, now.
I only said pineapples give me gas, see?
O.K.
They're full of gas.
Ah, that's fine.
Little sweetness!
It's too bad he's got to grow up at all, ain't it?
What do you mean too bad?
He grows up to be a big, strong man, like his papa.
Huh, little Joe?
Yes'm.
Gloria-she talks funny.
What goes on here?
We're just bathing the baby, Mr. Curly.
Mr. Gorman, it ain't none of my nevermind, but don't you think we ought to tell that child about that man of hers?
It's gonna give her terrible misery when she finds out.
You keep your mouth shut and do as you're told.
Tell her I'm here.
Yes, sir.
That Aunt Jemima's gonna blab one of these days.
- What difference does it make?
- So the appeal ain't going so hot, huh?
Curly! Mr. Gorman!
You tell me about Joe.
They let him come home soon, yes?
No word yet.
Here are your railroad tickets.
You'll leave for San Francisco tomorrow morning.
Oh, then I'm going to see Joe!
I show him his baby.
Just a minute, my dear.
Yes?
This appeal- the court, you know- is costing a little more than I anticipated.
You never heard Joe tell about any other money he has, did you?
More money?
But he said you have all the money.
Oh, I see.
I start packing, then I'll bring baby in to show you.
Gloria! Gloria!
Gloria!
So you want to know where it is, too, huh?
- Where what is?
- Ok, rat...
"it's costing
A little more than I anticipated," huh?
"No, I haven't heard about any other money he has," huh?
The vultures are all ready, but the carcass ain't coming through, huh?
The government is taking over this estate, my friend-
This place, Seven Oaks, and the Westchester house.
That will be nice.
Maybe you can wear a shirt.
What smells so bad around here?
Somebody put a skunk next to the washer.
Someday, you'll peel back his lower lip, huh, Mr. Krozac?
That's what they're trying for, but I'm not starting any trouble.
No solitary for you, huh, Mr. Krozac?
I'm gonna be on tap when my kid gets here, that's all.
Stand here...
And talk into the window.
Talk English.
You'd better not try to whisper,
Because that loudspeaker won't pick it up,
And he won't be able to hear you.
There. All right.
Joe! Joe!
Oh, gee...
Say, that's...
That's some kid.
Hey, look at that-
He knows me!
Joe, you like your little boy?
Oh, I'll say!
He's the greatest kid in the world!
He's me-me all over, right on the nose, ain't he?
Are you glad to see me, too, Joe?
Talya. You're glad to see his mother, Joe?
Oh, sure.
Everything is fine.
Say, I bet he weighs more than any kid his age, huh?
34 pounds.
34?! Will you-
34 pounds!
Boy, that's some whopper!
Hey, Joey!
Joey! Ha ha ha!
I think of you all the time.
They are good to you here?
Oh, sure, sure.
Don't you worry about us.
I'll be out of here in no time, and everything will be aces with us again.
Joe Krozac, jr.
Hey! Hey, Joey!
It's your old man!
Joe... I speak
English better now, don't you think?
Oh, sure, sure. I can see that.
That's fine. That's fine-hey, Joey!
Hey, hey, Joey!
I read in the newspapers.
Joey...
I read about you, Joe...
Things I never knew.
I show them to Curly, and he only laughs.
Why shouldn't he?
I told you they were all lies, didn't i?
But the lady in the hotel where we stay, she stopped speaking to me and little Joe when she found out who I am.
Joe, I have to tell you-
What difference does that make?
Told you they were all against me- everybody!
Don't you worry about anybody but that kid, understand?
But, Joe, I have to-
We only got a few minutes!
I want to talk to my kid and look at him, see?
We got plenty of other times for all that baloney,
So keep quiet, will you?!
All right, Joe.
Hey!
Asleep, huh?
You've got one more minute, ma'am.
Listen, kid, I'm up for appeal sometime this week.
Gorman said everything was good when you left home?
Mr. Gorman said he's doing his best.
That's all he told me.
You keep your chin up.
I'll be out of here in no time.
You get yourself a nice place in San Francisco, and just you watch the newspapers
The day I strut out of this mousetrap, we're gonna celebrate, kid- you and Joey and me.
You just take good care of my boy, huh?
Joey!
I do that with my life, Joe.
Time's up, ma'am.
So long, Joey!
I'll be seeing you!
Good-bye, Joe.
Good-bye.
Oh, yeah,
So long, Talya.
Atta boy. Pound the old ear, Joey boy.
Your old man will put a lot of smart talk in it someday-
All the smart talk you'll ever need, Joey!
So long, kid!
This way, ma'am.
That's some kid,
Huh? Oh, boy. So long, Joey!
Gee, he's me right on the nose, isn't he?
You ever see a kid like that? 34 pounds! Oh, boy.
I hear tell you want to see me, warden.
It's about your appeal.
Well, I don't like to say, "I told you so,"
But I feel kind of high today.
I've just seen a kid that's a 1-2-3 double for Joe Krozac.
Wish you could've seen him, Warden.
Yeah, so long as
I'm springing out of here, I don't mind-
Your appeal has been denied.
What?
This is a nice place to think up jokes in, Warden.
I said, your appeal has been denied.
Denied?
Hey, listen, warden,
I got to get ahold of my lawyer right now.
Gorman, Sid Gorman.
Gorman has resigned from your case.
Resigned?
You mean, ratted.
That's what you mean-ratted!
When I get out of here-
You are going to do absolutely nothing.
You are going to stay here with us.
You're going to serve your time-
10 years.
You're going to serve it quietly, according to the rules.
Are you going to have it any other way?
Ok.
Have it any way you like.
I'll spend my next 10 years standing on my head.
How was he, Mrs. Krozac?
Oh, please...
Please leave me alone!
Are you all loaded, Hank?
- Yeah!
Then keep your eyes open. You miss this one, I'll make you eat that lens raw.
Come on, come on.
Please, a taxicab, please.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. Krozac.
Just a second. I have a rattle for the baby.
Got one. I got it!
Extra! Joe Krozac's baby at Alcatraz!
Extra!
Joe Krozac's wife and baby visit prison!
Extra! Read all about it!
Joe Krozac's baby at Alcatraz!
But I want to see him!
The editor...
Oh, how do you call him...
- The editor, you call him, yes?
- But, lady...
But I must see him, you understand?
Just a minute, lady!
Who says all these things?
Who writes all this?
I'm sorry, boss.
It's ok, Freddy.
Hello, Mrs. Krozac.
You are Mrs. Joe Krozac, aren't you?
Yes, and I'm here to stop all this.
Who writes all the things about my Joe and my baby?
Come over here, my dear.
- This is all lies...
You lie about my Joe all the time, all newspaper.
Now you lie about his baby.
My little son...
You put a bad name on him!
You make everybody to hate him!
Sit right here and calm yourself.
We'll have this all straightened out in a minute.
Jump in the morgue and pull out everything on Mr. Krozac-
All those nice pictures, especially.
We're glad you dropped down, Mrs. Krozac.
Mac... Hold the final 15 minutes. More on Krozac.
The pictures will be up right away.
This is a little job he did to one of the Duffy boys in Chicago.
That was before he was a big shot, when he carried a gun himself.
Did you know he was pretty good with a gun, Mrs. Krozac?
Joe... Shot people?
No.
You get it?
Blissful, happy ignorance of everything.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde husband the world hated while she loved.
That was when he was in a more expansive mood,
When he really got going-
5 men all at once with a machine gun
when their backs were turned, Mrs. Krozac.
It isn't very pretty, is it?
Course, we couldn't prove it in court, but everybody in the country knew that Joe did it.
You see, we don't want to print any lies here, Mrs. Krozac.
You believe it now, don't you?
Realization came like a sudden blow.
She saw the fairy story of her husband's political career written in blood.
Why? Why do Joe...
Search me. Maybe it was so he could be nice and rich and marry a nice girl like you someday and give her things like that, huh?
Maybe that was it.
Or maybe it was so his son, your baby,
could grow up and go to college
and have a big car and a raccoon coat, huh?
But my baby didn't do all this.
It's no right for him to know all this.
That young fellow and his wife had babies, two babies, I think.
But Joe had his boys take him for a ride
Because he didn't agree with Joe.
Pretty clever, huh, Mrs. Krozac?
And that wife shot herself when she saw him lying in the morgue like that.
Now those babies are in an orphan asylum, I guess.
It's the old angle,
Paul, sins of the father, sins of the father visited upon her child.
Yeah, I get it.
You? You write all these things about my baby?
Oh... No,
But you saw him!
Wait a minute.
Let's talk some more, Mrs. Krozac.
Please, don't say bad things about my baby.
Why, it's just news, Mrs. Krozac.
Your baby will be famous for a long time.
- Everybody will want to read about him.
- Oh, no! Please...
I'm no mad anymore now, but...
Please...
Now, now, wait a minute, Mrs. Krozac.
Well, I guess that's everything.
Crack down on it, Paul- the works.
I'll rap out a new head.
Well, that's beautiful!
What's the matter with you?
Oh, it's lovely.
I don't know,
I guess i've gone noble or something.
I can't take it.
- Are you nuts?
No. I just caught a flash of you and me in a mirror and we're a couple of pretty filthy- looking guys.
That girl never knew anything about this Krozac stuff. She's on the level.
Get back on that typewriter, you silly slug.
You heard me tell Mac 15 minutes.
You better get another boy.
Come on, you and me are getting out of here.
Hey, Paul,
Wait a minute! Snap out of it.
- You'll no write anymore about my baby?
- No, no.
Listen, you crazy fool, that's a great story!
So was the slaughter of the innocents.
Long walk up this hill.
Are you tired?
No... But I must stop crying.
To cry will fix nothing.
Oh... Sometimes it does.
The father of my child, out there in a cell someplace
Because he did all those things.
When Joe and I married,
I was in love, and I believed everything he said.
Then all the things happened.
They come and take Joe, and...
I hear and understand all things.
Today, I watch Joe's face.
I wonder.
All at once, I grew up inside,
And all at once, I feel... old and empty.
Oh, now, Joe probably kept those things from you to make you happy, you know?
Oh, no. I think he knew
I'll be sick and ashamed if I knew.
What are you going to do now?
I wait until I see Joe next time, and I tell him the names to give his baby...
And he knows what
I have to do, and he say yes.
Hi.
Say... Didn't you bring the baby?
Where's the kid?
No, Joe.
I didn't bring him this time.
But why not?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
He ain't sick, is he?
No, he's all right, Joe.
Well, what's the matter, then?
What are you standing there like a dummy?
What's all this about?
Look, Joe.
Huh. Well, I guess maybe they got some sense now.
I guess maybe they know how to photograph Joe Krozac's kid.
That's fine.
Oh, Joe, do not laugh!
Why not? Someday, that kid, he's going to laugh at that picture, too.
Public enemy junior, huh?
Well, he'll show 'em.
But you see the gun?
You make my baby a killer, too?
Who have you been talking to?
You shut up, you hear?!
Come on, now... Let's cut out all this daffy talk, see?
But I must not bring baby again, Joe.
You see, it is the only thing to do now.
- What's that?
- Oh, Joe...
I'm sorry for you, Joe, but...
You didn't tell me the truth.
And now our little boy... my little boy...
All his life, he will have a bad name.
He's got my name.
What's better than that? Yours?
Oh, Joe, I must never bring him here again.
I know. I must take him away someplace...
Change his name, change my name...
So that people never follow him and point to him as the son of Joe Krozac.
Say, you forget you ever said that!
Sometimes when all excitement goes down and people don't think anymore...
I come back to see you, Joe.
You heard what I said!
So you're ratting on me, too!
I come because
I'm sorry for you, Joe.
You live wrong, and...
But you are the man I love, Joe, and you love me, too, and you married me.
Aw, get away!
I married you because you were my kind for a kid, see?
A family-
Joe Krozac, jr.!
You don't count for anything, and don't you forget it!
Joe... You don't mean that!
You heard me!
You stick around here and bring that kid every month,
- ...or else, understand?
- Take him out!
That's my kid, you hear me!
I got plans for that kid!
You try and snatch him, and I'll have you dropped out of sight!
You bring him here dressed fancy every month,
Or I'll know the reason why! He's my kid!
He's my kid, you hear me?!
You'd better go now, ma'am.
Aw, she can't get away with that kind of stuff.
Try to take my kid away.
Where does she get off to pull that kind of stuff?
Oh, no.
Don't you worry about me cutting any wrists.
I got too many things to do when I get out.
What's the matter with Napoleon this morning?
Oh, yes...
How come Joe junior don't visit
his big shot father no more?
He take a powder on you, too?
It's Krozac!
Not to Mr. Krozac,
You don't!
- Why, Mr. Paul!
- Hi, Gloria.
I'm sorry, Mr. Paul,
I was getting the young rascal ready for his supper.
He gets into more things...
- Where's Talya?
I guess she come out on the late trolley again.
Seem like they're working her harder and longer every week.
Maybe we ought to do something about that, huh?
Uncy Paul!
I got to do something about that.
Oh, kick those around till they get large.
Run! Yippee!
Once more. Yippee!
Oh, here... Here, I got a new one.
Now, watch.
Here's the boss.
Oh, my little darling!
I was just putting him to sleep.
A nice way you're putting him to sleep. "yippee!"
Come, doll.
It's time for bed.
Mama will play with you a long time tomorrow.
Come, now. Come, now.
Let me tuck you in.
We'll play tomorrow.
Say good night to Uncle Paul.
No, we got a new one, haven't we, pal?
- Come on, now, let's show mother.
- You remember what it is?
Good night...
Good night.
Yeah, yeah, I know, but good night what?
Good night...
Good night, daddy.
That's it!
Shake hands on that.
Now, that's a boy.
He and I sort of like it, you know?
You, uh... sort of talk it over with him, huh?
Did you talk it over with him, Talya?
Oh, Paul, darling...
Talya... There's a law that will make you automatically free...
That can be done all very quietly, and no one will know, just as they don't know now.
Little Paul will never know.
But... It wouldn't be fair to you.
No matter how we try to forget, try to hide... all that's been still is, Paul.
And there's something else.
That boy ought to grow up with a man around the house, shouldn't he?
Oh, darling, you've done too much already.
This is all I ever wanted to do.
Everything else has just been leading up to this, I guess.
Now I feel as though my heart's going to stop beating for 10 seconds while I... while I wait to hear whether or not
I can keep on doing this forever.
I think your heart is too big to ever stop.
Oh, now, cut it out.
You put the paper to bed.
That boy of mine will scalp me if I'm 5 minutes late today.
All right, Paul, but I want to see if this is your idea of the strike story setup.
Yeah. Oh, very nice.
Looks very nice.
It's a much better lead than-
Than what?
What?
I said it's a much better lead than we had before.
Well, I'll be back sometime monday.
Have a swell weekend, and give my best to Paul, jr.
Boy, I envy you that kid.
I'm gonna sell him to the bush league.
Atta boy, rags.
Keep pulling.
Now, if you were a 15-pound pickerel,
I could reel you in as easy as anything.
Here's your c amping blanket, rolled up like you.
Land sakes, child!
Has you got that hook in that dog's mouth?
Of course not, Gloria.
Don't be dopey.
Rags is just helping me practice a little.
I'm sorry, Gloria.
Get away! Go!
You ought to know better than to stand in back of a fella who's practicing.
Yeah. Yeah, you just practicing to fall right out of the boat, that's what you is.
Hi, dads!
You have to hurry, dads.
Hi, dope.
Hey, no kidding.
They'll be here any minute.
You get your mother to lay out my stuff?
Sure, and I've got everything packed.
I've got some Number-4 hooks and some new line.
That won't do any good.
I'm going to catch all the fish, you know.
Oh, yes?
We'll see about that.
Well, if it isn't that homely woman I married.
Here. I bought this for a blonde.
I guess you'll have to do instead.
- Oh, darling!
Hey, dads, don't do all that silly stuff with mother now.
You've got to get ready.
They'll be here.
Silly stuff, huh?
You get ready yourself.
I've just about got time to grease this line.
Hey, you!
Hey, you little crazy chickadee!
You stay out of my lard bucket!
He's so proud to be going off with his father.
Come now, you'd better hurry, dear.
Yes, I know that.
The bus leaves in about 10 minutes.
Oh, darling, they're beautiful.
They all right?
You know I have a nose for flowers and news, honey.
Didn't you bring a paper home?
I said, didn't you bring a paper home?
Paper? Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
I forgot it.
Paul?
Paul!
What?
What, you say something?
You didn't forget.
There... was something in the paper, wasn't there?
Yes, he's getting out next month.
Now, darling, we swore that when this happened, we wouldn't give it a thought.
He's just as far removed from you and Paul now as he was before.
Darling, you're hidden.
You're hidden by
10 years of me and this house.
The whole world's forgotten.
And nobody and nothing is ever going to change that.
I know.
I'm silly, darling, but just for a moment, the look on his face and how he threatened... came back so clearly again.
I'm all right now.
You're all right all the time.
Have a good time, you two.
- 3 wonderful days.
- Good-bye, dear.
Come on, dads!
Please hurry!
Come on back here! Has your mother got the measles or something?
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, mother.
Don't worry about dads.
I'll take care of him.
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye
- Good-bye, darlings!
That's a pair of men to be proud of, honey.
They're yours forever.
Yes, Gloria.
Good-bye, Joe, and good luck.
Hiya, Joe!
Hiya, kid!
You knew Curly would be waiting for you, didn't you?
You look swell, Joe, swell.
Come on, let's get rid of these freaks.
Get away, you mugs!
Hi, Curly.
Hi, Mr. Krozac.
Sit right here, Mr. Krozac.
This ain't the Palace hotel, but I guess it's better than what you've, uh...
- Bottle of Scotch.
- Scotch. Yes, sir.
I picked a nice, quiet spot, boss, but it'll liven up pretty soon.
Curly ain't forgetting you.
Sit down and relax, boss.
Have a cigarette. Boss?
It's legal now, Joe, but there ain't much doing it.
Half the stuff ain't as good as what we used to put out, but it warms you internally.
It don't go down so easy after a long time off of it, does it, Mr. Krozac?
I guess Frisco ain't such a tank town after all.
Huh, Joe?
We're kind of on the committee of welcome, Mr. Krozac.
- Ok, beat it.
- What?
- Beat it.
- Well, of all the...
- What's wrong?
- You heard me, get out.
Well, pardon my 6-ounce gloves.
I like that!
I know why they let him out-
He's dead.
Gee, boss, I thought you'd...
Where is she?
Where's that dame?
Where's that dame with my kid?
Oh, your wife, you mean.
I thought you knew about it, Joe.
She married another guy.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Where are they?
Where are they hanging out?
I don't know exactly. I don't even know what the guy's name is.
Last I heard of her,
Red said he spotted her in a store up in Boston.
We're gonna find that dame, see?
And I'm going to pay her off, along with that sucker that she hooked up with-
Pay her off good and plenty.
Then I'm going to take my kid, understand?
Later, Joe. All that later.
Yeah? For 10 years I waited to catch up with her.
10 years!
Joe, but what about us?
We've been waiting for you just as long.
You can't go back on the boys.
I ain't goin' back on them, but first I got-
Listen, Joe, we've missed you.
Like we've missed a head and two legs.
There's only one Joe Krozac.
10 years can't fix that different.
Kind of missed me, huh?
Right up and down the line, Joe.
I got a plane staked out.
We'll be in new york in 16 hours.
After you get back
East and get things going good, then we can all help you spot that dame.
And then one night, you'll walk in there, pay her off, and take the kid.
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
So, uh, all the boys are waiting for me, huh?
For nobody else, Joe.
And this is Billy Ernst, does a beat job now and then-
And incidentally plays a swell game of snooker.
But he's thinking of other things now, huh, Billy?
Yeah.
- Ok, Billy. We'll get along.
- Sure.
And this is Bottles Bailey.
You knew his old man, Stinky Bailey.
Oh, yeah.
Rolland got to him, didn't he?
I got to Rolland 4 years ago.
Yeah, I heard about it.
Nice going, kid.
I can always use your kind.
- Thanks.
Well, you met them all, boss.
Now maybe we can get down to cases.
Well, boys...
I guess we can do business.
Just so long as you'll always remember who's boss in this organization.
Limpy here and Curly and Brockett,
They'll tell you just how to run an organization, eh, boys?
So just you remember who's boss, and I'll do the rest.
Understand?
You're full of wind and dust, ain't you?
What?
Why don't we turn off this secondhand gasola and throw a few naturals?
That's what we're here for, ain't we?
Is he on the level?
Maybe Bottles is a little quick, Joe, but that's the way we move now, direct.
Like I told you, there's a lot of new angles.
Things move faster,
10 years faster.
Everything's streamlined, you know what I mean?
We get to the point quicker. Getting it?
What is this?
You guys giving me the business?
All we want to know,
Joe, is where's that dough you held out?
Just tell us where you got that stashed away
And maybe you'll have your organization.
What dough?
You know.
Who do you think you're talking to, you cheap phony?
I'm talking to you, not Napoleon, huh?
- Now where's the dough?
- I ain't got any dough, you know that.
You got a couple of million.
You're not fooling nobody.
You're crazy!
Ok. Pick him up.
You've had a 10-hour walk, Joe.
Feeling in a conversational mood yet?
No. I haven't got anything to say.
Still stubborn, huh?
Get Red on the phone.
Tell him to get going.
We may need him after all.
Move!
Pick him up, boys.
Gee, it's hot today, ain't it, Joe?
Like some ice water?
Butterfingers.
Has he come across yet?
No, and I think if we go over him once more, he'll never talk.
Hiya, boys.
Hiya, Red. Here?
Bring him in.
Bring him down.
I think you'll unbutton your lip now, Joe.
Maybe you'll talk to your son.
My what?
Here.
Hiya, sonny boy!
Had a long trip today, huh?
Oh, sort of confused.
Well, your old man's confused, too.
My father?
Is my father here?
Where?
Right here, the great Joe Krozac.
He's been pining for you, sonny boy.
Father?
That's not my father.
Sure it is. Ain't he pretty?
Are you all crazy?
Y- you're kidding, ain't you?
How do I know this is my-my-
This ought to make it sink home.
See? That's my father.
That's dads and mother.
You're just kidnappers, aren't you?
I see what you're heading for.
No use trying anything with this kid, see?
Because that ain't a picture of that dame.
No, no, that ain't the woman!
I ought to know!
- Curly ought to know, too.
- You're screwy, Curly.
That's just somebody who looks like her.
You ain't going to work the boy over, are you?
That all depends on you, Joe.
You wanna talk?
Listen, boy-
You're not mine, see?
They just think you are, see?
So no matter what they do to you, you can take it. I know that you can.
Just like your old man, see?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Let me go home to mother and dads!
Don't let them throw you, Joey!
Start him off.
I think you'll decide to talk, Joe.
Start walking, Sonny.
- What?
- Get a move on! Walk!
Pick them up! Feet! Feet!
All right, my son.
Dad's at breakfast.
You're not going to sleep all day, are you?
Oh, always throwing your things around.
Don't you want to eat breakfast?
Paul!
Paul! Paul!
What is it?
- They've taken him!
He's come and taken him!
Oh, he has him now!
I'll never see him again!
And he'll tell him everything!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to call Washington.
The police? No! It'll get in the papers, and wherever he is, he'll see it!
He'll show it to him!
All we've been trying to hide!
Washington has known all along about you and Paul.
They've had to. It's their business.
But I swear to you, they'll keep this thing absolutely quiet.
When I tell them to, it will break in every paper in the country.
It will be hard for him, but I think that boy has enough spirit to outlive anything.
Spin around, Sonny.
That's the ol' kid.
Getting hot, Paulsy walsie?
How about a nice, cool drink of ice water?
You wouldn't give me the sandwich, you won't give me the water.
You heard that?
I guess that told you!
I don't know whose kid he is, but he's as game as a pit dog!
That's throwing it in there, kid!
Whoever his old man is, he ought to be proud of him!
Come on, Curly.
What are we waiting for?
Wait, don't! Please, don't!
Are you gonna talk, Joe?
Ok, start giving the kid a workout.
Oww! Please, don't!
Shut up!
- Cut it out!
- Ok!
Will you talk now?
Ok. I'll tell you.
Anybody still live in my old Westchester home?
No, it's closed up.
Well, out by the swimming pool is a great big...
This is the last stop, Joe.
What?
Come on!
We're saying good-bye, papa.
The kid, too?
Sure, with our love and kisses.
He must be hotter than a firecracker now,
And we got enough hot stuff as it is.
Yeah, you can get to know the kid better!
Then maybe all 4 of you can live together!
How are you ducking bullets, Joe?
Yeah, the feds will be shooting at you from all sides!
Thanks for the bus fare!
They ain't getting away with a thing.
That dough ain't going to be theirs for long.
Was there much?
The box looked real full.
Plenty. But that don't matter.
Soon as I straighten out that old lady of yours,
I'll take care of those smart double-crossers-
One by one, from Curly down!
And there won't be any mistaking who done it.
The Krozac trademark will be stamped all over them!
Come on.
Are you coming home with me?
Yeah, I got a date with that dame in your watch fob.
My-my mother?
Ok, call her that.
I guess I don't understand you at all.
Mother and dads will be awfully glad, after all you've done.
Yeah, I wonder.
There's a lot of things you don't understand,
But you will soon enough, because you're my kind of a kid, see?
I guess. It's awfully funny about those men thinking I was your son, isn't it?
No, no, it isn't.
Because you are my son, see?
That's one thing you've got to get right now.
I can get home without you.
You don't need to come along.
Now wait a minute, Joey.
Just a second, Joey.
My name isn't Joey.
It's Paul North, jr.
You're crazy if you say it's anything else.
I think you're all crazy anyway!
Let me alone!
Hey! No kid of mine is going to hand me any lip!
I didn't sweat half my life in a steel box to come out and get this from you!
You're Joe!
Joe Krozac, jr., Understand?
And you and I are going back to that dame -your mother-
She'll tell you that I'm your father from first to last, understand?
- Yes.
- You gonna behave?
Sure. Sure, I am.
Come on. We got to get out of this.
Dig in under. That's what you do with a haystack.
Did you leave any money for the eggs?
Boy, you sure got funny ideas.
But you and I are going to get along all right.
We won't have any more beefs on each other.
I hope not.
'Cause you got brains.
You know, I like brains around me.
Your angle on digging last night, you know?
And this fire, with the poles and everything-
Where did you learn that kind of stuff?
From dads.
You see, he taught me all about camping out like this.
You see, we went on a camp hike last month-
Come on, come on.
Let's get moving.
- We had a race to see who could-
- Come on, come on. catch the most fish, and he caught 20 bass and pickerel, and that only made-
Fish, fish... go on, stop that, will you?
Lay off of that stuff.
I don't give that fish stuff a nod, no matter how many you've caught.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
Always feeling sorry. Don't do that, kid, will you? Waste of time.
Come on.
I'm sor...
I mean, ok.
Attaboy. You'll smarten up with me, all right.
Yes? Washington?
Ok, put them on.
Yes, yes, speaking.
What? Yes, where?
But what about my...
Oh. Yes. I'll be here all the time.
- What?
- Nothing about Paul yet, darling.
They caught up with the Krozac gang and shot it out with them.
They're all dead.
But they didn't have Paul.
But what about him?
He wasn't with them, either.
Then he has him.
He has my little boy!
I'll never see him again!
You all right, kid?
I guess so.
Say, what's that?
Got decorated, huh?
It's just a medal they gave me in school.
Lincoln medal.
That's pretty good, huh?
I guess it is kind of an honor.
Why do they call it a Lincoln medal?
You got to look like Abraham Lincoln?
Oh, no.
You see, it's for outstanding achievement.
Yeah?
And, well, Lincoln was a great man.
Oh, sure. Lincoln was ok.
But if they'd have put Napoleon on there, it would've been a real first-class medal.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
Dads said Napoleon got a swollen head.
That's what beat him down.
So now he's going to pay off Napoleon, is he?
Smart guy, is he?
Now he's gonna pay off Napoleon!
Maybe he won that medal instead of you.
As a matter of fact, he did help me get it.
Well, that's what he said.
Well, you see,
I almost flunked in math, and dads showed me a new way to-
Can that Dads stuff!
- But I only said-
- Cut it out, you hear me?
Dads, dads, dads!
You call me that if you want to call anybody dads!
You're my kid, see?
Joey! Joe Krozac, jr.!
You'll get that into your head right now, or-
Please, don't! Don't, Joe!
You're getting all sick again!
Please!
Guess this will have to wait.
Now you've hurt your sore eye.
Here...
I've got some adhesive in my emergency pocket.
I'll just clean it up a little.
Here's your medal, Kid.
I can't now, I'm too busy.
I'll keep it for you.
Well, we got a croaker.
Always come in handy in our family- Eh, kid?
Huh? Oh, yes.
Come on. Wake up, kid.
Come on,
Come on, kid.
We got to walk in in style.
Oh-oh!
Honey child! He's back!
Oh, my darling's back!
My boy!
It's all right, mother.
I'm home now.
Oh, yes, yes,
I know, darling.
- No, I'm all right.
- Oh, my dear!
Hi, dads. I'm here.
Oh, son! That's a boy.
You all right?
- Yeah, but I have to sleep.
Leave him alone.
Oh, it's all right, Joe.
You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-
He brought me home.
Didn't you, Joe?
There you are.
You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?
Here, I'll do that.
The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack.
You should have been with us, dads. It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how.
The way you showed me.
Didn't I, Joe?
Let's get this coat off.
You two must have had some experience, huh?
Yes.
Here are your pajamas, darling.
The ones you like...
How about a big glass of hot milk?
Oh, no.
I'm... too sleepy, I guess.
You ask Joe.
Joe is probably hungry, though.
Joe, you talk with Mother and dads.
They can help anybody.
You see, mother and dads,
Joe isn't very well.
Sometimes he doesn't realize what he's saying.
But it's all right, Joe.
You can talk with mother and dads.
They're wonderful.
You've probably never had anyone like them,
because you wouldn't have had all the trouble you've had.
Every now and then,
Joe thinks he has a son like me.
He even calls me Joey.
It was funny.
I wasn't afraid of him,
But... He's a good scout.
He's ok.
Good night.
Can I get you something to eat, Joe?
Thank you for bringing him back.
With all my heart, I thank you.
You are proud of him, aren't you?
He is the kind of a boy you really hoped for, isn't he?
Isn't he, Joe?
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that.
He ain't the kind of kid
I'd put my money on, exactly.
You got him conned into one way of thinking, so what the heck?
Let him stay that way, for all I give a darn.
He didn't swallow what I told him, anyway.
You can just tell him
I was nuts, you know.
Stir-crazy.
Me? I like a kid with some... with some get-up-and-go to him!
I like a kid that knows all the answers, all the angles.
Why, I like a kid that...
H- how do you get out of here?
Good luck, Joe.
Hello, Joe.
I saw you delivering your boy.
Aren't you staying to take him over now?
You're running out on him, eh?
Getting big-hearted.
That touches me, Joe.
I'm going to help you.
Start walking into the alley.
Well, you've had a nice, long time to think about it, and now it's here, Joe.
Move on.
Now just stand there a minute and I'll give you something else to think about.
So you're kind of bashful about letting people know he's your boy, are you?
Well, I'll do it for you, Joe.
After I pump you full of this,
I'm going to drop a little note to every newspaper in town.
Going to tell them about your boy.
Going to tell them what you don't seem so proud of anymore.
That he's Joe Krozac's son.
All his little pals are going to know it from now on, Joe.
No, you won't.
Stay there, Joe,
I haven't finished.
They'll all know it,
Joe, everybody.
Joe Krozac, jr.!
Joe Krozac...

That's the most
I got is 3,000 bottle of crème de menthe.
You got things pretty much your own way now, haven't you, Louis?
Sure.
Everything is just fine.
That's good.
But Pete was saying just tonight...
He say that the South Side, she's get out of line.
I say, what are we gonna do with the South Side?
Let some of the other boys get theirs, too. I got all I wanted.
Johnny Lovo, he's talking about starting something.
Yeah?
He's looking for trouble, eh?
Johnny's very foolish!
Look at me.
A man always got to know whether he's got it or not. I got plenty.
I got house. I got automobile.
I got nice girl.
I got stomach trouble, too.
Better get some sleep.
All right.
Well, she was a pretty good party, eh?
Next week,
I'm going to give the party which the boys ain't never seen nothing like it before.
We'll have much more music, much more girls, much more everything.
Everybody, should say, "Big Louis, he sit on top of the world!" Eh?
- Goodbye, Louis.
- Goodbye, boys.
Take good careful of yourselves, eh?
- Bye.
- I see you some more.
Hello. I want
Lakeside 417, please.
Yeah, 417 Lakeside. Sure.
That's the wrong...
No, I want Lakeside 417.
Hello, Louis.
Hello.
How many of them?
All right.
Hello.
Copyboy here.
Copyboy!
That's rotten!
"Costillo slaying starts gang war!"
That's what I want.
I'm working on that angle now.
- I've got four men on it.
- Four?
You'll need 40 men on this story for the next five years.
You know what's happening?
This town is up for the grabs. Get me?
You know, Costillo was the last of the old-fashioned gang leaders.
There's a new crew coming out.
And every guy that's got money enough to buy a gun is going to try to step into his place.
You see?
They'll be shooting each other like rabbits for the control of the booze business!
You get it?
It'll be just like war!
That's it, "war."
You put that in the lead.
"War. Gang war."
Here come the coppers!
Hello, Rinaldo.
You coming along?
Where's Camonte?
- Hello, Guarino.
- Come on.
What's your hurry?
I'm getting a massage, too.
We'll finish that at headquarters.
Put your coat on.
I got lots of time.
Who wants to see me?
The Chief.
That kidney foot?
Never mind the jokes.
Come on.
Hey, how's it look in the back?
Very good.
Come on, you rat!
Come on.
"Tony Camonte, aliases Cabrone, Joe Black.
"Assault, carrying brass knuckles and sap, DW, disturbing peace.
"Street robbery on three counts, loft burglary, violation Volstead Act.
"Indicted for murder of Buck Kempner.
"Member, Five Point's Gang, came from New York, 1920.
"At present, bodyguard and strong-arm for Louis Costillo."
Bodyguard for Costillo, eh?
Pretty smart boy.
I suppose you didn't kill
Louis Costillo?
Who, me?
That's very funny.
Big Louis and me, we're like this.
Can I slap it out of him,
Chief?
I'll let you have him in a little while, Ben.
This fellow got ideas
I don't like.
Costillo hired you for a bodyguard.
Where were you at the shooting?
I was having my beauty sleep.
Where?
In a lady's house.
You want her name?
Phone number?
She's very nice.
We'll go into your alibis later.
You've been hanging around
Johnny Lovo, haven't you?
Lovo split with Big Louis.
What were you doing at Lovo's house last week?
Now listen, Tony,
I'm gonna give you a chance.
You play ball with me and I'll play ball with you.
Last night, you met Johnny in Spinelli's Barber Shop.
What did he give you money for?
Now listen, you.
What kind of mug you think I am?
I don't know nothing, I don't see nothing and I don't hear nothing.
And when I do, I don't tell a cop.
You understand?
All right, Guarino, you can have him.
Thanks.
Come on, Tony.
We'll take a look at the goldfish.
Here's Epstein.
Hi, boys. Hello, Chief.
All right, let's have it.
Writ of habeas corpus for the release of Tony Camonte and Guino Rinaldo.
- Who gave it to you?
- Flemming.
All right, gentlemen, see you later.
- Hey, I don't go with this guy?
- No.
Listen to me.
You've come into this town and you think you're headed somewhere, don't you?
You think you're gonna get there with a gun, but you're not! Get me?
You know why?
Because you got $1,000 bills pasted right across your eyes.
And someday you're gonna stumble and fall down in the gutter, right where the horses have been standing, right where you belong.
You got me all figured out, huh?
I've spent my life mixing with your breed and I don't like it. Get me?
You can hide behind a lot of red tape, crooked lawyers, some politicians with the "gimmes", writs of habeas corpus, witnesses that don't remember overnight, but we'll get through to you just like we got all the rest!
Oh, maybe me,
I'm different.
No, you're not!
Take your gun away and get you in a tough spot and you'll squeal, like all the other rats.
You're gonna get me, huh?
In your particular case, I'd give up a month's pay for the job.
Are you gonna see Lovo?
Yeah, right away.
Tell him to stay undercover.
I'll come up tomorrow.
Hey, what's this writ you got me out on?
Habeas corpus.
Deliver the body.
Can't hold you without booking you no matter what they think you've done.
That's a fine idea. Hey, you tell Flemming
I want lots of them.
- Hi, Boss.
- Come in, Tony. Glad to see you.
Hey, that's pretty hot.
Silk. Expensive, huh?
I see that
Epstein got to you in time.
Yeah. Nice little fellow.
He give them a writ of hocus pocus.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
He said you stay here till the heat's off. He said...
Hey. That's pretty hot.
That's Poppy.
Hey, Poppy.
Meet Tony Camonte.
Hi.
Mmm-hmm.
How are the coppers taking it?
Oh, I didn't pay much attention.
What about the newspapers?
Yeah, I bring them along.
The News has got the best story.
Pictures of you and one of me, too.
Where did they run it, in the razor ads?
Huh? Oh, that?
That's an old business.
You'll get used to that.
I got it in the war.
War with a blond in a Brooklyn speakeasy.
Some kidder, huh?
It takes a long time with the pinchers, eh?
You've got an office for this sort of thing,
Johnny. Why don't you use it?
There you are, Tony.
That's a bonus.
Hey, that's a nice feel.
That was a fine job, Tony.
Remember, that's only chicken feed.
You've stepped into big company.
You stick to me and do what I say, play square and you'll be walking around with lace pants and a gold hat.
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, I know.
Now, listen, I'm gonna cut you in on a percentage.
Give you a raise, double.
The South Side is rolling in jack.
All we gotta do is step in and take it.
Yeah, and have some fun with O'Hara, too, huh?
Who? Now wait a minute.
O'Hara's too big a guy to buck now.
There's lots of jack on the North Side.
Now, listen, you.
You let me think up the ideas.
I'll take care of that big hop in my own way when the time comes.
I say we stay out of the North Side.
I say we leave O'Hara alone and what I say goes!
Don't ever forget that.
- You're the boss.
- That's better.
From now on, next to me, the boys take orders from you.
Yeah, me and you, eh?
That's fine talk, Boss.
Here. Have a cigar.
There'll be plenty of work for everybody.
Costillo slowed down too much.
Yeah, and now he come to a dead stop.
Here, you better smoke one of mine.
That's pretty nice.
Expensive, huh?
I don't like cigar smoke in my room. Do you mind?
Listen, I'm gonna hold off that meeting with the boys a couple of days.
After Big Louis' funeral, it's better.
You know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
It don't look so good.
And I want you to send some flowers.
A cross of white carnations from me, see?
Yeah, and I send lots of purple, a bunch.
Big Louis he always liked purple.
Why don't you go and do it now?
You better make that meeting Monday.
Tell all the guys that want to run beer on the South Side to be there.
Tell them I'm gonna make a speech.
You know what I mean?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, goodbye, Poppy.
See you again.
She don't like anybody but me.
Mmm-hmm.
She's a very busy girl.
Expensive, huh?
Here, Little Boy.
Easy dough, huh, for just standing outside and listening to a gun go off?
- Cinch. When are we gonna get some more?
- We'll get plenty.
There's business just waiting for some guy to come and run it right.
And I got ideas.
We're working for Lovo, ain't we?
Lovo? Who's Lovo?
Just some guy who's a little bit more smart than Big Louis, that's all.
Hey, that guy is soft.
I could just see it in his face.
He's got a setup, that's all, and we gotta wait.
Someday I'm gonna run the whole works.
Remember, those monkeys on the North Side ain't so soft.
Oh, yeah? Say, they're satisfied, ain't they?
Why didn't they come and take Big Louis before we did?
Listen, Little Boy, in this business, there is only one law you gotta follow to keep out of trouble.
Do it first, do it yourself and keep on doing it.
- Where's Cesca?
- Oh, I don't know. She go out.
What do you mean?
Ain't she coming home for dinner?
Hey, I don't like that!
You tell her I want she should come home for dinner. Understand?
Sure.
I tell her lots of times.
"Come home. Come home.
Tony no like."
Still she don't...
That's a nice way
I catch you, huh?
What do you mean, "catch me"?
I wasn't doing nothing.
- You was kissing him!
- Sure. What of it?
- Well, I don't like it!
- You're missing lots of fun, Tony.
Listen. I don't want anybody kissing my sister, understand?
You're hurting my arm!
I don't want anybody putting their hands on you.
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm your brother.
You don't act it!
You act more like...
I don't know, sometimes I think...
I don't care what you think!
- You do what I say!
- Sure, and never have any fun.
"Never have any fun."
You call that fun, eh?
Running around with guys like that. That's fun!
Listen, you want real fun, huh?
Here.
How's that?
Gee, Tony, where'd you get it?
Never mind where I got it.
You just spend it, see?
You're swell.
Go on, get ready for dinner.
And remember, you do what I say.
No more fellows, understand?
What for you wanna give her money, huh?
Well, she's just a kid.
She wants to have fun.
Yeah?
Sometimes I think you crazy.
Cesca!
What for you take that money, huh?
- 'Cause I want it, that's why.
- Give it back!
It's bad money!
Tony no got it in no good way.
Gonna bring you lots of trouble.
What do I care where he gets it?
There's nothing wrong with his giving it to me.
Tony wants me to have a good time.
Oh, yes? You listen.
Tony no love you like he make you believe.
All of the time he smile on top, but what he thinks...
Oh, he's got lots of tricks!
He no give money to nobody for nothing.
He would to his sister!
Sister! Huh!
That make no difference.
To him, you're just another girl.
Someday, when he needs you, he mix you up in his business just like anyone else.
And he's gonna make you bad like him!
He can't make me do anything
I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my own life.
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah?
All of the time
Tony say like that.
Afterwards, he no belong to me no more.
He's no good! And now you start to be just like him!
No, I'm not.
Don't worry about me.
I'll get along all right.
Hey!
That's all right, boys.
Just changing the name on the door.
Meet the new president,
Johnny Lovo.
Hi, boys.
Where's Berdini,
Zeigler, Meehan?
Anybody see them?
I did. They ain't coming.
Is that all they said?
They said you could take a flying...
Okay, okay.
Now we know where they stand.
All right, you guys, I'm making a speech.
Here it is.
Big Louis gets a wad of dough and then he gets soft.
He lets you guys come into the South Side and run beer.
Well, I'm gonna change it, see?
You can still stay in but from now on you're operating the way I say.
Are you asking us or telling us?
I'm telling you.
We're gonna get organized and I'm gonna handle the works.
It's gonna mean twice as much dough for everybody and half as much trouble.
- You got something figured out, Johnny?
- Everything.
Not being able to get it's gonna make this town thirstier than ever.
Running beer ain't a nickel game anymore.
It's a business, and I'm gonna run it like a business.
Swell! We've been cutting each other's throats long enough.
There's 3,000 saloons on the South Side.
Half a million customers, figure that out.
Add up what they're gonna lay on the line every year for drinks and nobody in charge.
So you're going to be it?
Yeah, "it." That's me!
I make my own beer and I got my own trucks.
I don't have to go into business with nobody.
- Where you going?
- Who wants to know?
You sit down here! And don't interrupt the president no more.
All right, President.
- Well, are the rest of you guys in or out?
- I'm in.
What about Meehan?
Yeah, Berdini and Zeigler?
Why, they've been selling to 700, 800 joints between them.
Yeah? Well, from now on they're out.
Those joints buy from us.
Sure. If you try to sell at one of those places,
Meehan'll turn this side of the town into a shooting gallery.
Fine! Anything he starts, we'll finish.
You guys don't have to worry.
All you gotta do is to haul beer.
Yeah? Well, who's gonna stick his neck in those joints and get the orders?
My friend, Tony Camonte.
Yeah, I'm what he call a good salesman.
Hey, I start right now to get orders, eh, Boss?
All you can get, go to it.
Hey, dope, got a pencil?
Oh, boys. I don't write.
That's one.
Come on.
Come on, Little Boy, business.
- Ever eat at home?
- Once in a while.
You get all the samples here.
Here have your beer.
Hey, what is this?
Let go of me, will you?
What do you want? Let go!
- Say, what's the big idea?
- Sit down!
- Who're you buying your beer from?
- Meehan and Berdini.
- How many barrels a day?
- Three.
He's lying, Tony, he's been taking five.
Chiseler.
Well, you're getting eight now, see?
And you're buying from us. Johnny Lovo.
- But, listen. I can't...
- Sit down.
I can't use eight barrels around here!
I get you a hunk of soap, you take a bath in it.
- What do you paying a barrel?
- Fifty!
Well, ours is 65, it's better!
You get delivery tomorrow.
What am I gonna tell
Meehan and Berdini?
We'll take care of them, don't worry.
Well, that's order number one.
Now we get plenty more.
There's a system to these things.
How many barrels did you say you wanted?
Six.
Yeah? Well, you're getting 10.
You're getting a delivery tomorrow.
There's no use arguing with this joint.
Zeigler runs it himself.
Step on it.
Hi, Boss.
Lots of garlic.
Get me some, too.
Well, how's business?
You get some more orders?
Lots of orders. They all buy from us.
All we have to do is fill them.
Yeah, it's a good idea.
You better tell Meehan and Berdini.
Oh, them fellows, they retired from business.
They what?
What've you been doing?
You remember you say all they have to do is start something, we finish it?
- Well, did you?
- About an hour ago.
- You mean...
- Hey! Hey, kid.
- Extra here!
- Come here. Hey!
- Keep the change.
- All right. Thanks.
Here you are, Boss.
There's your South Side all nailed up in a box.
All nailed up in a...
Yeah. Well, you didn't get the lid on very tight.
- What do you mean?
- Look at that.
Come on. Hey, keep this hot.
We'll be back right away.
- You can't come in here.
- Come on, get out of here.
No, it's a private hospital.
You can't go...
Oh, what did they do?
- Hi, Poppy.
- Hello.
Hey, what's all the time biting you? You afraid of me?
Well, that outfit's enough to give anybody the yips.
Nice, huh? I got three more.
Different colors.
I see you're going in for jewelry.
It's kind of effeminate, isn't it?
Huh? Yeah. I got them in an auction. A bargain.
You sure are a funny mixture,
Tony.
That's the first time you smiled.
Yeah?
Well, how do you mean, you think I'm funny?
You just are, that's all.
What else are you doing with all your money?
I hear you're getting a new car.
Mmm-hmm. It's different.
It's got bullet-proof glass and a steel body.
And I got myself a new house, too.
Come up sometime?
Yeah,
I'll bring my grandmother.
No kidding. You come up?
Why don't you get yourself a girl, Tony?
Well, I'm working on that now.
Yeah?
Well, don't tire yourself out.
- Is Johnny in?
- Yeah.
He's mad, huh?
Hi, Boss.
When are you gonna learn that I am the boss?
Sure, you're the boss.
Then what do you mean by breaking up that
Lakeview joint last night?
Didn't I tell you to stay out of the North Side?
Now, listen, Johnny, it was easy.
Now, you listen to me, stupid!
That was one of O'Hara's places and you know it.
Didn't I tell you I wasn't ready for O'Hara yet?
It was a nice little order.
Fifty barrels a week.
I don't care if it's 50 a day!
What do you use to think with, an empty beer keg?
Just when we get this territory lined up and running smooth you step out and gum up the parade.
How do you mean, Johnny? I just sell a little more beer. Don't worry.
Don't worry? You know what O'Hara's liable to do now?
He'll send his guns down here on the South Side.
They'll move around like hummingbirds.
You're liable to get it and I'm liable to get it.
I know that hop. He's tough, see?
He ain't so tough.
Hanging out in a flower shop.
You afraid of a guy like that?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
Sure, you're not.
That's a crazy question, eh, Johnny?
- Come on, don't argue.
- Where you going?
To clean up after you, you mug, unless it's too late.
Look out!
It's Keach!
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello, this is Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's the name, please?
This is
Mr. Camonte's secretary.
Secretary, I told you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Secretary, you dope.
Secretary.
Okay, Boss.
No, no. I no talking on you.
I was talking on Mr. Camonte, that's my boss.
- That's...
- Hey, hey.
Get a name. Get a name.
What's your name?
No, no, I no wanna know what's your brother's name.
I wanna know what's your name.
Oh, you do, huh?
Listen, I come on over there,
I smack you right in the teeth.
- I get you, your brother...
- Hey, what's the matter?
That's no way to talk.
Talk nice.
Tell him to state his business.
Go state your business.
Who was it?
I don't know.
What do you mean,
"I don't know"?
Didn't I tell you always to get a name and write it down over here?
- Oh, Boss, I forget again.
- Forget again.
Hey, what are you writing there, huh?
I don't know.
I can't write.
Can't write? That's nice.
A secretary that can't write.
A secretary must be able to write.
Must be educated.
Get an education.
He cannot write.
Education?
That's your fault.
This Mr. Camonte's...
Oh, no, please, you're wrong.
I no hang up on you.
I thought you was through.
I told you before.
You have to write a letter.
You have to make...
Oh, you do, huh?
Let me tell you...
Shut up, you. You...
Hey, what's the matter with you? You crazy?
Listen, the last time
I tell you...
You pick yourself a nice one.
You get one for me?
Didn't have time.
Was there any trouble?
No, it was easy.
- How many were there?
- He was alone.
Hey.
Hello? Who is it?
I don't get...
Boss, I don't get the name.
Hello? Yeah?
Who? Oh, sure.
Sure, send her right up.
That's Poppy.
Hey! It's better nobody see you with this.
Hello, handsome.
Well, Poppy.
Hello, Tony.
They tell me O'Hara was killed in his flower shop this morning.
Had you heard that?
- Did Johnny send you up here?
- Johnny?
How do you like this place?
- Kind of gaudy, isn't it?
- Ain't it though?
Glad you like it. Come here,
I show you something nice.
Steel shutters on all the windows.
My own idea.
In case you have visitors you don't like, huh?
Uh-huh. That's right.
How do you like the view here, huh?
You see that?
Someday I look at that sign and I say,
"Okay, she's mine."
You think so?
Yeah,
I got a pretty good idea.
That's pretty hot.
Expensive, eh?
Yeah, come here. I show you something what's pretty hot.
How do you like this place, huh?
Come here.
Here's some stuff I buy.
Aren't they sweet?
Huh? You like?
I'm gonna get some ties made to match.
See, what I'm gonna do is wear a shirt only once.
Then I give it right away to the laundry.
A new shirt every day.
You're just gonna drive the women mad, aren't you?
Yeah. One of them.
Meaning me, I suppose?
Feel it.
Huh? It's got inside springs.
I bought it at an auction. It's a bargain.
Go ahead, sit down. Try it.
Yeah, it's all right.
You like it?
I thought you were Johnny's friend.
Sure.
I like Johnny, but I like you more.
Excuse, Boss.
Cops is downstairs.
All right, tell them to come in and sit down. I'll be right out.
Okay.
Hey, I don't wanna be caught here. This is a mess.
It's all right.
Don't get excited. It's easy.
Oh, great. Thanks.
Hey, Poppy.
After I get through with them, I'll meet you at the restaurant at 4th Street.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey, hey, go to the left.
Uh-huh.
- Hello, Guarino.
- Hello.
- You all alone?
- Yeah.
You're a cute fellow, coming here all by yourself.
You ain't afraid of me, huh?
No, nor 10 like you.
Come on, the Chief's waiting.
Hey, Angelo, call up Epstein and tell him that...
Hey, Little Boy, call up Epstein.
Tell him there's a kidney foot here taking me down to the Chief's office.
Tell him to come right down with habeas corpus, understand?
Hey, you know, I just hear O'Hara, he was met with a terrible accident.
- That's too bad, no?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Come on, come on.
So Camonte thinks he's going to run this side of town, now that he's got O'Hara.
- He's getting too big.
- Yeah?
He won't get any bigger.
We'll take him before he finds out about these guns.
Three hundred slugs a minute.
Get the rest of them unpacked.
How many we got?
Plenty.
There's a lot more coming.
O'Hara had them run in across the line last night.
We'll have the cops on our necks.
Forget it. They can't do anything about it.
There's no law against bringing guns into the state, and we can buy all we want.
- What a cinch.
- You said it.
Gaffney, listen, Camonte just left headquarters.
McGill's trailing him.
He's gonna phone.
Hey, you guys.
Load those guns.
You get the cars ready.
Stick the hearse in front of them.
Then to the South Side, and I want everybody.
- Now you hang onto that phone.
- Right.
Snap into it, now get going!
- Hello.
- Hello, Tony. Have a seat.
Hello.
Well, what took you so long?
The moxie, he was late with the habeas corpus.
Go on, order some food, will you? I'm hungry.
You know, every time I see you, you look better.
That's a cute hat.
- Please, my stockings!
- What's the matter?
Well, don't do that, Tony.
They're brand new.
- Hands off, eh?
- No, feet.
You know,
I know lots of girls.
I know redheads,
I know blonds, and all kinds.
They all like me.
Yeah, you're pretty good, eh?
I'm the best.
Are you gonna eat by any chance?
I'm not hungry.
Except for you.
You got something I like.
Yeah, I'm nice with a lot of dressing.
You work fast, don't you, Tony?
No. Say, I've been waiting a long time.
I'm crazy for you.
Everybody say,
"Tony Camonte, he's a big shot!
"He's got everything he wants."
Yeah, I got everything but what I want.
You understand?
Pardon me, telephone for Mr. Camonte.
Hey, dope, go see who it is and get a name.
Hello, this Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's your name?
I say what's your name?
This Mr. Camonte's secretary.
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear what you say.
That's too loud!
That's too loud! Talk lower!
Hello, please.
Don't be a fool, Tony!
What's the name, please?
I can't... Hello?
Hello, please,
I can't hear what you say.
Hey, that's O'Hara's mob.
I can't hear what...
I can't hear what you say.
It's too loud.
Hey, lookit!
They got machine guns you can carry!
If I had some of them, I could run the whole works in a month.
I'll get you one in a minute.
Hey, that's swell.
Look, it's little, you can carry it!
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Boss, there was too much noise.
I didn't get their names.
That's a dope!
Too much for him.
Bring him upstairs. Bring him upstairs.
That's all right.
The back door. The back door.
Hey, lookit.
They've been here too!
Hey, look at that. Come here.
Get me some shells, let's see if she works.
Hey, you. Call Fugatti, tell him we want three cars, right quick.
Hey, Johnny, look what I got.
You dirty murdering mug, you bumped off O'Hara!
Who, me? That's foolish.
You told me to stay out of the North Side. I stay out.
I've been home all day!
Hey, Little Boy?
Sure!
Sure!
Oh, so that's it?
I told you to lay off!
I don't hear so good sometimes.
You won't be hearing anything if you go on like this!
Look what happened to me.
They clipped me!
Lookit, Johnny, you can carry it around like a baby!
Shut up!
We gotta get organized.
This is only a starter.
They'll be back after us.
What do you mean?
We don't give them time.
We go after them.
We throw them Micks up for grabs.
Yeah? Well, when you're laying in an alley with your head blown off, maybe you'll learn how this business ought to be run!
Yeah? And who's gonna do that?
O'Hara's mob, Gaffney.
He's running it now!
He'll give it to you here, a pound of hot lead in the belly.
Make sure it's him, Johnny!
- Cars are here, boss!
- Okay. Hey, Little Boy, it's business.
You fix who goes in each car, understand?
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- To the North Side.
- Like I always knew someday.
- You can't do that.
What do you mean "can't"?
Who's stopping me?
I am. I'm giving you orders for the last time.
There's only one thing that gets orders and gives orders!
And this is it. That's how
I got the South Side for you and that's how I'm gonna get the North Side for you.
Some little typewriter, huh?
I'm gonna write my name all over this town with big letters!
- Hey, stop him, somebody!
- Get out of my way, Johnny, I'm gonna spit!
Come on, fellows!
Hey, Tony, take this along in case that bean shooter doesn't work.
Okay!
- Come on, Dugan.
- All right.
- Hey, you see what happened here, kid?
- I don't know, mister, but they said a big black car with side curtains, and a machine gun gave them the works.
- Oh, hello, Ben.
- Hello, Chief.
What do we gonna do about them machine guns?
What can we do about them?
There's no law against manufacturing them, just against having them.
If they can't get them in one state, they go across the border and get them in another.
These fellows bootleg machine guns like they bootleg booze.
Yeah, they better do something about that because with these toys to play with, what happened before will look like a tea party.
I know it. So you better put the screws on the 22nd Street freight house.
I hear they're bringing them in in fruit boxes.
Right.
- Get that guy's number!
- Somebody get an ambulance!
What's the matter?
What is this, a pinch?
No, just bringing you a valentine.
Don't you know it's Valentine's Day?
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Come on, line up, you guys.
Over there. All seven of you.
What's the gag?
Is the heat on?
Plenty!
Face the wall!
Put your mitts up.
All of you!
Here's Gaffney.
Gaffney, what do you know about this? Well?
Well, I was on my way here to the garage to keep an appointment.
- And I was late.
- Yeah?
And a car drives up and some guys pile out.
Two of them was cops, at least they was dressed like cops.
Cops! That's a new gag.
Then what?
Well, it looked like a pinch.
So I beat around the block till it was over, then he picked me up.
Yeah, lucky you were late.
Now, take a good peek and see what you missed.
Seven of them.
Lined up against the wall.
Mowed down, just like that!
They didn't have a chance.
Sit down, Chief, you're wearing out the carpet.
Yeah? I'm the only one left!
Thinks he'll get me, huh?
Fat chance.
Who's there?
McArthur from the Journal.
Let him in.
- Hi, Gaffney.
- How'd you find me?
Oh, we boys from the Journal always get around.
Yeah, anybody else know
I'm here?
Nope. It was just my own little idea.
Sit down.
You're going to stay for a while.
Well?
Can't get a thing on him.
We're right up a blind alley wherever we go.
And Gaffney's turned yellow, and he's hiding out.
- What about Lovo?
- Lovo is practically out.
He's as scared as Gaffney.
It's Camonte all right, but we can't prove it yet.
No, but we will.
- Say, Chief?
- What do you want?
- This fellow, Camonte.
- What about him?
A story.
Public's interested in him.
He's a colorful character.
Colorful?
What color is a crawling louse?
Say, listen, that's the attitude of too many morons in this country.
They think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods.
What do they do about a guy like Camonte?
They sentimentalize, romance, make jokes about him.
They had some excuse for glorifying our old Western bad men.
They met in the middle of the street at high noon and waited for each other to draw.
But these things sneak up and shoot a guy in the back and then run away.
- I guess you're right, Chief.
- Colorful.
Did you read what happened the other day?
A car full of them chasing another down the street, broad daylight.
Three kiddies playing hopscotch on the sidewalk get lead poured in their little bellies.
When I think what goes on in the minds of these lice, I wanna vomit!
- Ben?
- Yeah.
See if you can find Gaffney.
He'll probably get it next.
They got all the others.
Right.
Our organizations are opposed to your policy, Mr. Garston.
Your paper could be an influence against the gangster, yet you keep right on playing up his activities as front page news.
Murders, gang wars, killings, that's all we read about!
You're glorifying the gangster by giving him all this publicity.
You're trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him?
By keeping him off the front page?
That's ridiculous!
You're playing right into his hands! Show him up!
Run him out of the country!
That'll keep him off the front page.
In the meantime, you expect our children to read of nothing but outrage and murder?
That's better than their being slaughtered.
The city is full of machine guns.
Gang war in the streets.
Kids aren't even safe to go to school.
You want that to go on?
Certainly not! But what can private citizens do?
Even our police force can't stop it!
Don't blame the police!
They can't stop machine guns from being run back and forth across the state lines.
They can't enforce laws that don't exist!
Then it's up to the federal government to do something about it.
You're the government!
All of you!
Instead of trying to hide the facts, get busy and see that laws are passed that'll do some good!
For instance?
Pass a federal law that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery!
Put teeth in the Deportation Act!
These gangsters don't belong in this country.
Half of them aren't even citizens.
That's true. They bring nothing but disgrace to my people.
All right.
I'll tell you what to do.
Make laws and see that they're obeyed if we have to have martial law to do it!
The governor of New Mexico declared martial law to stop a bull fight, the governor of Oklahoma to regulate oil production.
Surely, gang rule and wholesale law defiance are more of a menace to the nation than the regulation of oil or a bull fight!
The Army will help.
So will the American Legion.
They offered their services over two years ago!
And nobody ever called on them.
Let's get wise to ourselves.
We're fighting organized murder!
That Sadie Thompson, she's a pretty smart girl.
What's a girl wanna hustle in a place like that for?
Yeah, it's raining all the time.
Yeah, that rain, that's pretty good.
That comes from a pipe, you know, just like a shower.
Them two fellows...
Hey, which one do you think she takes?
The guy with the collar?
Nah, he ain't so hot.
Hey, listen, them Marines ain't so hot, too.
Come on, I go take a smoke.
That's a fine show.
I gotta see more shows like that. You know, serious.
Ain't got no jokes.
I like a show with jokes.
That's a dope.
What more do you want?
Listen, this girl, Sadie, she's got what you call a problem.
This fellow with the collar, he's gonna...
- What's the matter?
- They found Gaffney.
Spotted him down at Frank's Bowling Alley.
He's got into a game.
- Yeah?
- It's a setup.
Take about an hour to get the boys.
I'm looking at a show now.
Listen, it's the last act now, see?
There's two fellows after a girl.
Well, she's called her name Sadie, see?
Now this girl, Sadie, she's been, what do you call, disillusioned.
We gotta do it now!
He's liable to slip us again.
He's the last one, Boss.
Come on, Tony.
That's too bad.
All right, come on.
Hey wait a minute!
Now, you stay here.
- You stay and see the show.
- Oh, Boss.
I gotta know which fellow this girl, Sadie, she take.
You stay here and find out, and then come and tell me.
It's all right, Boss.
The copper's gone.
All right. Come on.
Hey, Little Boy, you go around the back, up on the balcony, grandstand seat on Stanton.
Hey, Pietro, side door.
He may have friends, you never can tell.
Joe, I want you stand in the alley.
If he gets that far, you do your stuff.
You keep the motor running.
Bring the present. You stay here.
Come on, fellows.
Now we'll know what happened to that girl, Sadie.
Hey, Angelo, did she take the guy with the collar?
No, she climb back in the hay with the army.
Yeah? That's fine.
She's a smart girl, I think.
- Come on.
- What're you doing?
Not bad, huh?
Just watch this one.
- Hello, Tony.
- Hello.
That's pretty hot.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello, stranger.
Chair. Well, Johnny.
Well, you're looking swell.
I thought we were gonna see something of you.
Well, here I am.
Where have you been?
On a vacation?
I've been working.
Up on the North Side, eh, Johnny?
That's what the papers say.
Don't work too hard.
I just finish up tonight.
Now I play a while.
You got your own table,
Camonte.
What's that?
This is a table for two.
Well, maybe you get another table, eh, Johnny?
Hey, listen, you. Who do you think...
All right, go on.
Nothing seems to bother you much, does it?
Well, I get used to noises.
- Hello, Guino.
- Hello, baby.
Why are you always high-hatting me?
Go on, beat it!
I suppose you need an organ grinder to work with?
Tony's inside.
He see you in that outfit?
I looked pretty good from two stories up.
Am I different now?
Wanna dance with me?
Listen, you're Tony's sister, see?
Besides, you're only a kid.
I'm 18.
You like that music?
Now do you wanna dance?
No.
Afraid! Afraid of Tony's sister!
Why you...
Well, I noticed you stood there and watched.
Someday you'll find out you've been missing something.
Hey, how about it?
You and me, eh?
I thought you weren't dancing?
I've changed my mind.
I need exercise.
We show them something, huh?
I think you missed me, huh?
That's right.
We make up for lost time.
How do you wanna play, Tony?
Like this?
That's good.
You wait here.
I take her home myself.
- You can't.
- Shut up!
You'll be sorry for this!
Next time I catch you in a place like that again, I'll kill you!
You're telling me what to do?
I'll do what I want, same as you. Understand?
You listen to me!
I hate you!
Never mind what I do.
That's all right!
But you're gonna stay home.
Understand?
- I'm no baby! I can take care of myself!
- Yeah.
Running around with fellows, eh?
Letting them hold you like that!
Letting them look at you! Dressing up like that for fellows to see, eh?
What I do with fellows is my business!
Cesca!
- Mama.
- Cesca. What's the matter?
What did Tony do to you, huh?
What'd he do?
He hit me. He said he'd kill me and I wasn't doing anything!
I was only dancing.
That's all right, figlia mia.
No cry. All right, tell Mama.
Come on upstairs.
No cry, baby.
He hasn't any right to.
Just because I'm his sister he can't throw me around like that.
No, no, no.
All right, no cry, baby.
I tell you.
I tell you lots of times.
He hurt you. He hurt you.
He hurt everybody.
Pour a little on those tires.
Right.
That's got him.
Just shut up!
Get me some nickels!
Get me some nickels! Hurry!
Lakeside 1305.
Get me a drink.
Hello?
Hello, is this Jim?
Tony Camonte.
Is Rinaldo there?
No, Mr. Camonte.
He left an hour ago.
- Is Lovo there?
- Lovo?
No, he left, too.
Said he was going back to the office.
Bosworth 4503.
Hello.
Hello, Mabel?
Camonte. Rinaldo there?
Why, no.
He ain't been here.
Say, you know, I think that guy's giving me the runaround.
I've had a date with him two or three times...
Maybe he's going home to bed.
What are you talking?
- That tomcat?
- Try Maizie.
Maizie, that's right,
I forgot about her.
Hatfield 6401.
Yeah, 6401.
Come on.
- Hello.
- Hello, Maizie? It's Tony Camonte.
- Rinaldo there?
- Yeah.
For you.
- Hello.
- Hello, Rinaldo.
I'm at Pietro's. Pietro's!
Yeah, come right away.
Anything wrong?
Yeah, plenty.
Go get me a towel.
I thought you weren't doing anything tonight?
I'll be back later.
This is worse than being in love with a grasshopper.
It took you a long time to get here.
- Who done it?
- I don't know.
But I got an idea.
You just wait.
- How do you stand with Lovo?
- Huh?
- Come on!
- How do you stand with Lovo?
- Who's Lovo?
- That's good.
Say when.
That's enough.
You call Johnny Lovo at his office at 10 minutes past 2:00, see?
That's 10 minutes past 2:00.
You say that you're calling from the country now, see?
You're one of the guys that took me for a ride.
The car got smashed and I got away.
The car got smashed and I got away!
Yes, yes.
You think it was Johnny?
I don't know.
But we'll find out now.
We'll be there when Pietro calls.
And if it was Johnny, he'll stall, won't he?
- Sure.
- Let's go.
Open the door.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Tony, where you been?
What happened to you?
Yeah, look.
They spoil my brand new suit.
Who, coppers?
No, monkeys.
Never seen them before.
Somebody must have brought them in.
How did they get you?
They smashed my bus, took me for a ride.
Almost.
That's right.
You left the café alone.
You ought to know better than to do that.
Where were you?
I thought you always stuck to Tony.
Well, baby, I'm glad you got away.
I'd have missed you plenty.
I'll get somebody for this.
I knew you would, Johnny.
That's Poppy.
I don't wanna see her tonight.
I'll tell her you ain't here.
Wait a minute.
I'll talk to her.
Hello? Who?
No, there's nobody here by that name.
What? What?
Oh, ring off.
You got a wrong number.
You better have a drink, Tony.
You?
It's a lie!
I didn't do it!
I wouldn't try anything on you, Tony. We're pals.
Sure, we're pals.
No, no. I didn't do it!
You got me wrong.
Listen, Tony, I brought you out here. I worked with you.
You're the last guy in the world
I'd try to cross, you know that!
You wouldn't do anything to me!
Don't take me, Tony! Give me a chance!
You can have anything I got, anything!
All the dough you want.
Poppy! I'll let you have her!
I give you my word!
You can have Poppy, Tony! I'll tell her!
The boss!
No. Let me go away.
Give me a break.
I never did anything to anybody!
- I never hurt anybody!
- No.
You get somebody else to do it for you!
No!
Wait! Don't!
Tony, come back! Tony...
Oh, Tony.
What's happened?
Where's Johnny?
Where do you think?
Go pack your stuff.
Hey, come here.
Look at that.
Do you remember what I told you?
Tony isn't here.
He's out of town.
You're telling me?
Why did you hang up when I called yesterday?
Too busy.
The one on the end's kind of cute.
She ain't bad.
I should think you'd want something more like...
Like what?
Me.
Cut out that sort of talk.
You're only a kid.
I told you
I had grown-up ideas.
You're like Tony when you go after something, hey?
What would Tony say?
He'll be away for a month.
The big fellow's on his way from Florida.
Uh-huh.
Well, he'd better watch his step.
This town's entirely different than when he left it.
That new crowd down at the City Hall is looking for him.
The first crack he makes, they'll climb all over him.
Hand it to Hap. Tell him to play it for what it's worth.
You stay out here.
- Tony.
- Where's Cesca?
She get a place of her own.
She say to me, "Shut up. Mind your business."
Just like you say.
- Well, is she living alone?
- Yeah.
All the time that's what she tell me, but one day I follow her.
She meet a man.
They go in the house together.
I look and I see her name under the push bell.
See? See what you do?
Once I have a son,
I have a daughter and now...
Ma...
Where is the place she live?
236, Central Street.
What you gonna do? What you...
No, no, Tony, no!
Stop!
Central Street.
He was going downgrade
Making 90 miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
And they found him in the wreck
With his hands on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
It's a mighty rough road
From Lynchburg to Danville
And the track's on the three-mile grade
It was on this road
That he lost his average
You can see what a jump he made
Hello.
Hello, baby.
I'm so happy.
You're telling me?
You do love me, don't you, Guino?
You know I do.
Never stop telling me, will you?
I'm not like all the others, am I?
You're up there all by yourself, sweetheart.
We'll always be happy, won't we?
Hello, Tony.
Tony, I...
Tony, don't! Tony!
Guino! Guino!
Guino! Guino, speak to me!
Speak to me!
Guino, say something! Guino!
Tony, he's my Guino!
I love him.
We were married yesterday,
Tony! Really married!
We were going to surprise you!
Weren't we, Guino?
Oh, darling, speak to me!
He's dead.
He's dead.
He loved me.
Really loved me.
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me!
Stay away from me!
You're not my brother!
Don't you think I know?
Murderer!
He kills people!
He kills everybody!
He kills everything!
He's a butcher.
That's what you are.
You're a butcher!
You're a butcher!
Drive down to the house.
Come on, Boss.
Go on, beat it!
Get out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Mr. Comante's secretary.
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear you.
It's... It's Poppy, Boss.
I got her name.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Tony, what is it?
Tony, say something.
Tony.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
He did, eh?
Did you get the rest of them?
All right, let me talk to Duffy.
All right, Ben, here's what you've been waiting for. Camonte killed Rinaldo.
Put up a fight when they tried to take him and holed up in that steel fort of his.
Get him! Take Madden and his whole outfit.
I'll send you more if you need them.
Yeah, wait a minute, Duffy.
Don't lose any men. Block off the street.
Put your lights on and smoke him out away from his guns and he'll quit!
Get going. Hello, Duffy?
Yeah. Send those monkeys on in.
Tell Jake to stay put.
Tony! Quick, Tony, they're coming!
The police!
Cesca.
They're after you!
They're gonna get you, Tony!
Why didn't you shoot,
Cesca, huh?
Why didn't you shoot?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because you're me and I'm you.
It's always been that way.
Three of you fellows, go on that roof across the street there!
You two cover that alley back of the house.
- Right.
- Right.
Tony, what are we gonna do?
What do we do?
Come here,
I show you what we do.
Tony, they followed me! This is my fault.
I shouldn't have come!
What's the difference?
Your fault, my fault?
Just so you're here, that's all what matters.
Here, you load them, huh?
Sure I'll load them. I'm not afraid.
I'm like you, Tony.
That's the way to talk. You're not afraid, huh?
Come on, we'll show them.
Here, here. Put it here, Cesca.
Put it right here.
We'll show them something.
Hey, look at the monkeys there!
They think they're gonna get
Tony Camonte, eh?
Hey, Cesca, wait, I'll show you.
Look, Cesca, see?
Steel, all steel!
Solid steel!
No one can get in here!
Hey, Cesca, you and me, huh?
We'll show them!
We'll lick them all, the North Side, the South Side!
We'll lick the whole world!
Cesca!
Cesca!
Let me lie down, Tony.
I'm all hollow inside.
Cesca. Cesca, what is it?
Where?
It doesn't hurt, really.
Just put your arms around me,
Tony, just for a minute.
- Cesca.
- I won't be able to help you now.
Oh, you can't go away. I won't let you, you understand? I won't let you!
So dizzy.
Hold me, Tony.
Don't let me get scared.
Listen, you don't understand.
I'll be here all alone!
You can't leave me here all alone!
Why, Tony, you're afraid!
Don't be afraid, Tony.
You're all I got left!
Little Boy, he's gone! Angelo, he's gone!
I'm no good without you,
Cesca. I'm no good by myself!
Cesca!
Cesca!
They're out there! They wanna get me!
They're all there!
Cesca, they won't give me a chance, please!
- Cesca!
- Guino wasn't afraid!
Cesca, don't go.
Please, Cesca!
I won't let you go!
You hear, I won't let you!
You understand?
You gotta stay here, you hear me?
I don't wanna stay!
You're afraid.
Guino. Guino.
Cesca, please. Come back, you hear?
Come back, I say!
Hurry up with that gas.
That second window up there.
All right.
Cesca! Cesca!
Cesca!
I can't see!
Cesca!
Angelo!
Little Boy!
Cesca!
I can't see!
Break it down!
Stop! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, Guarino!
Lookit, I'm all alone.
I got no gun, see?
Give me a break, will you, Guarino?
Break? Who'd you ever give a break to?
Look at me. I got nobody.
I'm all alone!
Little Boy's gone.
Angelo is gone.
And my steel shutters, they don't work.
Shut up, Camonte!
Give me a break, will you?
Don't shoot!
You got me covered.
I can't do nothing!
I can't do nothing!
Give me a break will you?
Listen, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me.
I told you, you'd show up this way.
Get you in a jam without a gun and you squeal like a yellow rat.
Come on! Climb into this.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CLOCK CHIMES]
[DOG BARKING AND HOWLING]
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
But how else can we explain these terrible deaths?
Von Ilse last night.
Five others before him.
That's six within as many weeks, Inspector.
Our friends, neighbors that we've known for years, drained
Of their life's blood, found dead
In bed, likely skeletons of skin and bone.
Vampires are at large,
I tell you, vampires!
Yeah, malignant demons who issue forth from their graves
In the dead of night to attack their victims
And drink the blood from their veins.
Brr!
God in heaven,
Brettschneider, don't jest!
Ah, that blood-sucking legend belongs in the same category
With werewolves and all other peasant superstitions.
But the bats, man!
The bats!
God, yes!
Big ones, so!
Oh, now we're switching to bats again.
There was an epidemic of giant bats in Klineschloss in 1643.
And at the same time, there was an outbreak of vampirism.
Rot!
Why, this record from the town archives proves it.
Says it, not proves it.
Well, I'll show you.
I'll show you.
Now, ah, here it is.
"And on this day was von Hausmen hanged"
From a gibbet in the public square
After being convicted on a proven charge of vampirism.
And on this same day, there did occur the departure
Of the bats, thousands of horrible flying creatures
Which infested the town for weeks.
And on the night of this same day,
February 13 in the year of our
Lord, 1643, was there a stake
Driven through von
Hausmen's heart
"And his head cut off with a gravedigger's shovel."
There.
Well, all the records in the world
Can't make me believe in vampires.
There are bloodsucking bats, yes,
In South America, thousands of miles from here.
But not in Klineschloss.
But bats fly!
They could fly here!
You saw the buggers, all of them.
Two wounds on the neck, right at the jugular vein.
Two wounds on the neck, pierced and spread apart
Just as if two fang-like teeth had
Bitten through the flesh and right into the veins.
And in every case, a blood clot, eight inches from the victim's
Neck, the mark of the feast, the devil's signature.
Does that appear the mark of a human being or a demon's?
God save us, the devil's.
You ought to make a pretty fair meal for a vampire.
But let's be consistent.
Are these human vampires or... or bats?
Vampires can take the shape of a human or a bat,
Just as they choose.
Oh.
They're magicians.
Well, it doesn't make sense to me.
The whole village is in terror.
We live in closed houses, behind locked doors and bolted
Shutters, not daring to close our eyes,
Fearful lest this unseen, silent death may find us in our sleep.
For it is then that it strikes, swiftly, silently, ghastly.
My room is tightly closed.
The windows are barred, nailed down!
Nothing can get in, nothing!
But they tell me vampires can go through stone walls,
Like that.
God save me, so they can!
We've got to do something, I tell you!
Klineschloss will become a deserted village.
Well, you might capture all the bats
And drown them in the river.
Karl!
Karl!
While you're hunting for vampires and chasing bats,
I'm looking for a human being, a murderer, a thief!
Well then, don't jest about it.
Do something!
I'm trying to!
Every hour, every day, every night since this thing started!
[DOG BARKING AND HOWLING]
Do you hear it?
Yes!
Yes!
Night after night, lying awake until dawn, waiting!
For what?
I don't know.
That's what I thought.
Good night, gentlemen.
Don't let the vampires get you.
[POP]
[LAUGHS]
Are your kisses dynamite!
Don't you like my kisses?
Well, how's my mastermind this evening.
Well, if you want the truth, not so good.
The Burgermeister and his grand council
Still stick to the vampire theory, huh?
Stick to it?
Ha!
They're quoting history to prove it.
I think you and Dr. von
Niemang are the only
Sane people left in the village.
And you?
What about you?
Hmm, me.
Well, I'm beginning to think I'm seven
Different kinds of a fool.
Murders are being done under my very nose.
I must be as blind as the bats themselves.
I can't find a single clue.
Oh, but you will,
Karl, you will.
Well, I haven't.
AUNT GUSSIE: Oh, Ruth!
And here comes dear Aunt Gussie to spread good cheer and hope.
Just what I thought, slaving your life away
In this awful place.
It hasn't got that nice, plain, wholesome smell of a hospital.
How are you, Karl?
Oh, quite well, thank you.
Well, I'm not.
This clammy old place is bound to give me pericarditis,
[INAUDIBLE], neuritis,
[INAUDIBLE]...
Well anyway, Ruth.
You want some coffee?
No, no thank you,
Frau Schappmann.
Well, just as well.
There's only two cups.
Here, dear.
Anything to chill out your bones.
Thank you.
Speaking of chills,
Frau Schappmann,
Did you know the villagers are supposed
To be infested with ghouls and vampires?
Oh, Karl!
Vampires!
Pariahs among fiends, demoniacal creatures
With huge canine teeth who bite deeply
Into the necks of their victims, to quaff
And gorge on blood, warm human blood!
There's no such thing as a vampire, Karl Brettschneider.
I don't believe in it.
You're just saying that to frighten me.
And I just won't be frightened.
I'm entirely too sensible to believe in such rubbish.
I beg pardon.
[GASPS] Oh, that was you.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Who said you frightened me?
I'm not afraid of anything.
Could you tell me where
Dr. von Niemann is?
Well, he drove to the village to see
Martha, the old apple woman.
Thank you.
Is this what Dr.
Hobb prescribed?
Yes, sir.
She takes it in water.
Hmm.
Well, continue giving it to her.
Yes, sir.
It's stifiling in here.
Open these windows.
Herman open windows.
Me do, me do.
[SIGH] Well, she'll sleep well now, poor soul.
It won't be necessary for you to stay here.
A good night's sleep will work wonders for her.
It was kind of you to come, Doctor.
Oh, Martha has sold me apples for many years,
Always the good, ripe, juicy ones.
Martha give me apples!
I like!
[LAUGHS]
Shh!
Oh, to think.
[MOANS]
DR. VON NIEMANN:
She wants her cross.
Herman get.
Herman get.
Here.
Here.
Now that for Martha.
There.
Oh!
She won't let it out of her sight.
A terrible experience.
To be attacked by a giant bat is enough to shatter
Anyone's nerves.
She talks about it all the time, how it flew in her face
And tried to sink its teeth in her throat.
No, no, no, no.
Bats no do!
They soft, like cat.
They not bite Herman!
[CRIES OUT]
[INAUDIBLE] see what you've done?
There, there.
There, Martha, there.
Shh.
[CRYING SLOWS]
She'll be all right.
If she isn't, let me know.
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
That's all right.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Run along, Herman.
You can see Martha tomorrow.
Oh.
Ah, Dr. von Niemann.
Ah, Kringen, how are you?
Much better, thank you kindly sir,
Since you prescribed for me.
That's right.
Go to bed, Herman.
Go to bed!
You shouldn't be filing around the streets.
It's dangerous!
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Afraid?
Afraid of what, Kringen?
The bats, sir.
Big giant bats, with wings like an eagle.
DR. VON NIEMANN: You saw this bat, you say?
I saw it swooping down the street.
It came directly for my throat, sir.
When was this, Kringen?
Last night when they came to take von Ilse.
It was a big, monstrous thing.
I saw it leap across the alley and into a window.
I ran just as fast as my legs could carry me.
You said nothing about this?
There's enough fear in the village already.
Maybe I should.
Maybe I sh... I will.
I'll tell the Burgermeister.
Yes, Kringen.
That's the thing to do.
No!
Bats... bats good!
They not hurt Herman.
He plays with them.
You... you no tell!
No.
No, no, no, go to bed, Herman.
Go on.
Go on, go to bed!
You say he plays with bats?
His garret is filled with them.
He makes pets of them.
That's odd.
Very odd.
Maybe... maybe he's it.
Herman prowls around the streets all hours of the night,
Just like an animal.
Maybe he's the vampire.
Now, don't start any gossip with that, Kringen.
Heaven only knows where it might end.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
There.
Now.
So nice.
There.
See?
What did I tell you?
Perhaps there's something in what Kringen says.
Seems strange that a human being
Should want to play with bats.
[GROWLS]
[LAUGHS]
He isn't human, I tell you!
He's in league with the devil!
Put it on.
Put it on.
There.
Now, go to sleep.
You'll be all right in a few days.
The doctor says so.
Close the window.
Close the window!
I'm afraid!
The vampire!
He said leave them open.
But I'd have them closed.
Do you want the light?
Leave the light.
I'm afraid.
Well, I can't blame you for that, either.
I'll turn it down a little.
Goodnight.
If you want me, just pound on the floor.
I'll hear you.
All right.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Martha.
Ohh.
Herr Brettschneider is here to see you, sir.
He's in the laboratory with Miss Bertin.
Oh, thank you.
Ah, here you are!
Good evening, Doctor.
Good evening, Ruth.
How are you, Karl?
Well, I'd feel a lot better if I could
Find the solution to these murders.
You don't believe in this vampire theory, then?
[SCOFFS] Of course not.
Do you?
There are many strange happenings, my boy,
Many mysteries beyond the power of the human mind
To comprehend.
Have you a theory which might explain these deaths?
Well, I'll be pleased to discuss it with you, but,
Uh, not now, now now.
I have some very important work to do.
Well, tomorrow then.
Tomorrow?
Yes, perhaps.
Uh, we'll see.
Oh, this isn't so important, Miss Bertin,
That you can't let it go till tomorrow.
All right, thank you, Doctor.
Oh, uh, how about Martha?
Huh?
Oh, nothing serious.
Just a case of nerves, after all.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Goodnight, Karl.
[FOOTSTEPS WALKING AWAY]
[CLOCK CHIMING]
[SCREAMS]
HOBB: Name?
SAUER: Martha Mueller.
HOBB: Age?
I don't know.
Cause of death?
Like all the rest.
A vampire.
Yes, yes, that's right.
When I said I was going to tell you,
His eyes burned up like coals of fire.
His hand reached out toward me, as
If he were gonna sink it into my throat.
And weigh this well.
He never works and never bathes, and yet he
Appears well fed always.
That's so.
He does.
Well, what does he live on, then?
I'll wager it's as Kringen says.
And my [INAUDIBLE] was in Martha's room
Tonight, when Herman put a flower in her hand.
Strange business if you ask me, mighty strange.
I hate it when [INAUDIBLE].
Yes.
After what's happened tonight
I've locked myself in my room
And prayed God to protect me from the devil!
[CROWD CHATTERING]
MAN IN CROWD: Dr. von Niemann!
[CROWD CHATTERING]
Dr. von Niemann!
[SCREAMS]
Well, what do you make of it, Doctor?
Are these two wounds similar to those
Found in the other bodies?
Dr. Hobb can answer that for you, sir.
Yes, they were the same in every case.
This is a strange condition, Karl.
So strange that I doubt the evidence of my eyes.
What was your conclusion, Hobb?
I diagnosed the wounds as having been made by needle
Sharp teeth, punctures [INAUDIBLE]
Penetrating into but not beyond the jugular veins.
Do you mean to say that you also
Believe they could have been made by teeth?
Frankly, I do.
Ha, you see, Brettschneider?
What kind of teeth, Doctor?
An animal of some sort.
It's hard to say.
The fangs of a wolf, perhaps.
A werewolf.
Could they have been made by, well, a bat, for instance?
DR. VON NIEMANN: A certain species, yes.
There are vampire bats.
Dr. William Garrison,
[INAUDIBLE] the perimeters
Of the upper Amazon, states that bloodsucking bats do exist.
He further asserted that the victims often
Become blood drinkers themselves,
Citing a case in which he saw a native [INAUDIBLE]
By his tribe brothers.
They swore he had become a human bat.
And, states Garrison, he confessed it.
KARL: Do you mean to say that such a thing as a human vampire
Is possible?
Who can say.
Historic records would have us believe that an evil soul,
Assuming there is such, can take any shape it pleases.
So why not [INAUDIBLE] that of a human being.
Eh, Karl?
Why not?
Have you any literature on the topic, Doctor?
Yes, I have many interesting volumes on my shelf
That might prove very enlightening.
I'll be glad to show them to you.
I don't mind admitting that I'm up a tree.
Stumped.
Well, we'll see what can be done, my boy.
No, no, no, Herman.
This is no place for you.
Go in, my boy.
Go in.
DR. VON NIEMANN:
Goodnight, John.
JOHN: Goodnight, Doctor.
DR. VON NIEMANN:
Goodnight, Hobb.
Uh, goodnight, Doctor.
DR. VON NIEMANN: In the morning, Karl.
KARL: Thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry to have dragged you out at such an ungodly hour.
DR. VON NIEMANN: Oh, that's all right, that's all right.
Ah!
Ahh!
A child, fleeing in horror from the sight of death.
That was the vampire.
Arrest him!
Lock him up!
Kill him!
Has the entire village gone mad?
Herman wouldn't harm a baby, and you know it!
I've walk the streets of this village for over 40 years,
But tonight's the end.
He knows that I've told he plays with bats.
He knows that I saw him sneak into Martha's
House just before midnight.
Perhaps he was taking her another flower, Kringen.
The boy brought her one this evening while I was there.
He killed her just like he did all the rest!
And now he's gonna kill me.
Unless he's killed and a stake driven through his heart,
I'm a doomed man!
He'll kill me!
He'll kill me!
I'm doomed!
He'll kill me!
He'll kill me!
I'm a doomed man!
He'll kill me!
Good morning, Mr.
Brettschneider.
What brings you to
Klineschloss so early?
You.
Fibber.
I heard the doctor tell
Georgiana he expected you.
I knew there was something else.
You're a delightful prevaricator,
Karl, but not a very convincing one.
Oh, you don't mind me using your stethoscope,
Do you, Doctor?
Not at all, Frau Schnappman.
What seems to be the ailment this morning?
What's that?
Oh!
What seems to be the ailment this morning?
Well, Doctor, I am positive that I
Have valvular disease of the aorta.
Or maybe it's the, um, the right ventricle.
Hm.
Well, there's something wrong with my heart.
I can hear it beat thump, thump, thump,
Thump, just like the book says.
Well, if you didn't hear it beating thump, thump, thump,
Just as the book says, I would say there is something wrong.
What?
Without a moon?
You have a heart of stone.
All right then, close your eyes.
Now.
Oh, so young lady!
It's too early in the morning, Karl, much too early.
Oh, is it?
[GASPS] Oh, there's Aunt Gussie.
Hmm, she would show up just at a time like this.
Oh, oh!
[SIGHING]
Well, Aunt Gussie, what's the matter now?
An [INAUDIBLE] of the auricular, ventricular
Microvalves, to the [INAUDIBLE].
You mean your heart's beating.
Of course it's beating.
Dr. von Niemann tried to assure me.
But I know, I know it's serious.
I'm liable to go just like that.
Did he prescribe for you, dear?
Yes.
[INAUDIBLE] chloric acid.
You mean salicylic acid, don't you?
Well, silasalic or salicylic, it [INAUDIBLE].
My heart is much quieter.
Hello, Karl.
Hello.
Oh, Karl.
You will be good to Ruth when I'm gone, won't you?
Yes, of course I will, Frau Schnappman.
Well, I'm not gone yet.
And you can't marry her unless I say so.
Don't forget that.
Oh, my heart!
There, Auntie, you'll be all right.
Just rest a while.
What you need is...
Rest?
Rest, dear, and quiet.
[GROANS]
Aunt Gussie has a heart like a steam engine.
Karl! [LAUGHS]
[MEOWING]
Here, kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty!
Kitty-poo!
Come on!
Come on, kitty-poo.
Where are you, baby?
Come on!
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty poo.
Come on... [GASPS] Ew!
[INAUDIBLE]
Nasty little beast!
Oh!
Don't you know it's wrong to steal?
[GASPS]
You'll cut yourself.
[INAUDIBLE] blood.
Ew!
Stop it, stop it!
No hurt me.
No hurt!
Oh, you poor thing.
Now, you wait right here, and I'll run in the house
And get something for that finger.
A subcutaneous wound like that might easily
Result in a tetanus infection.
Tetan... tetan...
Tetanus Lockjaw.
Not that you need be afraid!
From the way you talk I think you've got it already.
Look, here's a nice juicy apple for you.
Mm!
[SIGHS]
Ah, this is it.
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] by
Augusta Dom Calimay in 1746.
Huh.
"Let us suppose that these corpses do not actually"
Stir from their tombs, that only the ghosts
Or spirits appear to the living.
Wherefore do these phantoms present themselves
And what is it that energizes them?
Is it actually the soul of a dead man which has not
Yet departed to its final destination?
Or"...
AUNT GUSSIE: [INAUDIBLE] Now, how could a corpse buried
Under four or five feet of earth get
Out to do any such foolishness?
I don't believe it.
It's a fair question, Doctor.
How could it?
Well, according to accepted theory,
The vampire dematerializes the body
And reintegrates it outside the grave.
A good explanation if you can believe it.
And while I'm standing here listening to all this rubbish,
There's a poor man in the garden in danger
Of a tetanus infection.
Now, what should I do for him, Doctor?
Shall I apply [INAUDIBLE] or a tube saturation of [INAUDIBLE]?
Well, either will do.
Get some gauze and some material from...
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll wait here.
Difficult to believe, isn't it?
It's impossible to believe.
And yet it would explain these deaths, wouldn't it?
Ah, Brettschneider.
Pardon our intrusion,
Dr. von Niemann.
But after what you saw last night,
You'll be interested in this as well.
What's happened?
Kringen was found dead an hour ago, with the two punctures
In his neck and not a drop of blood in his body.
And what's more, Herman
Gleib has disappeared.
What?
Now are you convinced that we were right and you were wrong?
This ought to be proof enough for anybody.
Kringen said Herman would get him and he did.
Well, Brettschneider?
I appoint you my deputy.
Organize a searching party and comb this countryside
From one end to the other.
Find Herman Gleib and bring him in, but don't harm him.
You understand?
What good will that do?
He's a vampire.
There's only one thing for us to do when we find him,
Kill him and drive a stake through his heart.
Herman Gleib will be tried by a court of law!
If the charge against him is proven true,
The law will decide what to do with him, not you.
Now get your men together and do as I tell you.
That's a way to talk.
I'm going into town for a little while, Doctor.
Would you care to come along?
Oh, I hardly believe so.
There's little to be done till they find the boy.
If you need me then, I...
All right, thanks.
I'll let you know.
I feel as though
I'm going to faint.
There, Auntie, there's nothing here to be afraid of.
[INAUDIBLE]
Run along now and take care of that patient of yours.
Oh, heavens.
I forgot all about him.
Oh, my heart!
Oh!
Poor Auntie.
She's has every ailment in the book.
Your [INAUDIBLE] aunt, I'm afraid.
Particularly a palpitation of the [INAUDIBLE] ventricular
Tricuspid and microvalve, Doctor.
Well, I had to tell her something to satisfy her.
[LAUGHS]
There, there, you mustn't do that.
Now, where's that finger?
You good like Martha.
She give me apples.
Herman like you.
Are you Herman?
Me Herman.
You give me apple, Herman give you nice soft bat.

[INAUDIBLE]
What is it, Georgiana?
I just found this in Emil's room.
Well?
GEORGIANA: It belonged to my friend, Martha Mueller.
Are you certain?
I gave it to her myself.
Martha died last night.
I find her crucifix in Emil's room.
Doesn't that mean
Emil is the one
Herr Brettschneider was seeking?
This amazes me, Georgiana.
It's impossible.
It rained the night von Ilse died.
There was mud of Emil's shoes the next morning.
Have you mentioned this to anyone?
I intend to tell
Herr Brettschneider
When he calls again.
I can't believe it.
Uh, leave this with me.
I want to talk to Emil before you say anything to anyone.
The Burgermeister should know at once.
Yes, all in good time.
Emil is going to be too [INAUDIBLE]
For us to jump to conclusions.
Don't say anything until I tell you.
And send Emil to me.
Very well, Doctor.
That's for the muritis.
And the [INAUDIBLE].
Is tougher than shoe leather.
And [INAUDIBLE].
That'll help if I come into any harm.
And, uh, ginger... [BURPS] that'll warm my stomach.
Now, a little
[INAUDIBLE] of soda.

Ooh!
Ooh!

We've got him!
He can't get away from here now!
Come on, he's around that way!
If he tries to get past you, you know what to do!
[DOGS BARKING]
There he is, [INAUDIBLE].
Here, boys!
Herman?
You're going back to the village with us.
Come on.
We won't hurt you.
No.
No, won't go!
Herman afraid!
Come on!
You're going with us, Herman!
No!
You're going with us!
No!
Come on.
Come on!
Get him!
[DOG BARKING]
Come on, Herman, we won't hurt you.
Come on, Herman.
No!
No.
No!

[DOGS HOWLING]
Come, [INAUDIBLE].
[DOGS HOWLING]
You've got to make certain.
I won't go down there.
Nobody asked you to.
I'll go myself.
Can you see him?
He's on a ledge about 50 feet down.
I'll get a rope.
We've got to make certain, I tell you.
You must be careful, Emil.
Very careful.
No.
It must be.
It must be.
She's no better than the rest.
I've got to go on.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Oh, it's you, Doctor.
Good evening.
I'm sorry to have to disturb you, Doctor,
But we simply couldn't make
Georgiana hear the bell.
That's quite all right, my dear.
Georgiana's becoming careless, very careless.
Yes, I've noticed that too.
In my opinion, she has [INAUDIBLE].
That's hidden sickness.
You know [INAUDIBLE].
At first I thought it was [INAUDIBLE],
So I stuck a pin in her leg to see.
And there was a splendid reaction of the, uh,
Reflex motor [INAUDIBLE].
Why, Auntie.
Ha, you're shocked.
So was she.
Won't you join me in some coffee?
Yes, thanks Doctor, we will.
There are a few questions
I'd like to ask you about.
About blood and murders and vampires, I suppose.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Well, so am I. Well, goodnight.
If such a thing is possible I'm going to bed.
Won't you join us too, Frau Schnappman.
Coffee at this time of the night?
No thank you.
I'm going to stick to my [INAUDIBLE]
Summer salad. [INAUDIBLE].
Goodnight!
What's the news in the village, Karl?
Have they located Herman yet?
No, not a trace of him.
I hate to think of that poor misfit
Being hunted down like a dog.
You know, I simply can't bring myself
To believe in that vampire theory.
Uh, would you pour, Ruth?
Certainly.
I know, Karl.
[INAUDIBLE] common judgment tells us that such things can't
Be, and yet here, for instance, in this ponderous tome
Are cited 1,0001 phobias and complexes
That human beings are err to.
Some of them are strange, more untenable even
Than werewolves and vampires.
Uh, could I have some more, please?
You drink entirely too much coffee.
It's my one weakness.
And also my excuse for tolerating Georgiana's
Laxity in other things.
She does know how to make good coffee.
Thank you.
She brings it to me every night at exactly 10 o'clock.
And when I've drunk it all, then I know it's time to quit.
Yes, and eat breakfast so you can have more coffee.
Oh.
[CHUCKLES]
Georgiana, you mustn't lie like that!
You'll get yourself [INAUDIBLE].
G... Georgiana?
[SCREAMS]
That was Auntie!
Auntie!
Oh!
I'm all right.
I'm all right now.
Emil, help Frau
Schnappman [INAUDIBLE].
AUNT GUSSIE: [INAUDIBLE].
[SCREAMS]
It's OK.
Don't be afraid.
The same two wounds, Doctor.
And my last words to her were angry ones, a petulant
Reprimand for being late with my coffee.
What time was that?
About two or three minutes after 10:00.
She's been then about 45 minutes.
Bloodless, like the rest.
Passes all belief!
Ruth's aunt saw Herman Gleib in the garden this morning.
Could it be that he...?
You were the first one here.
What happened?
I was in my room reading.
My door was open.
I must have dozed off for a minute or so,
Because I awoke to hear
Frau Schnappman scream.
You say your door was open?
Yes, my room was very poorly ventilated.
And you saw nothing?
Heard nothing unusual?
EMIL: Nothing.
Karl.
What is it?
This crucifix belonged to Martha.
[BELL RINGING]
See who it is, Emil.
Can you positively identify this as belonging to Martha?
Without a doubt.
I saw it in her room the night she died.
How in the world did it get here?
Herman Gleib was in her room.
He had that crucifix in his hands.
And Herman was here today.
Maybe here now, for all we know.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Who is it?
KARL: Karl:
Oh.
How is she?
She's had a real shock this time, but she'll be all right.
I'm putting her to bed.
Leave her there.
Don't let her out of this room.
And don't you leave it, either.
Well, what do you mean?
It looks as if Herman Gleib is the killer after all.
It's possible he may be hiding here in the castle.
What makes you think so?
I'll tell you later.
Stay in your room and keep your door locked.
Don't worry about that.
I heard every word he said.
And I don't think there's any use
Of them searching for Herman.
They should look for a dog, a human-faced dog.
Auntie, the doors and windows are all locked.
There's nothing to be afraid of now.
Well, who said I was afraid?
I'm not a bit afraid.
No, of course you're not afraid,
But you must get some rest.
Rest in this awful place?
With dog-faced Hermans and human-faced bats
And bloods and murders and vampires!
Find anything, Karl?
There's an unbroken cup over in that window.
If Herman did it, he came through the door.
He must've.
And yet I don't understand how he could find
His way up here without us hearing him.
Yet Emil was asleep, and
I was in the library.
Yes, he could have done it.
The facts all point to it.
What was it, Emil?
The Burgermeister.
He has new for Herr
Brettschneider about Herman.
Huh.
Pardon the intrusion,
Doctor, pardon the intrusion.
I knew Karl was here and
I though you wouldn't mind
If I ran in to tell him the news.
About Herman?
Yes.
He fell into the Devil's
Well in the cave.
KARL: He's dead?
BURGERMEISTER:
Dead as a doornail.
This ends our troubles, Karl!
The vampire's dead!
I can feel it in my bones!
Hmm.
Well your bones may be wrong.
What time did this happen?
BURGERMEISTER: Quite early, about 9 o'clock.
The cave is nearly two hours from here.
That's why we didn't hear it sooner.
Well, it may interest you to know that there's
Been another death, after your vampire died.
Who?
Who?
Dr. Niemann's housekeeper, right here in her own room.
Mother of mercy!
What are we going to do?
But a natural death wouldn't kill a vampire, Karl.
You know the expected theory, a stake driven through the heart.
Oh yes, that's the theory all right.
But... but... but...
But what?
But they did!
They drove a stake through his heart!
Good God, are we living in the Middle Ages?
It wasn't through my sanction, Karl.
Sauer did it.
He told me so himself.
Well, that ends the vampire theory as far as I'm concerned.
Herman Gleib died in the accepted fashion
For killing a vampire.
Oh no, there's some human agency at work here, Doctor, a madman
Who kills to satisfy some violent, sadistic urge!
Yes, you're right, Karl.
I've been a fool, a superstitious fool!
Did they leave his body in the cave?
Yes.
Yes, they did.
Well, in view of what's happened,
Don't you think you owe him a decent burial?
You're right.
In view of what has happened, we do owe him that, Karl.
I'll see to it at once, this very instant.
And I'll make arrangements for Georgiana's removal
To the morgue.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Pardon the intrusion.
Goodnight, Gustav.
BURGERMEISTER:
Pardon the intrusion.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Well.
Here I am, just where
I started weeks ago.
There isn't a single theory that doesn't
Lead straight into a stone wall.
I've jested about this vampire business
Because my better judgment told me it was a lot of nonsense.
Then I reached the point where I was willing to accept
Even that, Because it seemed to satisfy the equation.
All of it a bit superstitious.
I don't know which way to turn, where to look,
What to look for!
Why should anyone want human blood?
Why?
Why?!
Calm yourself, Karl.
Calm myself?
Calm myself?
With all these unsolved murders staring me
In the face and no solution in sight?
How much blood is there in a human body, Doctor?
About six liters, approximately.
Can you think of any purpose for which that amount of blood
Might be used?
No, not even in transfusions.
KARL: That's the point which stops me.
There isn't any other use for human blood.
Gah!
Murderers leave clues!
And these atrocities are murders, Doctor.
Those simple fools in the village
Can believe what they like.
But you and I are sane, thinking people.
And you know and I know,
Doctor, that these are murders!
The last one was done here, in this very house,
Right under this roof.
All right, I'll start here.
I'm going over every foot of this place,
Both inside and out.
Nobody, sane or insane, is clever enough
To get away with murder without leaving a clue of some sort!
And I'm going to find that clue!
Come, come Karl, you musn't let your nerves run away with you.
Here, these.
These will help to give you a good night's sleep.
If there are any clues, they'll be here in the morning
When your nerves are calm and your... your mind is clear.
Take my advice and go home and rest.
I imagined a thousand demons were
After me as I came down those stairs!
Ruth, didn't I tell you to stay in your room?
Yes, but I wanted the doctor to come up and quiet Auntie.
You know, it isn't her imagination this time.
Of course, Ruth.
I'll come right away.
Take my advice, young man.
Go home and go to bed.
Goodnight, Karl.
Goodnight, Ruth.
DR. VON NIEMANN:
Goodnight, Karl.
Goodnight, Doctor.
[CLOCK CHIMING]
If his lights are on, you must wait, Emil.
Wait until he has gone to bed.
Handle him as you did the others, Emil.
You are strong, very strong.
I am waiting for you, waiting for you
To bring him to the laboratory.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
You!
You're the one!
What mad thing are you doing?
Mad?
Is one who has sold the secret of life to be considered mad?
Life!
Created in the laboratory!
No mere crystalline growth, but tissue, living, growing tissue,
Life that moves, pulsates, and demands
Food for its continued growth!
Ha, you shudder in horror.
So did I the first time.
But what are a few lives being weighed in the balance
Against the achievement of biological science?
Think of it.
I have lifted the babe.
I have created life, wrested the secret of life from life!
Now do you understand?
From the lives of those who have gone before,
I have created life!
I'll tell Karl!
You may, for tonight Karl's name will be added to yours,
And all of those who misachieved within mortal lives.
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
I didn't take your sleeping tablets, Doctor.
Emil brought them here.
He's the one who murdered them!
Stay where you are.
You'll have a chance to tell everything, Doctor.
[THUMPING AND STOMPING NOISES]
I'll take care of von Niemann!
Get her out of here!
[GUNSHOT]
[CRASH]
You stay here.
[GUNSHOT]
Von Niemann and Emil.
Doctor!
Dr. von Niemann!
Karl, she mustn't see them.
Where is Dr. von Niemann!
I must see him immediately.
Aunt Gussie, you can't.
He's... he can't be disturbed.
Oh, but I must see him!
I simply must!
That hydrous magnesium sulfate he gave me is, uh,
Affecting me most peculiarly.
You'll pardon me.
Hydrous magnesium sulfate.
Why, that's epsom salt!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
There they are:
Refugees from Anshan, or what used to be Anshan before General Yang rode through it.
And who is
General Yang?
Why, he's the warlord of this province, and a swell guy to do business with.
But why does he want to destroy his own towns?
Oh, because they refuse to pay their taxes.
Well, I should think those people would learn how to obey the law, rather than suffer this.
Ah, these people have no nerves, no feelings.
They're used to suffering.
But they can't get used to paying.
Excuse me, Madam.
You got a match,
Colonel?
No,
I don't smoke.
Colonel.
Refuse me a match, will you?
But I haven't a match.
And those people didn't have the pennies to pay General Yang.
Think it over.
He's cute.
What is his name?
Sam.
How does he keep cool in this hot weather?
Room 26.
Stay there, Sam.
I bring you greetings from Mr. Wu, General Pen.
I'm O'Hara.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara.
You startled me at first.
I didn't expect him to send a foreigner.
Well, he thought I'd have a better chance of getting through.
Mr. Wu is very wise.
With his help, we will rid the province of Yang and his locusts.
Riding through,
I didn't see much left for Yang to plunder.
The bark on trees, perhaps.
And that is why he has made so many short, desperate raids the past months.
His ordinary soldiers are deserting by the dozens for the lack of rice.
His ammunition is so little, it is distributed chiefly among his personal guard.
Dear O'Hara, this is the time we have waited for.
Here is the money.
Mr. Wu gave you instructions?
To the "T."
To which, allow me to add,
I am ashamed to say,
"Be careful."
Not only for the love we bear you, but for the sake of that money, and the guns it will buy.
I'll get through.
It is of my opinion that
General Yang would sacrifice half his personal guard for that belt.
Which is to say, he would give his arms and legs for it.
You don't advise the train from Pengwa?
No.
Wait for the plane in Pengwa.
It will be arranged.
Good.
And even there,
General Yang has special agents.
So be careful and only by plane.
Mr. O'Hara.
From the time you close that door, until the time you deliver that money to Mr. Wu in Shanghai, the fate of the people of this entire province is in your hands.
I'll get through.
Must be a very careful job.
I can do it.
Why all the secrecy?
'Cause the man O'Hara is here in Pengwa.
General Yang says-
I know.
I've done those jobs for him before, all kinds.
General Yang knows he can trust me.
Your shot, Judy.
Your daughter has beautiful form,
Mr. Perrie.
Don't worry about her.
I got it all straight, see, so you don't need to worry.
I'm to get this O'Hara on a train, and then leave the rest to you.
He's got something
General Yang wants, huh?
Yes.
Money for an opposite side with which to buy guns.
For this reason, care must be exercised.
Also for the reason the General himself needs guns badly.
Hmm.
O'Hara by any chance a cock-eyed fellow?
No. American.
Staying at your hotel.
I'll point him out to you later.
Well, you know, it won't be easy to get a man like that on a train when he wants to go by plane.
A beautiful woman does it very easy.
She's high-spirited, don't worry.
Wait for me,
I'll be back.
I'll wait.
Now, Judy.
Judy.
Please, Judy.
No. No. No!
All right.
I'm not luring men to their death on trains, a man I never saw.
Judy.
Open this for me, will you?
What good are these pills?
I don't know.
Someone said they were good.
Who?
Someone.
I can't remember.
I've had so many doctors.
This is no place for us,
China.
Isn't it, Pete?
A man ought to die at home, a Christian death.
L- I've waited months for a chance to make enough to leave.
Now it's possible.
Oh, please don't come back to that again.
If you'll help, it's possible.
Well, maybe it doesn't mean much to you.
You never saw America.
But if I have six months to live-
You want to live it there.
New York. Nyack.
L- I'd get a house on the hill looking over the river.
Oh, it means so much, it does.
L- I want to sit there.
There's boats.
They go up and down the river.
You can't do this to me, Judy.
You're me, my kid.
It's six months, then you're free.
You can do what you want then, but help me now.
Oh, what's the use?
You've been playing me for a sucker for as many years as I'm old.
Will you do it?
Sure.
Sure, I will.
Why not?
Don't feel like that,
Judy.
I don't feel any way at all. I...
Just leave me alone, will you?
Maybe someday there will be a law to abolish the blues.
Something big, like an amendment to the Constitution.
For all of us.
O'Hara is now on the train, from the other side.
Can you beat it?
He's afraid.
Don't blame him.
Goodbye.
He's on.
Any cigarettes?
Be careful,
Judy.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yang's stopping the train at 8:00.
See you after then.
See you tomorrow.
Boo.
He remembers me.
Did you expect me?
What are you doing hiding behind doors?
I live here till tomorrow.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Do you like me,
Judy?
I wish you hadn't come.
Do you?
Like you?
Yes.
It's comfortable.
"Cozy," said the spider to the fly.
Preparations?
Lots of things on the ground don't like me.
For instance?
Well, uh...
There are certain busy Lizzies who scoot around taking potshots.
At you?
Mmm-hmm.
But the train's moving.
Sure, the train's moving, and it's nighttime and we're alone.
And I like the lady and she likes me.
Judy, you've got me by the throat, and I'm telling you, whether it's dopey or not.
Judy.
Don't do that.
No?
You don't want to do that.
That's what you say.
What do you think of that,
Sam?
Come on.
You know, Judy, uh,
I'm not one of the anxious boys.
You're a good guy.
I can wait.
Wanna hear something funny?
I'm crazy for a laugh.
I'm scared. Afraid.
Because of me?
Yes.
Well, I'm a man of infinite patience.
Sure.
You have a whole lifetime ahead.
It was only the mail.
Why are you so jumpy?
I told you, lots of things on the ground don't like me.
Why do they make those attempts on your life?
A certain honorable tootsie roll named Yang thinks he has the right to control the lives of tens of thousands of poor Chinese.
How?
Military dictatorship.
Taxes.
You put, he takes.
You protest, he shoots.
A heartbreaker, a strike breaker, a head breaker.
Altogether a four-star rat.
And what do the poor ones say?
Me. That's where I come in.
They're preparing underground.
They need good guns and ammunition.
You'll sell to them?
And, naturally, your Yang doesn't care for that?
You uttered a profound mouthful, lady.
Why do you risk your life, O'Hara?
What do you get for it?
Money? Fun?
Here's my life in a few lines:
Ran away from an orphan asylum at 14.
Sold newspapers on the street and got pretty good at ducking blows.
A life of opposition, you'd call it.
Then I boxed for a living, you know.
Didn't like smacking other kids around, so I quit.
Dock walloper for a year, road construction, then I joined an aviation outfit.
A bunch of us came over here in '29 to fly planes, and some of the fellows are still flyin' planes and dropping bombs on the same people
I'm working for.
You ask me why I'm for oppressed people?
Because I've got a background of oppression myself, and O'Haras and elephants don't forget.
What's better work for an American than helping fight for democracy? Do you know?
No, I don't.
But do you believe all that?
That's like asking do I believe I'm alive.
I hope to spit, I believe it.
If I believed like that in anything,
I'd do a dance.
Why do you look at me like that?
Can't I look?
Can't I kiss you?
Ask my mother.
Mrs. Perrie, may I kiss your daughter, huh?
Thank you.
What did she say?
She said it's okay.
Very soon, Herr General.
Isn't that marvelous?
They're playing hooky from a padded cell.
Look at him.
You're full of jokes, aren't you?
Why not? I don't meet a good girl in 10 years, and you expect me to be dumb.
So eat your cabbage and don't stick pins in papa.
Dinner and hurry it.
Quiet, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Not very.
You're pretty delicate.
Waiter.
Oh, hello, O'Hara.
Hello.
Who's that?
A Shanghai journalist.
Writes on an
English-speaking paper.
You can buy him for a bag of salt.
How you been?
Fine.
Chiseler.
What's the time?
My watch has stopped.
Ten minutes to 8:00.
Can I tell you something?
Something I can write down in my diary?
Why won't you be serious?
Why? What for?
The Lord made the world in six days, and on the seventh...
Oh-oh. The moles are working underground.
Don't go out there.
Why not?
You're in trouble.
Am I?
They're waiting.
Who is?
I say, do you know what it is?
Cloudburst.
I'm a newspaperman,
General Yang.
With newspapermen, me all the time gentle.
Caught yourself a public enemy, huh?
That's a fact.
Very bad man, et cetera.
Mind if I tell our readers?
No, I don't mind.
Also print my picture?
Sure.
Front page stuff.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nice friends you got.
Don't blame me for this, young man.
I'm a plain passenger on the train.
Sorry what they're doing to you.
Awful, but don't blame me.
Good, I won't have to remember your face.
Come on, Sam.
Greetings.
Breath purifier?
Thanks. I have got a bad taste in my mouth.
What's on your mind,
Yang?
General Yang.
General Yang, Sam.
Very sweet.
Aw!
Sad.
Mr. O'Hara, you are a big bother on me.
Looks pretty black for you from where I sit, Yang.
Real opposition begins.
The old days are through.
For my money, sweetheart, you're sitting on a porcupine.
Mr. Buddha.
That's a fact.
That's the only way they ever leave me.
They do shameful thing, lose face, then kill self.
Someday even they'll get wise, your fanatics, and cut you down like the rice is reaped.
Huh!
My guards faithful.
Stay with General Yang until each one himself becomes General, and I biggest General of all 12 provinces.
Yang Incorporated, merchants of war with 12 dummy partners, huh?
I don't like you to interfere.
Why you help my enemy, hmm?
I'd do anything I could to give you a kick in the pants.
To my jaundiced eye, you're a social disease.
I don't like your disposition,
I don't like your friends,
I don't like your politics, and I don't like your hat.
Your faithful dozen may stick to you, but you're still a small noise at the end of a parade.
Mr. O'Hara seems so little interested in his life.
You'd take chances, too.
I have a great destiny.
So have I, but mine is tied up with millions of people.
Yours is tied up with yourself, and the power of machine guns.
Your belief is in your own very limited self.
Mine is in people.
One day, they will all walk on earth, straight, proud.
Men, not animals, with no fear of hunger or poverty.
That's not so bad to die for, sweetheart.
The time has come when even, even peasants dare to laugh in the face of officer and General.
Pal, my nose bleeds for you.
Give me the money.
Couldn't Wong find it?
He's saying no money in your place.
Cough up, Sam.
Give me the money.
The eight characters of destiny are against you.
No money tonight.
Eight characters say you are a liar.
Come and get it.
Fight?
Give me.
All right.
This is the money.
You don't have to worry an iota.
I'll take it right to him.
Uh, Brighton.
That's his name?
Yes,
Brighton.
He is waiting at the Mansion House,
Shanghai.
And
B- R-l-G-H-T-O-N.
Now I got it all in my head, every word of it.
No mistake?
Oh!
General Yang never forgets mistakes.
Say, am I honest or am I not?
After all,
I...
I keep Mr. O'Hara for now.
Maybe his Shanghai friends make trouble, et cetera, maybe.
You're a running dog.
Thanks.
Very good man.
Teaches my men discipline and how to make war.
We will float down the river to Shanghai together, me and O'Hara.
Pick up ammunition also together.
Two days from now, we arrive.
If Mr. O'Hara's friends make trouble, if I don't get ammunition,
Mr. O'Hara don't arrive.
No hummingbird can fight 15 wolves,
Mr. O'Hara.
Now, was that so terrible as you thought?
The Mansion House.
Mr. Brighton.
Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
I'm Mr. Brighton.
Thank you.
No news?
No.
I am very worried.
Something is very wrong.
Drink hearty, my friend.
Oh, no, you don't.
You can't get away with that.
I won't even drink this drink.
You're trying to get me drunk, so I'll wait here for your man O'Hara.
But I won't.
Now, look here, Woozy.
Don't you know
I can't lay around this harbor with that load of guns?
Any minute, the gitchie-witchies are liable to hop on us and we're sunk.
What do you think
I'm doin'?
Waitin' till the kids get out of school to sell them lollipops and pretzels?
No, it's munitions.
It's illegal.
Plenty guns.
Plenty bullets.
Plenty noise.
And you, none of your philosophical remarks.
Get me, Chennie?
Is he comin' or not?
No philosophy.
Have a drink, my friend.
Oh! Take the wax out of your ears.
Don't you hear me?
You can't get me tight.
Mr. Brighton, it is no such intention in my mind.
But we are expecting an information from Mr. O'Hara this morning.
What was in that wire you got?
Oh! Smart, very smart.
Well, you get six more hours and then I sell to the first comer.
That's what was in that wire.
Get me?
Got you.
You forget the glass.
Oh.
I'll be under that moose head and a stuffier piece of stuffin' I've never seen.
"I'll be glad when you're dead"
"You rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead"
"you rascal you"
Detestable man.
Who is it?
Don't know.
Thank you.
Pete.
What?
Where are you going?
I'll be back.
Where are you going?
Down to the bar... for a tonic.
No more bets on the ponies?
Now, Judy, have I got money for bets?
I don't know.
Have you?
I surely don't understand your attitude.
Pick up that shipment for Yang, first thing.
Of course. Of course.
Of course. Why, of course.
Well, I must say, what a funny world where a man's own daughter don't trust him. I must say.
No one mistrusts you, Pete, but I just happen to be worried about that O'Hara boy.
So please be careful.
Sure.
Oh, you dog.
Oh, you dog, you.
What are you looking at, banjo eyes?
He drink for three days now.
Who is he?
Name Mr. Brighton.
Oh! Mr. Brighton?
Yeah.
Waiting for somebody.
He got plenty money.
Say he go to hard-knock university.
Every morning, he eats two double lamb chops.
Also has two sisters live in Washington, D.C.
His favorite song:
"I'll be glad when you die, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad"
"When you're dead, you rascal you"
See?
I found this sign on the floor, Mademoiselle.
Thank you.
My foot.
I am Wu, Mademoiselle.
And?
I bring to Mademoiselle the greetings of the house.
A custom here.
Good brandy?
Yes.
Our four-star is better.
Brandied duck is with us a house specialty.
I never eat brandied duck.
Very friendly on the stomach.
Like our small creature here.
You have him long?
Two years.
Call him.
What?
Mademoiselle, call the animal to you.
What for?
Call him.
Maybe if you call him with name.
Maybe if you say to him,
"Sam."
What do you want?
Where is O'Hara?
Who is O'Hara?
Mademoiselle, you are indelicate.
You do not know him, nor the creature here?
Your Mr. O'Hara was taken off a train last night.
General Yang do it?
Yes.
What else?
I don't know what else.
What do you mean?
You don't know more?
No.
The animal was left behind.
You're sure nothing more? Please.
Why should I lie?
Mademoiselle has already lied once.
Who in the world are you to demand the truth?
A great friend of O'Hara.
And what's that got to do with me?
Shanghai is filled with dangerous persons,
Mademoiselle.
Be careful.
Of what? Do you-
You will be watched.
You like to fish?
It bores me.
Why are you so very much interested in my country, my, uh, people?
How many times before you buy guns for people of my province?
Maybe I fix you so you really don't talk.
Interesting idea, no?
Yang, that money was the bitterly earned personal property of 500,000 oppressed people who want your heel off their collective neck.
They trusted me with it, and I failed.
If I live to ever look them in the face, it will be with far greater difficulty than facing you.
Do I make myself clear?
No.
I'm saying, bring on your fires and your devils.
You've already done all you can to me, or I've done it myself.
Mr. O'Hara has so little regard for his life.
He sounds, sounds almost like Chinese.
That makes me a candidate for your guard, don't it?
No. You are too much interested in women.
That's a fact.
You eat fresh fish tonight.
Thanks.
When we arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, maybe fresh fish eat you.
Hmm, thanks.
When does she sail?
Midnight tomorrow.
I'd like to book two bedrooms and a sitting room.
Two bedrooms and-
It's for me and my daughter.
Oh, yes, Mr...
Uh, Martin. Martin.
Mr. Martin.
Peter Martin.
Peter Martin.
I'll pay you now, cash.
How much is it?
Was the name Martin, did you say?
Yes, Martin,
Peter Martin.
Midnight tomorrow,
Mr. Martin.
Seems everybody in these parts have two names.
Have they?
That one is either a thief or a liar.
Really?
He gave a fake name.
I've seen it by the initials on his wallet.
How are you on pears?
24 hours more, and still no news.
I shall lose my mind waiting.
The boy must be dead.
Has the girl made any moves?
In 24 hours, nothing suspicious.
"I'll be glad"
"When you're dead, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
Believe me,
Mr. Chen, it's lucky if more complications do not set in.
Oh, where are you coming from?
Down the bar, having a drink.
Down the bar? Why?
What's the matter?
Headache.
Oh.
You've been looking awfully worried these last 24 hours.
Well, knock on wood, huh.
Everything's shipshape.
We'll be out of here by midnight.
We're on our way, huh?
What's that for?
Shh.
Who's that?
I don't know.
A fat man.
How did he get here?
He sneaked in, looked through your bags.
Better open up, brother. Who are you?
I was inside when he came.
He didn't see me.
I can make an awful racket, maybe break down the door.
You wouldn't like that disturbance, would you?
Better call the police, Pete.
No, no!
Open up.
Judy, don't get excited.
Judy?
What's the matter?
Nothing, nothing.
We don't know who he is and-
Where's your gun?
In my bag.
Stand back.
Come out of there.
Put down your popgun.
Who are you?
I'm the angle man.
W- what?
When you're in trouble,
I work out the angles.
We'll find an angle,
Brother Perrie, and, uh, Miss Perrie,
I might add.
And what's all that supposed to mean?
Well, from the General to the specific, you're on a very interesting project.
No one here knows what you're talking about.
Now you get out.
We'll have the police on you in 10 seconds.
Get out.
Now, I'm not the smartest man in the world, brother, but I'm not the dumbest.
You send for the police.
Yes, you do that little thing.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Judy, this man's a big imposter of some sort, a- a faker...
He's gonna share some money with me.
What money?
That's what
I came to find out.
Oh, come on, get out of here.
You admit you don't know what you're talking about.
But your father, he knows.
Just look at him.
He needs a friend.
A bird's-eye-view man like me that knows the town, all the back alleys.
Get out!
You have it in your power to stop me from leaving,
Brother Perrie.
Pete?
One final word,
Brother Perrie.
If you were thinking of escaping with a large sum of money, and you know you are, it'd be absolutely fatal not to insure yourself with a man like me.
Oh, excuse me,
I forgot to introduce myself.
The name is Leach.
And I want one-third of it.
I shall be downstairs in the bar.
And I shan't consider it an imposition if you should call on me when you need me.
Judy-
I don't want one trembling word out of you, not one.
All I want to know is what you're doing with those Yang funds?
Shh.
Don't duck, Pete, answer my question.
You can't frighten me.
I won't give it up. Not a cent.
You'll have to. I'm not gonna let the O'Hara boy get killed.
I don't care if he does. Here are the tickets.
We're going to the States.
You mean you are.
I'll get there.
In a coffin.
Judy, help me, please.
Not this year.
Judy, don't you see, it's for you.
I can't use all this money-
Oh, stop that.
Think about buying what you want-
Are you picking up that shipment or not?
Are you?
No.
What are you going to do?
Get out of my way.
You won't tell anyone?
Won't I?
No. Because that would be patricide.
Killing your own father.
You couldn't do it, Judy.
But you're murdering O'Hara.
You can do that.
It doesn't mean the slightest, dumbest thing to you that I haven't slept for two nights because of him.
Oh, it's nice to talk about "patricide" and "poor father," but that
I'm crazy about the boy doesn't make you wink an eye.
Do you care about him or me?
Do you care about me a nickel's worth?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Will you tell him?
I might.
You wouldn't dare.
Maybe you're wrong.
Or right.
If I were the heroine of a novel,
I'd know what to do.
Pull a plane out of one sleeve, a fat checkbook out of the other, get the Marines, and put the situation well in hand.
But this is a simple girl, my lovey-dovey Pete, one of the nameless legion that always gets stuck.
Yes, your black-hearted daughter is up a dead-end street.
Useless, dumb.
But if you laugh at him or me, I'll
I'll have your life.
Take it with my own hands.
The General say you go.
Do you want to die?
Show me how to get out of here.
Ah.
Mademoiselle plays a very nice game.
May I join you, Mademoiselle?
Certainly.
Come along.
I regret,
Mademoiselle.
Really, really?
What is it?
I feel like a bag of broken glass.
Chen.
It's not serious.
I will do it myself.
Get some hot water, some iodine, some bandages.
His clothes are in my rooms.
Well, you may as well start from the beginning.
What happened?
And that's the story in a nutshell.
I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara, for everyone.
We can never trust you again.
I don't expect it.
You were lonely, huh?
Yeah, if you want to put it that way.
In our cause, my friend, there must be a minimum of loneliness and a maximum of care.
Well, what next?
Next is to find the girl.
I'll find her and give her the works.
What is the good, to give the works?
She knows who
Yang's agent is.
Mmm-hmm. Well.
I'll grab her and make her cough up.
We'll have to work fast.
Yang won't waste a minute now he's here.
One thing is in our favor.
Yang's agent has not yet contacted Mr. Brighton.
No?
No.
He has private plans, it seems.
No, he...
It's that dame.
Huh? Well, maybe you're right.
There was some guy, some little guy.
Shanghai's a big town.
I don't know where to start looking for her or him.
I suppose you'll kill her if you see her or him.
In half.
Huh.
Mr. Chen?
I think maybe we will soon have that money again.
Hey.
What are you trying to pull?
O'Hara's here.
Calm yourself, calm yourself, my friend.
I think maybe we soon fix everything.
Lay down, Sam.
I know it's not my right to say it, but I'm glad you're alive.
Save your breath because anything you say goes in one ear and out the other.
What are you going to do?
You make the recommendation, you're so talented.
You started to beat me up.
You might continue where you left off.
I might kill you, that's a possibility.
Yes, it is.
First,
I want some information.
Answer precisely and to the point.
Who employed you? Yang?
Yes.
When they took the belt off me, they gave it to a man.
Who was he?
L- I don't know.
A little fellow with a gray face, sick-looking. I don't know.
Don't waste my time,
I'm warning you.
I'll tell you whatever I can.
And don't give me that whiskbroom stuff.
Brushing me off.
Is it necessary to shout?
Where's the dough?
Listen, lady, you can be broken in little pieces.
Little pieces, very easy.
What's funny?
You think I care, but I don't.
That's what's so funny,
Mr. O'Hara.
I could kill myself for almost next to nothing.
Try carbon monoxide.
They say it's pretty good.
O'Hara, O'Hara, you're such a fool.
Sit down.
And this is the girl I loved with vitamins A, B, and C.
Why are you so hard like that?
Where's the money?
I wouldn't tell you if I knew.
You can't intimidate me.
This is Shanghai, a public hotel.
You were doing illegal work, running guns. You fell.
You were so busy giving me a rah-rah talk, you couldn't see before your nose.
You want to speak to me, speak as a person or not at all.
Not at all is good enough for me.
There's no money here.
I didn't ask you.
The pig they made this out of was luckier than you're gonna be before I get through.
You gotta listen to me.
I want the cash.
I had nothing to do with it.
You didn't get me on the train?
Against my will.
Let me explain.
I know. You're working a brother through school.
Please, if-
Or an old, sick father needs care.
Let me tell you, dreamboat, don't think
I fell for you.
A tree with a flower on.
I'd have fallen for that, the way I felt.
A fish on a dish would have gotten me.
You don't have to justify yourself.
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
I'm sorry you won't listen.
You're licked.
The money isn't here,
Mr. O'Hara.
Your gun won't help, and your brawn won't help.
And your big mouth won't help.
When I'm finished here, we'll talk about places where it might be.
Unless Yang gets here before we're clear.
He's at anchor, three miles out, personally.
He is?
I speak good English.
O'Hara, the money isn't there.
Where is it?
Is Yang here?
Where do you suppose
I came from, the sky?
Are you being tricky?
You heard Yang say he'd pick up the shipment himself.
Suppose you got that money, most of it, what would you do?
Would you let the person go who had the money?
Maybe.
And give him a bonus?
This is no bargain counter.
It is for you.
I'd have to ask.
Who?
Wu.
Then do it.
A $1,000 or $2,000 bonus.
You mean it?
I mean it.
Who's in there?
Where?
Behind that door.
I don't know.
But if I were behind it,
I'd keep it locked.
Don't you come in here.
Pete!
Stay out, now.
Wait!
Stay out, I tell you!
Who is he?
My father.
He's dead.
Get your hand fixed.
I'm sorry.
He's Yang's agent.
I'll have to get my belt.
You'll get your money.
I'll get it now.
Get out.
Please get out.
I'm sorry.
What must I do to ask you to leave me alone with this tired old man?
Do you want me to call the police?
No, even if you could.
Do you want me to scream and be heard?
I must get my belt.
Try your room.
I'm not sorry for him.
He took a job.
He knew what it involved.
I'm sorry you had to get into this mess.
I said it before.
You can't do this kind of work and die in bed.
It was my life or his.
It's got me nuts, too.
I like people too much to shoot, but it's a dark year and a hard night.
Come on.
I'll have to take whatever he's carrying.
Don't make me go in that room.
All right.
You stay here and have your sorrow out alone.
Hello.
Looks like you, uh, murdered a man, brother.
Miss Perrie, take his gun from him.
Miss Perrie, take his gun.
All right.
Now throw it on the bed.
That's right.
Now, may I recommend care,
Mr. O'Hara?
Look before you leap.
And you, too,
Miss Perrie.
I may be fat, but I'm agile.
Now may I recommend our next move?
Evidently, you may.
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.
The money isn't on our dear dead brother.
Now, every impulse of my carnal nature says to stay here and continue the search.
But every impulse of my intellectual nature says to move the luggage and all out of the approaching
Yang's wrath.
Am I, uh, understood?
Well, do it.
Oh, no, no, no.
You do it.
Mr. Wu. Call him.
Hello.
Ask Mr. Wu to come up.
Take a seat.
And you, too.
Not so good.
Better luck next time.
Don't try it again.
Now, sit down where you were.
Don't move.
Fatso was sucking around for a little nectar.
No time to waste.
Did you find anything?
The girl knows where it is.
Who is he?
Her father.
You kill him?
Yeah.
Watch him.
Bring the body here.
Fats will help.
Now, you stay here with Miss Perrie.
And you come with me, my freelance friend.
But perfect, positive quiet.
You hear me,
Fats?
I hear.
I will come back.
I was holding the fort,
General, but they nailed me down.
Yes? Who are you?
I heard they was going to rob you, so l-
Very nice.
Find Mr. Brighton.
Bring him here.
Gentle.
O'Hara!
He's got another one there.
Where is
Mr. Perrie?
Miss Perrie, where is Mr. Perrie?
Dead. Killed.
In there.
Man who killed Perrie, take money.
Give me.
Don't talk? Nobody?
I leave my men here to search, and we, all good friends, go on my boat.
Maybe then somebody talk what this is all about.
Take baggage, too.
It looks like
I'm the original boy that took the watch apart and couldn't put it together again.
He don't shake hands no more.
Example of what sometimes happens.
My man Wong here, uh, uh...
Expert.
Yes.
Very expert.
Can make painfulness many, many ways.
See?
Big chop, little chop.
And person die very slow.
Your friend Mr. Chen die too fast.
So you don't forget?
Hmm?
Now, which dog hide bone?
Miss Perrie, perhaps.
Now you tell me where is the hiding place?
I don't know,
General Yang.
That's the plain honest truth.
My man Wong, expert.
Expert.
She told you 50 times, she don't- Shh.
Shush your Aunt Susie.
The water around here is jammed with gunboats.
And you'll have one on your tail any minute.
Optimist.
Yes.
Optimist, O'Hara.
Got fog. Got night.
But there will be a day.
Oh, plenty day, but you'll never see it.
You, you, and you, you all die because destiny don't fail me.
I looted 12 cities, killed many thousands, make great commerce:
Silk, rice, and opium.
Got big, great friends.
I am Yang.
Would somebody please be good enough to hide
Mr. Chen's face?
Let's put him up there.
Well?
Do you want me to tell Yang, or will you?
Tell him what?
Where the money is.
Do you know?
Lady, this is no time for games.
But I don't know and that's the blank, flat, honest truth.
Didn't you tell me in your room at the hotel you'd make a deal?
Didn't you tell me that...
You certainly knew where it was then.
I thought my father had it on him.
That's the truth?
That's the truth, and may I be permitted to exercise the prerogative of the outsider?
Now, may l-
May I make a suggestion before he wakes up?
Sure, but if you're gonna suggest chocolate,
I prefer vanilla.
This is how
I see it.
A girl is good for nothing, and she knows it.
The only bright spot in her life she can remember is when she once won a prize in school.
That's all right because it only involves the girl's life.
But then she begins to get good people in trouble, perfect strangers, like you're in trouble now, and Mr. Wu.
It sounds like the speech that got you that prize.
Well, I don't care.
Even if
I got off this boat,
I don't know where
I'd go or what I'd do.
I've got a good, solid chunk of anguish in me as it is.
Why don't I tell Yang
I know where the money is and that I'll tell if he lets you off the boat, and Mr. Wu.
You would do that?
Why not?
It won't cost me anything, as the saying goes.
Except your delicate little life.
Who's that a loss to?
Me, myself, and I?
Don't be a fool.
Don't you be a fool.
Let her do it, O'Hara.
Do you want this girl to kill herself?
She got us here, didn't she?
You think Yang will fall for that stuff?
He might.
Otherwise, it's finished.
I'll call him.
O'Hara!
This young lady is about to present a lie to Your Excellency.
She's going to tell you she knows where the money is and reveal its hiding place if you will release her comrades.
You make decide?
Yes, and it's no lie.
But you'll have to release
Mr. Wu and O'Hara before I tell you.
I don't care what you do with him.
You make bargain?
Yes.
I don't take a chance.
If Miss Perrie knows, we'll find out quick.
We'll take Miss Perrie deeper in the ship.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara like her.
Very sad.
Too bad he never kiss her.
Yes. Too bad.
Maybe now make kissing before Miss Perrie go because maybe he don't like her when she comes back.
Can I tell you something?
Sure.
Maybe we're through here and because we're through,
I want to ask you something.
Ask or tell?
Ask first, then tell.
Why did you pick me up in Pengwa?
You needed the dough?
My father, he wanted to get out of the country.
Honest?
Yes.
I would have helped you before now, if I could.
Why?
Look, Judy, life at its best isn't much of a bargain.
Someday it may be different, not now.
It's a series of dumb accidents.
Now you're a great guy, you scratch your finger, blood poisoning.
What are you trying to say?
Look, you kicked out one of my lungs on the train.
You were properly sore.
All over.
I don't feel like that now.
I'm trying to say you're wonderful.
That makes me a sap,
I know, but it doesn't make any difference one way or the other now.
You know I'm wonderful, too.
You are.
Judy Perrie, darling, we could have made wonderful music together.
We could have worked and made ourselves a circle of light and warmth.
O'Hara,
I am so lonely for you.
Hey.
Where's my whisky,
Rastus?
Oh, dummies, huh?
Oh, I see.
I asked you for a drink, and that's your answer.
Tough guy, huh?
Make me a prisoner, will you?
Ah! Go away.
What are you doing?
Yeah, put that tomahawk away.
Where's my whisky?
The Herr General sends his regrets, we have no whisky aboard.
Ah, what kind of house is this?
Ain't got nothing to drink.
There must be whisky in those bags.
Hey, what goes on here,
Sambo? What is this?
What did you say?
Do you see this?
Well, now you don't.
What's in these?
When I want something,
I want it when I want it.
Well, that's fine.
Why didn't
I think of that before?
Well, well, well.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Sit down.
That's American money, and no Chinese can-
Sit down, please.
All right, I heard you,
I heard you.
All right.
There's more here in the bag.
Get out of my way.
So the drunk fool found the bone.
Everybody please come outside on deck.
What's happened?
General Yang wishes to converse with you.
He's got our telephone number.
Do so immediately!
He's stabbed.
If he isn't dead in 20 minutes, it will be a miracle.
He's our only chance.
Yang?
This is something
I never expected to see.
Who chopped you?
Miss Perrie knows all the time where money is.
We found it in her father's bag.
He hide good.
Now, I must kill all of you.
But the General promised if he found the money, we should go free.
Huh.
Am I free?
Slowly here, my life fall out, fall out in my hand.
You make me so much trouble, you die one by one.
Yang, I asked you who chopped you up, and you didn't answer me.
Don't argue with him, Wu, because he's sore at the world, and who blames him?
It's easy to see that his own guards betrayed him, knifed him.
Huh! What a laugh that will be.
Boys and girls will dance in the streets when they hear how the great Yang was killed by his own men.
Lie, lie. You hear me? Lie!
Drunk fool Brighton make accident.
Tell it to Sweeney.
Even if it were true, where was your guard when it happened?
Where were your tootsie boys who were supposed to give up their lives for you?
My men are faithful.
How do you know?
My men die for me, okay.
They're alive and kicking, while your singing days are over.
When you die here, they'll feed you to the sharks.
Then they'll go where another General will give them rice and put silver in their pockets.
They will not return.
What's to stop them?
They will be dead.
Who will kill them?
They lose face.
They shoot each other.
At whose command?
My command.
You must think we're out of a nuthouse to believe a story like that.
They have sons and wives.
You see answer.
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, he understand Chinese.
"Men, do not forget this happening," he says.
"In the temples of Peiping
"and in the sing-song houses of Canton they will laugh at Yang and his guards", he says.
"Only if they are not afraid
"to ascend to the Dragon with him, can they hope to wipe out this shame", he says.
They are agreeing to die with him.
My men faithful.
That's the most marvelous thing
I ever saw in my life.
Excellency, you are to be commended upon the integrity of your guard.
But, uh, might I make a little suggestion?
What about giving the order for my release?
White flesh dies.
Also Mr. Wu.
One by one.
Oh yes, yes, I know, I know.
And very just, too.
They deserve it.
But what about me?
You know, just me?
Thank you, Excellency.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry, but you understand.
You know, self-preservation.
Go.
But, Excellency, you misconstrue me.
Go.
Excellency, you misconstrue me.
Excellency!
Excellency.
Shut up.
General Yang,
I'm thinking of you.
Yes.
You're a brave, great man, and so are your guards, but who will know it if they die with you?
Who's left to tell the story?
Excellency, let me go, let me go!
Yang, what will your enemies say?
They'll say river pirates assaulted you, or Nanking surprised you in the night.
Your enemies will never know the glorious death that was yours and your men's.
What did he say, O'Hara?
What did he say?
Yang, listen to me.
Such great honor should not live in a closet.
It needs the open air and daylight.
Your enemies must not laugh at the memory of General Yang.
Coolies must not laugh.
Peasants, old men, women must not spit on your name.
You can't do this to me.
I won't die.
Someone must be left,
Yang.
Someone who has seen this last, glorious page in the history of General Yang's life.
Yang, listen to me, before you fall asleep.
Yang, before you fall asleep.
O'Hara, O'Hara!
They'll find out the truth.
How? If you stop all our mouths, who will be left to speak tenderly of Yang?
No one, I tell you, no one!
O'Hara!
You'll tell the story, O'Hara?
Yes, I will tell it. Yes.
Of your greatness and the obedience of your men.
Gentlemen in clubs will hear it.
Crowds at the dog races will talk of your guards.
Shanghai diplomats will know it.
Gunboat captains will tell it by radio.
O'Hara, O'Hara!
Every great paper in the world must tell how Yang's guard went to death with him.
The London Times,
The New York Times.
You think we'll get pictures in the papers?
Everywhere.
Because these are not things that happen every day.
You want I let you go?
Let us go.
Us?
All of us, to see no stain or blemish is left on the memory of Yang.
Will it be worth it?
Don't lie?
I swear, this is one true thing.
That's a fact?
Yes. Yang, before you fall asleep.
Yes, yes, help, help.
Oxford.
You will see.
I am a big man.
He was a talented man, but very, very corrupt.
[ Door knocks ]
Madame Honori.
- Bonsoir, Gecko.
Madame.
Monsieur?
Monsieur?
Monsieur is composing.
Oh.
Composing.
You will wait?
Svengali.
Ah, Madame .. je suis enchantée.
Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you.
I'm early?
On the contrary. You are just in time.
I could hardly wait for this evening.
My days are so empty.
Yah, liebchen, I know just how you feel.
I am empty, too.
How can you be?
You have so many other pupils.
- Yah, naturally.
But no-one ..
Who responds like you.
Yes.
Now.
What did we do last?
Don't you remember?
I am speaking about music.
Ah .. here.
Yah.
There .. now remember.

Never mind.
- What's the matter?
Nothing, darling. It is beautiful.
But .. such a delicate instrument must not be strained.
Come, now we rest.
We rest.
Now .. you are comfortable there?
Yes.
Because ..
There is a little something
I must tell you.
I have something to tell you.
I've left my husband.
Huh?
I've left him .. for good.
And ..
How much has he left you?
Do you think I would take money from such a brute?
I threw it in his face.
He gave you money?
And you threw it back at him?
But he ..
He bit me on the wrist and ..
And kicked me.
Oh.
You have no idea what I've been through.
And you left your husband ..
Without a settlement?
I've come to you just as I am.
With no settlement at all?
Nothing?
Nothing.
Except me.
Ah ..
Svengali .. you ..
You don't want me?
But.
But you promised?
My voice.
It's yours now.
It will make us both famous.
As you told me so often.
But I've no other place to go.
There is only you left.
I worship you, Svengali.
I'll even die for you.
Don't look at me like that, Svengali.
Don't look at me like that.
Take your eyes off me, Svengali.
Take your eyes off me!
Don't look at me like that!
Madame Honori.
What about her?
They have found her .. in the river.
Oh, that is not possible.
In this weather.
But it is true, Maestro.
I just saw her body in the morgue.
In the morgue?
- Yes, Maestro.
Ahh .. tsk, tsk.
That is a pity.
She was very, very sweet.
But a bad businesswoman.
Maestro.
I am worried about something.
What do you mean?
Do you mind if I tell you?
No. What?
How are we going to pay the rent?
You promised by noon.
Yeah, yeah.
Noon is a long way off.
In the meantime, my dear Gecko.
I am very hungry.
I presume you are, too.
Get me my coat.
We will go visiting.
Maestro, I don't know what we're going to do.
We have borrowed from everyone we know.
We cannot go back to Vinard's.
They will throw us out.
Oh, possibly, possibly.
But there are other people.
Our English friends.
They have not enjoyed the fragrance of our society.
For a week.
We will go there. Yes.
But Maestro, the last time we were there.
Monsieur Taffy, and Monsieur the
Laird, and even the little Billee.
They were so kind.
- Now listen. Gecko.
You know the trouble with you is you have not sufficient optimism.
You let little things discourage you.
Remember.
In the bright lexicon of youth.
There is no such word ..
As "failure".
Come on.
These Englanders get dirty very quickly.
Thank you, Maestro.
- Don't mention it.
[ Piano music ]
Taffy .. who is that?
It sounds like Svengali.
Here, Taffy.
Hide my purse.
Before his music melts my Scottish heart.
Ha!
I don't want to lie to him, but if I have any money on me I can't resist him.
[ Piano music: National Anthem ]
[ National Anthem ]
Stop it, man. I'm shivering here.
Well, my patriotic friend.
Are you up yet?
Yeah, I'm up and I want to be done with you, you phony scavenger.
Oh, is it my fault ..
That you Englanders have to take a bath every morning?
How long is it since you took one?
Huh?
Not since I tripped and fell in the sewer.
We've put you in the tub, you've got to make a good job of it.
You stay there now.
We'll see that he can't get out.
Hey .. and don't walk around here in the nude.
Sometimes we have respectable callers.
God strafe England.
Are you there, Billee?
Billee, we've news for you.
Aye, it's the wonder of the world.
- Svengali is taking a bath.
Svengali is taking a bath?
And, he didn't do it because he wanted to do it.
He did it because we pushed him in it.
- He can't get out.
These are his clothes.
I know. I've got an idea.
Go to Carrel's School and bring the whole crowd over to see him.
It's too good to miss.
By golly, that's a good idea.
We'll do it. Come on, hurry.
Bonjour, Gecko.
Maestro.
It is Monsieur Taffy's Sunday suit.
- Yah.
But it is very becoming on weekdays.
But Monsieur Taffy?
My dear Gecko, I have a pleasant surprise for you.
Monsieur Taffy is a very large-hearted man.
Yah. He has been unusually generous.
Look .. hah ..
The rent for Madame Vinard.
Breakfast .. dinner .. supper.
And the rest?
We will spend foolishly.
Remember what I told you, Gecko.
In the bright lexicon of youth.
There is no such word as ..
Milk .. below!
Milk below?
You know it would be a pity.
To let such hospitable friends starve, huh?
Get the milk pitcher, Gecko.
- But we must hurry.
May I come in?
Are Monsieur Taffy?
No.
The Laird, then?
- No.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Me? I'm a model.
I work for Durien upstairs.
He sent me down for Monsieur
Taffy and The Laird to look at.
A model, huh?
For a moment, I thought you were a Gendarme.
Oh, I pose in this.
Yah, yah.
Gecko, wait outside.
- But, Maestro ..
So we will not miss our friends.
But ..
Do you need a model?
All the artists say I have a very classic figure.
Durien, Mallot ..
- My dear young lady, I don't doubt it.
As far as I can see.
- Shall I show you?
Well ..
Well, I would be glad to.
Perhaps you can use me sometime?
Well .. that's what I had in mind.
Well, where shall I change?
Oh, in there?
Why, that is as good a place as any.
Very well. I'll be right out.
- I can hardly wait.
They are coming, Maestro.
- Who?
The Laird and Taffy.
They are across the street.
You always arrive just in time.
But there is a mob coming here that will make a fool of you.
Just as I am about to enjoy myself artistically.
There is that face.
Oh Maestro, come please. Off we go.
Shush.
[ Trilby singing badly ]
[ Trilby singing badly ]
Terrible.
People with voices like that should not sing.
You fool. That shows you know nothing.
The roof of her mouth ..
Must be like the dome of a Cathedral.
To push out sounds like that.
Come, Maestro. Come with me.
Come quick, Maestro.
Wunderbâr.
Did you hear the volume, Gecko?
- It doesn't matter.
To you, a rough diamond is like a piece of coal.
I've got to find out about that woman. I've got to find out.
It seems the joke is on me.
Aye .. and your new suit is on him.
You should have had the
Scotch forethought I had.
And hid your suit like I hid my purse.
By the way, where did you hide my purse?
I put it safely away.
In the pocket of those trousers.
Hello.
Hello.
Where is the fire?
It's not exactly a fire.
I was looking for Svengali.
- Svengali?
Yes.
He was here taking a bath.
Oh, I'm sorry. I ..
- Well, that's alright.
But there's been no-one taking a bath while I've been here.
No?
He's a tall creature.
Polish or something.
Oh ..
So, that's Svengali. Well ..
I've been looking for that artist myself.
Artist?
Oh, he's not an artist. That is, not in the sense of a painter.
He's a singing teacher and a pianist.
My .. well that's one on me.
I'll get even with that fellow.
- Why?
Oh, it's nothing. I'll see him again. He lives here.
Oh no he doesn't. Nobody lives here but Taffy and The Laird.
I just come in the studio to paint.
Here is Billee. Slaving away at his art.
Overwork will be his ruin yet.
Look out!
- Don't, don't ..
These are the gentlemen you came to meet, Miss ..?
Trilby O'Farrell.
Miss O'Farrell, let me present:
Taffy and The Laird.
Now you've met the three musketeers of the brush.
Hello.
Durien sent her down.
- Oh, you sit for him?
Oh, yes. Modelling is my business.
Head. Hands. Feet.
Everything. Especially feet.
Isn't that a pretty foot?
- It is that. It's very pretty indeed.
It is, isn't it. Everyone says it's the most beautiful foot in Paris.
It's very pretty.
- There's only one that can match it.
Aha.
- And where's that?
[ Durien: ]
Mademoiselle Trilby!
What time is it?
- Oh, it's about quarter past ten.
Trilby!
Yes, up there!
Trilby, please come now.
Yes, Mr Durien. I'll be right up.
Well, there you are. Work, work, work.
But what's the difference?
So long as you're happy.
Goodbye to you all.
You're coming back?
Of course.
There are several reasons why I must come back.
What are they?
Well, first of all.
This place looks like a pig-pen and needs a feminine touch.
Eh? A pig-pen?
- Oh, keep quiet.
What's the real one?
This place looks like a pig-pen and needs a feminine touch.
That girl has a wee bit of
Scotch in her, I bet you.
I think she has a wee bit of the devil in her.
I think you're right.
I think she's lovely.
No you don't. You don't now, Billee.
You're just fooling when you say that.
- He doesn't really mean that.
Yes, I do.
She's lovely.
But all fooling aside.
And she did have a foot like an angel.
Aye .. she had that.
Do you realize the light's going and you haven't worked on your canvas all day?
I know.
I don't believe you've tested for a week.
No. And I don't intend to until you give me your answer.
You mean to tell me you'd leave me out there with that cold canvas unfinished?
For ever?
For ever and ever.
Until you give me your answer.
Well.
I suppose I must answer some time.
In the interest of art.
Trilby! But I saw it.
You do love me?
You do mean it?
Don't you know?
Haven't I been telling you for weeks?
Bonsoir, mes amis.
Is anybody here?
Everybody is out.
Ah.
There seems to be the odour of baking in the air.
Good?
- Delicious.
As good as mother makes.
- Oh, I can't be as good as all that.
Oh yes you are.
You're wonderful.
You're the sweetest thing I've ever known.
When we're married .. I want to take you to England, and to my mother.
She'll be proud of you, Trilby.
Proud of you as I am.
Tell me, what is England like?
Oh, England is beautiful.
Green fields and .. hedgerows and ..
Hollyhocks and primroses ..
And fog.
And pneumonia.
And shopkeepers.
And flat feet.
And boiled beef and cabbage.
Ha-ha-ha .. Trilby in England.
It would be like a butterfly in mutton soup.
Svengali!
- Billee.
Tarts for supper!
Yes, and you won't get any if you don't come and play for them.
I .. I don't feel like playing the piano.
No, no. I don't feel like playing it now.
I want to talk to you seriously.
Yah. I want to talk to you about your voice.
Oh, that's a good one.
What will you tell me next, I wonder?
- Ah, you don't understand.
I looked for you everywhere today.
I went to Durien, Mallot.
There is no Trilby.
Where have you been, huh?
Oh, I had one of my funny headaches and didn't work all day.
Headaches?
Yes. But don't tell anyone.
They'd send me home.
Ah, poor liebchen.
Oh, it's nothing. It will go away like it always does.
Possibly, I can take it away for you right now.
Oh ..?
I mean it. It is so easy.
Sit down. I will show you.
Can you really take the pain away?
Yah. Now you sit there quietly.
And do just as I tell you, huh?
Now, you look.
You look at pretty Svengali.
Looking at you is a funny way to cure my headache, Svengali.
Yah, I know.
Now .. don't be afraid.
Look me right in the eyes, liebchen.
Right in the eyes.
If you can really cure my headache ..
You shall see nothing.
Hear nothing.
And dream of nothing.
But .. Svengali.
Svengali.
Svengali.
Svengali.
Svengali.
Svengali.
Yah ..
That is right, liebchen.
Now, sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Open your mouth, liebchen.
Wide.
I was right.
A soundboard like an angel.
The roof of her mouth.
Is like the dome of the Pantheon.
The headache, liebchen.
Will go away.
What's happening there?
What's the matter, Trilby?
What have you done to her?
Trilby.
Trilby!
Wake her up!
Are you asleep, Trilby?
No.
Then open your eyes and say you're alright.
Can you open your eyes, Trilby?
No.
He's hypnotized her.
- Bring her out of it once!
At once! Do you hear me?
Can you hear me, Trilby?
Yes.
Then open your eyes.
Why, what's happened?
- Are you alright?
Why, yes.
My headache's gone.
How on earth did you do it?
I told you. It is so easy.
Oh.
Ah ..
What's the matter?
Eh?
Your headache is here in my heart.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ah, it is nothing.
I will keep it as a souvenir.
Go on, get out of here.
Gentlemen. No violence.
No violence.
And no dinner.
What did he do?
- He hypnotized you.
And don't you ever let him do it again.
Those fellows can make you do anything and say anything they want.
Lie, steal, anything.
They make you kill yourself when they're done.
Yes, they do that.
- But he took my pain away.
I'd rather have the pain than have it cured like that.
Trilby.
Don't forget what I told you about the headache.
Gentlemen.
It might be as well to remember.
There are more things in heaven and earth ..
Than are dreamt of ..
In your philosophy.
Come in, my dear.
I ..
I'm sorry to ..
Trouble you.
I shouldn't have come.
At this hour.
Oh, it is no trouble at all.
It is never too late to trouble Svengali.
I felt ..
I had to come.
But I ..
I think ..
I think I had better go now.
Without telling me what is troubling you?
Oh, it's nothing.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Except ..
- Except?
Did it come back?
The headache.
Yes.
I woke up with it.
And you thought I could help you? Huh?
Yes .. that's why I came here.
Yah .. yah.
Svengali told you.
Whenever you are in pain.
To come to him.
And he will take it away from you.
My dear child, it is the most natural thing in the world.
Come in my dear child.
It is cold out here.
What?
Don't be frightened.
Sit down.
Here.
Are you comfortable?
- Yes.
Yah.
Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Oh poor girl.
All your nerves are jumping like mad.
But ..
And your skin.
Oh, it is hot like fire.
Poor liebchen.
Look .. look at me.
Come.
Look me in the eyes, liebchen.
No .. no.
Take your eyes off me.
Let me go.
Let me go!
But the pain, liebchen?
I know. It's gone now.
Trilby.
Trilby!
Svengali.
Oh don't go, liebchen.
It's been so long since I've seen you.
But I must. I ..
- Ah?
You've been crying.
Poor Trilby.
You know .. perhaps I can cure a pain in the heart.
Just as easily as one in the head. Huh?
Nobody can cure this pain.
It's for someone .. someone else.
Whom I've hurt.
Ah .. I see ..
Now come.
Tell old Svengali all about it. Huh?
Yah .. he'll understand.
Trilby .. you know when human beings are unhappy.
There's always something to do about it.
Come on now.
Tell me .. what's happened.
Tell me all about it.
Well it's .. it's Billee.
Today .. today I posed at Carrel's school.
And he saw me there.
Before all those men.
Oh, you won't understand.
But I'm so ashamed.
Ah, but I do understand.
Yah, liebchen.
Billee is not like the others.
Ah, my poor Trilby.
Do your eyes reflect the virtue ..
That he sees in them?
Look in your mirror.
Do you think you should be on such a high pedestal?
After all the ..
Other artists .. you have known?
What do you mean?
Does he ..?
Does he know about Durien?
Durien?
What is there to know about him?
Only what all the rest of us know, my poor Trilby.
Except the innocent little Billee.
I won't listen to you any longer!
How could I help being kind to a man who has been so kind to me?
Kindness is a virtue undeniably, but ..
But, to be so very kind?
I am good I tell you. I'm not like those others. I'm not, I'm not!
Ah, poor Trilby.
Poor little liebchen.
Surely you are good.
You are good like a little bird.
Like a lark that must sing in the sunlight.
But ..
Are you good enough to face little Billee's mother ..
As his wife?
After.
Durien the sculptor.
Mario the painter.
Come, come, Billee lad.
There's nothing to worry about.
A wee drop and soon we'll have Trilby back in your hands within an hour.
Aye.
What you standing there for, man? Get the whiskey.
I'll get the glasses myself.
Here you are.
- There you are.
Billee.
What's the matter, laddie?
What is it, Billee?
She says she's not good enough for me.
But I saw her today, and she really is.
She's going away and will never see me again.
Billee .. she tells you that she loves you.
Never see me again.
Never again.
Or anybody else.
She says.
Stop her! Find her! Trilby!
Billee .. Billee boy!
Come here, lad.
[ French language ]
Do you know Trilby O'Farrell?
Are these her clothes?
- Yes.
We found them on the bank of the Seine.
Where is she?
In the morgue.
If they've found her body by now.
I'm afraid you will never find her, Monsieur.
The river is too high to drag.
I'm very sorry, Madame.
- Trilby.
Suicide.
The Maestro, Svengali.
This is a marvellous change since we saw him last.
Aye, it's been just five years.
Wonderful.
They say that his wife is a very beautiful woman.
Didn't you say .. that she was a Polish woman that he picked up in Russia?
Yeah. That's what I heard.
Sir, if she's as beautiful as they say she is ..
He must have hypnotized her into marrying him.
I'm not interested in that.
What I want to know is who is giving him his baths now?
Probably she is. In self-defence.
Come, laddie. We must get the tickets now.
Standing room only.
Oh, let me.
- No.
Give them just enough to see Svengali in a dress suit.
Ah .. is Monsieur Svengali here?
Not yet.
- Not yet?
But tonight, it is the début of La Svengali in Paris.
Paris is not different than
Berlin, or Vienna or Madrid.
But it is almost time for the concert!
And I have a very important message for Monsieur Svengali.
You will pardon me, please.
Ah!
Monsieur Svengali.
I am speechless, Madame.
Every night you grow more beautiful.
Thank you, Señor Bonelli.
All Paris is waiting at your feet.
Then what are you waiting for?
Oh, I burst with pride.
Well, control yourself a moment. Just a moment.
Marta.
Now, why do you burst?
Three illustrious gentlemen wait in the green room to interview La Svengali.
Madame Svengali never gives interviews.
How many times must I tell you?
But it means another Command
Performance in St Petersburg.
These three gentlemen are messengers from the Court of Russia.
It does not matter.
- Oh, I am desolated.
Here. Attached to this beautiful bouquet ..
Is a present from the Czar himself.
Do you still refuse to allow
Madame to see these gentlemen?
You refuse positively?
Not the necklace. Only the interview.
But, Monsieur Svengali.
Monsieur Svengali .. but ..?
[ Italian language ]
[ Italian language ]
Here is a little trifle.
I thought would be becoming.
A trifle?
Why, they're gorgeous.
There is nothing too beautiful ..
For "La Svengali".
You are sweet to me, Svengali.
What are you staring at, you old fool?
Maestro, I am very sorry to disturb you, but you are late.
The theater is already packed.
Even the standing room has gone.
That is as it should be. Go away.
You have never looked more lovely.
Never more adorable.
Will we ever see anything?
I can't see a thing myself.
He's so far away I cannot see.
Has he changed much?
I can't even see a grease-spot on him.
Then he's changed much.
I now have a chair in the aisle for Monsieur.
My glasses, please.
Merci beaucoup.
- Sorry to trouble you.
No trouble at all.
[ Opera singing: ]
[ Opera singing: ]
I can't see her face.
Is she as beautiful as they think?
I cannot see myself.
[ Opera singing: ]
Hey laddie. How about three more chairs?
Sorry, Monsieur. That was the last one.
But I will try to get you some opera glasses so you can see La Svengali.
Aye. You do that, laddie.
[ Opera singing: ]
I say, laddie. Did you forget the opera glasses?
No Monsieur, I'm sorry. They are all taken like everything else tonight.
[ Opera singing: ]
We are here to see Monsieur Svengali.
But I am sorry, gentlemen.
I have strict orders to admit nobody.
Oh, but we are old and intimate friends with the Monsieur.
Sorry, nobody.
Look at all these scavengers.
No need to try and keep his feet clean.
He hasn't been clean for five years.
Gecko!
Why, Gecko!
Why can't we get in to see Svengali?
It is very difficult to see
Mr Svengali at any time.
Gecko, tell me. Is he still dodging the landladies?
Mr Svengali is beyond such a thing as landladies.
I notice that you are not beyond getting yourself a belly.
Look at the nice opera coat he's got.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. If you will excuse me. I must go, I am in a hurry.
Oh certainly.
Certainly.
Look at the little beggar on horseback.
- Aye, and riding to his doom.
Trilby.
Trilby!
It's Trilby, is it not?
It is Trilby, isn't it?
It can't be.
The pain again, Maestro?
Yah.
Keine gefahr.
Alright.
Alright.
But it is. I'm sure of it.
But her voice.
Trilby couldn't have sounded like that.
Why, it's Billee.
Billee.
Taffy and The Laird.
Oh, it's so good to see you all again.
I ..
I beg your pardon.
I must have mistaken you for someone I knew.
Don't make a scene here, Billee.
Oh. I seem to have been asleep for ages.
Haven't I been good to you, Trilby?
When you were ill.
Who .. who gave you back your life?
You did.
I've done everything I could.
To repay you.
- Yah.
Except love me.
Hello, liebchen ..
I do love you so much.
Oh, please.
Please.
Svengali.
I've tried but I ..
- Yah, yah, yah.
But you know very well why you can't.
It is the magnificent young Englander.
The head of the purity brigade.
Sir Galahad.
Yes.
This stiff-necked little Billee Englander.
What is he, liebchen?
With his silly paints in one hand.
And these twiddling brushes of pig's bristles in the other?
What does he amount to ..
Compared to Svengali?
Ah, he paints his silly pictures and sends them to London.
Where they hang upon the wall.
Like .. dead soldiers on parade.
Plenty people pass in a long procession.
And .. yawn.
Svengali will go to London himself.
Where he will be all alone on a platform.
And Princesses.
And Countesses.
And serene Highnesses.
Will fling him their jewels.
And applaud him.
And invite him to their palaces.
And he will take you with him, liebchen.
And never look at them.
Yah, we could be so happy.
But I .. I don't like palaces.
No.
Nor anything else that other women like.
Except that little Billee.
Look at me .. in the eyes!
Open your eyes.
Oh .. I do love you.
Ah, close your eyes.
I love you.
- Ah, don't say it.
You are beautiful.
My manufactured love.
But it is only Svengali.
Talking to himself again.
Did you get tickets for the concert tonight?
There won't be any concert tonight.
Svengali and his company have cancelled the engagement and gone away.
And where are you going?
After him.
Svengali is not running away from you.
Not from me, Taffy.
But from the fear of the day when his spell over Trilby will be broken.
As it was for a moment last night.
Aye .. and what will you do when you catch up with him?
Just wait until the day comes.
I'll get her back.
If I have to follow them around the world.
Take your places, please.
Take your places.
Come on. Everybody.
Come on. Please, please.
Presto, presto!
Gecko. Mr Svengali. Will he be delayed?
When he is ready, he will be here.
He is already one hour late.
The people are tearing down the house.
When he is ready, he will be here.
Oh ..
I must go and make an explanation.
Curtain!
Signore e signori.
[ Italian language ]
[ Italian language ]
[ Italian language ]
[ Italian language ]
[ Italian language ]
Mr Svengali .. you are not made up yet?
They are waiting for the concert to begin.
Waiting is good for such riff-raff.
What's the matter .. are you not sick?
Yah .. I am sick.
I cannot go on.
But what about Madame Svengali?
Would she ever appear without me?
You mean, you refuse to give the concert? Again?
Yah .. there is no concert.
Then there will never be another one.
If La Svengali does not sing tonight.
Her career in Europe is ended.
I tell you .. I am sick.
Alright then .. I am through!
From now on, you can manage
yourself into the poorhouse.
In every place, you have broken your engagements.
Until there's no other theater that will contract for La Svengali's appearance.
Are you trying to tell me what to do?
I would like to tell you where to go!
But there isn't any place for you except a dive.
And now, that's where you belong!
Go tell that rabble.
La Svengali.
Cannot appear tonight.
But they will kill me, Maestro.
Yah.
I will give you .. a military funeral.
[ Italian language ]
Would you please Maestro cancel the engagement.
I will go in and tell them.
- Alright.
And that spell you had tonight.
It was the worst you ever had.
And I am afraid, Maestro.
Take Madame Svengali to her dressing room. I will join you later.
Liebchen.
Go with Gecko. Wait for me.
Ah .. calm yourself.
I did not come here to fight.
Do you expect me to sit down and talk quietly?
I think it would be as well for all of us.
I think you will agree with me.
After I explain.
Sit down, please. Sit down.
Ah .. have a drink.
Some champagne will clear the atmosphere.
Garçon!
A meillure of champagne.
Vous allez. Tout de suite.
Now we can talk like old friends.
- What do you want?
Don't be alarmed .. nothing from you.
What do you want?
Allez, allez.
You .. you will not have to follow me.
After tonight.
You probably would not want to.
What do you mean?
What are you driving at?
Oh, nothing mysterious.
Tonight.
Is La Svengali's last concert.
You mean you're taking
Trilby back to Paris?
My dear young friend.
That is for her to decide.
To Trilby.
And her freedom.
Surely you will drink to that?
"The next act has been brought from
Europe at tremendous expense."
He is probably alluding.
To the superb artist.
Svengali.
I have ..
I have an act now, you know.
The Queen of the Kings.
The toast of Emperors.
Assisted by the great Maestro.
Svengali!
You can hear with what delirious appreciation ..
They look forward to my music.
I .. I feel sure you would not wish me to keep them waiting.
Excusez-moi.
My young friend.
Remember what I once told you.
There are more things in heaven and earth ..
Than are dreamt of ..
In your philosophy.
Auf wiedersehen .
What's the matter, liebchen?
Are you alright?
Why .. yes.
Except I feel ..
Yah, yah?
Strangely.
Listen .. my dear.
Tonight.
I want you to watch me.
Very closely.
Do not take your eyes off mine.
Even for an instant.
And remember.
There is nothing in your mind.
Nothing in your heart.
Nothing in your soul.
But Svengali.
Svengali.
Svengali.
[ Opera singing: ]
Maestro!
Trilby!
Trilby.
It's Billee.
I'm right here with you.
Kiss me, darling.
0h, God.
Grant me in death.
What you denied me in life.
The woman I loved.
Svengali.
Avanti, signori ..

Hello? Morning Dispatch.
Hello? Morning Dispatch.
Hello. Park Vista hotel?
Give me Angela Merrova's apartment.
Tell her it's Walt Garrett, Mr.
Garrett of The Morning Dispatch.
- Here's your peanuts, Wichita.
- Oh, thanks, Pinky, my boy.
- You cheapskate.
- Hey, wait a minute, what...
Hello, Miss Merrova.
It's you, Mr. Garrett. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine, thank you. How about an interview this morning?
What about?
How about your ideas on love and marriage?
Well, I have some fresh views on love, since my last trip to Europe.
Oh, I'm terribly booked up, but I might find a few minutes for you, Mr. Garrett.
All right, come right away, will you?
Goodbye, Mr. Garrett.
Say, Dooley, if a redhead calls, tell her I'm finding out about love, will you?
I'll cut you guys in if there's any new angles.
New angles? You don't know the old ones.
Say, listen, I'm gonna show you tired old hacks how to write an interview.
It's a fine thing.
You leave that door open like that, anything's liable to drop in.
Miss Merrova, your favorite newsboy is here.
- City editor.
- Hello, Andy?
Listen, Angela Merrova's dead.
Yeah, croaked. Sure, I'm sure.
Oh, this is Walt.
I don't know. There's nobody here except the monkey,
- and he couldn't have done it.
- Anybody else got it?
No, nobody knows it, not even the cops.
Let them read about it in the paper.
Yeah, yeah, give me Rewrite.
This is a horrible thing.
What'll people think, Lieutenant?
Oh, they'll probably figure out the joint's a hangout for gorillas.
- Exactly! What?
- Who's this guy?
Well, Lieutenant. Imagine finding you here, of all places.
Well, if it isn't the Kansas Sherlock.
- Which room?
- In here.
- I'll see you later, brain trust.
- Anytime I can be of service, anytime.
How do?
- Come on, come on, what is this?
- I don't know.
- The newspaper said...
- There's no dead body in here.
Oh, sit down, will you?
He's a very funny guy, this Garrett.
Well, where is it?
- Yes, where is it?
- Where's what?
The body. Of course, I just represent the law here, and if you're saving it for another one of your scoops, don't let me interfere.
Cut it out, will you,
Kincaid? What's the rib?
You tell me. There's no corpse in there.
I... No corpse?
Well, what the...
Well? Well, what gives that now?
I don't know, the body was lying right there on the floor.
It was dead. I'd take an oath.
It had a deep knife wound, right under the heart.
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- Honest at Pete it isn't, Kincaid, she was murdered.
I know! Somebody came in and swiped that body.
That's what happened, she was kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
First she was murdered, now she was kidnapped.
Oh, this is horrible.
It'll ruin the hotel.
- Positively ruin it!
- Take it easy.
- Well, genius?
- I just can't figure it out.
Well, I'll tell you, we're gonna play a new game.
Body, body, who's got the body? You want to join us?
Come on, boys.
- How you doing, Wichita?
- Not so good.
I've been in the morgue, the medical institute,
I've even had the river dragged.
There's something awful cockeyed about this whole setup.
- Any more dope on this dame?
- That's the works.
Well, it's no help. No friends, no family, an orphan.
Did you ever hear of an orphan with a family?
- File room. - Pinky, is that corn-fed wizard in there?
Yes sir. Yes sir, he's here.
- Tell him to come in right away.
- Yes, sir!
Hey, Wichita, Picklepuss wants to see you.
And he don't mean in ten minutes.
All right, all right.
Jiminy Christmas.
Darned kids.
Don't forget to try the comics section.
Hi, Walt. Say, who's that body
I seen you with last night?
- Yeah, we heard you sat up with a corpse.
- Was it a wake?
You guys are very funny, but that dead body will turn up yet.
Hello, boss. Do you want me?
- Not after today.
- Oh, well, Pinky...
- What?
- You heard me, you're through.
- I don't get it.
- You know this lady, I believe.
How do you do, Mr. Garrett?
No, I don't believe it.
I'm glad to see you recognize Miss Merrova.
But... But it isn't possible.
You must be...
Boss, this girl is a phony. I saw Angela Merrova. She's dead.
If you don't mind, she seems very much alive to me.
And it may interest you to know that she's suing the paper for $100,000.
Damage to her reputation.
And the Park Vista Hotel also is suing for a mere $50,000.
Boss, I tell you that the girl I saw in that room couldn't be alive.
- I know, she's your twin sister.
- I have no sister.
I've already extended the paper's regrets.
And I've assured Miss Merrova that we'd print a complete apology.
I thought before you left the building you also might care to apologize.
Why, certainly.
I'm very sorry for the mistake. Wait a minute.
The cashier has your check waiting for you, Garrett.
- Oh, boss, give me another chance.
- Go back to Wichita, son.
Maybe they'll give you another chance there.
No sisters.
Get out!
Calling Dr. Rhodes. Dr. Rhodes.
Calling Dr. Rhodes.
And there she was sitting in the boss's office. Alive.
Well, I almost went through the ceiling.
So I thought I'd better talk to you about it, on account of you're the only doctor friend I got.
I don't know, maybe there's something wrong with me, maybe I ought to be psyched or something.
Superintendent calling.
Dr. Rhodes speaking.
- Go into my office. I'll be right with you.
- But hurry up, will you, Mike?
Yes, sir. It's scheduled for 10:00 sharp.
Yes, we purposely postponed the operation until this morning so that Dr. Flegg could perform it.
Right, sir, we'll be ready.
Did the blood donor shown up yet, Miss Sweetman?
Not yet. Should be here any moment.
Whom did you call?
Stanley Rodgers.
Rodgers? He's in blood group one, isn't he?
- That's right.
- Is the patient group one?
That was the lab report.
That's funny. I thought she was ordinary group four.
Better call Rodgers again.
Dr. Flegg doesn't like to be kept waiting, and we must have a transfusion before we can operate.
Yes, Doctor.
Vance, look up Rodgers' number, see what's keeping him.
Yes, Miss Sweetman.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Rodgers?
Jules Hospital calling.
Remember, you have an appointment this morning with Dr. Rhodes.
Gosh, what time is it?
I guess I must have forgot to set the alarm. I'll be right over.
- Sorry to have kept you, Walt.
- Oh, I know you're busy, Mike, but you don't have to treat me like the forgotten man.
I had to check up on some blood test reports.
- Go ahead, spin the rest of your yarn.
- Well, that's all there is.
The dame that was sitting in
Picklepuss' office was Angela Merrova.
There's no getting around that.
But the thing is, I can't figure it out.
- What makes you think I can help you?
- Well, this is a chest x-ray, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Well, how do you get a good look at it?
- I want to show you something.
- Pull down the blinds.
- Now what's on your mind, Walt?
- Mike,
- isn't the heart about here?
- That's right.
Did you ever hear of a person surviving with a deep knife wound about there?
Well, friend, I'd say it's impossible.
But maybe the wound wasn't as deep as you thought it was.
No, it was at least four inches.
And it was as clean as if you'd done it with your scalpel.
- Me?
- No, I don't mean you, but it did look as if it had been done by a surgeon.
And then the corpse got up and walked away, eh?
Oh, Mike...
Give me an even break, will you? I know it sounds as crazy as a loon.
You probably think I'm the one that's crazy.
But I'm on the level.
I'd take an oath.
If what you say is true, even if the heart puncture didn't kill her,
- she'd bleed to death.
- That's it.
That's what made the body look so peculiar.
I never saw a corpse that color before.
- What color?
- Absolutely dead white.
It looked as if every ounce of blood had been drained out of her body.
Extreme pallor setting in within ten minutes. I've never heard of it.
Well, you're hearing about it now.
And when I saw her in the boss' office she looked exactly as when I saw her as a corpse.
Clammy.
- Yes?
- Dr. Flegg has arrived, sir.
Thank you, I'll be right there.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Walt.
I'll speak to Dr. Flegg about it.
He's usually in a pretty decent mood before an operation.
And if anybody can give you an answer, when it comes to hematology, it's Flegg.
- Hematology?
- Yeah, the science of the blood.
Stick around awhile, will you?
I ain't got any place to go except back to Wichita.
- Don't forget to ask Flegg, now, will you?
- Right.
Thanks, Mike, I'll give you a full column write-up for this someday.
- Rodgers get here all right?
- No, Doctor, he still hasn't shown up.
What's the matter with him?
It's time for the operation.
Call his apartment again.
You won't forget to ask Dr. Flegg about it?
Yeah, yeah, I'll remember. Now go ahead and get a magazine and relax.
Walnut 43701.
I can't understand what's the matter with Rodgers.
He's never disappointed us before.
- Well?
- No.
I can try and get another donor for you.
Can't find another number one blood type as easily as that.
There are only seven people in a hundred in group one.
Notify the superintendent.
- Dr. Rhodes?
- Yes?
I was tested last week when
I first came to the hospital.
- I'm in group one.
- You're sure, Nurse?
She's right, Doctor.
Dr. Baum made the test.
I'd be willing to help if I could.
Hey, Mike, you better hurry up, Flegg's liable to walk out.
- You know him.
- Right, coming.
Take Nurse Vance to surgery and prepare for transfusion. I'll see you there.
All right, Nurse, come with me.
- Frightened?
- No.
- Ever done this before?
- No.
You'll probably be a little weak when we finish.
I won't mind.
- Everything ready?
- Yes, Dr. Flegg.
- Took you long enough.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Very well.
I thought you were going to have Rodgers.
We weren't able to reach him, sir.
- Start the transfusion.
- Right.
- Fine job, Dr. Flegg.
- Yes, worked out rather neatly.
Saved that patient's life.
You're the only man that could have done it.
Interesting stuff, blood.
Make a thorough study of it, Rhodes.
It's important enough for you to devote your whole life to it.
I've been doing some research, not nearly as much as I'd like to.
Good. Stick to it.
It's going to transform the entire future of surgery.
The day is coming when man will be able to control blood.
And when that time does arrive, he'll be able to control his destiny.
Blood is the source of life.
Remember the Bible.
"And the life, which is the blood thereof. "
Hadn't you better take a look at your donor?
Oh, yes, yes sir.
- By the way, who is she?
- Girl by the name of Vance, one of the new student nurses.
- Doctor?
- Yes?
Would you say it's possible for a person to survive with a deep incision at the base of the thoracic aorta?
Why do you ask?
A friend of mine thought he knew of such a case.
Ridiculous. Tell him to change his brand of liquor.
- Oh, hello, Doctor.
- Feel a little weak?
I can take it.
I think you better rest an hour or so.
- Drink any of this?
- Not yet.
Here, take it down in one big gulp. It'll pick you up.
- What is it?
- Come on, drink it.
It's pretty swell of you to help us out.
- It's part of a nurse's education.
- That's the right spirit.
Say, why haven't I seen you before?
You never looked before.
I guess I've been missing something.
Just one more thing. I have an important operation scheduled for tomorrow evening and I'd like your assistance. Are you free?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good.
I think you'd better wear another outfit.
Evening gown. We're going dancing.
I'd like to very much.
But, you know, we nurses...
Yes, I know, Rules for Nurses number
114, "Keep away from staff physicians. "
What's the good of rules if no one breaks them?
Well, what did Dr. Flegg have to say?
He thought you ought to be more discriminating in your choice of hooch.
Mike, cut it out, now, will you? This is serious.
- I'm out of a job.
- Dr. Rhodes.
- Yes?
- Excuse me, I have a message for you.
You're wanted at 438
Gore Street right away.
- The police called.
- The police?
- Yes, Doctor, they said it was very urgent.
- Thanks.
- What's up, Mike?
- I don't know yet.
Look me up next week when you sober up.
Oh no. Where go the police, there go I.
I'm Dr. Rhodes. The officer downstairs sent me up.
Yes, sir. Go right in.
- Dr. Rhodes.
- Come in, Doc.
- Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
- Who asked for you?
Oh, have a heart, will you, Kincaid?
A guy makes a mistake once in awhile.
- What do you got here?
- Now take it easy, big shot.
- He a friend of yours?
- Yeah.
Well, since you're an ex-reporter, I guess it's okay.
Doc, come here a minute.
You know this fellow?
That's Stanley Rodgers.
How did this happen?
Come here.
You mind telling me what this means?
Yes, simply a memorandum of an appointment he had this morning at the hospital.
- An appointment for what?
- A blood transfusion.
- He was a professional blood donor.
- Hey, Mike, come here.
Look at this guy. Look at his face and look at his body.
- Why, there's no color.
- Yeah.
That's exactly the way Merrova looked when I found her in her bedroom.
And I suppose this geezer's alive, too.
Well, I'll tell you,
Lieutenant, there's pro and con.
- Well, Doctor?
- The blood's been drained out of the body.
I know that, but where is it?
That's what I want to find out.
There's only a few stains around.
- I don't know.
- Well, maybe I can help you.
That operation at the hospital this morning. Did you perform it?
No, Dr. Flegg did. He's one of our blood specialists.
- But you do operate?
- Why, yes.
Did you take a good close look at that wound, Doctor?
Yes. Yes, I did.
The coroner tells me that man wasn't stabbed, he was operated on with a surgical instrument.
And by someone who knew how to use it.
But that's what I'm trying to tell you, just like Merrova.
Listen, rigor mortis, if you mention that Merrova dame's name again, I'II...
I know what you're thinking. A doctor did it.
- Perhaps myself.
- I'm not saying anything.
All I know is the coroner says he never saw a case just like it.
- You got the coroner's report?
- Yeah.
- You want to see it?
- Please.
The type of blood found on the stains in the carpet is group four.
Why, that's impossible, unless the murderer was wounded.
How do you figure that?
Rodgers was definitely group one.
I've used him in several transfusions. I'm sure of it.
What is this group one, group four business?
Well, you see, medical science has discovered that the human blood is divided into four different groups.
Number one being the most rare, number four the most common.
We must see to it that certain of these types are not mixed in the transfusion.
Then would you say that whoever came into Rodgers' room to kill him
- was looking for number one blood?
- It's possible.
That's why I think the coroner made a mistake in his report.
So do you mind if I make a test of these stains for myself?
No, go ahead, Doc.
One, two, four, seven, eleven.
It doesn't matter to me.
All I know is, this poor guy's number was up.
- Yes, and who done it?
- Go sit down.
If I find out anything,
Lieutenant, I'll let you know.
Yeah, do that, Doc.
And, uh, Doctor, if I were you, I wouldn't try to go away.
I mean, leave town, or anything like that.
There's one thing I definitely do know, Walt.
This is not Rodgers' blood. I checked it with his file specimen.
That's very simple. It's the murderer's, then.
Doesn't even look like human blood.
A gorilla murder. Oh, Mike.
If you can figure that one out, we'll have our front page spread on every newspaper in the United States for weeks.
I must be ready for the bug house, or something, but it doesn't even seem to be animal blood.
Well, you've got vegetable and mineral left.
It's no use. Think
I'll call it a night.
You're not giving up, are you, Mike?
No, no, this will take a long time and I'm pretty tired.
I'll take another look at it in the morning.
How'd you like to go down and mangle a few ham and eggs, before you turn in?
- No, I think I'll hit the hay.
- Okay.
If you run across any good ideas, let me know about it.
- Right.
- Good night.
- Give me a ring in the morning.
- You're on.
West 86th.
You may wait in here. Dr.
Flegg will be back any minute.
Thank you.
Looking for something?
Perhaps I can help you.
I... I was waiting for Dr. Flegg.
What is it you want?
I wanted to speak to him about a blood smear. I'm Dr. Rhodes.
Oh, Dr. Rhodes. How do you do?
My name is Quesne.
I've often heard Flegg speak of you.
- Yes?
- Yes, he thinks you show great promise.
Particularly in the study of blood composition.
That's very kind of him.
Yes, I may wish to discuss that subject with you myself someday.
I'd like to. Anytime.
Oh, he's ill.
- We're both victims of...
- Of what?
Go on, Quesne, victims of what?
Circumstance.
Go back to your work.
You wanted to see me, Rhodes?
What's the matter? Did our patient have a relapse?
No, sir, I came here to ask a favor of you.
Well, speak up, man.
What is it you want?
Your opinion on a blood specimen, as to group.
Blood group?
You must need a genius to figure that out.
Have you forgotten your hematology?
Or perhaps you never learned it.
I hate to bother you this late, Doctor, but
- there's something unusual about this.
- Unusual?
There's something I can't understand.
Oh, very well. Quesne.
Yes, sir?
Dr. Rhodes has a blood specimen I want prepared for the microscope.
At once.
Strange-looking creature, isn't he?
Yes, rather.
What is it? Terminal case of primary anemia?
No, he hasn't completely recovered from a rather severe shock.
He's been a very valuable man for me, though.
- Has he been with you a long time?
- Yes, a couple of years.
His interest in blood almost equals my own.
Let's take a look at that slide.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Where did you collect this smear, Rhodes?
At a murder this morning.
How did it happen you were called in on the case?
- To identify the body.
- Someone you knew?
Yes, a blood donor.
The man who was supposed to report to you at the hospital this morning.
Stanley Rodgers.
- Rodgers murdered?
- Yes.
Oh, that's too bad.
Blood group one, isn't he?
- Are you working with the police?
- No, sir.
Then why did you bring this to me?
The police laboratory classified it as blood group four.
I know it's not one, but I'm certain it's not four, either.
I disagree. I think the police laboratory is correct.
It is group four. Is that all?
Well, don't you notice anything peculiar about it?
Merely the usual chemical changes accompanying post-mortem coagulation.
I don't know how to explain it, but hasn't it some sort of artificial quality?
What have you done?
Clumsy fool.
Go into the office and bandage it. See that you're more careful.
- Case of hemophilia?
- No, merely a great deal of trouble.
That's the second time this week he's cut himself.
Well, I'm sorry we were interrupted.
I see no need for further discussion.
This stain is blood group four and nothing else.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've a great deal of work to do.
Could I have the slide, Doctor?
- Why, yes.
- Thank you.
You go out this way.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I had to see you.
- What's the matter?
- I feel cold.
My ears are ringing.
I can hardly breathe.
Yeah. You see, Flegg? I told you.
You'll never find what you're looking for.
- You're a failure, Flegg.
- You're lying.
- What does he mean "you're a failure"?
- Nothing.
Nothing, I assure you.
I haven't failed yet.
Now get out of here.
- Hello, Michael.
- Hiya, Walt. Glad you dropped in.
- Anything new?
- Yeah, I went over to see Flegg last night.
- Oh, what'd you find out?
- He wasn't much help.
He said the police report was right.
But as sure as I'm sitting here, he knows this bloodstain isn't ordinary group four.
Who was the fellow with the pasty face?
- How do you know about him?
- Oh, I was watching from outside.
You followed me? Why did you do that for?
Kincaid said the murder had to be committed by a doctor.
- You suspected me?
- Oh no, of course not,
- but maybe Flegg.
- Flegg? That's ridiculous.
All right, ridiculous perhaps, but possible.
Who was the other fellow?
I've seen him someplace before.
Fellow by the name of Quesne.
He's Flegg's assistant.
You know, Mike, there's something awful phony going on in that joint.
Good morning, Doctor. Come in.
- Rhodes, may I see you a moment?
- Certainly.
- Alone.
- Pardon me, I was just leaving, Doc.
How's the patient?
Excellent this morning, Doctor.
Temperature practically normal.
Last night, you asked a favor of me.
Today, I'd like to ask one of you in return.
Of course, Dr. Flegg.
Forget everything and everyone you saw at my home last night.
We'll call it professional ethics.
Yes, sir.
Oh...
What did you say that girl's name was?
The one we used yesterday for the transfusion?
Joan. Joan Vance.
- A nurse here, you said?
- Yes.
I always like to keep my list of group ones complete.
- Have you her home address?
- 1233 South Cedar.
Thank you.
Now, do you still think he's an innocent bystander?
I still don't think he's a murderer, if that's what you mean.
All right, what would you think if I told you that Angela Merrova paid him a little visit last night, and she had a blood transfusion?
Now, do you still think I'm wacky?
- You're sure it was Merrova?
- Am I sure?
Brother, there's a face I'll never forget.
And another thing I'd like to point out to you.
Did you notice the peculiar coloring on that kisser of Quesne's?
Yeah.
- Like a piece of white marble.
- Like something dead, huh?
Yeah, I remember when I shook his hand, it was cold and lifeless like a dead person's.
What do you think is the matter with him?
I don't know.
Flegg says he's suffering from a severe shock.
Well, whatever it is, Merrova has got that same cold, graveyard look.
Mike, you gotta help me out.
Every newspaperman in town is giving me the rib.
You suppose we could have a talk with Merrova?
There are a few questions
I'd like to ask her.
Well, we could try.
I'd like to ask her a couple myself.
How about tonight?
Oh, I can't make it tonight.
I've got a date with Joan.
Oh, why don't you break it?
This is no time for dames.
Walt, I can't do it.
I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll take her along.
You can drop us at the Club El Rey later.
Okay, that's a deal.
- We'll be at Merrova's at 9:00.
- Okay.
I've got a table reserved at the
Club El Rey. This won't take long.
I don't mind waiting.
616 is right down here.
Here.
Last time I was up here, she left the door open and I fell in.
I guess she left the door open again.
- Is that you, Dr. Flegg?
- No, ma'am. It's not.
What are you doing here?
What right have you to come into my apartment like this?
Now, take it easy, Miss Merrova. We just wanna have a little talk with you.
I have nothing to say to you, Mr. Garrett.
And so please get out.
That girl's always passing out.
Her hands are as cold as ice.
Is that whisky over there?
Yeah.
Here you are, Mike.
- Thank you.
- Gee, it's sure lucky we dropped in.
This is Dr. Rhodes of the Jules
Hospital. He can probably help you.
I don't need any help. I'm all right.
Besides, I expect my doctor any moment.
Well, would you mind answering a few questions before he comes?
What kind of questions?
Are you anemic?
Has Dr. Flegg been your physician for some time?
Why, yes. Several years.
- Why do you ask?
- Did he ever make a blood test of you?
You see, we're trying to find out if you are a group number one blood type.
I'm not sure, but I think so.
Why do you want to know these things?
Because we think you can help us.
Somewhere in this city, there is a murderer at large.
The only possible clue we have is that he seems to be interested in obtaining type number one blood.
Yesterday morning, a young chap named Stanley Rodgers was found murdered in his apartment.
He was type number one.
His body was completely drained of blood.
Another thing.
The knife wound was identical to that which Mr. Garrett found on you.
This is untrue.
Mr. Garrett suffers from hallucinations.
Not since I was 14.
Remember, you may be helping us to save someone else's life.
Very well.
It's true.
When you called me for an interview, as I hung up the phone, I realized someone had entered the room.
I was terrified.
A hand went over my mouth and then I felt a sharp pain on my chest.
Then I lost consciousness.
That's when I found you lying there on the floor.
- I suppose so.
- But where did you disappear to?
I don't know.
All I know is that the next morning I woke up in this room.
Why didn't you tell all of this to the police?
I didn't want this kind of publicity.
But can't you just give us a hint on who stabbed you and where he took you afterward?
I'll be all right as soon as Dr. Flegg gets here.
I'll see you tomorrow morning at 10:00 in your office.
Then I'll tell you all.
Good evening.
Dr. Flegg was out. The nurse gave me the message.
I came to see if there was anything I could do.
- How do you do, Dr. Rhodes?
- How do you do?
And...
This is Mr. Garrett.
Walt, this is Dr. Quesne.
Pleased to meet you.
Yes, how do you do, Mr. Garrett?
I'm sorry to disturb you, gentlemen, but as you can see Miss Merrova is ill.
Yeah. We were just leaving.
Yes. That's very considerate of you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
By the way, Doctor,
I haven't forgotten that you and I are to have that talk on blood composition.
Yes, sir.
I told you I was right about that dame.
- I'm gonna go tell the boss.
- You could drop us off at the club.
Ah, no, Mike. You gotta come along.
He won't believe me.
- Success?
- You bet.
- But, Walt, I can't...
- Then we're ready to go, huh?
Well, I tell you, Joan.
Walt wanted me to drop by and see the boss...
Who does he think he is, Rip van Winkle?
- Sure this is the right house?
- Yeah, this is the place, all right.
Hey, boss.
- Hello, chief.
- You!
What's the idea of ringing my doorbell at this time of night?
What do you think this is? Halloween?
- He's always kidding.
- Kidding!
Get away from here, you...
You Wichita Frankenstein!
Now, take it easy, will you, boss?
I really got a great story for you this time. You gotta listen to me.
Come on in.
- What is it?
- I bet you can't guess where I've been.
So, now it's riddles.
Come to the point, Garrett.
I was over to see
Angela Merrova tonight.
Merrova? You blockhead!
You want her suing the paper for another $100,000?
You can forget all about that suit.
That dame really was stabbed, just like I told you. She admitted it.
- What?
- Yes, sir, and she's gonna be down at the office in the morning and give you the whole story.
Say, this isn't another one of your screwy ideas, is it?
No, boss. It's on the level. I take an oath.
This is Dr. Rhodes, a friend of mine from Jules Hospital.
Well, he was with me all the time. Tell him, Mike.
- He's right, sir.
- Well!
Could you picture that, boss, a four-column story?
"Actress to reveal truth.
"Angela Merrova tells all in the office of The Morning Dispatch. "
- Boss, I tell you, it's sensational.
- It's terrific. Come on.
Won't The Evening
Bulletin be surprised?
I'm going to make them print an apology for the apology they made us print.
- Garrett, I misjudged you.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Andy. Hold the presses for a morning extra.
Angela Merrova is coming to my office in the morning and...
What?
- If she does, I'm not gonna be here.
- What do you mean?
I just got a flash. She's dead.
What? Are you positive about that?
Oh, I see.
All right. Thanks, Andy.
What's up, boss?
So, Angela Merrova is coming to my office in the morning and she's going to tell the whole story, huh?
- Sure, I personally guarantee it.
- Listen, wise guy.
- Merrova's dead.
- Dead?
Well, we talked to her about an hour ago.
Quesne. He killed her.
She's been murdered.
- What, again?
- Yeah.
Why, you...
Listen, phony. I don't know where you dream up these yarns of yours, but Angela Merrova was not murdered. She died of natural causes.
Now, wait a minute, boss. Maybe it's one of those up again, down again routines she's been giving us.
Maybe she ain't dead.
If she's not dead, they're playing a dirty trick on her, because they're taking her over to Bixby's Undertaking Parlors.
- Now, get out of here. Both of you.
- Yes, sir.
And don't ever come back.
I won't believe she's dead till I see it with my own eyes.
Even then I won't believe it.
- Now where to?
- The undertaker's.
Well, that's different.
The undertaker's?
We won't be a minute.
Be out in a minute, honey.
If you find someone interesting in there, send him out.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Do you have a...
A customer in here by the name of Angela Merrova?
- You mean, the body of the deceased?
- Yes.
She just came in.
- Are you gentlemen relatives?
- Not exactly.
But we sort of have an interest in her, so to speak.
Friends.
Yes, sir.
We were wondering if we could see the body.
This way, gentlemen.
Would you mind stepping in the other room with me, please?
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
Certainly.
We are most willing to accommodate everyone at a time like this.
- Well, tell me, Mr. Bixby...
- I'm not Mr. Bixby.
Mr. Bixby has been dead for seven years.
I'm sorry.
It's quite all right.
We all make mistakes.
About Miss Merrova in here. Could you tell me who brought her in?
My dear young man, no one brought her in.
We went and got her.
- We were called by Dr. Flegg.
- Dr. Flegg?
Did the death certificate say she died of natural causes?
I believe so.
All right, Walt.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, I hope to see you again sometime.
- I'm sure you will.
The old fellow said that Flegg was the one who called to pick her up.
- What did you find out?
- Merrova's death was natural, all right.
Looks like we're stumped again.
Hello. Is the big mystery solved?
No. But it's after 1:00.
I think we better go home now.
Well, don't I even get anything to eat?
Yep. We'll go over to Gus' and get you a nice, big hamburger.
Hey, Wichita, ain't you found out what you're looking for yet?
No. Give me time, will you, Pinky?
Wichita, if the boss finds out about this,
I'll be pounding the pavement with you.
You sure you're gonna put all this junk back?
Yes. Will you go back to that door and shut up?
I'm taking an awful chance with you.
But I tell you, there's nothing on a guy named Quesne.
Well, there's got to be. I've seen his puss in some paper.
You tried every file but X, Y, and Z, and here's the final batch.
- I got it.
- What?
The guy.
Dr. Maurice Xavier. Dr. X.
Hey, that's the guy that starved that little kid to death, ain't it?
Yeah, he's the skunk who wanted to find out how long babies could go without eating.
"Surgeon held in starvation slaying. "
"Dr. Xavier to face trial. "
"Dr. X dies in electric chair. "
You mean to tell me you saw that guy walking around alive?
- Yeah.
- Now I know you're bats.
Hey, what are you doing? You can't take them clippings out of here.
Pinky, will you get me the file...
Hello, chief. I mean, ex-chief.
Hey, boss, it wasn't my fault.
Honest, I told him not to.
I thought I gave orders to you never to show your ugly pan around here again.
I knew you didn't mean it.
Well, this time you're going to regret knowing so much.
Now, wait a minute.
Get me the circulation department.
Tell them to send a couple of boosters up here.
I want this Wichita brainchild exterminated.
Now, wait a minute, boss. I've got a story that's going to crack the front page of every newspaper in America.
When you read it, you're gonna give me my job back.
- What do you have behind your back?
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Well.
- Circulations.
But it can't be.
This Dr. X was electrocuted.
Unless the execution didn't take place.
Oh, but it did. I phoned the warden and made sure.
Dr. Flegg came out and claimed the body, and the burial took place in Greenlawn Cemetery.
But, Walt, that's impossible.
Okay. Let's go out to the cemetery and find out tonight.
All right.
- I'll pick you up right after dinner.
- Okay.
How are we going to get into Xavier's grave?
It's against the law, you know.
I know the old caretaker in here. Leave it to me.
Well, sir, here we are.
Yep. That's it.
Well, let's start, eh?
Yeah.
Boy, I never heard nails sound like that before.
Well? What did I tell you? Empty.
I've been robbed.
No. There wasn't ever anything in that coffin to rob.
Well, let's go, Mike.
Thanks, Pop. Put it back, will you?
I'd like to hear what your friend,
Dr. Flegg, has to say about this.
At least we can give him a chance to explain.
It's true.
I'd hoped to keep it a secret until I'd completed my experiments.
There's no use in my denying it any longer.
Quesne and Dr. Xavier are one and the same.
Do you mean to tell us that you have discovered a way to bring a man back to life?
Yes.
- It's incredible.
- Is it?
Remember, a hundred years ago, anesthesia would have seemed equally incredible.
Even 50 years back, the possibility of x-ray would have astounded the world.
Twenty years ago, would anyone have believed that the living, pulsing human heart could be held in a surgeon's hand, operated on, and the patient walk again?
- But to revive a dead man.
- Yeah, I don't believe it.
You've told no one about your visit to the cemetery?
No, sir.
Then come with me.
After you, gentlemen.
You're fortunate. I had this equipment set up this afternoon for some additional experimentation.
This animal died this morning.
Double glioma.
Please satisfy yourself that he's quite dead.
Yeah.
He's dead, all right.
Too much emotion in your make-up, Garrett.
You never would have made a good surgeon.
An objective surgeon can't afford the luxury of feelings.
Yes, sir.
Well, Rhodes?
No question about it.
Rigor mortis has set in.
We'll now prepare the blood for decoagulation.
In Quesne's case, the electric chair made this step unnecessary.
His body was already prepared.
Now, if you gentlemen will step to the other side of that table, please.
This is ordinary rabbit blood, taken from the animal immediately after they die.
Rhodes, will you...
This is a special formula, my own composition.
The compound ester, in which essential blood salts have been precipitated.
Naturally, Quesne received a considerably larger dose.
And now are you satisfied?
That's good enough for me.
It's remarkable, Dr. Flegg.
Needless to say, it took a much greater period to revive Dr. X, but the procedure was essentially the same.
As you know,
I claimed the body and pretended to bury it in Greenlawn Cemetery.
But immediately after the execution,
I brought it here to the laboratory.
Suffice it to say that after six hours of the most intense work, his heart began to beat.
And in another hour, he opened his eyes and spoke to me.
Well, what I want to know is, why did you bring Xavier back to life?
He was a convicted murderer.
True, in the eyes of society, he was a murderer.
But he was also a medical genius.
And I felt that he had been a martyr to science.
Was that the only reason?
No. Not quite.
In addition to the experiments of the type you have just seen,
I needed him for further research.
Gentlemen, shall we go back to my office?
Well, gentlemen, if that's all, it's late. I'm getting a little tired...
One more thing I'd like to ask you, Doctor.
Could you revive anybody, no matter how they died?
Yes, I believe I could.
Then maybe you brought
Angela Merrova back to life.
Miss Merrova was a patient of mine, yes.
And maybe you know who killed her, too, huh?
I had nothing to do with that.
I'm interested in saving life, not in destroying it.
These further experiments you mentioned, what are they, Dr. Flegg?
Rhodes, surely you can understand.
After we've recreated life, the second and greater problem is to sustain it.
In order to do that, we must be able to give the person a new bloodstream.
For six years in that laboratory,
I've been striving to create a usable, workable, synthetic blood.
Synthetic blood?
That's the blood I found in Merrova's body.
That artificial quality was your synthetic blood.
And those phony stains in Rodgers' apartment.
Yes.
But why did she die, if you've created a synthetic blood?
But I haven't, Rhodes.
It's true that my formula will sustain life for a short period.
But unlike human blood, it fails to recreate itself.
Somehow, somewhere, the magic element of life has eluded me.
How is it that that Quesne manages to keep alive?
- Why I...
- I'll tell you how.
By killing for human blood.
Yes, but he had to.
He warned me. Told me he was dying.
Begged me to help him, but I refused.
Then I realized that my work had ended not in failure but in disaster.
Angela Merrova had been murdered.
Quesne saw her here in my office and knew that she was number one blood type.
The type he needed.
She was his first victim.
When I discovered what had happened,
I brought her back to life.
But I knew it was only for a short period.
Her death was inevitable.
Dr. Flegg, you knew this all the time and you didn't say anything to the police about it?
I wanted to.
But I was hoping every hour, every minute that I'd find the secret.
Thousands of lives could be saved if I could perfect my formula.
That's all over now.
Quesne will continue to kill until he's destroyed.
My experiments have turned into madness.
I've created a monster.
May God forgive me.
I'm sorry, Dr. Flegg.
There's no time to be sorry.
We've got to tell the police and I've got to get to my paper.
Goodbye, Dr. Flegg.
Mike, nothing like this has ever happened before.
It's the greatest story
I've ever had in my life.
- Hey. Hold on. Not so fast.
- Roy.
Gee, it's lucky we ran into you.
Yeah, lucky for me. I've been looking all over town for you two guys.
Cuff them, Moran.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
We haven't done anything.
No? What were you doing at
Greenlawn Cemetery tonight?
- We can explain that.
- Not to me you can't.
Snatching bodies is against the law.
Now, hold on minute, will you, Roy?
We got the answers to those murders. Now, listen...
Flegg.
You told them about me.
Yes.
In a few minutes, the police will be looking all over the city for you.
You might as well give yourself up.
No, you gave me this life and I'm going to keep it as long as I can.
I want that list of blood donors.
The addresses in that book of yours.
I won't give them to you.
Dr. Flegg?
Quesne.
The book.
He's got the book of addresses.
What's he talking about, Mike?
The list of blood donors. Joan's name's in that book and Quesne got it now.
Moran, you call an ambulance. Stay here and take charge of things.
- Come on, Roy. We need your help.
- All right.
Boys, you can get in my car.
- Paper.
- Miss Vance.
Yes?
My name is Quesne.
Dr. Rhodes was called to Dr. Flegg's home.
He asked me to meet you and bring you there.
- Thank you.
- I have a cab waiting.
It's all right.
Come on, come on, Lieutenant.
Can't you go any faster?
I thought Dr. Flegg lived on 86th Street.
He moved last week. Sutton Place.
Extra. Extra.
Say, buddy. Did you see Miss Vance tonight?
Yeah. Not more than a half hour ago.
A guy stopped her and talked to her and they got into
Shorty's cab and drove off.
- Was it a pasty-faced guy?
- Yeah, a funny looking mug.
You have any idea where they went?
Before the girl come, I heard him say to Shorty
- something about going to Jersey.
- Jersey?
Catch a gander at that.
That's an old duck club, just outside of Newark, the place where he starved that baby to death.
It all ties up, Mike.
Come on. Let's go.
Shouldn't we have turned there for Sutton Place?
I presume the driver knows a shorter way.
Really, there's no need for alarm.
No.
Of course not.
Come on now, will you, Roy?
You're not taking me to Dr. Flegg's.
That's quite right.
Dr. Rhodes didn't send you, either.
- On the contrary...
- You're lying.
Let me out of here.
Is this okay, boss?
Yes. This will do nicely.
- Looks like we walk from here.
- All right, let's go.
I wouldn't scream.
No one can hear you.
I'll take care of
Joan. Get after Xavier.
Ready, men?
Tell Dr. Rhodes we'll have to postpone our talk on blood composition.
But think what you're giving up.
You've got the makings of a great newspaperman in you.
And if you stick with me, you'll go places.
I'll give you a daily column to do.
You'll see your name in print 365 days in the year.
I'm having your contract drawn up now.
Say, how do you like that pipe?
Yeah, yeah. It's fine. But what about the contract? Will you sign it?
No, boss. I've got my novel to do.
I wanna get back.
Back to Wichita, where I can get close to the soil.
Well, I guess there's no use trying to keep you here.
But I'm disappointed in you,
Garrett. Terribly disappointed.
But no hard feelings.
Well, gee, I'm glad you feel that way about it, boss.
If you're ever around Wichita sometime
I hope you'll drop in and say hello.
- Here's the contract for Mr. Garrett.
- Thanks.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
- I don't think we'll be needing this.
Mr. Garrett has definitely decided to leave us.
Oh, really?
Oh, I'm awfully sorry you aren't going to be with us, Mr. Garrett.
Are you?
- That will be all, Miss Lawrence.
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Who was that?
- My new secretary.
Yes, I'm deeply disappointed in you.
- Any ink in that?
- There is today.
My boy, you'll never regret this. No, sir.
Okay, boss. I'll see you later.

Why do you make so many trips between Stockholm and Paris?
For business.
How long has this business been going?

What is the business? o o o oo

I suppose you might class this as ammunition for the Stockholm front.
These are the loveliest things we've ever had in the shop.
They're French. Paris.
At least you can claim a success at something.
Something that even a German brain can appreciate.
Madam, am I to be insulted like this?
Is it a crime to be German?
It's worse. It's a vulgarity.
Colette, I will not have this quarrelling.
- I don't want French women here.
- Ha.
Nor German women.
I want saleswomen. Ring for Anatole.
Filthy. Anatole, have you swept up this morning?
Assuredly, madam.
Anatole...
What can one do with a broom as bare as the behind of a burgomaster's baby?
Show it to me.
- The broom.
- Certainly, madam.
And take this.
We're going to the Countess Lindström.
My hat and cape, please, Maude.
You see, madam?
Yes.
I can see that it must have taken a lot of hard work to reduce it to this condition.
Get your cap.
Perhaps I should render more satisfaction with a mechanical sweeper such as are used in the better shops.
- Is the Countess ready for me?
- Will you go right in, please?
Thank you.
Good evening, gentlemen.

Charming young women are when they give you something you can't get from anyone else.
Oh, if it were only for me, I wouldn't cavil.
Ah, Major, if it were only for you, I wouldn't charge. ut I'm responsible to Headquarters.
And I'm responsible to my partners in Paris, who are risking their lives and mine.

I got seven days' leave in Paris.
Good. And then?
That's all.
Where were K124 and 5?
I wish I knew.
I have a strong notion that I was under observation myself.
Our system needs drastic reorganisation, especially in the neutral countries.
Slesser, you take over Copenhagen, and understand this - you'll be judged by results.
And for Stockholm, we need the best man we've got in Section 8.
Is that so?
- Doctor Muller, you are a physician?
- Yes.
You've come to Sweden for the German medical service.
To look after our prisoners returning from Russia.
You signed an undertaking at our consulate in erlin to refrain from any political activity.
Certainly.
It's my duty to remind you of that undertaking, and welcome to Sweden.
Thank you.

Could you tell us what a razilian girl'd say?

- Ha, that's where we've got you.
Why? Why, why? Lupita? Who's Lupita?
Get her, get her, get her, yes.

Don't be discouraged.
Oh, You eautiful Doll
Hello, ill. What are you laughing at?
The bloke in the bar just pulled a most amazing stunt.
And what was it?
He writes down in advance what any girl will say after he kisses her.
- Does he get it right?
- Every time.
- Oh, come on.
- How on earth could he do that?
There are probably only about a half a dozen things a girl of that kind will say. ut how does he get the right one?
I imagine he writes them all down on slips of paper, and fills his pockets before he comes out.

"I wish you'd teach my husband. "
What have you to say?
Let's dance.
How did you find me out?
- It was Madeleine.
- Madeleine? Who is Madeleine?
One of your crowd?
Oh, no she has a shop, very chic.
Look, there she is.
Dancing with the English boy.
This is one of the times
I'm sorry I left that arm in France.
You're doing pretty well with the one you've got.
- Oh, thnat's Madeleine?
- Mm-hm.
Was I engaged as an engine driver?
No. Do I get an engine driver's wages?
Huh, assuredly not.
Come along, clumsy.
Who are you to give me orders?
She can't help it, Anatole, it's her German blood.
I happen to be Viennese.
Same thing in waltz time, sauerkraut.
Frogspawn.
Gertrude, Colette, I will not have my shop turned into a beer garden.
I'm sick of the French.
I never want to see a German again.
Then I'd better go.
Oh, no, please come in.
I was only trying to prevent my shop being turned into a battlefield.
- What can I show you?
- Oh, just a bag.
Gertrude, show madam a bag, will you?
Whnat kirnd of a bag madam?
Arn EvErnirng bag
That'll do, Anatole.
How about this, madam?
It's one of the nicest we have in the shop.
Karh do you hikE thnis?
Charming.
Ah, lie there, you roaring beast.
That's the dress, the shoes, stockings, hair ornament, and the bag.
They match the bag beautifully, madam.
Dress, shoes, stockings, hair ornament, and the bag.
This way to our fitting room, please.
You have marvellous saleswomen.
- They do their best.
- They are better than that.
A girl comes in for a bag, and goes out with the whole shop.
A girl who goes out shopping with a man means to have the whole shop.
How much do I owe you? y the way, why did you give away my little trick last night? ecause you claim to know such a lot about women.
Do you?
Enough to realise I know nothing about them.
Which means that you've had a lot of experience.
Oh, a lot. ut what does it amount to?
1,2T5 krona.
I brought you a very good customer today.
He doesn't care how he spends his money.
Oh, one has only to look at madam to see that.
You won't give away my next trick so easily,
I promise you.
Send the things to the Grand Hotel at once.
Certainly, madam.
Au revoir, Madeleine.
Karl, I have bought everything I want.
Have you?

Will you please convince the lady outside?
Go on, call me a liar. Go on, say it.
You daren't. All right...
Get out Go to your shopkeeper.
That's the first sensible thing you've said.
May I tell you how very sorry I am for what happened today?
Oh, don't apologise.
We keep a shop, and it's open to everyone.
Plain women, or dazzling beauties.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And if you could ever take pity on a lonely man... dorn't haughn at mE

You would be doing a great kindness.

Packed with dazzling beauties.
Excuse me.
Hello. Is that you, ob?
Tonight at T.0, at the Grand?
No pity?
I'm sorry.
All right, ob, at T.0.
All right, Madeleine, you're an angel.
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- She's from Maloja.
Her father's farm was destroyed to make way for Swiss frontier defences.
I'll double-check all that when I get to London.
She's a sweet thing, and I hate to suspect her, but she's got a lot of German friends.
She's got a lot of French friends, and one or two English friends.
Yes, I know. That's what's got me guessing.

What do you know about him?

Funny, he doesn't look that type.
What makes you think so?

Hm, you may well ask.

Change of habit, that's what I mean.
It used to be all girls with no clothes.
Now it's all clothes with no girls.
Pity.
Nice.
- I'll have this one for my collection.
- You can't. Oh, no.
They've just arrived from Paris. Madame will want to show them to our best customer.
- I am your best customer.
- Oh, no, you're not.
Now then, will you pack this one...
...this one... and this one for the Countess Lindström.
Yes, madam.
That's all very well.
- What's left for me?
- Everything else in the shop.
All right. Pack it up.
Karl, this nonsense must stop. uying things you don't want as an excuse to come here.
- You won't come out with me...
- I won't sell you anything else.
- That means you forbid me to come here.
- Precisely.
All right Madeleine, I lose.
No, Karl, you win.
- Tonight?
- All right.
I have a feeling I shall be sorry for this.
- Colette, tell Anatole I'm ready, will you?
- Yes, madam.
You're a shrewd one.
No, I don't claim to be any cleverer than the next man, only the next man's always a bigger fool than I am.
Now then, lazybones, you've got to go out with these frock s.
Frock s? What do they want frock s for?
Fig leaf was good enough for Eve, and she was the first lady in the land.
Gertrude, I've forbidden the aron to buy another thing, so mind you're firm with him.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I knew she'd put a stop to this one day.
Well, no lady would ever accept presents from a man anyhow.
Of course not.
Oh Oh, my favourite scent.
Well, every woman has her price.
And what might that be?
Phew This is an expensive shop.

Tonight the crickets are calling
Along the woodland lanes
O, listen to me and you shall hear
A story that's terribly old
And each little star above you, dear
Is tired of hearing it told...
Coffee, please.
Coffee, please.
You've got a successful rival.
Oh?
The gallant aron.
Is that all?
That's all. What did you find out in London?
Nothing definite. ut I've got a call to make.
Hello.
Hello, give me the police.
Are you still sorry you came out with me that first evening?
Yes. That's why I've been out with you
1 evenings since.
And you've discovered all the secrets of my dark soul.
- Sugar?
- Two, please.
Go on, tell me how bad I am.
It is easy to touch your pocket, but difficult to touch your heart.
True.
Manners good.
- Milk?
- Thank you. lack.
Intentions - lamentable.
How true.
When you're with one woman, you're thinking of the next.
You've never been simple, sincere, loyal or faithful to any woman in your life.
Go on.
- Isn't that enough?
- You've forgotten my most important asset.
What's that?
That you love me.
Why are you trying to resist?
You won't succeed.
How do you know I won't? ecause I tried... but I couldn't.
I want to take you away.
Away from your friends, your business.
No time for anyone but me.
You want to take everything?
And give everything.
And share everything.
Mustn't you, if you marry?
Madeleine Goddard, you're wanted at police headquarters.
You identify the man?
Do you know anything of his life?
Only that he was a most faithful and devoted servant.
Quite, in business hours. ut you had no reason to suspect him of pro-German activities?
How could I?
He hated them.
Some interesting German correspondence was found on him, however.
Let me see, Miss Goddard.
You are Swiss, aren't you?
Yes. h supposE you hnavE dEahirngs withn a good marny GErmarns dorn't you?
I have clients of all nationalities.
And yet you had no idea that the faithful and devoted Anatole was a spy?
- She's already said...
- Silence, please.
I beg your pardon.
Is it necessary to distress the lady any further?
I'm sorry to press the question, but I must have all the information you can give the court.
Willingly, but I can only tell you that I've lost a friend.
Thank you. That is all for the present.
- Do you know who did it?
- Possibly someone from the Cherry Orchard.
It's terrible.
Something much more terrible has happened.
It was all lies.
What?
- Your information about the counteroffensive.
- ut there was an attack.
Yes, and our army stopped it, but it stopped the wrong attack.
ThnE rEah ornE camE irn arnothnErpart of thnE hirnE whnErE our troops hnad bEErn withndrawrn thnarnks to your irnformatiorn
Your partners in Paris are either incompetent, or working for French counterespionage.
That's impossible.
- What do you think went wrong?
- I don't know, but you're going to find out.
You go to Paris.
No, Doco o
You forget what happened here tonight.
It's suicide.
It's duty.
- ut I'm Swiss.
- You're a member of our organisation.
You know what that means.
What are my orders?
You will find out what's gone wrong with our organisation, and what has become of K124 and 5.
You'll get detailed instructions in due course.
You leave tomorrow by the Gothenburg boat.
You will be getting her another porter.
The Grand Hotel, please.
Is that the Grand Hotel?
Can I sp...
Hello, hello?
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
The boat train leaves in half an hour, doesn't it?
Yes, aron.
Thank you.
Madeleine Goddard, will you step this way, please?
Please sit down.
What made you come to France again?
Er... for business.
Wat bts ss?
There were difficulties with my firm. Cottin.
What difficulties?
W t r prcs ar too g, v foor art
- Couldn't you write?
- I did, without much success.
Madeleine Goddard, you go to Paris under escort. You are under arrest.
- Are your sympathies with France?
- No.
- With Germany?
- No, I'm a neutral.
There's a German secret service in Stockholm?
- Yes.
- ow did you krnow?
Well, everyone knows.
There's a French and ritish one too.
Have you met anybody belonging to the German service?
I may have. One never knows in Stockholm.
You had an employee called uh...
Anatole ergen.
- I had.
- Was he a member of the German service?
The Swedish police seem to think so.
- ut you never knew?
- No, I never knew.
Very well.
You will remain under arrest for the moment.
My business house may be anxious.
- Would you send a word to Maison Cottin?
- That can be arranged.
Thank you.
Ah, Madeleine, how was the journey?
- Any submarines about?
- Oh, the usual number. And how's Paris?
- Oh, the war, you know.
- Monsieur Cottin.
Oh, Madeleine, my dear,
I'm delighted to see you.
I've got lots of new models to show you, and I'm sure that all our little differences can be quite easily smoothed out.
Nice calm trip?
Well, the weather was calm enough.
Usual hold-ups, you know.
Yes, not very pleasant travelling in wartime.
So glad to see you. I'm afraid your reception was hardly what at you had a right to expect.
Oh, I don't know. I...
The Medaille Militaire.
The highest award that France can give one of her soldiers.
Your Excellency, I...
That represents the real feelings of a grateful country.
It'll be in my safekeeping until the day comes when you can wear it.
And may that be soon.
Why did they send you back again?
They say my partners in Paris are either incompetent, or working for the French counterespionage.
I should prefer them to think we are incompetent.
Do they know about K124 and 5?
That's what they've sent me to find out.
Firing squad?

Uhn hnuhn hrn thnE cErntrah post officE
Poor soul.
- Your Excellency, forgive me.
- Forgive you for what?
Don't send me back to Stockholm.
We need you.
Haven't I done enough?
Too much to fail us now.
I can't face it, I can't.
After three years of misery, to pretend, to cheat, to lie - it's degrading.
Is it because of Marwitz?
What do you know about him?
Only that he has been taking up a great deal of your time.
All right, I'll meet you halfway.
Make this one last effort, and you can come back to France for good.
- And what is the last effort?
- Find out who's the head of Section 8. ut isn't it Doctor Muller?
I don't know.
There's another German in Stockholm that I'm rather interested in.
This is for your information.
You must think me a prize fool.
- You do the ritish Intelligence an injustice.
- At least I shall know who's who in Stockholm.
Well, now you know, please forget.
I've already forgotten
Madeleine Goddard's name.
Everybody's Doing It Now
- An entree?
- Côte de veau napolitaine avec des pois.
And the sweet?
Pot de creme au chocolatine.
- Half an hour.
- Very good, aron.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Thank you, Karl, a lovely dinner.
- We've started cocktails.
- ack in circulation?
I'm afraid not.
In confidence, some officers arrived this evening from Siberia, prisoners of war going home.
What of it?
They haven't seen a girl for three years.
All right, Karl,
I know your shop girl came home today. ollinger '06. ht's a bEar it's a bEar it's a bEar
WhnErE?
To your everlasting love that didn't last three week s.
- ut it did.
- Yes, please.
To your marriage vows, which are forgotten. ut they are not.
Then why are you looking at me as if you'd never seen me before? ecause I'm not sure I have.
Yes, please.
Stopped by a submarine, arrested, grilled by the Paris police, and there you sit, this slip of a girl, looking as if it were all in the day's work.
What of it?
You frighten me.
- I suppose I'm a coward.
- Nonsense.
What have you been doing while
I've been flirting with death and destruction?
Oh, trembling for you, and wondering what I should do when you return.
And have you made up your mind?
I told you I was a coward.
- Prisoners of war?
- Yes, from Siberia.
- Oh.
- Who is it?
One of my best friends, Otto von erndorf.
Hello, Otto.
I read that you were a deserter.
You...
M A N Wat's rog, Otto?
Wat's t attr r?
- Gentlemen, please.
- Ask him if you want satisfaction.
- Gentlemen, please.
- That's all right.
Orchestra. Please, orchestra.
What did you run away for?
Why spoil a perfectly wonderful evening?
There's a greater force than all the armies in the world - stupidity. did you warnt a pubhic brawh?
I wanted to see you kill that man.
Oh, Madeleine
Kill a decent boy on his first night out after three years in Siberia?
Come, Madeleine, where is your sense of humour, hm?
Well, at least I've succeeded in convincing you that I am a coward.
You have.
Good night.
Very well, if that's how you feel.
Good night.
- Karh?
- Hm?
I think you're the bravest man who ever served his country.
That's very sweet of you. ut how do I serve my country?
As a deserter?
As head of Section 8 of the German Intelligence.
When did you find out?
Tonight at the Grand Hotel.
And why do you tell me? ecause you must know that I am in the German Service too.
I know more than that.
I know that you're not Swiss, you're French.
I know your name isn't Goddard, but Montdenis, and I know that you have outwitted us for three years while you were serving your country...
...as I served mine.
Thank God.
No more lies.
Thank God.
And now I want you to take me away.
Away from my friends and business, from everyone but you.
That's my dream.
Where shall we go?
A villa on the Mediterranean, near Nice.
That's France and I'm German.
There's Switzerland.
How shall we get there? y walking down the trenches, and getting out at the end?
This is a lovely spot.
Hm, right in the middle of the revolution.
Here it is. o Go
The bluest blue in the world.
And the mountains are reflected in the water, and the music of the cowbells floats across the meadows.
And the guns roar day and night.
So, this is the end of the dream?
That's the end.

Gentlemen,
Captain Von Marwitz is the head of Section 8.
SchnaffEr
Schaffer, you will go back to erlin tomorrow, and report for duty.
These are your orders, and you'll have to be quick and clever.
- ob, I need your help desperately.
- Yes, I was warned you might.
It's all right, Miss Goddard.
I went with you to Paris.
Well, what's happened?
- I found out who's the head of Section 8.
- Who?
Von Marwitz.
He'd found out who I am too.
- The devil he has.
- Oh, ob, I must get away from here.
You remember what happened to the others?
Don't you worry. We'll get you out of this.
- How about going into hiding?
- Impossible.
There's nowhere in Sweden where they wouldn't find me.
M o o o No
Same thing.
- ThnErE's rnot a sirnghE phacE
- Shush, don't talk.
Faber? That gang wouldn't fancy coming into conflict with the Swedish police.
- Last thing they'd care to risk.
- It's all right.
You're going to be as safe as a church if you do as I tell you. Now, here's the programme.
- Cognac.
- Evening, gentlemen.
- We're buying.
- What?
0 men and women, tomorrow morning.
What for?
To go shopping.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.
Good morning. Will you come this way?
Move fast, but not till everyone's inside.
- They should all be in now.
- What about the cars?
- They'll be outside the shop.
- Right, let everybody be cheerful, a gay crowd.
And above all, no trouble with the police.
Who put the sale notice on the window?
Hello, hello, hello?
Hello, hello?
This way, Madeleine.
Your customers are waiting for you.
There's a dress in the window.
I want you to let me have a look at it.
- Madeleine Goddard?
- Yes.
Come with me.

Someone denounced her as a French agent.
The police arrived and arrested her.
Hm.
That means she'll sail from Gothenburg.
See to it.
You can unlock the door when you're outside the three-mile limit.
What are you doing there?
Oh, 12.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
I want to see your passengers, Captain.
Come with me.
- You can't do this.
- This is a neutral ship.
And this lady's a non-combatant.
She has a Swiss passport, but she's not Swiss.
She is a French citizen, and a member of the French Intelligence.

He'll be interned for the duration.
Karl?
I'll be waiting.
I can't hear you.
I'll be waiting.
Are you all right, sir?
Better ask my nurse.
My English is not good enough for me to know.
That daughter of mine seems to be knocking
'em cold before her time, doesn't she?
"Knocking them cold"?
What does it mean?
It's just an expression.
Lucky if you didn't catch your death of cold.
Hello, Louis. Whoo!
Good thing you didn't lose your head.
- Sorry I upset you.
- Don't mind. It was a very awk... awkward moment.
Come along now.
We've been here quite long enough.
Well, I think I must go back to the hotel now.
- No more jumping?
- No, that was my last chance.
Oh. Your fault, terrible woman!
It wasn't.
It was a silly little dog.
I might have been killed, you know.
You realize my last day here might have been my last day on earth?
- Your last day here?
- Mm-hmm.
You're not leaving tonight, are you, Louis?
I'm afraid yes, by the last train.
- Oh, Uncle Louis.
- Why do you call me "uncle"?
Well, you're just like an uncle, aren't you?
- How dare you, miss!
- We shall miss you, Louis.
Mummy will cry her eyes out.
- Won't she, Daddy?
- Yes, dear.
- Do you think so?
- Oh, she adores you.
- Doesn't she, Daddy?
- Yes, dear.
I'm desolate to go.
As it is my last night... would you and your charming wife accept to have dinner with me tonight?
- She'd love it. Both of us.
- Good.
- Uncle Louis?
- Hmm?
- I get awfully hungry in the evening.
- Yes, you get awfully sleepy too, darling.
Long after your bedtime, my child.
Oh, let me sit up.
I'll sleep overtime tomorrow.
- We'll ask your mother.
- Oh, yes. Let's.
- Where is Jill?
- Mm.
She's working off the finals of the clay-pigeon shooting.
- I see.
- I do hope she wins, don't you?
- Who is against her?
- That fellow Ramon.
- Aha.
- Well, then, she's got to win.
- Don't like him, Trouble?
- Do you?
I don't know. He's all right.
He's a bit of a bore, but he means well, doesn't he?
Why don't you like him?
He's got many too many teeth and... and too much brilliantine.
- Sworn enemies, eh?
- You English have such a sense of humor.
Well, I can't say that I hope you'll win.
I'm sure that you will.
You're so beautiful. So clever.
Yes, well, let's get on with it, shall we?
Well, are you ready?
- Mummy, may I stay up tonight?
- Oh, darling, ask me presently.
Oh, say yes now, just for luck.
You little wretch. Look.
Here's that broach you wanted.
Now will you run away and be quiet?
- Oh!
- Shh!
Daddy, don't you like it?
Mummy gave it to me.
- Shut up, darling.
- Shh! - Sorry.
Hello.
Oh, tough luck!
I'm not a baby.
Let that be a lesson to you:
Never have any children.
- That was your fault, fathead.
- It wasn't!
Betty.
You know your child's going to cost me the match, don't you?
She's your child as well as mine, isn't she?
- If I lose this game, I'll disown her forever. - Shh!
I am sorry that you lost,
Madame Lawrence... but I am delighted that I won, if you understand me.
You're a marvelous shot, and I know what I'm talking about.
You'll make me blush.
We must have another battle one day.
Shall we?
I shall live for that moment.
Well, you would have this child.
Oh, Madame Lawrence, you English are extraordinaire.
Ah! My love!
- Ah, my darling.
- My lunch.
- You can keep your brat.
- Thank you.
I'm just going off with another man.
Darling, you go to bed early... with Betty.
Poor Daddy.
Sir, you have beaten my wife, and she has gone off with another man.
- You are a dirty dog.
- You are as comical as your charming wife.
Is that Mummy's knitting?
- Yes. Why?
- Donnez-moi.
Bung it over.
- Go on, Louis. Perform.
- What do you mean?
Do your stuff.
What do you think of the average Englishman?
Much too cold... except when he drinks too much, of course.
Is that jumper for him?
Of course it is.
Did you think it was for you?
- It's a memento.
- To wear over my beating heart.
- Is this thing fireproof?
- Daddy, don't!
Oh, look.
I'm sorry.
Quick!
Tell Bob... my room... a brush in my room.
Take it to the British consul... or to... Gibson.
Louis!
Don't breathe...
Don't breathe a word... to anyone.
Betty, will you be a good girl and run up to bed?
- Go along, darling. Buzz off.
It's all right. - All right.
- It's a bullet.
- ... smashed the window.
- Any letters?
- Yes, sir. Two.
- Bob.
- What's the matter, love?
- He's dead. It's horrible.
- Good God.
Listen, there's something behind all this.
Pull yourself together.
He said you were to go to straight to his room. Something about a brush.
Here's the key.
He gave it to me.
- Bob, what can this all mean?
- Well, we'll soon find out.
- Good evening. Is anything the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- If I were you, and I found some...
- Come on. Hand it over. -
Pardon, sir, but no doubt there is some explanation.
- Of what?
- Of why... why you were in that room.
Monsieur Bernard's room.
It is irregular.
Oh, yes, that.
That... That's easy to explain.
Anything I can do to help?
Can you get the British consul on the phone, please?
- No doubt, but first...
- Yes, first.
I've got something very vital to tell him.
- The British consul?
- Yes, please.
Perhaps it will better if you will kindly come to my private room for a moment.
- Of course I will. Certainly.
- Thank you very much.
- It is the purest formality.
- Yes, of course.
- You will pardon me, but in my position...
- Of course. It's quite all right.
This way, sir, please.
You won't forget that I want to speak to the British consul on the phone, will you?
Presently, mein Herr.
Certainly. At once.
- I must go in and talk to my wife.
- I'm very sorry... but the commissary wishes to see each one separately.
It is formal.
But you know him well.
He was your friend.
Yes, he was, but we knew very little of him. Hardly anything.
Excuse me. Do you, um...
Can you tell me if the British consul is in town today?
Ich verstehe nicht.
Can you... The British...
Der britische Konsul...
You know, the man who copes with parcels... is he here?
- Hier?
- Ja, er ist ein Herr.
No, I don't mean is he a Herr, a man.
Is he here?
Hier? Nein.
Uh, listen.
Is he here in St. Moritz?
Look... der britische Konsul...
Est-ce qu'il est...
Est-il ici aujourd'hui?
Oh, damn.
I can't remember how far he was standing from the window.
- Everything was so sudden.
- Think, madame.
You must let me go in and talk to my wife.
But you cannot, sir. The commissary is giving orders. He is in charge here.
What can I do?
Please excuse.
But, uh...
- Sie d黵fen hier nicht rein.
- Now, listen.
- If you don't mind, I must...
- Was?
Herr Lawrence. Please.
Oh, thanks so much.
It was left at the desk of the hall porter.
It was marked "very urgent."
Thank you. That's fine.
...before he died.
Remember that, madame.
Wait a minute.
- He said you have to go.
- I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I've got a message for my wife.
The, uh... The Michisons can't come to lunch tomorrow.
Perhaps we'd better put the other people off too.
What is that note? Give to me.
I've nothing to add to what I've already said, Inspector. Nothing whatever.
It's no use talking like that,
Mr. Lawrence. It just won't do.
Now, uh, on March the 10th... you and Mrs. Lawrence went to Switzerland.
Thank you. Yes.
To St. Moritz.
Yes.
With your little daughter.
- Yes. Whiskey and soda?
- Oh, thank you.
On March the 19th, you returned to London.
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.
- Sorry.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
You returned to London... without your little daughter.
- Yes. One for you?
- Thank you.
Where is she?
- Staying with her aunt.
- Oh? What's this aunt's name?
Mary.
And where is she staying with this aunt?
In Paris.
- Street and number?
- It's a complicated French name.
Rather difficult for an English person to remember, I'm afraid.
- One for you?
- Thank you.
By the way... why were you so upset the night you left Switzerland?
I'm not aware as I was upset.
Was it because your child had been... kidnapped?
And another thing.
My point is this...
He's not the sort of chap to give things away and lose his head... and spill the beans, and all that sort of business.
See what I mean?
- When I was in the navy...
- Is that train electric?
Yes. Twenty volts.
Best present I ever gave the kid.
- Doesn't play with it much now, does she?
- She never did.
You never gave her the chance.
I say, you mustn't get jumpy.
Really, you mustn't.
What I mean to say is, uh, once you begin that sort of thing... lose grip and, uh... and...
I know.
I'm all right.
Oh, Clive... you've got Pullmans and coal trucks on the same train.
Good Lord, I have!
- So is that your last word, sir?
- Absolutely.
I'm sorry to have to say it, sir, but I don't believe you.
It's your duty as a citizen,
Mr. Lawrence.
- Thanks for calling.
- You may be sorry.
Don't drop in again.
Hello, are you still here?
You lost your whistle or something?
I'm not a policeman.
My name's Gibson.
I'm secretary to Sir Norman Wood at the Foreign Office.
Oh, really?
Never heard of him.
However, how do you do?
Your friend Louis was one of our people...
Special Service.
- You didn't know that, did you?
- I'm afraid not, no.
You didn't happen to find anything in this brush, did you?
Nothing much.
I'm terribly busy...
But enough to justify somebody kidnapping your child to keep your mouth shut.
- I never said so.
- Nonsense.
When Louis Bernard was killed, there was a paper in this brush.
How terribly thrilling.
Darling, you haven't told them anything, have you?
Not yet, Mrs. Lawrence, but I think he's just about to.
Jill, dear, this is Mr. Gibson of the Foreign Office come to see us.
How do you do?
Oh, I...
Of course, I quite understand.
But I think if you'll listen to me, you'll appreciate why I have to bother you.
Has either of you heard of a foreign statesman of the name of Ropa?
- I don't think so. Have we, dear?
- R-O-P-A.
- No.
- If you haven't heard of him...
I suppose it doesn't worry you much if he's likely to be assassinated.
What's that got to do with us?
A little patience, Mrs. Lawrence, and I think you'll see.
Louis Bernard was killed... because he knew of a plot to assassinate Ropa.
A few hours later, your child was kidnapped. Why?
Because by that time you were in possession of that vital information.
It was written on the piece of paper you found in Bernard's shaving brush.
Mr. Lawrence, Ropa is in London, and an attempt may be made on his life.
My department must protect him. Now, will you tell me what was on that paper?
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't.
But I can tell you what was written on another piece of paper... that our child had been kidnapped... and if we spoke, we'd never see her again.
It's her life against this fellow Ropa's.
Why should we care if some foreign statesman... we'd never even heard of were assassinated?
Tell me: In June 1914... had you ever heard of a place called Sarajevo?
Of course you hadn't. I doubt if you'd even heard of the Archduke Ferdinand.
But in a month's time, because a man you'd never heard of... killed another man you'd never heard of... in a place you'd never heard of, this country was at war.
- But...
- Don't tell him, Bob.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gibson, but we're not interested.
What you've told us may be true, but our child's in danger.
That comes first. It must come first.
You see that, don't you?
Mrs. Lawrence, do you realize the type of men we're dealing with?
Do you think they draw the line at murder?
Besides, how do you know the child's alive? How do you know they...
All right. Hold on a minute.
Someone on the phone in the hall.
It's about... about Betty.
- Switch it through here.
- All right. I will.
Hold on a minute.
- Hello?
- Good afternoon, Mr. Lawrence.
Please listen very carefully.
We don't want to interrupt your chat... with the gentleman from the Foreign Office... but we think we ought to remind you that if you tell him anything... you will never see your child again.
Just a final warning.
- Yes, but I I want...
- Bob, what is it?
Somebody playing the fool or something. Hello?
If you think somebody's fooling you... perhaps you'd like to speak to the child yourself.
Hello, Daddy.
Betty!
Hello, my darling.
Hello, Mother. Is that you?
Are you all right?
- Yes, Mummy.
- Plenty to eat?
Ask her where she is.
Yes, Mummy.
- Are you getting on without me, Mummy?
- I'm missing you terribly, darling.
Uncle Clive and I have been... been playing with your trains.
Ask her where she is.
Mummy, I want to come home!
Oh, I do want to come home!
So you shall, darling.
Very soon.
- Ask her where she is.
- I'll come and fetch you.
Darling... where are you?
Mummy, they don't let me...
Darling?
Betty!
Steady, old girl, steady.
Did either of you recognize the first voice that spoke?
Oh, for God's sake!
I'm sorry, but can't you leave us alone?
Wouldn't it be possible to trace that call?
No, the telephone people would never tell.
Hello?
Give me Special, please, quickly.
Hello? This is G speaking.
Were you listening? Where did the last call to this number come from?
Wapping? A public call box.
Notify Scotland Yard to have a plainclothesman posted... on every corner of the district.
Well, get them from other districts!
Wapping... does that convey anything to you?
Nothing whatever.
Well, if there is any trouble,
I hope you'll remember you're to blame.
Not a very nice thing to have on your conscience.
It's all right, Bob.
I'll see him out.
Ask Lawrence to talk it over again when I'm gone.
- You know where to ring me if you want me.
- Yes, thanks.
Good-bye.
- Clive, here a minute.
- Yes?
- Are you coming?
- Where to?
- Wapping.
- Of course.
- I'll get our hats and coats and things.
- Why?
You know those plainclothesmen that Gibson ordered?
If these blokes who've got Betty see them, they'll think we've given them away.
- Our only chance is to act ourselves, double quick. - I'm coming too.
No, darling. You stay here.
Keep on the end of that telephone.
If there's any news, we'll get through to you.
Oh, darling, I can't risk losing both... both of you.
Come on. Blow your nose.
You won't lose either of us.
- What about your food?
- Leave me a bowl on the mat.
Here, do you want this?
There can't be many
George Barbors in Wapping.
I couldn't drink another one in that pub anyway. Come on.
Look.
What? Are they plainclothesmen over there?
All right. Come along.
- In we go.
- No, just a minute.
What?
- Think these things are all right?
- No, you look terrible.
I say, Clive, any questions asked, we're just off a boat.
Good idea.
When I was in the navy...
- How are your teeth?
- Hmm?
It seems a pity. Come on.
- Let's make a dash for it.
- Right-o.
- A bit grim, isn't it?
- Yes.
Good evening.
My pal here's got a rather bad toothache.
Ah. I'll look at it.
All right. Come along.
Here.
- Oh!
- Oh, poor old boy.
- Five shillings.
- Five shillings.
Give him five shillings for me, will you, please?
Just a minute.
Better have a look at mine while we're about it.
- What's wrong?
- I've had terrible toothache today.
- Have a look at them, will you?
- Yes.
You stay outside and keep your mouth shut.
Please.
Has he arrived?
Not yet.
- Just off the ship?
- Yes.
- Which one?
- Saxon.
Mm.
She's not due until tomorrow.
Oh, no, I...
I got off at, um...
I got off at Tilbury.
Came on by train.
Tough skipper, old Turner.
Not half.
Left her last voyage.
Yes, of course, that's right. I...
- What I meant was...
- I was wrong.
The voyage before last.
Yes, of course.
Slipped my memory.
Nothing much wrong with your teeth.
I think you're right.
It's not hurting as much as it was.
I'll be off.
Wait.
- Why? What's the trouble?
- There's one there better come out.
- I think I'll chance it.
- Sit down.
Doesn't a doctor have to do that?
Has he come?
Oh, there you are.
Had a good crossing?
No. Sick all the way.
It is the last time I let myself be smuggled into this country... for you or anybody else.
You will be smuggled, my friend, when, how, and where...
I'm pleased for you to be smuggled.
Yes?
It's your fault for having such a wonderful aim with your gun.
You must pay the price for your genius.
Everything ready for tonight?
I have arranged a box for you... most conveniently placed.
Any trouble with the charming Miss Lawrence?
As quiet as a little mouse.
And where is the little mouse now?
Oh, in a little... a little hole in the ground somewhere.
You shall see.
- Your last job tonight?
- No, first.
Clive, which way did they go?
- Where's Betty? Found out anything?
- Yes.
- Shall I give Jill a ring?
- No, no. Come along. Hurry.
- You sure they went in there?
- Must have. Almost certain.
I say, Clive. Look.
- What are they, Bob?
- Sun worshippers.
Probably they've got nothing on.
Come on. Let's go.
# Praised be the source of light #
# The sun whose bonny ray #
# Sends forth all power and might #
# And life doth call away #
# Clive, Clive, Clive #
# That woman at the end #
# Half left to you and me #
# What is the row, old man #
# I don't see #
# What you mean #
# La, la, la, la #
# Stand by #
# There's trouble #
# Coming soon ##
Perhaps those who may be among us tonight for the first time... and who have not yet become initiated into the mysteries... of the First Circle of the Seventh Old Ray... may be wondering what is going to happen now.
I will tell them.
Before proceeding to the mysteries, which are only for the initiate... it is of course necessary for the minds and souls of us all... to become purged and to be made clean.
I'm therefore going to ask anyone here who is not in tune with us... to submit to a very simple process of control.
Merely place him- or herself under the guidance of the Fourth Circle.
Is there anyone here tonight who would care...
Perhaps you.
Relax.
Keep your eyes fixed on this light.
Keep them fixed.
Before receiving the First Degree... of the Seventh Old Ray... your mind must be white and blank.
You are already feeling sleepy.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.
Your mind is becoming quite blank.
You feel that, don't you?
Quite, quite blank.
Yes.
Quite... blank.
I think that will do for the moment.
Will all those who are not of the Fourth Circle... please leave as quietly as possible?
You're not going to leave your friend, sir... are you?
Hello.
Good evening.
I hope you weren't very rough with him.
You see, he's subject to apoplexy.
- Who?
- "Who"?
Poor old George Barbor down at Wapping.
Is it all right in here?
Thank you.
I ought to have mentioned it to you, perhaps.
You should learn to control your fatherly feelings... and not drop things on the floor, please.
Mm.
Collected our brother's little offering yet, have you?
Oh, sir, I forgot.
Pardon me.
Dangerous.
Perhaps you would care to join our little circle now, Mr. Lawrence.
- Yes?
- Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Why, if it isn't our friend the sharpshooter.
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Lawrence.
Thank you.
Nice to see you.
Is my young daughter ready to go home yet?
Oh, no, sir. She's asleep...
No shooting!
You don't want the police here, do you?
Start playing that organ, or they'll hear this noise outside.
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Through the window! Phone Jill!
Tell her to go to the Albert Hall!
Call the police!
Sorry.
Please forgive me.
Get on to Mrs. Lawrence.
Tell her if she goes to the Albert Hall tonight, her child is...
Come on.
- Let me get...
- Ho!
Mr. Lawrence, please.
Who?
- Hello?
- Hello.
- Clive!
- L-Listen, Jill.
You know that chap we were looking for?
Yes. "A. Hall."
It isn't a chap at all.
No, it's the real hall. Albert Hall.
- The Albert Hall!
- Betty... we're on to her all right.
Bob says you're to go to the Albert Hall.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
You're to do what you can. That's where it's happening. You're to stop it.
- But... but when...
- No, no, no. No time now.
Must get off for the police.
Hello.
Is that Mrs. Lawrence?
Mrs. Lawrence? I'm afraid she's just this minute gone out.
Will that be all for tonight, sir?
No.
I shall want you to stay, yes?
I'd rather go now, sir.
My husband wants his supper.
Besides, I don't want to be mixed up in any nasty business.
- Rawlings.
- Hello.
See that Mrs. Sprocket stays, huh?
See to it.
Are these poisoned?
Have a drink?
Thanks very much.
I'll have a gin and French.
Is this where you write your sermons?
Sometimes.
Come, come.
Don't blush, please.
Have you never been to the seaside?
- You caught her?
- No. She'd gone.
Well, I've no doubt we can arrange... to deal with it in some other way.
It's my pal with the cops.
If he worries you, gentlemen, shoot and give him a bad leg.
No one will hear.
So long.
Ah, here he is again.
Officer, this gentleman has been a great trouble tonight.
Nothing of the kind, Officer.
My pal has a little girl.
That's the whole point...
He came down here to look for her.
And these chaps... I mean, this fellow here... they're crooks, Officer.
He's a little intoxicated, Officer.
His friend was bad enough, but he's worse, isn't he, Sister?
He's constantly creating scenes in this church.
Look here, the pair of you...
Disorderly behavior in a sacred edifice.
Is that you want to charge him with?
Alas, yes.
We don't wish to press it, Officer, but we've been very patient.
- Haven't we, Sister?
- Oh, but, damn it, I...
- What have you got to say for yourself?
- Look here.
Tonight, my friend and I...
- Where are they?
- Who?
Well, the whistle.
The whistle that was blowing just now.
Oh, yes.
The arm of the English law... needed help in taking our friend to the station.
Very, very reluctantly
I have given him in charge.
For disorderly behavior in a sacred edifice.
Let me go!
Mm. I forgot.
- The little one... shall she join us?
- Do you mean Betty?
One of the sweetest children I ever met.
Bring her, please.
You know, to a man with a heart as soft as mine... there's nothing sweeter than a touching scene.
Such as?
Such as a father saying good-bye to his child.
Yeah, good-bye for the last time.
What could be more touching than that?
I'm afraid if you expect a scene from me, you're going to be disappointed.
We shall see.
Why do you look at me like that?
Betty!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Oh!
You all right, darling?
There, there.
I say, darling... awfully smart dressing gown.
Where did you get it? Hmm?
Betty...
- Betty, I want to tell you something.
- Here. Oi.
Listen, your school report's come.
Awfully good. Really.
Let's go.
Where's Mummy?
Come on, tell her.
At the Albert Hall, my dear.
Oh, that reminds me.
Your scene was so charming,
I was almost forgetting.
What is it?
A record of the delightful piece... which they are playing at the Albert Hall tonight.
- Charming, yes?
- What of it?
Oh, yes. I forgot.
Music is less in your line than marksmanship.
If you listen, my dear Ramon...
I'll show you the exact moment at which you can shoot.
Now, listen carefully.
There.
You see, at such a moment, your shot will not be heard.
I think the composer would have appreciated that.
No one will know.
Except for one.
Yeah, if you are clever, my friend.
Come. You must start soon.
It's impolite to be late for a concert.
And tell Mrs. Lawrence... her little Betty and her husband are very well.
- Anything else?
- Tell her they may soon be leaving us.
Leaving us for a long, long journey.
How is it that Shakespeare says?
"From which no traveler returns."
A great poet.
Daddy! Daddy!
Let me go! Daddy!
Daddy! Let me go! Daddy!
# There came a whispered terror #
# On the breeze #
# And the dark forest #
# Shook #
# And on the trembling trees #
# Came nameless fear #
# And panic overtook #
# Each flying creature of the wild #
# And when they all had fled #
# And when they all had fled #
# And when they all had fled #
# God save the child #
# God save the child #
# Around whose head screaming #
# The night birds wheel and shoot #
# Away #
# God save the child #
# God save the child #
# God save the child #
# God save the child #
Was that it?
Sounds as if it went off all right.
I hope so, for all our sakes.
Quick! There he goes!
Follow that car.
You come with me.
- Well?
- It's all right.
What was that scream?
We have to apologize to listeners... for the delay which has occurred in the broadcast... of the concert from the Albert Hall.
An attempt has been made to assassinate the distinguished European diplomat...
Monsieur Ropa, who is attending the concert.
"Attempt"?
We are happy to say, however, that the shot fired... merely caused a slight flesh wound in Monsieur Ropa's shoulder... and he has been able to return home.
We are now taking listeners back to the Albert Hall... for the rest of the concert, which has already started.
It must have been that damned woman screaming.
Were you followed here?
No one saw me leave the building.
I couldn't have been followed.
I hope you are right, for your own sake... and for dear little Betty's.
Call the others.
Abbott wants you.
Come on.
Take a look.
- Gangway, please.
- Gangway, please.
Looks like an all-night job to me.
Baker?
Listen, Baker, I want you to go across to their front door and knock.
Once that door's open, see that it stays open till we get across.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Quick! Come on, boys!
Do you know anything about that house?
What about the child?
Any idea if she's inside?
I know no more than you do.
God, I hope not.
All I know is they went to Wapping...
- What's up?
- We've got orders to clear these streets.
I've got orders to clear my box.
- Anything further, Binstead?
- No, sir.
We, uh...
We can't do anything against them with revolvers.
I've sent to try and raise some rifles.
Where from?
There's a gunsmith's a few streets away.
I've sent the lorry.
- It's the rifles, sir.
- Good.
Put the men in the house opposite at the same level.
- Get in by the back doors.
- Very good, sir.
You take charge of the firing party.
I'll send the men in to you.
And clear the people out of the houses you occupy.
Very good, sir.
Where's your backyard?
Through the kitchen.
This way.
Sergeant, leave a couple of men next door on the ground floor.
I'll take the rest in here.
Come on. Whose rifle's this?
It's mine.
What... What's the trouble?
You'll have to shift your family out of here.
- I ain't married.
- All the better for you.
You wait out here. It'll be safer.
We've got business inside.
Much better if you waited outside, you know.
I only come in to see if everything was all right.
Stop that.
This is a scrap, not a smoking concert.
That piano will make a nice rest.
Let's move it over.
Good God! Come away from that window! You'll get killed!
- Oh... - You've got to get out of this room. The police want to come in.
Take your tunics off.
Don't touch that blind till you're in position.
- When you hear my whistle, open fire.
- Yes, sir.
Better take that mattress across.
Give you a bit of cover.
I've come straight off point duty. I could do with a bit of sleep on that myself.
- Still warm too.
- Sure. I'll tell your missus about ya.
- Are you ready?
- Wait a minute.
Come on, boys.
There must be some way through to the house.
- Try all these doors.
- Come on, boys. Try those doors.
- They're locked, sir.
- Smash them in.
Go on. Break 'em right down.
Go on.
They're in. They're all in.
It'd be safer if you were farther up the street, madam.
By God, that's done us.
- More ammunition wanted.
- All right. Get it.
No, I finish. I don't go on.
You took this on for our cause, and you've got to go through with it.
We ought to have taken a chance.
We ought to have shot our way out.
I never ordered the first policeman to be shot.
Now we'll have to try and use... the child.
Go and fetch her.
Go and fetch her, yes?
I'll keep her close.
Then if they get me, they get her too.
They're scarcely replying to our fire at all now, sir.
My God, look at that!
It's Betty!
Stop them firing.
Quick, get that man.
I daren't, sir.
I might hit the kiddy.
Two men on the roof after the girl.
Sergeant, look after him.
The rest of you, come with me.
Hello, darling.
Come on. You're all right.
Here's Mummy. Look.
It's all right.
It's all right.
How much longer are we gonna wait?
He's coming now.
Mr Kalinsky, can you tell us the reason for your visit to this country?
Gentlemen, please.
Mr Kalinsky has not statement to make at present.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Good morning, sir.
Morning.
Thank you.
Mr Kalinsky.
We're delighted to have you here with us again.
Your usual suite is ready.
I'm expecting a Mr Benson to call.
Have him sent up the moment he arrives, will you please?
Certainly, see to that.
Very good, sir.
The gentleman to see you, sir.
Thank you.
Mr Kalinsky's waiting for you.
How are you, Carmen?
Very well, thank you, sir.
Am I disturbing you?
Hm?
Oh my dear Gregoroff.
We meet again.
Profitably, I hope?
Very.
You're looking well.
Cigarette?
No, thank you,
I'll give you something really good to smoke.
Fine.
Speaking of something good.
The deals and subscriptions from the Key Club this last year amounted to just under 5,000 pounds.
Excellent.
Lucky for us there's so many fools willing to give money in the sacred cause of peace.
Present from a certain
South American president.
In appreciation of your machine guns huh?
What death stealing inventions have we bought lately in the cause of peace?
Well, for one thing, we purchased a gun which kills thousands.
Only it doesn't work.
Then we've acquired a newer and deadlier poison gas.
But which isn't very affective.
Thank you.
The club members were very very pleased.
Good.
May I?
Do.
The sacred cause of peace, huh?
What about the Caldwell aeroplane?
We'll keep that for ourselves.
You're sure that works?
I've seen it.
It's perfect.
We can name our own price to any foreign power.
Splendid.
Now, I'll have the plans for you later this evening.
Then it won't be necessary for me to go to Scotland tomorrow.
We've done all that's necessary in Scotland.
The inventor went there for secrecy.
Which suited us perfectly.
I understand.
What time is the meeting tonight?
Eight o'clock.
At Hartley manor.
And the club members are anxiously awaiting your speech.
I feel flattered.
By the way.
What is the subject of your sermon tonight?
Finances applied to world peace.
Kalinsky in London!
Newspaper!
All of London's enlightened!
All of London's investing!
Ha, Good morning, Grayson.
Morning.
Seen the paper, Colonel?
No.
I wonder why he arrived in such a blaze of publicity this time.
Well, probably to put our minds at ease.
If I had my way, I'd lock him up in a lunatic asylum.
That's where most of his mystery finances ought to be.
What he wants is a firing squad.
What good would that do, Grayson?
Do you know what's wrong with you fellows at the Intelligence department?
Well, what.
You will not realise, that wherever there's trouble, there will always be another Kalinsky.
Equally unscrupulous, ready to make war a profitable business.
Yes, who is it?
All right, put him through.
Very interesting young fellow this.
Scotsman, got an idea for a robot aeroplane.
Very hush hush.
Yes, put Mr Caldwell through.
Hello.
He...
Stay right where you are, Mr Caldwell.
Hello.
Get him to the car.
He's been cut off.
Give me exchange again, will you please?
No, they cut me off.
Would you agree, Mr Caldwell?
I'm asking you a question, Mr Caldwell.
Mr Caldwell isn't answering questions.
He will.
Don't shoot, you fool, you'll kill him.
Quiet, Jocko, basket.
- Good evening.
- Evening.
How long have you been here?
Thirty year, come Christmas.
By the door.
Maybe five minutes.
- Seen anyone?
- hmm-mm.
Two men.
- Two men.
What were they like?
You should know, seen as how you be the two men.
Mind me coming in?
Who did that?
Wish I knew.
And you saw nothing at all curious?
Not 'til you came.
Search upstairs.
Can you keep your mouth shut?
I can, sir.
Well, look here, the man who did that, escaped from an asylum.
It's unpleasant and we rather not have gossip.
I'll be too busy counting these.
Won't take me long though.
That's better.
Cal!
Did you find something upstairs?
Gee, certainly they're long gone.
Come quick to the car.
Remember.
Good for you, boy.
Well, Jocko, what do you make of it?
Cranloch, history,
Caldwell.
There he is, make it to the car.
Come out of there.
You're riding in the back this time.
I wonder if there was a note wrapped around that stone that went through the window.
Well, what do we do now, Jocko?
Walk four miles in the fog to tell the police?
You're right.
We wait until morning.
What do you think of that, Jocko?
No, you wouldn't like him at all.
He's not your type.
Cranloch, history, Caldwell.
Aeroplanes, history.
Air ministry.
Jocko.
It's all right, Jocko.
Oh, forgive me, but the door was open.
Can I be of any assistance?
My car's broken down.
I wonder if could use your phone?
You could if we had one.
Oh dear, what a morning.
I've come out without my breakfast.
Would you care to share an egg?
I'd share anything.
Let's stick to an egg for the present.
Won't you come in.
Thank you.
Welcome to the castle.
I'll prepare the banquet.
Can the lady in distress help?
The lady in distress needs help.
Oh, I don't know.
I can boil water.
And I can burn toast.
I'm afraid I'm putting you through a lot of bother.
Think nothing of it.
If there's one thing I like more than another, it's being bothered.
Living alone?
Oh, no, I have protection.
My housekeeper's returning this morning.
In the meantime, I'm headman.
Thank you, Jenkins.
Thank you, madam, but the name is Jeeves.
Indian or China?
What are you having?
Indian, and you?
China.
Correct.
That's a versatile tea pot.
Quite, sugar?
Yes, please.
Oh gee.
I wonder what went wrong with your car.
What usually happens to a car that refuses to go?
It stops.
Here we are.
Shingled?
Bobbed.
Oh, sorry.
What an attractive bag.
It is, isn't it?
Sort of matches my gloves.
And your eyes.
Let's stick to the gloves.
Well, this is delightful.
It looks a bit strong.
It is strong.
Jeeves will remedy that.
I hope this isn't going to be the end of our acquaintance.
Well, I've done my part.
And I've done mine.
Say when.
When.
I do enjoy a good cup of tea, don't you?
Oh, yes, yes I do.
But you're not drinking yours.
It's cold.
Let me give you some hot water.
Thanks.
Oh hell.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
Careless of me.
I'll have to get out of these if you'll excuse me.
I hope I didn't burn you.
Just a little.
Cranloch, air ministry, Caldwell.
Oh, come on me darling, come on Jocko.
Did you think I forgot ya?
Well, indeed I didn't.
Come on in with your mother and see what I got for you, there me child, go on, got a lovely bit of meat here for you, so I have.
Good morning.
Who are you?
Heavens, will you look at the glass?
What's been going on here?
It's all right, Norah.
It's perfectly respectable.
We've only had breakfast together.
Well, this is Norah my housekeeper, Miss...
Thompson.
I'm Hugh Drummond.
Well, I want to know what's happened.
Happened?
Yes, the window.
Oh, the window.
Well, that was a very curious thing, Norah.
A stone came through the window last night with a message wrapped around it.
Go on.
What sort of message?
It seemed to be for someone named Ints in Mundesley.
How exciting.
Did you call the police, Mr Hugh?
Ah, that's the sad part of it.
Jocko ate the evidence.
What a pity.
Yes, isn't it?
Now, let's see if we can do something about your car.
No, no, it's a messy job.
I've already spilled tea all over you.
Oh, what's a pair of pants between friends?
I don't suppose there's anything really wrong with the car.
No, I don't suppose there is.
It just stopped.
They do sometimes.
But generally a reason, don't you think?
I suppose so.
It's a good point to start from.
You know I've found very few women who can handle cars.
I found very few men who can handle women.
Your starter works.
So I've heard.
You have no spark.
That's the first complaint I've had.
Please, I'm still talking about the car.
I think you'll find they run better with the wires connected.
Ow!
Oh, I'm sorry.
My hand slipped.
I hope that doesn't happen often.
Not very.
Thank you, Mr Drummond.
Don't mention it.
Good bye, Mr Drummond.
Oh, I hope you don't mind running me into Cambridge.
I wanna collect my car.
After all you had one of my eggs.
So, I did.
I hope you're not nervous.
Oh, not a bit.
I've got to telephone my uncle.
All right.
You want any pennies?
No, thank you.
Ring up a good hospital for me while you're about it.
That's an idea.
Yes.
It's Doris.
You didn't get anything?
What the devil do you think we send you there for?
Did you search the place?
Find any sort of message?
Says the fella told her there was no message.
Did you get his name?
Drummond?
Drummond!
Captain Drummond.
Uncle all right?
He needed cheering up a bit.
He was a little worried.
Who isn't?
I'll drop you at my hotel.
Just stop, I'll get out.
Send the car to the garage.
I hope you enjoyed your ride.
Well, good bye, Mr Drummond.
Oh, I'm not leaving you yet.
I just remembered
I didn't finish my cup of tea this morning.
You surely wouldn't leave me to drink my tea alone.
After all...
- I know, the egg.
- Morning, Miss Thompson.
- Morning.
Tea for two please.
Oh, but I really ought to be going.
Remember the egg.
Will you excuse me a moment?
I have to telephone my aunt.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
Hugh.
Dear old boy, is it serious?
What do you mean, drinking with a Bodger?
Tried to poison your tea?
I don't like the sound of it at all.
What?
Well, naturally, of course, I'll come at once and in the meantime, if you meet her again, fool her, order coffee.
Aunt all right?
Trifle depressed.
I'm sure she needn't be.
This is cosy, isn't it?
Good bye.
Oh, good bye's so final.
Why not make it Au revoir or auf Wiedersehen or even so long?
Good bye, Mr Drummond.
The jury fail to agree.
Waiter.
- Yes sir.
How long has Miss
Thompson been staying here?
Three or four weeks, sir.
She and her uncle, Dr Belfrus.
Why?
- He's nuts.
- Nuts?
- Screwy.
- Screwy?
Do you mean batty?
Yes, balmy.
Thinks he can stop wars, sir.
Him and his friends hold meetings about it, sir.
They call themselves the Key Club.
Key Club?
Yes, that's their badge, sir, a key.
The key what unlocks the door to peace.
Lot of hoo wee, sir.
What about your tea, sir?
What time is it?
Half past 11.
Bring me a beer.
Yes sir.
No, couldn't be the best
Indian tea at that price.
All right, lady, we often meet people like you.
Now, here's a sample packet.
Make a cup now and judge for yourself.
Well, mind, if I don't like it, I won't buy it.
All right, lady, I'll be coming back.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Norah, Norah.
Jocko, Jocko!
Come on out.
Feet first.
All right, Jocko.
I ain't done nothing, mister.
I swear, I ain't done nothing at all.
Nothing, where's my housekeeper?
How should I know?
That's what I'm gonna find out.
I don't know where she is, I tell you, governor, governor, I don't know where she is,
I don't know anything about, I swear I don't.
We'll leave in a moment, Jocko.
Now, who sent you here?
So, that's it.
Perhaps this will put some light on the subject.
Don't do it, governor, don't do it, I'll tell you.
Well.
It's the Key Club.
Go on.
We take our orders from Dr Belfrus.
Yes?
The club's a blind.
Oh, and who gives Belfrus his orders.
I can't tell you, oh, I can't tell you.
All right, all right.
The name of the man who gives the doctor his orders is...
Now, we'll get down to serious business.
Norah!
Norah!
Norah.
Norah.
Drugged.
Oh dear.
I feel queer, I must be.
I must be getting old or something.
Oh.
- Ringmond.
- Yes.
I tell you these things don't happen in England.
Oh, don't they?
Are you sure the man is dead?
If he's not my name's not Drummond.
Well, you should know, Bulldog.
Where's the body?
There.
He's obviously quite dead.
Obviously.
Just a formality.
Oh darling.
What?
Oh, hello, Hugh.
Why the boy scouts?
There was a man in that chair.
There is.
Stop playing the fool.
Suppose you stop playing the fool, sir.
When he arrived there was a man tied in that chair, dead.
No.
Is this your idea of a joke, Mr Drummond?
But I assure you.
I take this a very serious matter at the moment.
Now, wait a moment.
What's going on here?
You all right, Norah?
Of course I'm all right.
D'you know, I must be getting old or something,
I got a terrible headache, then I fell asleep.
My goodness, look at the state of the place.
Come along.
You know it's a serious offence to lead police officers on a wild goose chase?
Don't let it happen again.
I don't think he likes you, old boy.
Incredible.
Oh, you're here, are you?
I might've known it.
Once you two get together, there's sure to be trouble.
Ah, but darling, surely you love it.
Ah, go on, out with that, would you.
This is serious Algy.
Got you down, hey?
Got me going.
Good, after you telephoned me,
I got in touch with Grayson.
He'll meet us at the hotel at six.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well, one of us must, after all, don't you think so?
Oh.
Ah, here you are, waiter.
Waiter.
Oh, my mistake.
When Caldwell wasn't put through, you suspected nothing?
No reason to.
I thought we were just cut off.
Does the name Cranloch mean anything to you?
Caldwell's workshop, it runs from a place called Cranloch Head.
Cranloch Head.
And Jocko ate the Head.
And you believe this Key Club is mixed up in this thing somehow?
I do.
I think it's at the back of the whole thing.
Okay, Grayson, what are you smoking?
Sailors' socks?
The girl puzzles me.
After she tried to poison him.
Just a boy scout old fellow.
I say, waiter, what about a little service?
Maybe I'm wrong.
Do you mind?
Certainly not.
A bit crowded.
Fearful, fearful.
You come here often?
Quite often, quite often.
I say, look here.
Excuse me, sir, what is that?
Member of the Key Club, you know, the Key Club.
And what does the key represent?
It represents the unlocking of the door to a more satisfactory world.
There's a meeting of the local branch tonight.
Very large membership, very large.
What, a meeting here?
No, no.
Hartley Towers.
Local secretary's place.
And who's he?
Dr Belfrus.
Nice chap, nice chap.
There.
And there.
What'll you have, sir.
Thanks very much, I'll have the same.
- There.
- Thanks very much.
- This is Mr...
- Portside, Reginald Portside.
Cheers.
Cheers, cheers.
Mr Portside is an important member of the Key Club.
You were asking about that only the other day.
Oh, was I?
Oh, so I was, what?
Can you take visitors?
With pleasure, with pleasure.
We welcome recruits.
There's your chance, Algy.
Mr Portside says the Key
Club welcomes new members.
If you'll be kind enough to introduce my friend.
Please, please.
Oh, yes, but you've got something else on tonight, haven't you, Algy?
I'd be very interested.
Then come along, sir.
Come along.
We're leaving at 8:15, 8:15, excuse me.
I say, why does he have to say everything twice?
Just doubly anxious, old boy.
I didn't quite get your name, mr...
Davenport, Gerald Davenport.
Gerald Davenport, thank you.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen.
It makes me very happy to see such a representative gathering assembled for our meeting this evening.
That's Dr Belfrus.
The occasion is doubly momentous.
Because we have with us tonight a very distinguished guest who has promised to address you on a topic which is very near to all our hearts.
That of world peace.
The famous financier, Mr Ivan Kalinsky.
Members of the Key Club.
It is a great honour and privilege to address you this evening.
Does your car always break down just after it's been repaired?
No, it's usually repaired just after it's broken down.
Why not have it repaired first?
Oh, oh dear, oh dear.
Not tired are you?
Oh, no, no, no, I got beyond that miles back.
Oh, thanks, so much, old boy.
What did nature give you two feet for anyway?
One for the clutch, one for the accelerator.
And above all, ladies and gentlemen, simply if I can say...
Oh, Hugh, do you realise all the people in there are sitting down?
Quiet.
But what is this Key Club, a jamboree for locksmiths?
It's a blind.
You mean something crooked?
Right.
Here, old boy.
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
As simply as I can state it.
There can be no war without weapons.
And no weapons without money.
And the power of money, my friends, is harnessed on the side of sanity, of progress and of peace.
Jolly good, jolly good.
Coffee and sandwiches now.
I hope.
There she is.
The waitress?
No, the second from the end.
Where do you think you are?
The Folly Bezier?
Who is she?
The woman I had tea with.
Oh, Mrs Bodger.
Oh, Mr Gregoroff, may I present Mr...
Davenport.
Glad to see you here.
Most interesting.
Excellent speech from Mr Kalinsky, straight from the shoulders, straight from the...
If you'll excuse me.
I'm glad you see it.
How old are these thing?
Fighting boss to give their cooperation.
Yes, I suppose that as for us all.
Excuse me.
Shut the door.
What's up?
There's a British Agent at this meeting, named Grayson, calls himself Davenport.
Are you sure?
I never forget a face.
They're up to something and we've got to get Caldwell out of here.
Go upstairs, I'll join you presently.
Come on, let's get hold of Grayson, he'll give us a lift.
My shoes are so full of feet.
Not yet.
But why not, everything's over.
Everything's just beginning.
What's happened?
I just met Gregoroff.
He's tumbled me.
Then we might as well go home.
I've got to go the
Inn with our fat friend.
But when I can get rid of him, I'll wait for you at the cottage.
Better stay at the hotel, there's no phone
You sure you won't want me?
I got Algy.
And I got sore feet.
Well, I'll see you in a while.
I'm sorry I can't stay longer, but I must get back to London.
Good night.
It's been a great honour, Mr Kalinsky.
Good night.
- Good night.
That was the only way to get in that room.
Why not use the open window?
We'd better think of a reason for being there.
Let me think.
I'll save you the trouble.
You've lost your hat.
Here, I say.
Come on, follow me and don't get lost.
I don't like my hair.
Down, Algy, down.
What are we looking for?
Your hat.
Hello, what are you looking for?
I have no idea, sir?
Splendid, fellow.
My friend has lost his hat.
Hat, sir?
Did you look in the cloak room?
Did you look in the cloak room, Algy?
No.
Where is it?
Over there, sir.
Thank you very much.
We're expecting you at the next meeting of the Key Club.
Thank you, you're doing wonderful work, Doctor.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well that's the last of them.
You can lock up now.
Very good, sir.
It's been one of the most enjoyable evenings
I've ever had, Dr Belfrus.
I'm very glad, Miss Thompson.
Gregoroff wants to see you upstairs as soon as the house is clear.
Anything wrong?
You're asking me?
You'd better be getting up there.
Come on, we're needed.
I don't want to hurt you anymore, Caldwell.
But, I must have the plans.
Algy.
You'll never learn anything about life through a key hole.
What?
Thanks, old boy.
Come along, Caldwell, what did you do with them?
I destroyed them.
Do you expect me to believe that?
It's the truth, do you think
I'd keep plans like that?
Well, he can redraw them.
I won't.
I won't do it.
You hear me?
You can do what you like to me, but I won't.
All right, sweetheart.
You've asked for it.
Oh!
Do you wanna kill him?
A dead man can't talk.
You see, you're getting nowhere this way?
Yeah, but we've got...
What do you suggest?
Get him back to Cranloch.
What for?
Then we can give him the works just the way we want.
Perhaps you're right.
You stay here with him, Veight.
Veight, get a car for Miss Thompson.
Get in touch with Kalinsky and tell him, we're compelled to take
Caldwell back to Cranloch, but don't tell him why, understand?
Sure.
Get him to think the
Scots express in the morning and you go to Cranloch with him.
Who pays the fair?
Kalinsky of course.
Yeah, yeah.
I know those millionaires.
I'll take Caldwell up by car tonight and wait for her.
And don't slip up on this.
I'll attend to everything, including Kalinsky.
All clear.
You're not going in.
Why not?
But there may be a gang of thugs in there.
That's what I'm gonna find out.
You can count me in, old boy.
Nothing doing.
On guard, Algy.
I shout, come in, if I don't stay out.
Good.
Look out!
What are you doing here?
Well, you see, it's like this.
If he calls me, I'm to go in.
If he doesn't I'm to stay out.
You'll stay out.
Algy!
Algy!
Meredith, bring in
Captain Drummond's Algy.
I don't know how you and your friend got in here, Mr Drummond, but you're gonna have a much harder time getting out.
Did you enjoy your ride, Mr Drummond?
Shall we say so long?
Auf Wiedersehen?
Or just good bye?
I'll take that.
Put Caldwell in the car.
Help him, Meredith.
All right, Doctor.
Good night, Mr Drummond.
I'll be seeing you.
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
Sorry, you can't join us, Captain Drummond.
That man's dangerous.
Not now.
My mother said I'd never live to a ripe old age.
Who wants to?
These people do things well.
They certainly do.
My jaw aches.
You exercise it too much.
Peace, like war, needs sacrifice.
No, no killing.
We must kill, Doctor.
For as long as these two men are alive, there can be no peace.
Now, have you forgotten our cause?
The Key Club?
Our sacred trust.
Don't you realise that these men would ruin our plans?
The secret Caldwell is holding from us must be revealed for the sake of peace in Europe.
For the peace of the world.
I'd give my life for it.
Then why not theirs?
No, there must be no violence.
But gas isn't violent.
It's slow, gentle, quiet.
Look, Doctor, don't you remember when we tested that last gas formula the club bought?
How quiet everything was in the laboratory when we came back?
How very quiet?
Huh, Doctor, huh?
Two.
Alcohol.
Oh, alcohol.
We're in a pretty tight fix, Algy.
It might be worse.
Stop twittering.
Twittering, I resent that, I never twitter. well, I'll be.
Budgerigars.
Lovebirds, very fond of necking, aren't they?
They're happy.
At peace.
That's queer, he's dead.
Poor little fella.
Quiet and peaceful now, isn't it?
I tell you, Doctor, you and I have struck a blow for peace tonight, that'll resound through history.
Let us hope now, that nothing can hinder the cause.
Absolutely nothing.
Enjoy a good night's sleep, Doctor.
Good night.
I suppose the poor little blighters had to peg out some time.
Look, another one.
And always from the lowest perch.
Gas, heavier than air and it's rising steadily like water.
Dear old boy.
Hello.
I'm sorry, Dr Belfrus has retired.
Good night.
Every inch airtight.
Tight, tight, who's tight?
What's that?
Cotton waste.
Oh, I know sailors wind it round their big toes.
Cotton.
Were you ever at school?
The best in the country,
I've had them all.
Did you ever do stinks?
I say, really old boy.
Oh, you mean chemistry.
Did you ever make gun cotton?
Never made a thing in my life.
Well, you're gonna make some now.
Help me with this.
Get me the nitric acid.
Hardly my kind of beverage.
What are you doing, writing home?
The action of those two acids on cotton waste gives us C6H702NO83.
Gun cotton.
Enough to blow our way out of here.
We're in time.
Are we to be present during the fireworks?
We are.
I would prefer to die in one piece.
However.
How's the tide, Algy?
Rising rapidly, old boy.
We may have to finish this job out of our depth.
Pity we can't float on the stuff.
I'm so good at floating.
This will help in a pinch.
And yours old boy?
There's only one.
And you think I'd better use it?
Sure.
You're jolly well mistaken.
Perhaps one of the lady lovebirds will like it.
How do you tell which for which?
If we ever get out of here,
I'll tell you the facts of life.
Oh.
Good evening, governor.
You remember me, Davenport?
Yes.
Well, may I come in?
I'm tired.
Would you be good enough to state your business?
Certainly.
Two of my friends came here this evening and they haven't returned so I thought perhaps they might have stayed on.
No, there's no one here.
Mind if I have a look?
Look, I told you there's no one in the house.
Well, then you won't mind if
I have a look 'round do you?
Either you leave the house immediately or I call the police.
Police, hey?
Yes.
Yes, operator.
Give me the police.
What happens next?
We'll sit and wait for it to dry.
How's the tide?
Great scot, quick, let's save the birdies.
We'll have to make a split for it.
Keep your head well up, Algy.
I should be all tiptoed in a minute.
Pity I'm not a ballet dancer.
And despite the fact that there is no one here, this man, Major Grayson,
Intelligence department.
If you have nothing to hide, why not let us search the place?
Sorry, can't do that, sir, we've not search warrant.
I'd welcome a search now that authority is here.
You invite us to search your house?
Well by all means.
Come along.
We've gotta wait a while now.
Let's keep that mask handy.
I'll stand on the counter.
And by the way, in case of accident, do you mind if I shake your hand?
Not at all.
Are you satisfied now, sir?
Yes.
I demand an apology.
And let me tell you, sir,
I resent your attitude, your interference, your suspicion, intolerable.
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I must've been mistaken.
Well, then you...
But I'm still worried about my friends, Drummond.
Did you say Drummond?
Yes, Captain Drummond.
Have I been looking for Drummond?
Well, that settles it.
Come on.
I don't want to hear anymore, Captain Drummond.
Good night.
Nice and soothing, sir?
Hmm.
Morning, sir.
This going to be long?
Just finishing.
Too close a shave, sir?
Don't worry, I'm used to it.
I advise you to have a mudpack put on that mug of yours.
Permanently for preference.
Hurry up, Joel.
On the way, madam.
Have you a cigarette?
If anyone had told me I should've enjoyed this journey to Scotland.
You dislike travelling?
It all depends upon my company.
Beer, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
And in flew a dead duck.
Well, good morning.
Mr Kalinsky, this is Captain Drummond.
How do you do?
Very pleased to meet you.
Will you join us in a drink?
No, thank you.
Just lately I've learned to be very careful about what I drink.
Your beer, sir.
Well, happy landing.
Do you go to Scotland often?
Not as often as I should like.
Grand place, thought I'd slip out for a breath of fresh air.
I need it.
And a shooting?
I may have to do quite a lot of shooting.
I hear the birds are in fine condition.
I've taken every care of it.
Oh, Charlie, my travelling companions.
They're a honeymoon couple.
So you're a bird fancier, Captain Drummond.
In Scotland it's my firm intention to kill two birds with one stone.
You're very ambitious.
Well, if you'll excuse me I have a few matters to attend to.
I hope to see you in a few minutes.
I'll come to your compartment.
Keep the change.
An amusing little playmate.
Quite.
Cigarette?
They're quite harmless.
Thanks, just the same.
But I have to be very careful of what I smoke.
There's a gentleman, named Drummond on the train.
Hmm?
Gentleman named Drummond interfered with your plans once before, I remember.
You must see to it that he doesn't interfere a third time, Conrad.
What do you suggest?
There's a short tunnel further up the line.
Keep away from Kalinsky, please.
But we've only just met.
Oh, I'm not joking.
Don't try to follow him.
If he asks you to go to his carriage, don't go, please.
Why this sudden solicitude for my welfare.
Put it down to my conscience anything you like.
But take what I say seriously.
I take you very seriously.
And Kalinsky takes you very seriously.
Well, it's arranged, but I think it might be safer if we took his gun away from him first.
You'd better go to the bar and buy yourself a drink.
Smart, governor.
And you'll need this.
My dear girl, nothing on earth could stop me going to Scotland.
I hope to see quite a lot of you and your friends there.
We shall see.
Quite a lot of each other, I hope.
Watch out for yourself on the train.
Once you're off, I'll fix everything.
Good bye, Hugh.
Let's see those lovebirds, Charlie.
Yes sir.
Pretty little things, aren't they?
Lovebirds give me a pain in the neck, I'm married.
- Gin and mix.
- Yes sir.
Ow!
Funny how these folk dancers seem to be catching on.
You're okay, sir?
You sure nothing can go wrong?
Pete'll deal with him.
Nothing will be heard.
There'll be plenty of noise in the tunnel.
Can he approach without raising suspicion?
You leave it to Pete, he knows his job.
Arrangements are being made.
And we can look forward to a quiet little holiday at Cranloch.
Look out, here he comes.
Your beer sir.
Give it over here.
Excuse me sir.
Give us his coat, quick!
Hurry up.
May I come in?
Why certainly.
Thank you.
I think there's a tunnel coming.
Only a very short one.
Calton.
It may sound silly, but they make me terribly afraid.
Won't you have a smoke?
Nothing like tobacco for the nerves.
That's right.
Afraid I haven't a match.
Here's the steward.
Oh, steward, give the lady a light please.
Anything else, sir?
Not for the moment, thank you.
What are you reading?
My favourite fiction, crime.
Marches on.
Hey, hey what's the matter with you?
Help, help.
Help, help, help.
Are you crazy?
Hello, hello, hello, another cow on the line.
Hello, she stopped.
That's not usual here is it?
No, sir.
No one's safe with a man like that.
He ought to be shot.
You said it, lady.
I shall have to detain you until the police meet the train at Edinburgh.
You can charge him there, Miss.
This is disgraceful.
You poor child.
Drummond, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Will you come along, sir?
Certainly.
Now I'll come quietly.
Are you all right?
Yes, yes, I'm all right.
That was neat.
Very clever of you.
Hm?
Getting him off the train.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And to think he goes around with lovebirds.
Looking forward to our stay in Cranloch and you?
Very much.
Sorry we should be so numerous.
First time so many of my assistants will be gathered in one place.
I've given instructions that will ensure privacy for you and me.
Everyone enjoys privacy.
Except in prison.
Let me out of here.
It's urgent, vital.
You tell that to the court in the morning.
But I've got to get to
Cranloch on important business.
Is everyone here?
Everyone.
You've obeyed my last instruction?
Pete's arranged everything.
And Caldwell?
He's upstairs.
All right, we see him first.
Come on.
So, you're Caldwell.
And he's very stubborn.
He's a Scotsman, I think I can make him more reasonable.
Let me try.
I know it's tough, Caldwell.
Think it over, carefully.
They'll wait.
We'll give you ample time.
Miss Thompson knows that I can wait.
I don't care about myself.
You can kill me, but what are you gonna do to my mother?
His mother's here?
We found it advisable to detain Mrs Caldwell and we occupied Cranloch and took Caldwell away.
Send for her.
Leave me here with him until his mother comes.
You know.
Yes, but look here.
A woman can talk to a woman.
He's our trump card.
If that fails, he'd do anything rather than...
Rather than see her put to any discomfort.
If I were you, I'd keep an eye on our good friend, Gregoroff.
Oh?
Why?
Just that.
Nevermind what's happened, Caldwell.
All I want you to know is that you can trust me.
You know very well that line's dead.
Is there any other way of sending a message?
No.
This way, madam.
Now, listen Mrs Caldwell.
Just a minute
What's the matter?
You're to keep out of this.
I'm to keep...
Kalinsky's orders.
Through you?
Through me.
Thanks.
Say, sweetheart, I just had a little surprise.
Did you tell that girl to give me orders?
I did.
If you'll only do as I ask, there'll be no more trouble, I promise you.
Just stall for time, I'll take care of the rest.
Looks like things are changing around here.
They are, Gregoroff.
You've bundled this job every inch of the way.
Thanks.
Now she's gonna take over, huh?
Exactly.
So, you fall for her and try and throw me out.
You're getting pretty big, aren't you, Kalinsky?
I'm big enough to give orders.
Well, don't get too big.
He's ready to talk, and if you don't mind I don't want to be present.
Neither of you have anything to fear.
Make him tell them what they want to know.
I leave them to you.
And don't bundle it this time.
So that was what he was charged with.
Ay, that was it.
Well, I've always heard the air in Scotland is very bracing but by Jove.
Hugh.
The sergeant's just been telling me, fie on you, fie.
Are you bailing me out?
There'll be no need for that, Captain Drummond.
The charge has been withdrawn.
What?
You got a car here?
Dear old boy, you don't think I walked.
Come on.
Where to?
Cranloch castle.
Hey, you're forgetting your lovebirds.
Let her go!
I'm afraid we'll need her.
Unless you talk.
Well, are you gonna tell us?
Well, and what happened then?
Well, we trailed him as far as Edinburgh and then he vanished.
Come in.
There you are.
Cranloch Castle.
The whole lot of them.
Is that the home office?
Give me the emergency department, Scottish division.
And what about Drummond.
Oh, don't worry about him, he can take care of himself.
We're doing 90.
Step on it, old boy, don't loiter.
Good, Doris.
Do you mind?
I'll open a window.
That thing's likely to go off.
Whew.
I got dizzy looking down there.
I thought I was dizzy enough.
In the old days people used to build their houses high in the mountains to protect them from their enemies.
Everyone has enemies.
Are you sure you've built your house high enough?
Hm, I think so.
You only have one enemy to fear.
Well, as soon as Caldwell talks,
I shall have no use for Gregoroff.
There's plenty of time.
Here's how.
Time's up, Caldwell, take his mother away.
What are you gonna do to her?
Alec.
Stop, I'll tell you what you want to know.
Yes?
I haven't got any plans.
I destroyed them.
You what?
You see, when I built the plane...
Where is the plane?
Chateau Lafite 1920.
An incomparable wine soft as silk.
Exquisite bouquet.
A wine for lovers.
To the success of our venture.
I'll drink to that.
Listen, Kalinsky.
I shall have to teach you manners one day.
I'm here on business.
Caldwell's come across.
- And?
The plane's down the valley of Secret Hanger, all tuned up and ready to go.
Let's be on our way, you can have your tete-a-tete later.
I give orders, I don't take them.
You'd better remember that, Gregoroff.
I'm gonna learn to dislike you.
Come on, cut the girl and let's go.
Run the car undercover and wait for me there.
If you see the girl, try and keep everything under control, old boy.
Why don't you get wise to yourself and stop pushing me around?
You're not important to me.
This girl's kidding you and she's not to be trusted.
I'll ask for your advice when I want it, get out!
You think you can split with her and cut me out of this racket?
You're crazy!
- Get out!
I'm not your dog, Kalinsky, don't you order me around like one.
I've told you once, I'm not gonna tell you again.
Go on, get out!
Why!
Maybe,
I'm not so tough.
And now I guess, I'll settle with you.
You've already settled for what I came for.
What's that?
Kalinsky and you know it.
The only thing I know is
I'm gonna take that plane and you're coming with me, come on.
Oh, no, I'm not.
Then I guess I'll coax you.
All right, if you wanna stay, stay.
I think you'll find it warm enough.
Where's the key to the hanger?
Give it to him, mother.
Thanks.
Look after him, boys.
Where's the boss?
Taking a rest.
Wait here and keep your eyes skinned.
Sure, governor.
Where has he gone?
Caldwell's come across.
Gregoroff's gone to the hanger.
Where's the girl?
Look, I'm choking.
Help, help, let me out!
Get up.
Take me to the hanger and keep your hands well up.
The whole place is alight.
You seen the girl?
Good, God, in the room beyond.
Where's Kalinsky?
Gone.
He took the jump.
That's what I should've let you do.
You poor sap.
But you're awfully nice.
I wanted to keep you out of this.
Catch these birds myself.
But I'm so glad you came anyway.
Stand clear.
But where do I come in all this?
Go back and ask Kalinsky.
It's Gregoroff.
Then he wins.
He can't win, he can't win.
There's still one thing
I haven't told you.
Come on, quick.
You take care of his mother.
What the devil is this?
This is the really secret of my invention.
Then the aeroplane just to bluff.
I'll use that third spin tactically.
When I tell you, throw it in.
Bring it down?
I'm gonna crash it once I can get the range.
Now!
Well, Larry, looks as though your invention's gonna be a great success.
It was quite a simple idea really.
Don't be so secretive about the next one.
Or you'll be getting very unpopular with my department.
And what may I ask is your department?
Oh.
In that case I have to doubly congratulate you.
But I shall be very sorry to lose such a brilliant and charming officer.
Thank you.
Where to, Captain?
London, important business.
Hey, Algy!
Don't tell me, don't tell me.
For once I'm ahead of you.
I bought you a wedding present.
Paper, morning paper...
Morning Tribune paper.
How are we gonna know this guy?
Remember, the man in Mike's car gotta see him too.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm going to kiss him, and how.
Good, you might as well make him happy.
It'll be the last pair of lips that hit him.
No.
You don't think he could have gone away, do you?
Here he comes now.
Thanks, handsome.
I just couldn't pass you up.
Believe it or not,
I never saw her in my life before.
I must have overlooked something.
Bloody shame, sir. Close to annoying.
Right under me very nose.
Your nose?
I'll get the car, sir.
Save 'em.
Okay this time, Mr Avery?
How was it for you, George?
Okay.
Oh, Ray. Could we do it again?
Number 10.
Up high! Ninety-nine!
Quiet.
Do you wanna move in and take a close-up at the top of the stairs?
No, that was terrible.
I'll make it over.
Yes, sir.
We'll do it again, folks.
All right, scene 99.
Let's run it over. All of it.
Move that car back here.
Hold it! Come on!
Take it easy.
Mr. Brent... when you dive this time, let's have less gymnastics. and don't spin like a top when you fall.
Okay, let's go. Come on, folks.
Move that one over there...
What's the matter?
What's that?
What's the matter?
Stand back, everybody.
Call a doctor.
Come on, give me a hand.
Let's get him to his dressing-room.
We won't need a doctor, George.
He's dead.
Dead?
Round up every man that had a gun. get the property man and find out who loaded those guns.
And see that the body isn't touched.
I'm going to phone the front office.
Yes, sir.
All right, everybody. Line up over there.
And all you fellas with guns stand over there.
Keep that door closed.
And see that no one leaves the stage and no one comes in.
Yes.
My dear Mr Little,
Since I read your scenario
I have come to the absolutely conclusion
That your name, Mr Little, fits you something beautiful.
And furthermore and yet besides
Bahhh.
Yes?
Oh, yes, Mr Avery. Just a minute.
It's Mr Avery.
Tell him to finish on schedule.
He's two days behind already.
Talking to me is a waste in time.
But he says it's important.
That's the problem.
He's too important entirely.
Hello.
What?
Brent?
Shot?
Dead?
Oy, that's going to cost me a fortune.
What a calamity. Quick!
Call Steiner. Tell him Brent was killed, shot.
What a calamity, what a calamity.
I'll get it, Bill. Thanks.
Yes?
Myles Brent was shot on the set.
Killed!
Mr Grossmith has gone to the stage.
I'll be right there.
Myles Brent.
Killed.
On general principal, not a bad idea.
Except that he happens to be one of our stars.
Get back to your office and do what you can to keep the papers off this until we hear what happened.
Don't give out any story until you hear from me.
Sure, but rescue me as soon as possible.
They'll be on my neck just as soon as the police get the news.
Miss Molly.
Yes?
Phone the brigade on the lot.
And tell them not to let anyone in or out until they hear from me.
Very well.
Thanks.
Hey, why don't you watch where I'm going?
What's the hurry, gumshoe?
Myles Brent's been shot.
Now there's a job that should have been done years ago.
Oh...
You won't have to rewrite any stuff for The Death Kiss now.
Say, Marcia was on the set with him, wasn't she?
Sure, but I don't think she did it.
What stage?
Three.
Drop this stuff in my office, will you?
Myles Brent, huh?
Picture actor.
My wife always liked him.
I had that kind of trouble too.
Come on, let's go.
All right, fellas, here's something hot.
Myles Brent killed. Shot. Sound Stage number 3.
Tonart Studio.
Operator. Operator.
Hey, that's the Evening Star phone.
You're telling me?
Give me the journal, please.
Hello, Tonart?
I want Max Hill in the publicity department.
Come on, snap him.
You know me, Connelly I never held out on the Evening Star yet.
Yeah, I know all about your deadline.
You'll get the pack. Call me back.
Never mind, I'll get it.
Yeah.
Yes, Morris, I know. But can I help it if he's shot in the morning?
You gotta take those things as they come.
Yeah, I'm going over there right away.
The police oughta be here now.
Call me back in ten minutes.
Hey, come back here.
Pull down that door.
Ambulance coming.
Yeah.
Detective Lieutenant Sheehan,
Homicide Squad.
Who's in charge here?
I've been trying to get things straightened out for you.
My name is Steiner. Studio manager.
What happened?
Well, the company was shooting the scene during which several people fired guns at Brent.
And someone used real bullets, huh?
People do get hurt that way.
That's the director's guess.
Oh, the director.
Did he happen to guess who did it?
No.
That's unfortunate.
Looks like we'll have to do some guessing on our own.
Come on, Hill, loosen up.
Did someone really bump him off?
I tell you, I don't know.
Then let us in on the lot so we can find out.
I can't let anyone on the lot.
Marcia Lane was with him in the picture, wasn't she?
Sure, she was doing the lead opposite him.
Marcia, oh, his ex-wife. That helps the story.
What's the name of the picture?
The Death Kiss.
The Death Kiss. Gee, what a tie up.
Stage office on the phone.
Just a minute, boys, I'll be right with you.
Eight men with guns?
Yes.
Well, it might have been an accident, but...
Frank, you don't think it was murder.
Darling, I don't even know ***
Maybe he died of old age.
Maybe he never even existed at all.
Now you wait here.
I'm gonna have a look around.
Yours.
You break it.
Nothing but blanks left in these guns.
Any other guns on the set?
That's all I know of.
You see, Captain, it's strictly an accident.
Lieutenant Sheehan.
What's your name?
Leon A. Grossmith.
I'm the president of this concern.
Well, what about it?
Now look here, Sargeant.
Do you realize what this has cost me already?
You have no idea. It cost me up to now...
Yeah, and it cost Brent his life.
Which also loses me money.
I can't have no more Brent in my picture.
Pardon me, Lieutenant.
Mr Grossmith means to convey that this regrettable accident need not be converted into a Roman holiday for the rabble.
I assure you that Mr Grossmith feels deeply, very deeply the tragedy of this affair.
And his point is, naturally, not to throw consternation into that great and unseen army of Mr Brent's admirers.
Now that is precisely what Mr Grossmith means.
That's just what I was going to say.
Mr Steiner, Mr Steiner.
Pardon me.
What is it?
The peckers are on my neck.
I've got to tell them something.
There's no use stalling any longer.
And they've got a story now about a mysterious woman.
They don't know themselves, but they say it makes a great story.
Tell them it was an accident.
They won't believe it.
Then make them.
You don't know those boys.
They've got imagination.
I don't care if they got fallen arches.
Tell them the Brent shooting was an unfortunate accident.
Yes.
Is that satisfactory to you, lieutenant?
Nothing is satisfactory.
I can't tell what it is because...
I don't know myself.
Here's all he had on him.
Keep that.
Well, I'm sorry to gum up the works.
But it wasn't an accident.
It's murder.
Murder, oy.
What a calamity.
How do you know?
This is the bullet that killed him.
A 38 calibre, center fire.
All the guns the extras used were 45s.
And you can't fire a 38 bullet through a 45 gun.
It's an old Chinese principle.
Where did you get this?
Out of the wall of the set.
Don't you know better than to meddle in police matters?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to meddle.
I just wanted to help.
You see, I like to dabble a bit in murder cases.
Well you just go and dabble some place else.
All right.
Who is he?
One of our scenario writers,
Franklyn Drew.
Oh, writes detective stories, I suppose.
Yes. How did you know?
They always do.
Well, this makes a difference.
Looks like we've got a murder on our hands.
You go and get that assistant director.
That brilliant young man who said there were no other guns on this set.
Right.
Who is Marcia Lane?
What?
You don't know who is Marcia Lane?
Over a million dollars we spend advertising her all over the nation.
She was on set just a minute ago.
Let's have a talk with her.
Howell, ask Miss Lane to come here.
Yes, sir.
Steiner and the detective want to see Miss Lane immediately.
Well, hurry.
I'm fluttering, sweetheart.
Bill. Tell Miss Lane Steiner and the dick wanna see her.
Okay, chief.
Oh, Pete.
Rush Miss Lane over to Mr Steiner and the dick.
Now?
No, next Tuesday, you sap.
Oh.
Come on, get going.
Oh, all right.
Pardon me, Miss Lane.
Mr Steiner and the dick wanna see you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What can they want with me?
They just want to annoy you with a lot of routine questions.
They always question people like you first to give the guilty ones plenty of time to make up good alibis.
It's part of the system.
Been going on for years.
Sit down, Miss Lane.
Thank you.
I don't wish to be unpleasant but there are a few questions
I'd like to ask you.
Certainly.
How long have you and Brent been separated?
We were divorced last May.
Why?
Well, I don't quite see...
Divorce is a matter of record, lieutenant.
I don't think we have to go into that now.
Say, will you go up to your office and write "bad little boy" 500 times?
When did you last quarrel with Myles Brent?
I don't remember.
Didn't you love him?
I wouldn't answer that, Marcia.
Say, just what is your interest in this case?
Personally I don't care who killed Brent.
But I would like to know how it was done.
Besides that, I'm...
I'm a friend of Miss Lane's.
Wasn't your name mentioned during the divorce proceedings?
No. Sorry to disappoint you.
What did you do with your gun, Miss Lane?
My gun?
Yes
I didn't have a gun.
Didn't you use one in the picture?
No.
But when you fired with the other...
As a matter of fact if Miss Lane had fired she couldn't have hit him.
She was around on the other side of the set when the shooting took place.
If you don't lay off,
I'm gonna take you downtown.
What for?
How do I know what for?
Good, I was beginning to be afraid you might say something sensible.
Hey! What are you trying to do there, huh?
Don't move, now.
I got you surrounded.
Don't lie, now.
What did you try to hide there, huh?
Why, nothing...
We'll see about that. Hold this...
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, you don't.
Yeah? Oh, yeah?
This letter all ready to mail was found in Myles Brent's pocket.
In this letter he told his lawyer that Marcia Lane refused to sign a release as beneficiary of his life insurance policy.
So you stand to collect $200.000.
Miss Lane's lawyer wouldn't let her sign the release.
I know all about that.
It's too bad you weren't the one that was shot.
So that gives you a pretty nice motive.
No funny business, now.
Come on, keep moving.
Here's your man, chief.
I caught him red-handed.
He was trying to ditch this gun. Look.
Look. It's loaded too.
I tell you, I...
Save your breath.
Put the braces on him, Owen.
Now ain't that astounding?
Something told me to take a squint around.
I sees 'im trying to ditch his gun, see?
And I puts two and two together,
I says to my...
I says to myself, that's the man.
I guess I used uncanny skill.
38 caliber and loaded.
It's the gun all right.
Who is this fellow?
Name's Chalmers.
He was an extra on the set.
Why did you kill Brent?
I never killed nobody.
You can't alibi yourself out of this.
That's the only 38 gun on the place.
You killed him. Why?
I tell you I didn't. You gotta listen to me.
Shut up.
You'll have plenty of time to talk later on.
Do you know this man?
Why, yes.
Everyone on the lot knows him.
He was head electrician for years.
How much did you pay him to kill Brent?
Now wait a minute, lieutenant.
Why not pin the murder on the murderer?
That's not against the rules.
What are you talking about?
Chalmers didn't kill Brent.
How do you know?
His gun hasn't been fired.
How did this gun come to be loaded?
I loaded it for Brent.
I lost my nerve.
So you had planned to kill Brent, huh?
Yes, I wanted to kill him.
I had every reason in the world to kill him.
But he made no attempt.
So you can't arrest him.
Not unless you want to make a fool of yourself.
You know, I'm beginning to think you're giving us the rash.
Prove it. You're a detective.
Take them off, Gulliver.
And maybe we'll put them on him.
Well, we seem to be right back where we started.
Yes, perhaps you may have some very valuable suggestion.
Yes, I have.
What?
The cameras were photographing when Brent was killed.
There might be something interesting on the film. It wouldn't hurt to look.
Not bad.
How soon can we see the stuff?
We could get a print in, say, three or four hours.
Can we get them going?
Certainly.
Come, Mr Grossmith.
You take the name and address of every person on this set.
And warn them all about trying to leave town.
Right.
In any of your books, does the detective ever sock the novelist on the nose?
No.
Write it in sometime.
Seems to me like a good idea.
Marcia.
Oh, Frank.
It won't be very pleasant to see it all over again.
But it may help us a lot if we look carefully.
Is everybody here?
I think so, Mr Grossmith.
Mr Steiner is in the projection booth.
He'll be right in.
All right.
There he is now.
Are you ready, Mr Grossmith?
Yes.
Mr Grossmith's ready.
Quiet, please. Quiet.
All right, turn it over.
Rolling.
Mark it.
Action.
Can I get your car, sir?
It'll be right here.
Thanks handsome.
I just couldn't pass you up.
Believe it or not,
I've never seen her in my life before.
I must have been overlooking something.
Bloody shame, sir. Most annoying.
Right under my very nose.
Your nose?
I'll get the car, sir.
Lights! Turn on those lights!
Not hurt badly, but he must have received a sharp blow.
Yeah, it looks like it was done with a blunt instrument.
You know, I had an uncle once who was knocked out the same way.
Only he got hit with a shovel.
Whoever rocked your cradle overdid it.
A rouge smeered cigarette butt started it off.
Can you tell me if that's studio makeup?
Hard to say.
Perhaps we should call the makeup man to tell you.
Thanks.
How did it happen?
I swear I don't know.
I was leaning over the machine checking the focus
I thought the building came down on me.
How about another print?
Yeah, but we'll take care of it this time.
There was something on.
And whoever cut it off didn't want it to be seen.
If we have the laboratory man provide a new one right away.
Could you, Mr Glossmith?
Why, yes, there's no reason why we couldn't.
Will you come with me?
No, Hillicker will go with you.
I have another angle.
Where do I find this makeup man?
Makeup department.
Clear out in the other end of the lot, just at the end of F street.
Sounds like a sleeper jump.
I'll show you if you like.
Thanks.
It's a special panchromatic rouge of my own make.
Only two people on the lot are in the habit of using it.
Who are they?
Miss Collins and Miss Lane.
Who's Miss Collins?
She's one of our players.
Is she in this picture you're photographing?
No, I believe she's working in The Night Riders and they're out on location.
And the only other person on the lot that uses this rouge is Marcia Lane?
As far as I know.
I see.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Wait a minute.
You have quite a stock of this rouge on hand, haven't you?
A few tubes of it.
Just as I thought.
Anybody could get at it.
Not very well. All the makeup that is not in use is kept in the cabinets.
And the cabinets are locked?
Yes.
It's hidden.
Hello? Just a minute.
It's for you.
Hello.
Yes, Hillicker.
How?
All right. You stick around there and see what you can find out.
Tell Steiner I'll see him at his office.
The negative of that last scene has been ruined.
Someone poured acid in the container.
This thing gets more muddled every minute.
You're telling me?
How do I get to Steiner's office?
I'll show you.
Thanks. And you're not going with me.
Right at the end of the street.
Right. You ought to have a map of this place.
Oh, Lieutenant.
You know that anybody could have taken the rouge from Miss Lane's dressing room.
Sure. A very interesting detail.
What do you make of it, Drew?
Got me.
It's more of a mystery than anything
I ever wrote.
What I can't undertsand is why anyone should want to murder Brent.
Not if it were a supervisor.
I don't see why anybody wants to murder anybody. It's a silly idea.
You're going to try and solve it?
Yes, why not?
It would be fun. Besides...
Marcia?
Yes. Oh, say, Tom.
If you see her, don't say anything about that director.
It would only upset her.
No, no, no, of course not.
If I can help you, let me know.
Thanks.
Has anything been moved on the set?
No. Police instructions were to leave everything undisturbed.
Well I'm gonna have another look around.
I want to find out just how he was murdered.
And with what gun.
I got an idea how Brent was killed.
You wanna hear it?
Some other time. Better go home and sleep it off, Chalmers.
That's what you think.
Chalmers don't know anything, huh?
But listen. I've been on the set and I've been seeing things.
Yeah, snakes and pink elephants, I'll bet.
Yeah, all right, be smart, be smart.
Now listen, you're gonna come to me later.
I'll see you in the morning. Go on home.
Poor boy. All he does is cash his paycheck and drink it.
Wanna have a look around with me?
No.
I'm not much of a detective.
Besides, Mrs Avery is waiting for me.
All right.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Go find Sheehan. He's someplace on the lot.
Bring him here.
Mr Drew. Mr Drew, what happened?
What happened?
Here, here.
Swell, ain't it?
I made it myself.
Who's in there?
It's all right, Sheehan.
Now...
I found the gun that killed Brent.
Where?
Right here in this lamp.
Why, it's gone.
Probably got tired sitting there and decided to take a walk.
No, I'm not kidding.
I came down to the set to take a look around.
Just by accident I noticed this... this... smudge on the lamp here.
So I looked inside.
Found a small Derringer fastened there.
Attached to an electromagnet.
There's the wire it was connected to.
And I got a bump on my head that knocked me out.
This proves one thing.
Whoever killed Brent knew a lot about electricity.
Who's in charge of these lamps?
The head gaffer.
What's that in English?
The chief electrician.
Who is he?
Al Payne.
Where can I find him?
Tom will take you over.
Come here, kid, let me take a look at that head.
That's all right.
Now listen.
You stop monkeying around with police matters.
It's a tough racket.
That head of yours won't stand another wallop.
Come on, let's get going.
Mr Drew...
I've been thinking.
No.
Yeah. The first thing I ask myself when I investigate a murder is whodunit.
That sounds logical.
And the next thing I ask myself is who could do it.
And then?
And then I ask myself again who wanted to do it.
And how do you answer yourself?
Well...
I ain't come to that yet.
You take Chalmers, for instance.
He didn't like Brent.
Why shouldn't he be an exception?
He didn't like Brent on account of Brent had him fired.
When was this?
A couple of months ago. When Chalmers was head gaffer they had an argument.
Head gaffer.
Yeah, Chalmers is an electrician, isn't he?
Yeah, Chalmers had a couple of drinks and him and Brent had an argument.
Say, Gully, you are a first-class gumshoe.
Investigator.
All right, investigator.
Right now, will you run up to the casting office investigate and find out where Chalmers lives?
Sure, what are you gonna do?
Put the finger... I mean apprehend him?
Maybe. You wanna come along?
Oh, boy, I'll say.
Got your gun?
Yep.
Got my gun, my badge...
We'll need those. Come on, let's get going.
The director hasn't anything to do with it.
The channel man really sets the lights.
You mean he tells you where to put the lights.
Yes.
When was this set lit?
The afternoon before.
They rehearsed the scene with the principals so they wouldn't hold when they called the extras.
Do you remember anything particular about that one light?
To be truthful with you, we had a lot of arguments on that set.
Mr Steiner didn't like the photography and he wanted more light.
Steiner? Was he there when it was rehearsed?
Yes.
Who else?
Well, they were all there with the exception of the extra people.
There were no extras there, huh?
No, only Chalmers.
You know, he's a sort of a privileged character around this lot.
He used to be our head gaffer.
Chalmers used to be an electrician?
Yes.
Miss Lane felt sorry for him and made
Mr Avery give him a bit in her picture.
Oh, Miss Lane got him the job.
Yes.
Could you give me the address of the cameraman and Chalmers'?
Sure.
And, by the way...
If a writer by the name of Drew asks you anything don't answer him.
Well, you can't keep me from hoping.
This is it.
Look. It's that Chalmers in trouble again.
Do you wish to see Mr Chalmers?
Yes, is he in, Mrs...
Miss Potts, and I don't know anything at all about his comings and goings.
Doesn't he answer the bell?
No, he doesn't.
I was just going in.
It's cleaning day today, you know.
I suppose he's lying stiff and the place all clotted up with gin bottles.
Let's go in and have a look around, captain.
As a tenant, he wasn't so bad until he lost his job. then he started acting queerlike.
See, I told you.
I laid it all down to him. I said, Mr Chalmers... my bungalow court isn't an alcoholic ward.
As I thought. Drunk again.
Well, this is the end.
This is no key to cure.
Out he goes.
I'm sick and tired of his carryings on.
The fellow's dead.
Dead?
Well, he didn't think of me, no not him.
I suppose my $28.50 back rent was all spent in booze.
Did I have Chalmers spotted.
All I did was ask myself whodunit.
Poison, all right.
Familiar smelling stuff too.
Boy, that guy would drink anything that wasn't too thick to chew.
Well, I guess this about washes up the case, huh, Mr Drew?
Looks like suicide to you, eh, Gully?
Sure.
I guess Sheehan would think so too.
He may be dumb, but he ain't blind.
He's not as dumb as he looks.
Do you wear a wristwatch, Gully?
Huh?
Do you wear a watch on your wrist?
Well... you see, it's a present from the wife.
I gotta wear it.
Why do you wear it on your left wrist?
Well, I use my right hand the most because I'm right-handed.
Did you ever try to write with it on you right wrist?
No.
Neither did, Chalmers.
Which makes this note a very interesting piece of fiction.
Say, Gully.
Come here.
Take a look in here.
Now, what do you see?
A bottle of gin and a piece of ice.
What else?
Use your powers of observation.
Oh, you mean that piece of lettuce in there.
Don't you notice that little service door in the back has been left open?
Whatever. The icemen probably left it that way.
My wife says you can't trust those icemen anyway.
If the iceman had left that little door open when he put in the fresh cake there wouldn't be any ice there now.
Oh, I never thought of that.
Let's have a look outside.
Look. Someone must have stood here a long time.
Them are fresh footprints, ain't they?
Step up there a minute.
Look out for those tracks.
Now what?
Look through the window.
Do you see Chalmers sitting there?
Yeah. The door's open.
Supposing someone stood here and doctored Chalmers' gin in the icebox on this side, and then stood here and watched him drink his last drink. through the window, what would you say?
And then watched him die.
Then wrote the note and put the pencil in his hand, huh?
Yeah. Only that's where he made his mistake.
Put the pencil in the wrong hand.
That's just what I was thinking.
Gully...
You know, if a car was parked here
It would entirely conceal that door and that window.
Yeah.
Then Chalmers didn't kill himself, huh?
Let's leave that to Sheehan.
If I'm any good of a guesser, he ought to be here by now.
We found him tumbled over the table.
Dead, huh?
Don't let Sheehan know what we found out.
I gotcha.
The captain got here 15 minutes ago.
Captain?
What are you and that Keystone cop doing here?
Now looky here, Sheehan, you can't talk that way about me.
Remember I'm chief of the studio police and I got rights.
I...I...
Nature in the raw.
Here's another opportunity for your skill, Lieutenant.
We've been waiting for you,
Everybody around here seems to know more about police matters than the police.
That's noble of you to admit.
Did you two losers touch anything around here?
Nothing important.
Good, then clear out.
And take that uniformed moron with you.
Come on.
Suicide, huh?
Looks like it.
Well, I always thought it was Chalmers right from the start.
Now who's the Keystone cop?
You don't even know Chalmers was left-handed.
Come on!
Left-handed?
Sure.
That starts it all over again.
I can remember when murders were nice, clean, simple things done with machine guns and meat axes.
But this case!
Keep coming.
All right.
What seems to be the trouble?
Battery's dead.
But didn't Miss Lane get a new battery just last week?
Yeah, I don't understand it.
It's bone dry.
The liquid's all gone.
Just as I thought
You were right.
Poison.
The electro... electrolytic *** 38%... distilled water 33%, electrolytic liquid 11% by volume the man said at least a spoonful would kill a man dead.
Electrolytic acid.
Did he say anything else?
No, that was all.
Hey. Ain't them the same kind of tread that left the marks under Chalmers' window?
There's probably a thousand cars in Hollywood that have that make of tire.
Yeah, I never thought of that.
Say, Gully.
I want you to get me the key to Brent's dressing room.
But don't anybody know it's for me.
Say, I'll get you the key to the city if you want it.
I have a couple of things to do.
I'll meet you here in half an hour.
Okay.
Who is it?
Frank, may I come in?
Just a minute.
Why all the locks?
I was just going through some old letters and didn't want to be disturbed.
Oh, I see.
Where have you been?
I've been waiting all afternoon for you.
Oh, I've just been doing a little sleuthing.
Marcia, you trust me, don't you?
Why, yes, of course.
You know I'd do anything in the world for you, don't you?
I believe you would, dear.
Then... is there anything you know about the murder of Brent that you haven't told me?
No.
I've just come from Chalmers' place.
He's dead.
Chalmers?
Poisoned.
You mean murdered?
If it isn't that, it's a good imitation on it.
Oh, how awful.
Whoever did it used electrolytic acid.
Acid out of a battery.
The unfortunate part of the whole thing is that... they used your car and the acid out of your battery.
My car?
That's why my car wouldn't start.
Yes. I only told you this because I'm afraid
Sheehan will find out and arrest you on suspicion.
That would mean headlines and scandal.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to get out of here.
Any place, just so Sheehan can't find you.
But that's running away.
Only for a day or two.
Just to give me time.
I'll go to Mary's at Malibu.
She'll help me.
That's swell.
Make it fast, will you?
There's no knowing how close
Sheehan is behind me.
I'll telephone you when I have it all worked out.
You may have a long beard by then, but I'll try and hurry.
Bye-bye, sweet.
Come in.
Leon.
I suppose you're surprised that
I'm here, huh, Marcia?
Frankly, yes.
You haven't come to see me since... since Brent's accident.
I should think you'd know why.
I don't.
I only know that I... that I want to help you.
I have all the help I need.
Marcia, you mustn't treat me like this.
I never said anything to you while Brent was alive.
But you should know how I feel.
You've succeeded in making your feelings quite plain enough.
Marcia, I...
I'm very fond of you.
Not the kind of fondness I care about.
Please go now, Leon.
I'm in rather a hurry.
Marcia.
Maybe some day you will come to me and ask for help.
Maybe you will apologize to me for laughing about how I feel for you.
Perhaps Brent wasn't killed for nothing.
No matter how smart they are they always slip up.
What's your name?
Pardon me.
Hello?
Yes, sir, I will.
Oh, wait a minute. Here she is now.
Miss Lane.
Mr Steiner would like to see you in his office.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Mr Wheatcroft.
Mr Todd, please.
Mr Wheatcroft calling to see you.
All right, thank you.
Pull down that blind.
Did you see Brent when he came in?
I see everybody.
What kind of a suit did he have on?
There it is.
Funny Sheehan missed looking in here.
You've been keeping him too busy.
See what those letters are.
Here's one from a dame named Agnes.
Agnes who?
She ain't that dumb.
She don't say much.
Except that uh... she can't live without him.
Married, too.
Says her husband don't understand her.
Well, it's that old, old story.
Two men and a woman.
The internal triangle.
What kind of place is the Cliffside Inn?
You know, one of those weekend places with all the Mr Smiths, and Mr Jones, and Mr Browns.
Brent wouldn't go there alone, would he?
Not him.
How far is Ocean View from here?
Couple of hours north on the Coast Road.
I guess that's our next stop.
Why?
I'm beginning to think there's a woman in the case.
No...
Mr Drew, this case is becoming complicated.
Even for me.
Come on.
Gee, it's 4:30.
I gotta check in.
Listen. Don't go away without me, will you?
All right, Gully. I'll pick you up at the gate on my way out.
Mr Drew, I've been looking for you.
Miss Lane wants to see you.
She's in Mr Steiner's office.
Thanks.
Yes, sir.
Go right in, Mr Drew.
When did you find out your car wouldn't start?
About an hour ago.
Well, with all your dabbling you didn't throw us off.
You've thrown yourself off if you think Miss Lane had anything to do with Chalmers or Brent either.
All right, all right, just sit down there.
And keep quiet.
Where did you go this afternoon?
I went downtown.
In your car?
Yes.
Where did you park it?
On the street. In front of Ellsmith's flower shop.
I ordered some flowers for Myles...
Mr Brent's funeral.
Then where did you go?
You went to Chalmers' house, didn't you?
Wait a minute, I won't stand for this.
You can't trick Miss Lane into answers.
And have little boy blue over there take them down.
Now keep quiet, Drew. We're trying to get to the bottom of this.
Oh, no, you're not.
Sheehan is trying to force Miss Lane into admission of things she's never done.
She might as well talk here as downtown.
I've got a warrant for her.
For what?
Suspicion of murder.
What's your theory?
It's as simple as ABC.
It would be if you thought of it.
Chalmers killed Brent because he hated him and she offered him money.
Then she got frightened and killed Chalmers thinking that he would get drunk and give it away.
Every piece of evidence we've got points to her.
It was her cigarette that blew the film, her car that made the tracks outside Chalmers' house, and acid from her battery that killed him.
Oh, that's a lot of bunk.
I know.
You've got to make an arrest.
It's okay with you.
Steiner, you can't sit there and... let them arrest Marcia.
She has nothing more to do with these murders than Lincoln had to do with the burning of Rome.
Mr Drew, we don't know whether
Lincoln burned Rome or not.
And we don't care.
But this man is a policeman, so let us hear what he has to say.
We are not paying you to quarrel with the police.
I don't care if you pay me a dime.
Sheehan, if you arrest Miss Lane now there'll be a lot of nasty newspaper headlines.
Hold out for another 24 hours and I'll be responsible.
Better than that, I'll prove she's innocent.
You're making yourself ridiculous.
I'm trying to protect one of your stars.
Wait a minute, Steiner.
Maybe he's right.
What about this scandal?
What about her box-office name?
Haven't we got enough trouble here already without having Marcia arrested?
Mr Grossmith, if you want to accept the responsibility, you can.
But remember...
This is a murder case.
Two people are dead.
And how do you know someone else won't be killed?
For my part, I believe that the police should not be interfered with.
Well, all I gotta say is that it's... a terrible calamity.
Let's go, Hillicker.
I guess the explosion's over.
Someone in this studio killed Myles Brent and Chalmers.
And he's trying to pin it on Marcia Lane.
But they won't get away with it.
Come on, Miss Lane.
Marcia. honey.
I'm sorry.
But I'll get you out of this as soon as I can.
I know you will, Frank.
I'm not worried, really.
Come on.
Special issue!
Read all about it... here.
Hollywood mystery.
Marcia Lane accused of studio murder.
Extra!
Read all about it.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?
I'm from the publicity office at the Tonart Studio.
Yes?
I'd like to see a list of the people who sent flowers to the Brent funeral.
Oh, I think I have a list.
Thanks.
Terrible thing that Brent murder, wasn't it?
I hear they're investigating Marcia Lane.
Yes, I guess she'll be one who won't send flowers.
Yes, she will. She was here early this afternoon and ordered a big wreath.
Is that so?
Here you are.
Mostly women.
It's surprising many of them gave their names.
Oh, some of them didn't.
There was a lady here just now who signed a check then thought better of it and threw it out.
Didn't want the husband to see the cancelled check.
Perhaps. Oh, pardon me.
Yes, madam?
Do you have any gardenias?
Certainly.
Oh, good evening.
Alone?
Yes, I'm not stopping.
Oh.
I have a key here a friend of mine carried away with him.
Oh, thank you.
My name is Drew.
I'm from the Tonart Studios.
I'd like to keep this thing quiet.
Keep what quiet?
Brent's visit here the night before he was murdered.
You see, if the papers get hold of a story like this they'll play it up and it's bad for the picture business.
Well, it doesn't do us any good either.
All right, let's get together.
Sure, what do you want?
Who was the woman with Brent?
Mrs Brent.
There is no Mrs Brent. They were divorced.
Well, then I don't know who she is.
You see, I wasn't here when they checked in and they left in such a hurry
I didn't see them go out.
In a hurry? Why?
Well, a fellow came in here and started a row
Then he waited in that telephone booth over there and they came down and he stepped out.
At least that's what Charly says.
Who's Charly?
One of the night bellhops.
Could I see him?
Sure.
Oh, Charly.
Yes, sir.
This gentleman wants to ask you a few questions.
Shoot.
Do you remember seeing the man who waited for Myles Brent in the telephone booth the other night?
I just got a glimpse of him before the fight.
What fight?
When Brent hit him in the patio.
How did it happen?
The lady ran out to the car when she saw the guy came out of the booth.
Then the guy steps up to Mr Brent and says:
Brent, I wanna see you.
I thought it sounded kinda silly because he was seeing him right there.
Then what happened?
Brent takes the guy outside in the patio.
That's when he socked him.
Then did Brent get into his car?
Yeah.
And the other guy picked himself up.
Boy, was he mad.
And was his face red.
What did he say?
What didn't he say.
Listen.
It was awful.
And then he beats it.
Would you remember this man if you saw him again?
Well, I might.
And then again, I might not.
It all  happened so fast.
Would you remember the lady?
Sure. Say, she was a honey.
She talked kind of funny.
Like she was a foreigner, or something.
With an accent?
Yeah.
That's fine, Charly.
You've been a great help to me.
Here.
Thanks.
Good night, and thanks.
Say, are you a detective?
No, I'm just from the studio.
Will there be detectives here?
I hope not.
Call for Mr Wallace.
Calling Mr Wallace.
Which booth did that fellow hide in?
There.
How long has it been out of order?
Just since the guy hid in there.
I guess he kept pounding on the hook.
Shelf, shelf, that's all you can think about, shelf.
Already this picture cost me $239.351.
Better I put my money in the bank.
Can I get any interest from a shelf?
I'm not asking you to do anything.
But how can we finish the picture without print?
I told you 17 times that we can use a double.
And play the whole kissing scene in a longshot?
Why not?
Because it's all wrong.
It's terrible.
I've got my reputation to think of.
And I've got my money to think of.
Money, money. What's money?
Now, just a minute.
Let's take it calmly.
The New York office is of the opinion that the murder of Brent won't hurt the picture. if we can release it soon enough.
So why not shoot that scene with a double and wind it up?
It's the last scene in the picture.
It can't possibly do you any harm.
Exactly, Steiner's quite right.
Oh, all right.
What's the use of arguing with him?
Good. We can get the company together and shoot it tonight.
Wait a minute.
What about Marcia?
Oh, we can arrange with Sheehan to use her for that one scene.
She can come over with the whole police department if he likes.
Everybody is on call, everything on the set is standing.
They can shoot it in half an hour.
Todd. Oh, hold on a minute.
What time?
Seven thirty... say nine thirty.
Make it nine o'clock.
We'll save a half hour.
Todd, we are going to shoot the last scene of The Death Kiss tonight.
Round up the company for a nine o'clock call.
Sure, Mr Steiner.
Max, we're retaking The Death Kiss.
Get busy on the call.
Okay.
You have Brent's double on call, haven't you?
Yes, I'll have him all right.
But, say, what about Miss Lane?
I'll take care of her.
Hey, Mac, put that light over on the roof.
Screen 80, Joe.
Good evening.
You know Mrs Avery?
Yes, of course. How are you?
How do you do?
I'm surprised you've come to see the retake.
Put it down to morbid curiosity.
That's the woman of it.
She insisted on coming.
Well, come along with me.
I'll have Howell make you comfortable.
He's very good with the ladies.
Put that light high.
Put it up.
We'll do it the same way.
You two girls in the back.
On the left.
Watch out.
Gulliver.
Yes, Miss Lane.
Do you know where Mr Drew is?
He went away and left me after he promised he wouldn't.
Do you know where he went?
I got an idea, but I can't tell.
Do you know when he'll be back?
I don't know.
He'll turn up.
You can't lose that guy.
We're ready for rehearsal, Miss Lane.
All right, thank you.
Go ahead. We'll wait here.
Thank you.
And just as you reach here,
Miss Lane steps up and kisses you.
And much to your surprise, because you don't know her.
Then you turn, read your line to the doorman and walk out to the kerb.
Right.
Alas, I'm so sorry about it.
I know it's going to be difficult for you, but I'll try and help you all I can.
Thank you, Tom.
Oh, do you know Mr Johnson?
Yes, how do you do?
Shall we try it once?
Oh, George, let's have quiet, please.
Quiet.
Rehearsal.
Take your places, please.
Hit them on.
Everyone ready for rehearsal?
Okay.
Camera.
This business gives me a funny feeling.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Just gives me a funny feeling, that's all.
Supposing it should happen somebody else gets shot?
That's ridiculous.
Well, maybe it is, maybe it ain't.
Anyway, I don't like the set and I don't like the title of the picture.
The Death Kiss, ugh.
From now on we have no more titles with death in it.
Getting superstitious?
Say, you ain't got no nerves.
I ain't afraid either. I'm just a little scared, that's all.
What can possibly happen?
That's it. Anything.
I must have been overlooking something.
A bloody shame, sir. Most annoying.
Right under me very nose.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter now?
I can't get it with the mike there.
Well, go ahead and fix it the way you want it.
Swing it in here farther.
Come on, farther.
Now down a little closer.
There.
Is that in your picture?
No, it's in place there.
Okay. Test it.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Microphone number two.
All right, let's go.
Okay for sound.
Oh, Lieutenant. Can I see you a minute?
Well, if it isn't our little mystery writer.
I knew you'd turn up.
Have you solved it?
Come over here a minute.
What's the revelation?
I went through the clothes that Brent wore the night he was murdered.
I found a room key to the Cliffside Inn in his pocket.
I went up to the Inn and found that he'd registered there the night before as Mr and Mrs Brent.
Not unusual for him, was it?
No, but the husband of the woman that was with him waited for Brent in the telephone booth in the lobby.
When Brent came down they had a fight.
Brent beat him up and left with the woman.
Now there's your motive.
The fellow who hid in the telephone booth is the fellow who murdered Brent.
It's a motive, sure.
But it seems to me that everyone around here had a motive.
Yes, but the same man knew a lot about electricity and a lot about film.
Now, Chalmers couldn't have thrown that cigarette butt in the film because he was nowhere around at the time.
Marcia couldn't have poured acid on the negative.
She knows less about film than you do.
But the same fellow, whoever it was, found out that Chalmers had discovered his contraption in the lamp.
Stole Marcia's car, took acid again, doctored Chalmers' gin, and then returned the car.
But why did he take Miss Lane's car?
To give himself a double headed out.
If you believed that suicide gag, it would be the end of it.
If you didn't, everything pointed to Marcia.
Whatever happened, he wouldn't be suspected.
Yeah.
But you have got to show me that the guy who is at the end is someone here at the studio.
And that he had access to the light, the film, the car and everything else.
That's easy.
The man who hid in the telephone booth left his trademark.
What's this?
Well, you know as well as I do.
Scribblings a man makes on a piece of paper are as identifying as a signature.
Oh, now all we've got to do is to find the guy that scribbled like this, huh?
I've done that too.
Take a look at this.
Where did you get this?
In Grossmith's office.
Now, Avery, Steiner, Grossmith and Howell were in there having a conference.
And you think one of those four killed Brent?
Yes?
This is interesting.
But I've only your word for it and that don't count for much.
Well, I'll keep your paper dolls.
But you've got to get me more substantial evidence than this before I can let Miss Lane go.
Take good care of these guns, boys, and don't forget to check them back to me.
Thank you.
Sure the gun isn't loaded?
You bet not. I just looked.
Mind if I look?
Not at all.
Is that clear to you?
All right, we'll take it.
Is everybody ready?
Let's make it.
Johnson, powder up, will you, please?
Sure.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Frank. I've been so worried about you.
Darling, I'm hot on the trail.
I've got an idea.
If I'm right, I'll have this whole thing wrapped up and tied before you know it.
But don't go away before I'm through, will you?
You bet I won't.
Miss Lane, will you stand in a minute, please?
See you later.
It isn't loaded, is it?
What do you think, I'm crazy?
Mind if I look?
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
Say, Bill, those aren't the same guns you used before, are they?
I know. I couldn't get 38s before so I slipped in the 45s.
Nobody knew the difference.
You mean 38s were called for before?
Yeah, we made a row about it.
Who insisted?
Okay, coming up!
Come on with me.
Listen. I've got it.
This is Bill, the property man.
He tells me on the day that Brent was murdered he was definitely ordered to give all the extras 38 caliber guns.
Yeah?
Did you get it? 38 caliber guns were ordered.
Now, if Bill had supplied them, we would never have known that it wasn't an accident.
But he didn't.
He had to use 45s.
That's how he knew it was a murder.
Now, the fellow who ordered those 38s...
Say, who ordered those guns?
Go ahead, Bill, tell him.
Well, it was Mr...
Turn those lights on!
Lights. Give me a light.
Here you are, Sheehan.
There he is. There he goes.
Up there.
Come on, he went this way.
No, there he is. Come on.
There he goes.
Stand where you are or I'll shoot.
Avery.
Mr Avery!
He's the that who ordered the guns.
Yeah, and like a fool I told you about him under the microphone.
He was listening in with the earphones.
So it was him.
Don't look at him now. He's dead.
He's dead.
Yes, I am glad.
The woman at the Cliffside Inn, huh?
You stay here, Hillicker,
Come on. Come with me.
I got him. I got him.
There's your man.
Who is he?
You'll suffer for this.
You despicable cad.
So, you're a policeman, eh?
Pardon me.
I think I owe apologies, Miss Lane.
And to you too.
I'm sorry I was unpleasant.
You know, at first I could have sworn it was you.
I knew it and it made me quite angry.
But you're much more clever than
I gave you credit for.
Well, that sounds like a new contract.
We'll talk about that later.
Oh, Lieutenant...
Would you mind telling me why it is that detectives always wear their hats even in the presence of ladies?
Sure.
That's so we won't have anything in our hands or arms in case we have to use them.
That's one for the book.
Do you mind if I write it in right now?
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
MAN: Chandu the Magician.
MAN: In the three years that thou has dwelt among us... thou has conquered the atma of the spirt... and found thy reward in the powers proclaimed by Shiva.
Thou shalt look into the eyes of men... and they shall be as straw in thine hands.
Thou shalt cause them to see what is not there... even unto a gathering of 12 times 12.
My son, I proclaim thee one of the sacred company of the yogi... and bestow upon thee the name of Chandu.
Thou hast done well, my son.
To few indeed of thy race have the secrets of the yogi been revealed.
To you, my teacher, I express my thanks.
- What more can I learn?
- Nothing, now. The world needs thee.
Go forth in thy youth and strength... and conquer the evil that threatens mankind.
I have gazed in the crystal, and I've seen the forces of death and destruction... rising from the brain of a madman.
Look.
- CHANDU: Who is this man?
- YOGI: This man is Roxor.
YOGI: Last of an ancient family that lived in Alexandria.
He has built a home in the rock temple of Madu... that stands on the great cliffs above the third cataract of the Nile.
But why am I appointed to fight this man?
It is fate who has chosen thee for the task, my son.
And because no man fights so well as when he is protecting his loved ones... fate has thrown thine own family in the path of this human monster.
Look.
CHANDU: Dorothy... my sister.
YOGI: Yes. Her husband has brought his family to Cairo... so that he maybe near his friend Roxor.
YOGI: This man, Robert Regent... has a secret of enormous power.
CHANDU:
Yes. For years, my brother-in-law... has worked to perfect a death ray strong enough to destroy whole cities.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
- He's never found it.
YOGI:
This death ray in the hands of Roxor...
Means an end to goodness...
An end to all that is noble... all that is sane.
Can't you do something?
Surely the police must be able to find some trace of him.
Oh, please telephone me as soon as you have any news at all.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Mother. Mother, you mustn't worry.
- I'm sure we'll hear from Father soon.
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Mother? Look at the letters I found.
- Where did you get them, Betty?
- In the laboratory.
- You didn't go out there in the dark now?
Oh, Mother, how could anyone be hanging around the garden in this sandstorm?
I thought I might find some clues in them.
But you mustn't go outside again.
Why? Did you see something?
Tell me. Did you bolt the door when you came through?
I... I don't remember.
- What did you see, Mother?
- Nothing, Bobby.
It may be foolish, but I thought I saw a face peering in at that window.
Oh, Mother, let's go away from here.
We can't, dearest. Not until we have some news from your father.
- (CLATTERING)
- Listen!
I thought I heard a door close.
- What's that?
- (EERIE RINGING)
Well, what's the matter?
Don't you recognize me?
- Oh, Frank! (SOBBING)
- There, there.
Now, don't cry. Don't cry.
I've come here to help you find Robert.
- Uncle Frank, do you know about Father?
- Yes, dear.
- Do you know where he is?
- I want to talk to you alone, Dorothy.
My, my, Betty Lou, how you've grown.
And Bobby too. But he's too big to kiss.
Sure. We're grown up pretty nearly,
Uncle Frank... so why can't we stay and hear what you know about Father?
- I'll tell you everything later.
- There's something I want to know now.
What was that bell that rang just before you came in?
That was an astral bell.
It tells you when a yogi is near.
- You're really a yogi now?
- Mm-hmm.
And when I hear that bell, I know it's a warning from a yogi that danger threatens.
- (HOWLING)
- What's that?
DOROTHY: It's only a pride of dogs down by the river.
"Now that I know your plans, no money on earth...
"could persuade me to sell you the secret of the death ray.
"If you try to approach me again,
I shall denounce you to the authorities.
I'm convinced you are a madman and should be dealt with accordingly."
Do you know whom this letter was intended for?
- No.
- Roxor.
- Roxor?
- I'm sure of it. Robert's his prisoner.
- Where?
- That I don't know.
I tried to communicate with his mind, but the crystal revealed nothing.
He must be...
- Dead?
- No, no.
Just probably drugged, that's all.
Unconscious.
Robert Regent, I'm calling you. Calling!
You see? It's useless.
Calling him has no response.
(SCREAMING) Help!
Let me go! Stop it!
- Who sent you here?
- Roxor.
- Where did you see Roxor?
- At the wine cellar of... (INDISTINCT)
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
- ## (MIDEASTERN)
- (CHATTERING)
I wish to see Roxor.
The effendi is speaking with a friend and may not be disturbed.
He will see me.
Tell him it is Princess Nadji.
MAN: Bring the princess here.
We must not let her find you here, Abdullah.
I don't know yet whether she is to be a friend or an enemy.
If she proves to be an enemy,
I beg you let me deal with her.
Why? Do you hate the princess Nadji?
I hate her.
Yet I want her more than
I've ever wanted any woman before.
Very well, Abdullah.
If Nadji opposes me... and you serve me well... there shall be a new slave in your harem.
ROXOR: Come in.
Let me have your cloak.
Then I may not feast my eyes on your lovely figure?
- Why have you sent for me, Roxor?
- Why?
To offer you my friendship.
- Well, here we are.
- Yes, but how are we going to get in?
You're not going in.
You're going to stay here and watch.
But it'd be much more fun to go in with you.
Listen, Bobby, in case anything happens to me... your mother and Betty Lou will need a man to protect them.
Stay here.
You have the word, brother?
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
But my people are happy and contented.
The great dams have multiplied our crops a hundredfold.
What if I destroy those dams?
- What?
- Yes.
I can do it with one blast from my death ray.
Then where will your people be?
More than a billion tons of water will sweep down on them... drowning them like rats.
The greatest flood since the biblical deluge.
So, unless my people join in making you a modern pharaoh... you will annihilate them.
Pharaoh.
I shall be greater than any pharaoh.
Civilization and all its works shall be destroyed.
Men shall return to savagery... following only one supreme intelligence... me.
You see, you're my prisoner.
Every man in this house is my servant.
- You can't keep me here.
- I shan't try.
You are to be sent to a friend of mine as a present.
Did you call me, master?
Take this woman through the tunnel to the river. A boat is waiting.
Come!
Come, Nadji, quick.
- Chandu!
- (MOUTHS WORDS) Come.
What's the matter with you?
Stop them! Stop those two!
After them!
Stop them!
- Everything aboard, Ahmed?
- Yes, effendi.
Very well.
Mother, is she a real princess?
Yes, Betty.
Uncle Frank says she's descended... from a long line of ancient Egyptian kings.
- And are we really going to her palace?
- No, Bobby.
- We're going to her dahabieh.
- Her "daha" what?
Oh, Bobby, don't you know that's a houseboat?
And the princess says we'll have to travel all night by camelback.
Won't that be great?
Wasn't it strange that chance should have sent you... to look for Roxor just when
I needed you most?
It wasn't chance, Nadji. It was fate.
I mean, it was, uh... It was fate that brought me in front of that door.
At first I didn't recognize you.
You see, it's three years since last we met.
- Remember?
- Yes.
Those days in Paris...
I've thought a lot about them.
I know.
In the yogi monastery, there's a pool... where you can see the face of anyone who's thinking of you.
And did you see my face in it?
If you would have looked in it, you would have seen mine much oftener.
Mother, do you think the princess can help us in finding Father?
I don't know, darling, but Uncle Frank says we'll be much safer... as her guests than if we're left here alone.
Well, I shouldn't be frightened anywhere with Uncle Frank.
Oh, look. There are the camels.
El Mahafi, are you ready to leave?
Yes, Princess, and tomorrow's sun will see us there.
Cush. Cush.
You bloomin' idiot.
Don't you understand plain English?
Voulez-vous cush?
Oh, why don't you kneel down when I ask you to?
Aw, I wish I had it.
- Miggles!
- Captain Chandler.
(CHUCKLES) That's all right, Miggles.
Don't salute me, and don't call me Captain Chandler.
We're out of the army now.
What are you doing in that funny-looking getup?
Nursemaid to a blooming camel.
Oh, I'm so happy I met you, Captain.
You've gotta get me out of this.
You've gotta give me a job.
I'll work for you for nothing. After all,
I was a good orderly, wasn't I, sir?
Are you still drinking, Miggles?
Well, sir... (COUGHS)
Changin' the subject, do you still do your magic tricks?
Oh, much better ones. Look at me.
Now look behind you.
- Aaah!
- (CHUCKLING)
Take off your hat.
- Why, you dirty little snoop.
- Who, me?
Oh. Oh, he can talk.
- Oh, take him away.
- (CHUCKLES)
- Make him go away.
- That's all right. He's only in your mind.
Oh, don't tell me I'm going balmy.
He's gone!
How would you like to take a very dangerous trip with me?
Sure. You know me. I love danger.
All right, then. Come on.
Oh, thank you, Captain. Thank you.
Every time you get drunk you're going to see that little fella.
- Understand?
- I understand.
So help me goodness, governor, this is the finish.
When a man starts to see things like that...
- Well, it's time to quit.
- Okay.
- You all right, Princess Nadji?
- Yes.
Miggles. Behave.
I can't thank you enough, Nadji.
Now that Dorothy and the children are safe...
I'll be free to find Robert.
I think I can help you.
- You, Nadji?
- Yes.
Roxor has been seen by some of my people... near the ruins of Madu.
Where are they?
- On the third cataract.
- How far is it?
Not very far.
My boat can be there in 24 hours.
Go straight to Roxor and inform the master... that the princess and the foreigner are on their way to rescue Regent.
Tell him I will see that the white man gets no further than the houseboat.
And now, tell me.
Have you married since I saw you last?
No. That's one feat of magic that requires a beautiful assistant.
- But you've been in love?
- All the time.
(LAUGHS) I might have known.
There are too many charming women in the world.
Not too many.
Oh, now, don't misunderstand me, Nadji.
All the time in love, but always with the same woman.
Do I know her?
You should.
She was a present to your father and mother on your birthday.
(LAUGHS) You're never serious, are you?
Never so serious as now, Nadji.
Tell me. Have you found someone?
Even if I had, my life belongs to my people.
You know, you told me that three years ago.
You think I'm foolish, don't you?
No, dear. Just very, very young... and making an unnecessary sacrifice.
Sometimes I think so too.
Hello.
You have a visitor.
His name is Abdullah.
He's been coming here very often lately.
Oh. I see.
For the white man.
It is Roxor who commands.
NADJI: I'll order some refreshments.
Ali? Some wine.
- You must be choked with sand and dirt.
- You're right.
I love the looks of the desert, but I hate the taste of it.
I thought I'd pay you a surprise visit.
- I'm afraid I'm rather in the way.
- No, not at all.
But unfortunately, my boat is starting at once.
And is the gentleman I just saw making this romantic trip with you?
Romantic is hardly the word.
With a woman as lovely as you are, Nadji... it couldn't be business.
You have a strange way of paying compliments, Abdullah.
Who is this friend of yours?
He is called Chandu.
Chandu.
Beg pardon, Captain.
Is this where the danger starts?
Not yet.
- (RINGING)
- That's funny. A telephone way out here?
That's strange.
You haven't told me yet.
Why are you going up the Nile?
- You know Roxor?
- Ro... Roxor.
Oh, is he that crazy scientist who lives in one of the rock temples?
Yes.
No, I've never met him.
Is he the man you're going to visit?
I understand that Roxor has discovered... many valuable relics of the 12th Egyptian Dynasty.
Wait.
Drink.
Go on, drink.
CHANDU: This wine is... is poisoned
CHANDU: Robert Regent, I'm calling.
Robert Regent, I am calling.
Robert Regent, where are you?
Look. Look!
The crystal's clearing at last.
NADJI: The great rock temple at Madu.
CHANDU:
Roxor is trying to build a huge death ray.
It's Robert. He's still alive.
NADJI: Roxor is there.
CHANDU: Robert hasn't told him the secret.
NADJI:
Oh, he'll torture him until he does.
CHANDU: That's your servant...
The man who gave us the poisoned wine.
Roxor is punishing him because he failed.
NADJI: Chandu, this man is heartless.
Roxor will kill him.
Not as long as he has any hope of forcing Robert to give up his secret.
What was that message the Arab just brought?
I don't know.
Nadji, you say you know the way to this temple?
Yes.
- (MOANS)
- Quiet, Miggles, quiet.
Oh, Captain!
Quiet, Miggles. Quiet.
Miggles, stay here and keep watch.
Yes, Captain. I can manage.
(GASPING) Captain! Captain!
Captain! Captain!
(MOANING) Captain!
Captain! Captain! Captain! Aaah!
Captain! Captain! Captain!
- Captain!
- What's the matter? What's happened?
One of them bloomin' stone idols hopped off his perch and ran away.
- And he pinched my hat.
- You've been drinking again, have you?
So help me, it's true. I swear it on the heads of me unborn children.
Captain! Captain!
Look!
- Chandu!
- Fear not, Princess. You are to live.
But you will see your friends die.
(MOANING) Oh, Mother.
Before we die... accept my blessing.
MAN: Open! Open!
- A fiend!
- A fiend!
Halt!
My will shall be your will.
Now I command you. Take me to the effendi Professor Robert Regent.
- He is not here.
- Speak the truth.
- The master has taken him away.
- Where to?
To the secret market of Bab Doukkala.
There, unless he speaks, he will see his daughter sold as a slave.
- What does it mean?
- It means that Roxor can do nothing... by threatening Robert, so he's kidnapped Betty Lou. Come!
Miggles.
(MOANING) Oh, Captain.
Miggles.
Oh, governor, take away those snakes.
Come on, Miggles.
Pick up your gun. Pick up your gun!
(GASPS) Take it away! Take it away!
Take it away! Take it away!
Never another drop, so help me.
Are you ready to tell me the secret of the death ray?
No.
You still may change your mind.
Never.
- Father! Father!
- Betty Lou!
My child.
What are you going to do with her?
That depends on you.
Will you tell me the secret of the ray?
- No.
- Take her to the block.
- ROBERT: No! No!
- No, no, no! (SOBBING)
- Don't!
- Father!
- (SOBBING) Father!
- ROBERT: Don't take her!
- Don't!
- Please stop! Father! Please!
Let her go!
You shall stand at that window and see her sold.
Help me, Father! Don't!
Let me go! Father, help me!
Kill me.
Kill me if you will, but let her go.
Courage, Betty Lou.
It's not too late to save her.
No. Whatever happens to me or mine,
I'll never tell you.
ROXOR: Get out!
Master! Master!
- (CHIRPING)
- Master! Master!
Allah, save us!
I saw the gold with mine own eyes!
This is magic!
Allah be praised!
Stop that man! Run after him!
Run after him!
Guard!
Abdullah!
Guard!
- Why didn't you hold him at the gate?
- He never passed the gate.
When these hands tried to seize him, there was nothing there but a burnoose.
That one.
- GUARD: The devil!
- (ALL SHOUTING)
Now I know who is fighting us.
Chandu... A man who has at his command the wizardry of the East.
- What is his power?
- Ah.
Hypnotism, nothing more.
Is there no way through which we can attack him?
Yes, one.
Samson's strength was in his hair.
Chandu's strength... is in his eyes.
Mother, here they are.
- Oh, Betty!
- Bobby!
- Oh, my poor child.
- Mother, dear, please don't worry about me.
It was dreadful to see Father like that, his face drawn with agony.
- So desperate!
- Don't. I can't bear it.
CHANDU: Now, Dorothy, don't worry.
Please, Frank.
Can't something be done to save him?
I'm going right back after him, dear, as soon as I get fresh horses.
There, there.
- Miggles, be ready to leave in half an hour.
- Yes, sir.
We're going to the rock temple.
All right, sir.
The rock temple, I think he said.
This calls for another drink.
Walking idols and guns that turns into snakes?
This certainly calls for a drink.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who? Me?
What for?
- For seeing things again.
- Now, go on. Hop it.
Is that a nice way to behave?
I thought you was a gentleman.
And I thought you were a gentleman too.
We were both mistaken, weren't we?
Don't you talk back at me.
I'm not talking back at you.
You're talking to yourself.
Miggles, aren't you ashamed of ourselves?
Every time you drink that liquor, you're not yourself.
If you're not yourself, how am I to know who I am?
If you're not you and I'm not me, then who are we?
Neither of us. Miggles, behave.
All right. I give in.
I'll never touch another.
- Nadji, why this costume?
- I'm going with you.
- No.
- But I might help you.
No, darling.
That last trip was too dangerous.
I couldn't risk losing you again.
At least I can go as far as the oasis.
Please.
If anything happened to you, Nadji, dear... do you think I could ever forgive myself?
Do I really mean so much?
- More than so much.
- (COUGHING)
- The horses is here, sir.
- Nadji.
No, thank you. You'd better order a horse for me, Miggles.
- That's all right. You can have mine.
- Miggles!
What's the matter with you?
You seem nervous.
Well, it's...
It's all this excitement, sir.
Could you fix it up for me, so I could have a drink without seeing anything?
You haven't had one all day?
No, sir.
All right, Miggles. You may have one then.
- Here's to you.
- To you, Miggles.
As I said, sir, here's to you.
Oh, go and take a good swim!
Be careful. This is tear gas.
If you break it, it'll blind you.
CHANDU: Well, here we are.
- Dear, keep yourself hidden.
- Don't you worry about me.
You have more important things on your mind.
Never anything more important than you,
Nadji, dear.
Sometimes I wonder if you really know the meaning of danger.
I do, darling. I do when it concerns you.
You know, I'm not a bit afraid... when we are together, and you speak to me like that.
When you look at me like that, nothing else matters.
Be careful. If not for your own sake... then for mine?
A bargain.
And you, darling, be careful... for mine.
Take no chances.
Chandu!
Ride, Nadji! Ride away quick!
(GASPING) I'm helpless.
Roxor was right.
Your magic comes from your eyes.
- Chandu!
- Bring him to Roxor!
DEATH RAY WORKER: Only Regent can do it!
Well done, Abdullah.
Now I'll have my revenge on Chandu.
Yes, but that doesn't tell you how to operate your death ray.
No?
You followed Regent's plans in building this elaborate machine... but he still withholds the knowledge to release its power.
Regent was near to breaking when he saw his daughter on the slave block, wasn't he?
Yes.
If Roxor threatens his wife and children... what then, Abdullah?
In a few hours, his whole family will be here.
How?
In that cell, he's now writing a letter to them.
MAN: Effendi!
- Is the letter ready?
- Where's Roxor?
He's not here.
If you'll take it to my family, they will reward you.
It's only a letter of farewell.
- The letter will be delivered, effendi.
- Thank you.
Now look, Abdullah.
For the wife of Robert Regent.
ROXOR'S HENCHMAN:
For the wife of the effendi.
- Are you sure that's really from Father?
- Look, darling, it's his writing.
Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if we really could save him?
We must save him. I'll get ready.
But, Mother...
There's no need for you to go.
This is a man's job.
- But there's no man here.
- Well, how about me? And Miggles?
- How's that, sir?
- I was just reminding Mother you're a man.
Does she have to be reminded?
If I could only get this bandage off my eyes.
- Oh, if I could only help you.
- Oh, Nadji.
Nadji, what a fool I was to let you come with me.
Don't say that, Chandu.
If these are to be the last hours of your life, I want them to be mine too.
If I could only get you out of here, see you safe once again.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
I feel so much closer to you now than ever before.
Oh, Nadji, I can't think of losing you... now that I've found you again.
Tell me, if all this hadn't happened... would you have left Egypt, gone with me?
You had only to ask, and I'd have followed you anywhere.
If this is the end, Nadji... let me hear you say "I love you."
I love you.
And I love you.
Well, Chandu, we meet at last.
It isn't quite as you planned though, is it?
Remember this, Roxor.
That the best laid plans of men sometimes go astray.
What do you mean?
I mean that my will is stronger than yours... that it will conquer you.
- That's a lie!
- Is it?
Then why are you afraid to look me in the eyes?
I'm not afraid.
Your eyes would have no effect on me.
Then take off this bandage!
If I were alone, I would.
But these silly natives, they believe your tricks.
You're afraid, I tell you.
Take the bandage from his eyes.
Take it off.
Stop! Stop!
Don't let him fool you.
Get rid of him once and for all.
You're right. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
You can't do that!
- You can't bury him alive!
- (CHUCKLES)
Why not?
It was a favorite punishment among the priests of Isis who built this temple.
No!
You'd be far better off to kill him.
Why?
Yogis have been known to remain buried for days.
ROXOR: Yes.
But not underwater.
No!
- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- No!
No!
- Roxor. Roxor!
- Why are you calling him?
I'll tell him how to work the machine.
Robert, you mustn't!
You said it would mean death to millions.
I'm going to, I tell you, if he'll let you and the children go.
We won't go!
We won't save our lives at such a cost.
Hmm. Why, it's a family reunion.
Let them go, Roxor.
I beg of you, let them go.
There is a way out of this cell, and I'll show it to them.
But not while you are in there.
Just let me stay here.
I don't care what you do with me.
Now, look.
Mother!
ROXOR:
I told you there was a way out, Regent.
That is a river down there... where your friend Chandu has gone.
Have mercy, Roxor!
Stop!
Close it! Close it!
- Will you tell me now?
- Stop!
Mother!
Mother! (WHIMPERING)
- (SCREAMS)
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stop! Stop!
- You'll show me how to work the death ray?
Yes. Yes.
How far will the beam carry?
- Halfway around the world.
- Ah!
Hurry, hurry!
Is it ready?
- (WHISTLE)
- Yes.
Back to his cell.
At last.
I'm king of all.
That lever is my scepter.
London, New York, Imperial Rome...
I can blast them all into a heap of smoking ruins.
Cities of the world shall perish.
All that lives... shall know me as master and tremble at my word.
Paris.
City of fools.
Proud of their Napoleon.
What will they think...
- when they feel the power of Roxor?
- (BOOM)
And England... with its sacred traditions...
Its king. Its triumph... its... its navy...
- will be helpless.
- (BOOM)
They shall bow before me in worship.
Me... Roxor.
- (BOOM)
- I will destroy the dams of the Nile.
And its roaring floods shall sweep down upon... hundreds of thousands... drowning them like rats!
Roxor, the god... whose hand deals death!
Stop! I command you!
Take your hand from that control.
No, you don't frighten me.
You can't move that lever.
I'll move it now!
And you're standing right in the front of the ray.
Your hand is powerless to move, Roxor.
It's a lie.
And you shall be the first man for the ray to kill.
I have come out of a coffin from the depths of the Nile.
My will brought me here... and that will is stronger than yours.
You are helpless.
- No!
- Drop your hands.
Now, stand there.
- Don't move.
- ROBERT: Chandu!
Dorothy! Robert! Are you safe?
Are you all right?
ROBERT: There... It's over... there.
I've doubled the speed of the generator.
The voltage is mounting.
The ambient's at white heat.
The machine will explode in a moment.
- Get out of here, quick!
- Not that way, Frank!
I'm all right. Hurry!
For years I've wanted you, and now I've got you.
- You beast!
- There's no use fighting.
Nadji!
Nadji! Nadji!
Nadji!
Chandu! Look out!
Nadji! Na...
- Captain!
- (BUZZING)
Chandu! Chandu!
- Where are they?
- Let's go.
- Are you all right, Nadji, dear?
- Uncle Frank! Uncle Frank!
Children! Dorothy!
- Thank heaven you're safe, Frank.
- That was brave of you, Robert.
You set the machine to destroy even your whole family... rather than give it to Roxor.
Aaah!
Help!
LITTLE MIGGLES: Where can we get a drink?
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Come on.
I hope I'm not very late.
They're upstairs.
His heart is perfect.
Hear that, Betty? I'm in perfect shape.
How did the new valves work on the heart?
Beautifully.
They'll give any pressure you want.
Then we'll get the apparatus ready at once.
Yes, Doctor.
Are you quite sure you want to go through with this?
Yes, Doctor.
You realize, of course, that the possibilities may be unpleasant?
I studied those possibilities all the time you were developing the mechanical heart.
It's worked on every other kind of animal.
Why should man be an exception?
He shouldn't, but we can't be sure until we try.
Well, can't you try on a body that's already dead?
Unfortunately, no.
But if we can revive a man who's been scientifically put to death, then we have the perfect anesthetic.
And in that moment the art of surgery will have advanced a thousand years.
It's the most tremendous thing we've ever worked on.
But what good will that do you if this fails?
I'd rather take a chance on something this great than to live to be 90, marking time.
- Then you're still determined?
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, Bob, you can't do it. I won't let you.
Now take it easy.
There's nothing to be panicky about.
But don't you realize he's going to kill you?
You're going to die.
That sounds a lot tougher than it is.
I'll be under anesthetic. That's all.
There's nothing to it.
- Well, what if he can't bring you back?
- He won't miss.
Why, inside of two hours, we'll be eating chop suey and fighting about where we're going to go on our honeymoon.
Now don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to anybody.
Oh, please don't, Bob.
All ready.
Now, don't forget we got a date for chop suey in two hours.
All set.
No, please. You stay here.
And we're not to be interrupted on any account.
Pulse, 47.
Forty.
Respiration, 15. Dropping fast.
He's dead.
Now to draw out the vital heat.
It'll take at least 30 minutes for the body to chill.
I'll test the heart.
How frail a thing to solve the riddle of death.
We're really very stupid, Lang.
We lived surrounded by working models of this machine, and only now it occurs to us to duplicate them in machinery.
The heart is nothing but a pump like this.
Veins and arteries are only tubes like these.
So what could be simpler than to use the glass pump to force the real pump into action after it has stopped?
Maybe we should have made this of steel.
No, then we couldn't watch the course of the blood from the machine into the body.
- We must see in order to learn.
- But if it should break?
If anything fails us now, our lives, as well as his, are lost.
- I don't understand.
- We've taken a human life.
If we don't restore that life, the law will call it murder.
Now look, Lieutenant, all I want is a little statement for the morning edition.
Is the Mayor guilty of that bribery charge or isn't he?
Listen, if I told you newspaper guys what I really thought, they'd snatch my badge right off me.
Officer, Dr. Savaard's going to kill someone.
You've got to stop him.
- How do you know?
- I'm his nurse. I work there.
He's going to kill a young medical student.
- Where's all this happening?
- At Dr. Savaard's house. Hurry!
- What's the address?
- 8700, Post Road. I'll show you the way.
Shane talking. Get hold of Dr. Stoddard and have him meet me at the Savaard home as soon as he can.
The address is 8700, Post Road.
- Does Dr. Savaard live here?
- I don't know if Dad's in, but I'll see.
This house is so rambling, we have a regular phone system.
He's not in the library. I'll try the laboratory.
Hello, Dad.
There's a gentleman here to see you.
No, no, Janet, I must not be disturbed.
I'm in the midst of a crucial experiment.
Send him away and don't let anybody else in.
Careful.
What's causing those gas locks?
They'll wreck the whole thing.
There's the trouble. Those tubes.
Why, they should curve down, not up.
Betty, what's the matter?
In there.
Open up. It's the police.
- The police? How did they get in?
- I don't know.
Hand me the shears.
Take this and hide.
- I'll face this with you.
- No, I'll need you later.
Hide somewhere.
I'll be able to get in touch with you.
What'll I say if I'm caught?
Say I sent you away before the operation started so you wouldn't see how the machine works.
Where will I go?
In the cellar for now.
But hide, and stay hidden.
Open up, I say!
Break it in.
Betty, what's the matter? What's happening?
He's killing Bob.
- All right.
- Over here.
He's dead.
- Dad, what happened?
- That's what I'd like to know.
It's very simple.
I've created a technique for restoring the dead to life, and that young man volunteered to be my first subject.
Now, if you gentlemen will be so kind as to leave my house,
I'll go on with my work.
- Did you kill him?
- I told you, he volunteered.
How did you kill him?
I made use of certain gases that end life without poisoning the tissues.
That's just what I wanted to know.
Unlock my hands!
I've got to restore that boy to life.
- Hello, Lieutenant, what's the trouble?
- Take a look in that box over there.
Look, give me one hour, just one hour to work on that boy.
Why don't you give him a break?
What have you got to lose?
Nothing but my badge.
Well, he's good and dead, all right.
This man says he can bring that body back to life.
- What about it?
- Fantastic.
Inside of an hour,
I can have that boy walking and talking, and explaining it all to you himself.
From what I've seen so far,
I'd say Dr. Savaard has developed a homicidal mania.
Idiots.
Watch out he doesn't hurt himself.
Now, gentlemen, you can think what you like, but give me one hour, just one hour to work on that boy.
I'll get an autopsy order right away.
If you touch a knife to that boy, it'll cost him his life!
Oh, please let him try anything to bring Bob back.
We'll do everything possible, but I tell you now, it's hopeless.
- I'll call the ambulance.
- Doctor!
Now look, that boy trusted me.
He put his life into my hands.
I've got to have one hour to work on him.
Just one hour. You must!
Not a chance, Doc.
Please, it's Doctor Savaard who's asking you this.
A man whose opinion is honored throughout the world.
He'd never have attempted this unless he could see his way through to the end.
You've got to give him a chance.
Oh, come along.
Dr. Stoddard, how long have you been a police surgeon?
About 14 years.
Calling your attention to the night of May 2nd, were you called by Lieutenant Shane to investigate an occurrence at the clinic of Dr. Savaard?
I was.
Would you tell the court what you saw, please?
I found the body of young Roberts in a sort of casket.
He was dead and cold.
I reported his death to Lieutenant Shane officially, then had the body removed to the morgue for autopsy.
In your opinion, could any power on Earth have restored young Roberts to life?
- No.
- Thank you.
Your witness.
Dr. Stoddard, is it not a fact that Dr. Savaard begged you for a chance to restore young Roberts to life,
- and that you refused?
- It is.
- Why?
- Because the idea was fantastic.
Have you never heard of dead persons being revived by drugs?
- Certainly.
- That's all.
Dr. Savaard, will you tell the court very simply just what you hoped to accomplish by placing a man in a so-called state of death?
Today, the surgeon is forced to work against time, because the patient still lives and breathes, and the bloodstream is still flowing.
But think what it would mean to the surgeon if there were no loss of blood, no race against time, no nerve shock, and no fear of death on the table.
It would mean more time for work, work that's undreamed of today, on the heart, on the brain, on the...
Perhaps the jury may find it a bit difficult to follow that explanation, Doctor.
Could you make it even simpler?
To operate on a living body is like trying to repair a motor when it's still running.
But with a motor you can turn the power off.
You can take it apart, find out what's wrong, replace the worn and broken parts, it can be put together and made to run just as good as new.
And you hoped to be able to do that with the human body?
But for the treachery of a stupid woman, my discovery would be part of the knowledge of the world today.
And you really believe that such a thing would be of great and lasting benefit to humanity?
I can think of nothing nearly so great.
This body, this mechanism means nothing.
The mind is all that counts.
But when the body dies, the mind dies with it.
But this we can prevent.
So our first great objective is the replacement of vital organs that have worn out.
And with the body scientifically dead, the surgery of such operations is simple.
But the real secret lies in the pumping of an artificial bloodstream through the body by means of a mechanical heart until the life functions pick up their own rhythm, the heart begins to beat, and life is restored.
Oh, believe me, all this and as much more as the mind of man can encompass is ours for the asking when once we've found the way to make death our servant, and not our master.
Think of it.
The Edison or the Pasteur of tomorrow need not die merely because his heart is worn out.
We'll give him a new heart, taken, perhaps, from the body of a young man who's been killed in an automobile accident.
And our great genius is awakened to another 60 years of useful life.
You ask me if that's of benefit to mankind?
I answer, it's the gift of eternal life.
But whether man is wise enough or old enough to receive such a gift,
I don't know.
I don't know.
That is all.
Your witness.
I've enjoyed the lecture very much,
Dr. Savaard, but if you don't mind, let's return to the object of this trial.
Did you or did you not personally, deliberately and with planned purpose, put young Roberts to death?
I've explained all that.
Answer my question.
Well, I... That is, I...
Did you kill him?
Yes, I did.
That's all.
The counsel for the defense is asking you to free Dr. Savaard because he killed in the name of science, for a high and noble purpose, for humanity.
In Dr. Savaard's own statement, stripped of its fine phrases and reduced to its actual meaning, it means we're to butcher our young athletes so their hearts can be used to prolong the life of some doddering old man, preferably a scientist.
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
Dr. Savaard's fine ideal would never be permitted in any civilized country.
And yet he wants you to set him free so he can continue that kind of experimentation.
He wants you to license him to kill young men and women.
He wants you to suspend the law and give him the right to go on committing murder without fear of punishment.
I have no quarrel with the great army of honest doctors and legitimate scientists who are trying to make life in this world better.
I ask only that you stop this one killer in his tracks, and you must do more than merely find him guilty.
You must make very sure that no way is left for him to squirm his way out of the hangman's noose.
You must deliver this killer not to a court of appeal, but to the hangman's noose.
You must serve notice to the whole world that the law is still supreme, that human life is still a sacred thing, and that murder, even in the name of science, carries the punishment of death.
He killed the boy. He admitted it.
What more do you want?
It's not as though he'd shot him with a gun.
What do we care how he killed him?
The boy agreed to the experiment.
It wasn't murder.
How do we know he did?
Ladies, gentlemen, we're not getting anywhere at this rate.
Let's get your opinions one at a time, and no interruptions.
- Mr. Sutton?
- As a 100% law-abiding citizen,
I say let the law take its course and hang him.
Men like you have blocked progress for hundreds of years.
Mr. Richards?
I don't think Dr. Savaard is guilty of what we ordinarily consider murder.
What do you call it, then?
- Mr. Watkins?
- I say hang him.
I say hang him, too.
- Mrs. Valentine?
- Couldn't we give him life imprisonment?
And have his lawyers turn him loose in a few years?
- Not while I'm on the jury.
- Yeah.
Dr. Avery?
There's absolutely no reason why life functions can't be restored to a body that's not fatally injured or diseased, providing circulation can be restored.
We're not here to discuss theories, Doctor, but to agree on a verdict of guilty.
Or not guilty!
- All in favor of hanging, stand up.
- Right.
- I'm standing.
- Here I stand.
I suppose you'd pin a medal on Savaard for killing that boy, huh?
Hanging's too good for him, anybody with an ounce of brains knows that.
How can you even turn a man like that loose?
It's open and shut.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, without recommendation for clemency.
Your Honor.
- Your Honor!
- Order!
Before you condemn me to death,
I would like the privilege of addressing this court for two minutes.
Request granted.
I thank you.
You who have condemned me,
I know your kind.
Your forbears poisoned Socrates, burned Joan of Arc, hanged, tortured all those whose only offense was to bring light into darkness.
For you to condemn me in my work is a crime so shameful that the judgment of history will be against you for all the years to come.
You, Mr. Prosecutor, are guilty of murdering not only me, but countless thousands who might have lived, had you not destroyed the only man who could save their lives.
When your last moment comes, always remember that you killed the one man who could have made your life secure.
Although the stupid, unthinking world may approve what you have done, in your heart you know that but for your treachery, the boy you loved would be alive today.
If anyone is responsible for his death, you killed him.
And for that murder you will live and die in the contempt and loathing of your own heart.
When those you love best lie dying, think back to this moment, when you held their salvation in your hands, and threw it away.
Always remember that I offered you life and you gave me death.
That'll be all, Dr. Savaard.
And you who are about to sentence me, after my death you will be overtaken by a punishment far more terrible than anything that you can do to me.
Sentence will be passed on you at 10:00 a.m. next Tuesday, the 15th.
Take him away.
The jury is dismissed. Court adjourned.
Come on, give her a break, will you, boys?
Let her alone.
Tell me more about it.
Here, now.
- It's all so unfair.
- Yeah, it's a rotten shame.
Here's a man who's spent his whole life trying to do nothing but good, and he gets the works because what he did happens to fit the legal definition of a murder.
Do you suppose if I went to the Governor, there'd be a chance for a pardon?
Look, Janet, nobody can do anything today.
So why not shut off the worries?
Sure, I know it's tough, but you've gotta get ahold of yourself, or you'll crack up.
Now, isn't there a nice quiet place you could go where there'd be someone to look out for you? Relatives, maybe?
- My Aunt Lucy lives in Baycrest.
- Why, that's swell.
It'll be close enough to run into town if you're needed, and far enough out to lose the snoopers and curiosity-seekers.
Hey, buddy, drive us to Baycrest.
On the flat rate.
- But my things...
- Send for them.
Right now, you're gonna hide and stay hidden until this thing quiets down.
You've been very nice to me.
Oh, forget it. I charge all this to expenses.
I don't mean the money.
You've been my only real friend through all this trouble.
How do you know it wasn't just a gag to get exclusive stories?
I know better than that now.
Oh, Dad!
Janet, my dear.
You shouldn't have come here.
Now, you mustn't grieve or be unhappy.
Why, you mustn't even think of me as being dead.
I want you to remember me always as being alive and well and happy, just like someone who's gone away on a pleasant journey.
I've given my body to science, dear.
There'll be no funeral, no grave, and no reminder of my passing.
Now, dear, please.
Well, I guess they're about ready to start.
I've seen eight of these hangings, and each one of them gets worse.
We get many requests for bodies from you doctors, but naturally, we can't do anything without consulting the man himself.
This is by his request.
Dr. Savaard, this man says you instructed him to take your body.
- Is that right?
- Of course.
I'm so glad to see you, Dr. Bruchner.
Sorry, gentlemen.
You'll have to keep apart. Prison rules.
Sorry, I did not understand.
Will you sign this release, Dr. Savaard?
I have some very special equipment ready and waiting to perform an interesting experiment,
Doctor.
One that I am sure you would approve of completely.
I approve of anything that is in the interests of science.
Goodbye, Dr. Savaard, and thank you.
And good luck, Dr. Bruchner.
Good evening.
It seems strange to see you in such good spirits, Doctor.
Strange that I should have no fear of dying?
Well, I have lived so long questioning the unknown that this plunge into its depths is only the last and perhaps the greatest of my experiments.
Have you no faith?
As a scientist,
I'm afraid I'm a professional skeptic who doubts everything, even the certainties.
But do you not recognize certain great truths that all men accept?
I've never found one that would bear analysis.
Can't you conceive of a truth too great for the human mind to analyze?
Tonight, no.
But tomorrow
I may know better.
Okay for you boys to go in now.
- Aren't you coming?
- No, thanks.
I can see everything I don't wanna see from here.
It's time to go.
And Dr. Savaard was hanged
at State's Prison
for the scientific murder
of one of his students.
The man of science mounted the scaffold
with a firm step,
betraying no nervousness.
And giving his last message to the world
with a clear voice, said,
"Though my life be taken,
my work will not be left undone."
This is thought to refer to his theories
in the hands of his students,
and not to the so-called death threat
he uttered at the time of his conviction
to the nine men and three women
who condemned him to die.
Sign right here.
Thank you.
Don't try to speak. Don't try to speak.
No pain.
Can't move.
Paralyzed.
No, you're not. You're strapped to the table.
- Where is instrument?
- Broken. It burst under the pressure.
The next one must be much stronger to force open the capillaries closed by rigor mortis.
Is the break in my neck very bad?
Not now. But it took desperate surgery to make the repair.
It would have been impossible, had you not been dead.
Good work, Lang. Congratulations.
I only followed your teachings.
When you stand once more on the platform, the living proof of your own triumph, the whole world will pay you homage.
Never.
When they see, they will have to believe.
They won't come to learn, only to stare.
I'll be a freak in a sideshow.
Lazarus II.
- Fifty cents to look, a dollar to touch.
- Please, Doctor, you must rest.
Yes, I must rest.
Gain strength and power for what I have to do.
Boss, take a look at that.
Yes, it's all been attended to.
"The body of Harley Ross, 40, well-known local businessman,
"was found late last night by police officers.
"No reason was ascribed for the suicide.
"Mr. Ross chose death by hanging himself."
- Well, what about it?
- Well, does it mean anything to you?
- No.
- Well, look at this one.
Two weeks ago, Ramsay Leith, salesman.
Another suicide, also by hanging.
I still don't get the point.
What are you driving at?
Here's another one about Graham Duff.
Hanged himself over a month ago.
Ahead of him was Percy Shore, and here's two more.
Six of them, all by hanging.
So, over a period of time six guys hanged themselves.
- What about it?
- Nothing, boss, nothing.
Except all six of them were on the Savaard jury.
All six were on the...
What?
Somebody's paying off for what happened to Savaard.
And six of the jurors are gone already.
Scoop, drop everything and go to work.
Get hold of all the remaining Savaard jurors.
Get statements, work up the biggest story you can get.
"Is the Savaard curse working?"
Get the DA, the judge, and everybody else he threatened.
- Statements, pictures, the whole works.
- Okay.
And make it weird, make it dramatic.
And make it snappy.
Right.
Hello. Hello.
Funny, none of these people answer.
They can't all be hiding under their beds.
You know, there've been a lot of cases where a curse actually did work out.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Mr. Kearney, please.
He went where? Are you sure?
Thanks.
Kearney's wife said he got a summons from Judge Bowman who tried Savaard, to meet him at Savaard's house.
Maybe that's why none of the others are home.
The Judge probably called them all.
Here, call the rest of these, will you, and see what you can find out.
Long distance, Baycrest, 732.
Yeah, it's official business.
I wanna talk to Janet Savaard.
I can't imagine why
Judge Bowman should call anyone there.
The house is locked up and I've got the keys.
Hold on a minute, will you?
Get ahold of Lieutenant Shane at Headquarters.
Listen, Janet,
I haven't much time to explain, but there's something funny going on out at the house.
No, don't go out there. Stay out of it.
I'll investigate and call you back later.
Goodbye.
Okay. Lieutenant Shane's gone out to Dr. Savaard's house.
That's where I'm going.
If I'm not back for the deadline, call out the Marine.
I'm Mr. Foley.
I'd like to see Judge Bowman, please.
- Have you an invitation, sir?
- No, but I've got a message from his office.
A matter of utmost importance that I must deliver to him immediately in person.
The Judge hasn't arrived yet, sir.
I have strict orders to admit no one without an invitation. Sorry, sir.
Good evening, Your Honor. Remember me?
I'm Scoop Foley of the Tribune.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- What's the meeting for, Judge?
Meeting?
Yes, you called all these people here tonight, didn't you?
Why, no. As a matter of fact,
I received a telegram signed by Janet Savaard, asking me to meet her here on a matter of life and death.
Well, that's funny.
I talked to her just a little while ago, and she didn't know anything about the meeting.
Well, we'll soon find out what this is about.
If this is someone's idea of a practical joke, we'll soon correct their viewpoint.
- I'm Judge Bowman.
- May I see your invitation, please?
You may come in, sir.
I'm sorry, sir. I can't let you in.
Those are my orders.
- I'll give the orders. Let him in.
- Very good, sir.
In there, please.
Good evening, Your Honor.
What's the idea, Judge?
Are we reopening the Savaard case?
- What brought you here?
- A telegram signed by you.
I sent no telegram, issued no orders.
- Good evening, Judge.
- Why, hello, Judge.
Good evening, Judge Bowman.
I presume you've all been called here by messages supposedly sent by me?
- Yes.
- Yeah. I was served with a court order.
- Well, so was I.
- Mine was a wire.
- Mine also.
- I got a wire, too.
Let me see them.
All fakes.
- This is insane.
- Extraordinary.
Get the butler.
No, you don't. You stick around, too.
Evidently, we're the objects of someone's practical joke.
I'll guarantee them very little laughter when we find out who's responsible.
- Well, I hope so.
- Me, too.
Yes, sir?
- Who is your employer?
- I don't know, sir.
Are you trying to tell us you don't know who hired you?
That's right, sir.
We were engaged through the employment agency and given orders to come here with food and service for nine persons.
But who let you in?
A key was sent with our instructions, sir.
We let ourselves in.
- Who else is in this house?
- Nobody, sir.
That is, nobody that we know of.
What were your instructions?
"You will arrive not later than 5:00 p.m.
"Prepare a cold buffet for the following persons,
"who will bear the following identifications."
Everyone named on this list is here.
- That will be all.
- Thank you, sir.
I was supposed to go to a business meeting.
What time did you receive your telegram?
- Oh, about 3:30 or 4:00.
- That's about the time I received mine.
Hello?
I understand. Yes, sir.
Well, if you're smart, you'll scram out of this place faster than you came in.
Six of the Savaard jurors have been killed already, and you're here to get the rub-out as sure as you're alive.
You're crazy.
Okay, wise guy, but I still say scatter, and scatter fast.
- Maybe he's right. Come on.
- No, he's just dreaming up headlines...
Surely you wouldn't leave without speaking to your host?
Judge Bowman,
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you again.
I trust you'll forgive the unauthorized use of your name to effect this little gathering?
You can understand it would have been indiscreet to use my own.
Shane.
And Kearney.
Good evening, Mr. Drake.
Still skeptical, my police surgeon friend?
You can't be Dr. Savaard. He's dead.
As you perhaps know, hanging breaks the neck.
Would you be professionally interested in seeing how it is repaired?
- How did you do it?
- Too long a story to tell you now.
Perhaps, if you're still interested, at dinner with...
You'll join me in a cocktail, won't you?
Dr. Savaard! Alive!
My only regret is that your fiancé is not here as a living proof of his faith in me.
- Well, what do you think now?
- He wouldn't invite us here to kill us.
That'd be sticking his neck out too far.
Yeah?
Well, I've got an uncomfortable hunch that we're the ones behind the eight ball, not Dr. Savaard.
Allow me.
- No.
- Oh, come.
You're not working for me now.
I happen to know you like sherry.
No.
I want to try something.
- Dr. Savaard, my name is Foley.
- I know. Scoop Foley.
The young man who gets into places without an invitation.
Well, that's my job.
Now look, haven't you forgotten some of the jurors?
There was Dr. Avery and...
And Mr. Richards and Miss Forsythe, who fought for over 60 hours in my defense.
I've no need of them here tonight.
- I see. Thanks.
- Not at all.
Won't you join me in a cocktail?
Thanks, no. I never drink.
Well, what'd I tell you?
What can he do?
We outnumber him eight to one.
Well, won't anybody drink with me?
I assure you they're not poisoned.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but my time is limited.
If you have anything to say,
I'll hear you now.
As a matter of fact, Dr. Savaard, we have more business with you than you have with us.
About those six jurors who mysteriously died.
My dear Mr. District Attorney, your law is shockingly bad.
I have the perfect alibi. I am legally dead.
Your business is with the living.
- lf you have nothing to say, I'll be going.
- One moment, please.
I asked you all here because there's a plot afoot against your lives.
That same fiend who killed the six unfortunate jurors plans to take your lives tonight.
Why should you want to protect me?
I'll explain all that at dinner. Shall we go in?
I'm afraid all this is rather informal.
I hope you found your places.
Miss Crawford, you are here on my right.
Allow me.
I thought it best to dispense with the servants, so I dismissed them.
Oh, do sit down, please, all of you.
May I offer you some pheasant, Mr. Shane?
No, thank you.
How were you brought back to life?
I thought I described the method very thoroughly in your courtroom.
Won't you try some pheasant,
Judge Bowman?
Mr. Drake?
Did you know all along you'd be able to do this?
I gambled that my assistant, Lang, could bring me back.
And here I am, not only alive, but beyond the reach of any law.
Six jurors have been killed.
But what public officer would dare suggest that Henryk Savaard was guilty of the crimes when all the world knows that Henryk Savaard is dead?
Did you kill them?
My dear Shane, and if I did, and if I decided to kill all of you tonight, who would believe that I had done it?
Oh, by the way, your place cards are rather amusing.
If you care to glance at them, you'll find something to your disadvantage.
In this corner is a figure which gives you the order in which you are to die tonight.
And in this corner, the exact time.
You will be the first, Judge Bowman, at exactly 7:00.
In fact, you have a trifle less than two minutes to live.
The man's insane!
- Put him under arrest and lock him up.
- Come on.
Judge Bowman, if you attempt to leave this house, it will be the last act of your life.
Judge Bowman, do not leave this house.
Come on.
- He's dead.
- Well, what killed him?
No marks of any kind. Might be heart failure.
The grille's charged with electricity!
You're telling me.
7:00. Right on the dot.
He knew the surest way to drive Bowman into that grille was to forbid him to leave.
Hey, where is Savaard?
Cover the back door, through the kitchen.
Yell if you see anything.
Boilerplate, eh? I ran into the same thing.
The window.
More boilerplate.
Don't look now, but I think we're trapped.
May I have your attention, please?
All the doors and windows
that you can reach have been sealed,
and there is no way
for you to leave this house.
You will now be punished for your disbelief
in the order and the time stated
on your place cards.
Judge Bowman was taken first
out of deference
to the exalted office he adorned.
The foreman of the jury, Clifford Kearney,
who worked so hard to convict me,
will be taken next,
in recognition of his untiring efforts
to secure my death.
It'll do you no good to search for me.
You can never reach me where I am,
but I can and will reach you,
once every 15 minutes.
At 7:15, Mr. Kearney, you will die.
Until then, goodbye, Mr. Kearney.
He can't do this! You gotta protect me!
You've worked in this house, miss.
Where could he get to from here?
Almost anywhere.
Well, he couldn't have gotten through any of the doors.
Isn't there any way to the balcony except the stairway?
Yes, it connects with the back of the house.
Oh, that's blocked. The grille cuts us off.
- I tell you, you gotta get me out of here!
- Take it easy.
Getting panicky is not going to help us any.
If we could get through that grille and reach the front door, one of us could get to a phone and...
Wait a minute.
Look, there's an extension wire.
It runs down on the baseboard and right in here, see?
And across there.
Dead.
I hope you don't think me stupid enough
to leave you any means of calling help.
Can you hear me?
Please don't shout, Mr. Drake.
I can hear and see you perfectly.
- And what is it?
- We'll be missed.
People know where we've gone.
They'll find us.
They'll find you, too, no matter where you go or try to hide.
Aren't you being a little ridiculous,
Mr. District Attorney?
What sane police officer
would dare even whisper
that what they'll find here tonight
might be the work of a dead man?
Oh, no, Mr. Drake, my alibi is perfect.
Have you forgotten?
I was hanged three months ago.
And now, Mr. Kearney, time is flying.
May I draw your attention to the clock?
What time is it? What's the time?
7:10 by my watch.
Only five minutes left.
We've wasted it all by talking.
- Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
- Take it easy.
We gotta protect him somehow.
Now look,
Bowman was tricked into killing himself.
It's a cinch
Savaard isn't coming down here alone to face all eight of us.
Let's get in the middle of the room away from the balcony, away from everything, and form a circle around him.
Now you're talking.
And if he so much as shows his face out of anywhere, I won't miss.
You'd better get inside, too, miss.
No, I'll take my chances out here where I have room.
Well, all right. Join hands, everybody.
Face out and watch your side of the room.
What time is it now?
Can anyone see the clock?
He may turn out the lights.
Don't let go of your neighbor's hand no matter what happens.
Quiet everyone. Don't move, so we can hear if anyone's coming.
I thought you said the phone was dead.
Sometimes you can call in when you can't call out.
- That may be a chance to get help.
- Don't break the circle. It may be a trick.
If it's an outside call, we're throwing our lives right down the sink by not answering it.
Let me loose. I'll answer it, and the rest of you keep the circle.
All right.
Hello?
Who? Mr. Kearney? Yes.
Who's calling, please?
Mr. Cantrell?
Cantrell's my business partner.
He was expecting me at the meeting tonight.
Stay where you are!
Tell him to call the police.
Mr. Cantrell, listen closely.
Call the police and tell them
Dr. Savaard is alive in his house.
He's already killed Judge Bowman, and he's gonna kill the rest of us.
It's on the level, I tell you.
Here, you talk to him and make him believe it.
Mr. Kearney, don't touch that phone.
Don't let him bluff you, Kearney.
Hello, Frank. Listen. Listen to me.
Frank, can you hear me?
What's that? Well, speak louder.
I can't hear you...
- Look at that!
- What is it, a needle?
Must have worked on a spring inside the receiver.
However it worked, it pierced right into his brain through the ear.
Don't touch that point unless you're eager
to leave before your time.
The poison is very active.
You can put the phone back into the drawer.
I'll not need it again this evening.
Miss Elizabeth Crawford.
For your distinguished treachery
that caused two deaths,
you will be the next to die.
Over my dead body.
That is easily arranged, Mr. Shane.
He must be up there somewhere.
You're quite right, Mr. Shane.
But you'll never reach me.
Come on, fellows, give me a hand with that table. Over under the balcony.
Move him out of the way.
Stop where you are.
If you think we're just gonna sit here and take it, you're crazy.
Come on, fellows.
Give me that chair.
Stop! I warn you, don't jump for that railing.
Let me up there. I'm not on his list.
You are now, Mr. Reporter.
I can't leave anyone alive
to tell what happened here tonight.
It's your move, gentlemen.
Stand back, everybody.
Just as I thought.
The railing's loaded with high voltage, too.
Well, that's that.
You're quite correct.
It makes no difference what you do.
You're completely at my mercy.
In 13 minutes Miss Crawford will die.
Goodbye, Miss Crawford.
- What's that?
- Somebody's at the front door.
- It's a trick.
- Suppose it isn't?
Yeah, that's what you said about the phone.
Janet, don't touch that grille.
It's charged with high voltage.
Beat it for the nearest phone and call the police.
Hurry, before it's too late.
Hurry. He's already killed Judge Bowman.
- Killed Judge Bowman?
- Yes, Dr. Savaard. He's alive.
My father? But it can't be.
- We've seen him and talked to him.
- He's trying to kill us one at a time.
- Where is he now?
- Upstairs somewhere.
We can't get at him.
Janet, don't!
Janet, keep away from him.
Dad.
What brought you here?
You are alive.
What brought you here?
Dad, Dad.
Oh, Janet, my darling.
What are you going to do with that gun?
- You must leave here at once.
- Did you kill Judge Bowman?
- He killed himself.
- Dad, why did you do it?
Are you gonna throw this miracle away only for a cheap revenge?
Not revenge, retribution.
But why anything?
Isn't your mere presence alive rebuke enough?
You only have to show yourself and the world will beg your forgiveness.
Not this world of savage cruelty.
We gave them wings to fly, and they rained death on us.
We gave them a voice to be heard around the world, and they preach hatred to poison the minds of nations.
Even the medicine we gave them to ease their pain is turned into a vice to enslave half mankind for the profit of a few.
Oh, Janet dear, don't you see?
Every gift that science has given them has been twisted into a thing of hate and greed.
But not this one.
That instrument is perfect, the secret of eternity.
But it dies with me after I've made them pay for all they made me suffer.
The shame, the months in prison, the hopelessness, the hideous waiting, knowing the exact hour and moment of the end.
Dad, you're not the man that said goodbye to me.
They killed the man I was.
All that's left is the will to hate and to destroy.
Now go.
All right.
Don't try to send for the police to help these people.
It's useless.
Now, those switches control the lower floor, the grille, the railing, the telephone, everything.
And if there's any interference,
I have only to throw that switch to destroy them all instantly.
But after this is over they'll hunt you down, no matter where you hide.
Oh, no, they won't.
All the clues I'm leaving point to Lang.
They'll hunt for him, but they won't find him.
Lang is dead.
You... You killed Lang?
He threatened to expose my plan to destroy these people.
I had to.
- And you'd kill me too if I tried to interfere.
- Oh, Janet.
You're the only thing in my life that's never hurt me.
You've never brought me anything but happiness.
I don't want anything to hurt you, ever.
- So go away from here, away from me.
- No, I'm not going.
Janet, I have no time.
You must go now, or stay here till the end.
I'm not going.
Then stay out of my way until this is over.
Dad, you don't know what you're doing.
- Janet, you must. You must.
- Dad, wait, wait!
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!
So, you thought you could escape me by turning out the lights, huh?
So, there you are.
You make a beautiful target, Miss Crawford.
What have you done with Janet?
She's perfectly safe. I only kill my enemies.
In just a few seconds,
the clock will begin to strike.
No!
Let me out! Let me out!
Dad, come and let me out!
Let me out!
Dad, let me out!
Please come and let me out!
Please let me out! Dad, let me out!
Let me out!
Oh, I can't stand it!
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.
Nice going, kid.
I wanted to spare you all this, Janet.
- You'll go now?
- Yes.
It's better that way. Goodbye.
Go, dear.
You will please not endanger my daughter's safety by making any foolish appeals.
I am sending her away to spare her
any unnecessary shock or pain.
- Are you all right?
- She's quite unharmed.
Miss Savaard, when you get out, call my office, tell them what's happening.
My daughter may call anyone,
because her discovery
of what is happening here
has made it necessary for me
to change my plans.
I can no longer wait
and to kill you one by one.
As soon as she is out of this house
and her car has left the driveway,
I'll end this matter for all of you at once.
Janet, get away before he changes his mind.
- We'll get out of here somehow.
- We'll be all right.
Your pity is wasted, Janet.
Nothing can save them.
- Dad, can you see me?
- I can see every move you make.
- Dad, can you see my hand?
- Yes.
I'm going to open this grille.
Janet, don't touch that grille!
You only have to throw a switch to save my life.
- I'm going to open this grille.
- Don't! Don't!
What happens now is for you to decide.
The juice is off. Break through the grille.
- How does it open? Get a light, somebody.
- I got a flashlight.
Hold it so I can see.
This time I'm not gonna let go for anybody.
- Save Janet.
- She's beyond saving, thanks to you.
Get her upstairs. The laboratory.
The heart will save her.
- Do as he says.
- Yeah, let's go.
The heart's picking up.
It's getting stronger.
Turn off the machine.
Disconnect.
Sterilize.
Bandage her arm.
- Is she all right?
- Yes. It's a miracle.
Believe now, Doctor?
- Dad.
- It's all right, Janet.
You're through the faint of the excitement.
Take her away. She must rest.
We better call an ambulance. He'll need it.
I'll do it. You stick here.
Drake.
- Get Dr. Stoddard.
- Sure.
Dr. Savaard! Don't!
Why did you destroy it?
Just you wait, it won't be long
The man in black will soon be here
With his cleaver's blade so true
He'll make mincemeat out of you!
You're out.
I told you to stop singing that awful song!
Didn't you hear me?
That same cursed song over and over!
Dear me, that's heavy.
What's the matter?
I told those kids to stop singing that awful song, but they sing it all day long.
As if we haven't heard enough of that murderer already.
Ah, leave 'em alone.
As long as we can hear 'em singing, at least we know they're still there.
Yes, I guess you're right.
PUBLIC SCHOOL
10,000 MARKS' REWARD -
WHO IS THE MURDERER?
"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara have been missing since June 11th.
Evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a crime similar to that committed last fall against the Doering siblings".
What a pretty ball you have there.
What's your name?
Elsie Beckmann.
Didn't Elsie come with you?
No, she didn't.
Pretty!
Thank you.
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.
Have you seen little Elsie?
No. Didn't she just come up the stairs?
No, she's not home yet.
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke.
Extra! Extra!
Extra! Extra!
No, I can't give change!
Extra!
Makes you afraid to send your kids to school!
Who is the murderer?
"Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!"
10,000 marks' reward.
- Christ, here we go again!
- This is horrible!
The print's too small.
We can't read it.
You in front, read it out loud!
- Let him read!
- Hey! Quiet!
"The terror in our town has found a new victim".
Louder!
We can't hear a word!
"Certain evidence leads us to believe
that this is the same murderer
who has already claimed eight victims from among our city's children.
We must emphasize once again that it is, now more than ever, every mother and father's sacred duty to alert their children to this ever present danger and to the friendly guise it is likely to assume.
A little candy, a toy, or an apple can suffice to lure a child to his or her doom".
Very true!
Keep reading.
"Anxiety among the general public is heightened by the police's failure to apprehend a suspect.
But the police are faced with the almost impossible task of catching a criminal who left not the slightest clue behind.
Who is the murderer?'
What does he look like?
Where is he hiding?
No one knows him, yet he is among us.
Anybody sitting next to you could be the murderer".
Yes, that's very true.
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.
What do I know very well?
Think about it.
It'll come to you.
What are you saying?
I saw you follow that little girl from the fourth floor up the stairs.
You're crazy, you dirty swine!
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?
You bastard! You swine!
Murderer!
Gentlemen!
I'll see you in court!
I'll have you locked up!
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!
Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!
And the police fall for it!
A search warrant!
How awful! What a disgrace!
Searching a man's house based on an anonymous letter!
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.
As if it weren't enough that we're in constant fear for our kids!
You see? That's why the police must follow up every lead.
Any man on the street could be the murderer.
Can you please tell me what time it is?
Yes, my child.
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?
What's it to you where the kid lives?
Excuse me?
What do you want with that kid?
Absolutely nothing!
What do you want with me?
I'll show you what I want!
Let me go!
This is an outrage!
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.
First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face! then acting like a big shot!
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!
Call the police!
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!
What? Is he the murderer?
Break it up!
Come on, move along!
- The murderer!
- The monster!
Get him!
Tackle him!
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS
"Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!"
This is a terrible scandal!
Imagine the effect such a note will have on the public, Commissioner!
This is simply irresponsible!
Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer from writing to whomever he wishes!
This severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
We immediately got in touch with the newspaper and had them send us the original letter.
The lab's working on it right now.
Of course, you can't get good fingerprints from a postcard
that's passed through so many hands.
Nevertheless, we will leave no stone unturned.
We'll painstakingly compare the results against our archives
in hopes of finding something that can be used to solve this case.
Then we'll send the letter to our graphologist.
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped and swelling sweeps, clearly seen in the word 'soon', third line from the bottom..."
You got that?
- Yes.
"...attest to the strongly pathological sexuality of this sex offender.
Period.
The partially disrupted and uneven style of his other letters is, in its interpretation,
a form of acting
which may manifest externally as indolence or even lethargy.
The writing as a whole displays
elusive yet unmistakable signs
of madness".
Yes, of course, Commissioner.
I have no doubt you're doing your job, and your men as well.
But we need results!
Results!
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!
My riot squads don't get a moment's peace.
They report for duty almost more fatigued than when they were dismissed,
because the painstaking nature of their work wears on the nerves,
and 80% - if not 90% - of our leads are false.
The homicide squad doesn't even get time to change clothes.
They're constantly on call, always tense and alert,
ever ready to spring into action,
to follow even the slightest lead,
as it just might be the one that solves the case.
Mr. Secretary, just consider the search of the crime scene.
To give you an example:
In the bushes just behind a picket fence,
a small, white, crumpled paper wrapping was found.
It apparently once contained inexpensive sweets.
In the outermost corner
were found traces of fruit drops
and particles of powdered sugar.
We've tried to trace the origin of this wrapper
in every candy shop and grocery store within a radius of a mile and a half,
but all to no avail.
With each passing day we expand the area searched.
But, of course, after such a long time,
no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
Despite all these setbacks,
we're forced to press on in our investigation,
always in uncertainty,
and with little chance of success
in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.
Our men are doing everyth...
What good is all this?
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling, but that doesn't change the fact that an unknown killer is terrorizing 4 1/2 million people!
And the police are getting nowhere!
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
Do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are 15 conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
Let me give you a random example:
"Testimony 1,478 in the Beckmann murder case..."
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!
Gentlemen!
You must at least know the color of the cap the little girl wore whom you say you saw with the stranger!
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!
- It was green!
- Red!
Stop! This is pointless!
Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!
Next witness.
If you rely on a color-blind man for clues, don't be surprised if you get nowhere!
In their hunt for this unknown killer, the police have tracked down more than 1,500 detailed leads.
The files in this case fill 60 thick volumes.
We've dispatched all our forces
to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
Every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched,
every bush examined,
since any bush or hollow could harbor some object
that could finally set us on the right track.
We called in police dogs.
We set the best trackers on the faintest of traces,
but they lost the scent
and failed to pick it up again despite all efforts.
Since the first murders,
the police have searched homeless shelters night after night,
subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
This does not, of course, make the police very popular,
nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
Railway stations are kept under surveillance around the clock.
Still, the investigation has not yet yielded the slightest results,
nor have nightly raids in the criminal districts.
The cops!
Get back!
Back!
- This is the police!
Let me go, you dirty bastard!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Goddamn bastard!
Put me down!
Let me go!
Let her go, you filthy pig!
Quiet!
Move back!
The top fuzz!
Quiet!
Police orders:
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.
Please!
Come now, children, stop this foolishness.
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!
Quiet!
That'll get you nowhere.
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!
Quiet!
Be reasonable now!
Step back!
You hear me? Step back!
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!
- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.
Please let me go, Inspector!
The two guys who tried to escape were caught on the Krangasse.
- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!
Have your papers ready!
Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?
Off to the precinct again!
Haven't even made a buck tonight!
Anyone without papers goes down to the precinct!
I tell you, I'm innocent, really!
Stop talking nonsense!
- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!
- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?
Don't push.
Everyone will get their turn.
- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!
Have your papers ready!
Your papers.
Inspector, I can't carry my birth certificate around with me everywhere!
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!
The precinct for you!
You make me puke!
Shoddy work, my friend.
You've been had.
Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!
Ah, lay off!
Next.
Stuck-up snob.
What's wrong?
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S
We'd better take you down to the precinct too.
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.
Move on.
Move on!
Ah, tough luck!
Next.
Papers.
- Don't got none.
To the precinct.
Just my luck.
Next, come on.
You're ruining my business, Sarge.
These raids every night.
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.
You think... we stay up all night just for the hell of it?
No.
But you're drivin' away my clientele, and you won't find the guy you're lookin' for here anyway.
If you knew how steamed they are at the guy who's causing these raids.
Especially the girls.
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.
But believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!
I know a lot of toughs who get all teary-eyed just seein' the little ones at play.
If they ever get their hands on that monster, they'll make toothpicks out of him!
Ready to leave, Sergeant.
So long.
They hit the Crocodile Club today.
Two paddy wagons.
What's keeping Safecracker?
Is it 3:00 yet?
I'll find out.
The exact time, please, miss.
2:58. Thank you.
The cops are crawling the streets like ants again.
Green coats wherever you spit.
They're on your back even if you're with a broad.
They've gone nuts... got this murderer on the brain.
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl, and every night I have to check under the bed to see if the murderer's hiding there.
You can't do business anymore for tripping over cops everywhere.
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.
What else is new?
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?
That guy? Come on.
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once on a bank job he pulled in London.
There he was, hands up, back to the wall, cops all around him.
Seconds later there were three men dead on the ground, but he wasn't one of 'em!
No one better from Berlin to San Francisco.
They've been after him six years and they've yet to get him.
Not yet. But put enough dogs on the fox's tail...
Can it!
Damn it!
I can't take this!
He was always right on time before.
- Thank God!
- Finally.
Morning!
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.
I declare all division leaders of this organization present.
I assume you're authorized to make binding decisions for your divisions.
Good. We'll dispense with the preliminaries, as we all know why we're here.
An outsider is ruining our business and our reputation.
Measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
We can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, café or even private home from the clutches of the police.
Very true.
This state of affairs must end.
Things must return to normal or we'll go under.
Our coffers will soon be depleted.
If we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
I don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
Our reputation is suffering as well.
The police seek the murderer in our fold.
Gentlemen, when I run head-on into an officer from the squad, he knows the potential risks, and so do I.
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.
But we must draw a firm line between ourselves and this man they're looking for!
We conduct our business in order to survive, but this monster has no right to survive!
He must be killed, eliminated, exterminated!
Without mercy or compassion!
Gentlemen, our members must be able to go about their business again without frantic cops in their way at every turn.
I invite...
...your views, gentlemen.
Step up ID checks, comb the entire city, and raids... relentless, ever tougher raids!
We need informers!
We must know the police's plans almost before they do themselves!
The girls gotta work the cops more!
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?
Now they can rat on the cops!
Every resident, every landlord, every property owner must be forced to consent to meticulous searches of his property for the slightest of clues.
What if we...
We have our connections.
What if we put an article in the papers that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization... doesn't wish to be lumped in together with this pig, and that the cops should look for this guy somewhere else.
He's not even a real crook!
This man may well be... when not engaged in the actual act of killing... a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
In his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.
Without what I'll call the innocuousness of these murderers' private lives, it's inconceivable that someone like Grossmann or Haarmann could have lived right next door to their neighbors for years without arousing the faintest trace of suspicion!
This is where we must focus the public's attention.
The public must cooperate.
I'll tell you about public cooperation!
Just thinking of it makes me puke.
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.
But ain't it the truth?
What the devil has public cooperation gotten us so far?
Piles of letters full of the most outrageous slander!
Very true.
They alert homicide whenever a chimney sweep walks by.
That's right.
But when you really want reliable information from them, then they suddenly haven't got a clue.
Why, they just can't seem to remember a thing.
There's your public cooperation for you!
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.
It can't really be that bad, can it?
But it is, Commissioner!
Most of the public still takes the position,
"How does this concern me?"
The idea that each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest, most anonymous child on the street hasn't even dawned on the public at large!
I've got another idea.
There was this magician.
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.
Anyway, he could conjure up hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.
The reward is still far too little money.
The man who leads us to the murderer should get a fortune.
None of this is anything new.
This is all leading nowhere.
So we just wait for the police to catch the guy instead?
The difficulties in solving crimes of this nature are, in my experience, often insurmountable, since perpetrator and victim are often brought together by mere chance.
The instincts of the moment drive the murderer's actions.
The victim is found and identified, his or her last known whereabouts are determined, and then... then comes the big question mark.
These children vanish without a trace.
And when they're found...
Well, we all know the state in which we've found them.
And the perpetrator...
It's a fact well-known to all of us that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.
That's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
The police have been after this murderer for eight months now.
They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.
No, we'll go broke by then.
What, then?
We have to catch him... ourselves.
Yes, that's what we must do.
There is perhaps one other way.
I'm quite certain that information on the individual in question must already exist somewhere.
Being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.
That's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.
We specifically need information on those released after being deemed harmless to society but who, due to their inclinations, could be the murderer.
We must cover the city with a net of informers.
Every square mile must be under constant surveillance.
No child in this city must take a single step without us knowing it.
- Fine, but how?
- And who?
It must be people who can go anywhere without causing a stir, follow anyone without attracting attention, follow any child to any house without arousing suspicion.
In short, people whom the killer would never suspect.
- But who?
- There are no such people!
- Who could do that?
- Who?
The beggars.
The organization of beggars!
MR. CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED -
THE MANAGEMENT
Blood pudding's on the upswing.
God, this cheese stinks so good.
Take that, you sons of bitches!
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.
Two, four, six...
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS
SANDWICHES
Bread-and-butter sandwich, lukewarm response.
Black Friday for roast beef.
All right.
Now come the courtyards.
Yes, from number 1 to 88.
Next.
You're responsible for the courtyards on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.
Got it.
What's next?
Hauptstrasse, from number 89... to 196.
Hauptstrasse, number 89 to 196.
Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.
Well, Emil, maybe you'll win the 15,000.
I've got my fingers crossed.
Knock on wood.
My heartfelt thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
"In searching homes, be on the lookout for any clue which could establish the origin of the murderer's letter to the Courier.
Be on the lookout as well for an old wooden table..."
Idiot!
"...or red pencil..."
Come in.
"... or writing paper of the type used by the killer".
Inspector, here are reports on mental patients who've been released as cured or deemed harmless over the last five years.
Reports from every private and public institute, as well as from municipal hospitals and asylums.
And here's a list of their present addresses.
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
Pardon me?
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.
You don't say.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.
I had hoped to speak with him.
I'm from the tax office.
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...
Yes, thank you.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.
THE GENERAL GAZETTE
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler, does Mr. Beckert subscribe to any newspapers?
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.
I see. Thank you.
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!
Child, you mustn't do that.
You know why.
Good day.
What would you like?
Coffee.
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.
Here you are.
Another.
Check.
Two cognacs... that's 1.65, please.
Thank you very much.
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.
Table: polished mahogany, with tablecloth.
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.
Printed matter found in wastebasket: cigar ad and a postcard with flowers and "Regards, Paul" on it, but no address of sender.
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand, a bag of candy...
Just a moment.
Ariston?
What was that?
I'd like the file on the Marga Perl murder case.
Thank you very much.
That's odd.
I've heard that before.
It was...
It was...
Hey, Heinrich!
What is it?
What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.
Can't you hear it?
There.
Now he's stopped.
Did you see the guy who was whistling?
Yes, I can still see him.
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl and walking her down the street.
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?
The day little Elsie Beckmann was killed, a man bought a balloon from me.
He was with a little girl... and he whistled just like that!
Damn it, man!
Are you crazy, throwing orange peels on the ground?
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!
I should report you to the police!
Outrageous behavior!
Hey, mister.
Aha! Here it is.
"In a 150-foot radius of the crime scene, three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand were found". There you have it.
Yes, it may be the same brand of cigarettes, but there was no old wooden table.
Of course, he could have written that letter somewhere else.
Good God!
The window ledge!
You're right.
Just a minute.
Red pencil.
My God, finally!
We're finally on his trail.
What?
They're on his trail?
- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.
Shut up!
What did you say?
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.
His every move is being watched.
- Mister.
- What is it?
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?
On your shoulder.
Here, I'll wipe it off.
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.
Out of the question!
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!
Maybe he's hiding inside the building.
Closing time!
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...
They're starting to come out!
Out in the street, and keep your eyes peeled!
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...
The boss came to my office today...
Turn off the light.
He'll get suspicious if he comes home and sees it on.
What time is it, anyway?
Almost 6:30.
He's gotta still be inside!
He definitely didn't come out with the office crowd.
No, just a moment.
The beggars have called for backup and surrounded the whole building.
They figure the guy's hiding in the building.
What sort of building is it?
What sort of building is it?
Nothing but offices.
I don't know what's in the basement.
There's a branch of the local savings bank on the ground floor, and the second to sixth floors are nothing but offices.
Above that is the attic space.
This is unbelievable.
Anyone still in there?
Anyone still in here?
What the devil!
Anybody still in here?
Damn carelessness!
All that trouble for one door.
Seems the guy's cornered now.
I think we should tip the cops off right away.
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!
Stay by the phone and call back in a few minutes.
What is it?
Are you crazy or something?
The police?
No! We're gonna get this guy ourselves!
Listen, the time now is...
All right. 9:00... 10:00...
At 11:00!
Evening. Did you know your gate isn't closed?
What? That's impossible!
Why I just... Wait, it is!
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!
Come on! Move it!
Let's go!
Come on, move it!
How many other watchmen are in the building?
Don't want to answer, eh?
Very well.
There are still two watchmen on their rounds.
Goddamn it!
Damn piece of crap!
Goddamned lock!
Damn it to hell!
Shit!
Careful where you shine those lights!
And don't stomp around like elephants!
He's not in the basement.
We went through it all and found nothing.
Two men are still going through the boiler room.
Hold it!
This is the last one.
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.
Safecracker sent me.
All right.
Listen carefully.
This is a new type of time clock.
Here's a general diagram.
If they're not set at exactly the right minute, an alarm automatically goes off at the nearest police station. Get it?
You got it?
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...
He's not in the boiler room or the coal room.
We turned over every piece of coal.
Hey!
Are you nuts?
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?
We gotta get in if we're gonna search the whole place!
But not through the door, you idiot!
Go through the ceiling of the office above!
Nothing.
All right. Down we go.
Hey, what's up?
Hey! What is it?
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!
What's going on?
- I heard some banging!
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?
Wait, damn it!
I've gotta see Safecracker!
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!
Quiet!
Go on! He has to be in there!
Here's the light switch.
Force the locks.
Come on. Hurry up!
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!
I heard someone banging, and I told Safecracker.
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.
Just came down to fill you in.
If I hadn't been alert, we could've looked for him for hours!
The watchman!
Three... one... four.
- Everybody out!
- What?
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!
Hold it!
Quiet down!
Five more minutes, six more storage sheds.
Move it! Get going!
Not like that!
Out of the way!
- He's not in here.
- Next door!
Come on! Faster!
- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!
Quickly! We've only got three minutes left!
No padlock on this one... he must be here!
Open it!
- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!
Hurry! Only one minute left!
There he is, the dog!
Come on! Move it!
Everybody out!
Get out while you can, damn it!
Move it!
For Christ's sake, get going!
What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!
If not, they might as well stay here, with or without the guy!
What in the hell is keeping them?
Finally! Thank God!
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!
He's not down here.
Hey! Who pulled up the rope?
Hey, who pulled up the rope?
Bunch of morons!
Hello there.
Hands up!
How can I put my hands up when I'm holding on to the rope?
Come out of there!
I'm really innocent this time...
...like a newborn babe.
This may surprise you, Franz... but I believe you.
Then everything's in order, and I can go now, right?
Just a moment.
Cigarette?
Uh-oh.
I'll take your word for it, Franz... provided... you can tell me... who the man was that you were looking for and that you found in that building.
I don't understand, Inspector.
A man, you say?
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.
I know nothing.
Nothing at all.
Of course.
There's just one thing I don't get: why you're covering up for the gang who left you in the lurch.
Fine friends, running off when things heat up, leaving you right in the fire.
Phooey!
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.
Listen...
What can happen to me anyway?
Maybe a little property damage... so what?
Nothing was pinched!
But something was pinched, my friend!
In fact, a good deal.
What? Something got pinched?
How much?
Tell me what you know and I'll do the same.
I already told you.
I know nothing.
Very well.
Give it some thought, Franz.
Leave a man alone for a couple hours... and a lot comes back to him that he couldn't remember before.
Take him away.
Send the night watchman in.
Mr. Damowatz.
Please sit down.
Now then, you said in your statement...
Listen carefully, in case you have to testify under oath later.
You clearly heard one of the burglars say to the guy guarding you,
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic".
Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.
Good.
Go home now and recover from your ordeal.
But please remain available for further questioning.
Of course, Inspector.
Good morning, Inspector.
Morning.
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann in the building?
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.
I'll come over myself.
What? I see.
Hasn't come home yet, eh?
Did you keep an eye on the old Winkler woman too?
Come in.
Come in!
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.
Listen, the whole block is surrounded.
If he decides to go home, he has to run into us.
So just keep on waiting.
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.
Damn it!
What do you want?
I wanted... to ask a favor of you.
Dishwater again!
I wanted to ask you...
Read this first.
- A statement?
- Yeah.
An office building was broken into.
Bennostrasse?
That's a respectable part of town.
Perhaps not that respectable after all.
Hell, this is getting serious!
What the... Did they mean to empty the whole joint?
What could they have been looking for in the coal?
Incredible! Unbelievable!
I'll be damned!
This is madness!
Ah, so they were after the savings bank!
Good God!
What could this mean?
I don't understand at all.
They didn't even touch it?
Must've been a bunch of real idiots!
I'll be damned!
Isn't that something?
Nothing stolen, but a man was carried off.
God knows where they took him.
That's just great.
And Franz isn't talking.
He's afraid, of course.
I know him well. Guy like him would rather jump out the fifth-floor window than be mixed up in a murder rap.
What if we could get at him from that angle?
Lohmann, if you'd be willing to help me out...
Very clever.
I see the wheels turning.
Let's send for this Franz.
You're wanted for questioning.
What? They sent four guys for me?
What's this about?
- Move it!
"Homicide squad.
Inspector Karl Lohmann".
What do you want with me?
What have I got to do with the homicide squad?
Yes, young man... your case has been turned over to me.
But why?
Why?
You boys did your work a little too well.
One of the watchmen...
Dead?
Accessory to murder.
Nasty business.
Inspector, I've had enough!
I want no part of this!
I'll tell you everything I know!
Very sensible, but, unfortunately, too late.
It can't be too late!
It can't be!
I'll tell you everything!
Even what we were looking for in that damn building.
Well...
The child murderer!
What?
Who?
The child murderer, Inspector.
Just a moment.
This had to happen to me!
Me, of all people.
Come sit down, my boy.
We're gonna level with each other, got it?
Certainly, Inspector.
And God help you if you pull something.
Now then... what have you boys got to do with the murderer, and where was the guy taken?
Well, Inspector... you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?
The one that went belly-up in the Depression?
That's the one.
Since then, the building's stood empty, and no one gives a damn about it.
Get out here! Move it!
Let me go!
What have I done to you?
You swine!
Let go of me!
Bastards!
Swine!
What do you want from me?
What do you want...
Help!
Help! Let me out of here!
I want out!
Let me out of here!
You'll never get out of here.
Gentlemen, I beg of you!
I don't even know what you want with me.
I beg you, let me go.
This whole thing must be a mistake!
A mis...
No.
No mistake.
Out of the question.
This is no mistake.
No.
No mistake.
You recognize this?
You bought a balloon just like this for little Elsie Beckmann.
Just like this one.
No!
Where did you bury little Marga Perl, you bastard?
But I never...
I never even met her!
You never even met her!
I suppose you never met her either, huh?
Or her?
You never met her either, huh?
- Stop him!
- Grab him!
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!
Watch out! The door!
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!
Let go of me!
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!
You have no right to hold me here!
Right? There's only one thing right for a man like you... death!
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!
Quiet!
Kill him!
You spoke of "right" just now.
We will be your right.
Everyone sitting here is an expert in the rule of law!
From six weeks in Tegel prison... to 15 years in Brandenburg.
They'll make sure you get your rights.
You'll even have defense counsel.
Everything according to the letter of the law.
Defense counsel?
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?
You, perhaps?
Hey, you.
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.
Your head's at stake here, in case you hadn't noticed.
And just who are you?
I have the dubious pleasure of serving as your defense.
Though I'm afraid it won't do you much good.
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?
We simply want to put you out of commission.
And we'll only be sure of that when you're dead.
But you can't murder me just like that!
I demand to be handed over to the police!
I demand to be brought before a real court of law!
That's a good one!
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!
So you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
And then you break out of the asylum or receive a pardon, and you're happy as can be, free to kill with impunity, protected by law on grounds of insanity... and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!
But I can't help it!
I can't...
I really can't... help it!
We know that one!
Before the judge, we all "can't help it".
What would you know?
What are you talking about?
Who are you anyway?
Who are you?
All of you.
Criminals.
Probably proud of it, too... proud you can crack a safe or sneak into houses or cheat at cards.
All of which it seems to me you could just as easily give up if you had learned something useful, or if you had jobs or if you weren't such lazy pigs.
But me?
Can I do anything about it?
Don't I have this cursed thing inside me?
This fire, this voice, this agony?
So you mean to say...
you have to kill?
I have to roam the streets endlessly, always sensing that someone's following me.
It's me!
I'm shadowing myself!
Silently... but I still hear it!
Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm tracking myself down.
I want to run... run away from myself!
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!
I must take the path that it's driving me down and run and run down endless streets!
I want off!
And with me run the ghosts of the mothers and children.
They never go away.
They're always there!
Always!
Always!
Except... when I'm doing it... when I...
Then I don't remember a thing.
Then I'm standing before a poster, reading what I've done.
I read and read...
I did that?
I don't remember a thing!
But who will believe me?
Who knows what it's like inside me?
How it screams and cries out inside me when I have to do it!
Don't want to! Must!
Don't want to! Must!
And then a voice cries out, and I can't listen anymore!
Help! I can't!
I can't!
The accused has stated that he can't help himself.
In other words, he must commit murder.
With that he has pronounced his own death sentence.
Right!
A man who claims that he's compelled to destroy the lives of others... such a man must be extinguished like a bonfire!
Such a man must be obliterated!
Wiped out!
May I address the court?
Counsel for the defense has the floor.
My learned colleague who just spoke... who is, if I'm not mistaken, wanted by the police on three counts of manslaughter...
That's irrelevant here. has claimed that the fact that my client was acting compulsively warrants the death sentence.
That's right!
He is mistaken, because the very nature of compulsion warrants an acquittal!
Get outta here, will ya?
Are you nuts, or plastered?
It is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
And a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?
That he should live?
I'm saying that this man is sick, and you turn a sick man over to a doctor, not an executioner.
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?
And one fine day the killing starts all over?
Another month-long manhunt!
Once again the insanity clause, once again the asylum!
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!
Is this supposed to go on indefinitely?
No one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
Not even the state, and all of you least of all!
The state must ensure that this man is rendered harmless so that he ceases to be a danger to society!
You never had kids, did ya?
Then you never lost any either.
But if you wanna know what it's like when a little child is taken from you, just ask the parents whose kids he took away!
Ask 'em about the days and nights not knowing what had happened, and later, when they finally found out...
Why don't you ask the mothers?
You should ask the mothers!
Think you'd get mercy from any of them for murdering their kids?
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!
No mercy for the killer!
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!
- Kill him!
- Waste him!
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!
I will not let you shout me down!
I will not allow a murder to be committed in my presence.
I demand that this human being...
That's not a human being! that this human being be afforded the same protection under the law rendered the common criminal!
Not a chance!
I demand that he be handed over to the police!
The police!
Of all the dumb...
In the name of the law...
In the name of the people...
This will not bring our children back.
One has to... keep closer watch... over the children!
All of you!
Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment
People ought to be ashamed of themselves.
Kicking up all that racket at this time of night.
What is it?
Is it a fire?
Well, why can't th ey knock quietly?
Oh, blast it.
We never... it's about
3 doors down.
That's where diana baring is staying.
I say, there's a policeman coming over i think.
Where?
Well, just coming around the corner.
What?
Well, that's funny
. i could've sworn.
No, you're right.
Look. There he is.
Coming down the side of the road.
I say!
That's druce knocking.
Looks as though he's tight again.
Here. Here.
Where's my shoes?
I better get down.
Aye. I'm on my way.
What, at this time of night?
My wife edna!
...with diana baring.
She's a...
Yeah, wait for me.
I'm coming.
I can't stop now.
I gotta go see what's the matter with druce.
Ohh.
Say, what's the matter, mr. Druce? Anything wrong?
My wife.
Will you please take this man away?
Come along now, druce, there's a good fellow.
No. Stop it.
There.
Open this door, will you?!
Open this door!
Hold on.
One second.
Open the door.
Come on.
Let go. Now, wait a minute now.
I can't wait to see what's going to happen.
Open the door, please!
Open the door for the love of god!
Open the door, for god's sake.
One of you run down to the station and ask the inspector to come along.
Tell him it's serious.
Is this woman a lodger of yours?
No, but miss baring is.
And she had mrs. Druce to supper with her tonight.
As a matter of fact, it was about... well, you see, mr. Constable, both these ladies are... i mean, were... you see, we're all members of the company that's playing at the theatre royale this week.
And as i was leaving the theatre, you see i'm the stage manager, and mr. Druce here, he's the general manager.
Well, you see, when i left the theatre tonight, i was invited to join them.
Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
One at a time, please.
They killed you, edna.
They killed you.
Tell me, darling.
Who, darling?
Did she do it?
You always hated edna.
Thought yourself too good for us... with your high and mighty ladylike ways.
Now, pull yourself together.
Ohh! Leave me alone.
Is there any brandy in the house?
You'll find some brandy in the flask on the table.
I was just giving some to edna when... when... i can't think.
I can't remember.
Well, there's none there. It's empty.
I'll run back and fetch some.
Perhaps you'd like a cup of tea, dear.
It'll warm you up.
T.
I'll go and make i i'll give you a hand, dear.
Shall i light this gas, dear?
Please, dear.
It's still hot.
It only wants a drop more in it.
Light the stove, will you, dear?
I, uh...
Uh!
I suppose mrs. Druce really is dead, you know, uh... you know, diana never did get on well with poor edna druce, and i know for a fact that they hadn't been on speaking terms for the last 7 weeks.
Miss diana said nothing to me about it.
Well, it's a fact. You can take it from me.
I don't believe she could have done it, though there's no denying she is headstrong.
I should say so.
Why, she gave in her notice the other day over edna.
Who, miss diana?
Yes, but, uh... jinx didn't want to lose her, so edna would've been glad enough to see her go.
Then suddenly... suddenly, last night, she changed, asked if they could make it up.
Diana was puzzled but asked her home to supper.
Now, i can't help feeling now that she had some reason for getting diana here alone.
Of course, perhaps it's been... hot stuff like she is, she thought one of her men was getting too keen on diana baring and wanted her out of the way.
What kind of tea did you use, dear?
Oh, my dear, i've tried so many kinds, i don't really remember which this is.
I'll get the door, right?
Would you mind... open the door, yes, if you don't mind.
Here. I say, i've just made tea.
That's all right, ma.
We'll get some down at the station.
Third act beginners, please.
Your call, miss baring.
That's miss baring's understudy.
There you are, see?
Going on now.
You are answering the door?
Answer the door?
Of course.
You know that.
Well, i don't know where we shall go.
Oh, tom. Tom.
Just a minute.
The inspector would like to have a word with you.
This is mr. Tom druid, inspector.
How do you do, sir?
It's about the murder, mr. Drake.
Now, there are one or two points we're clearing up.
I suppose you didn'’
’t happen to see mrs. Druce and miss baring leave the theatre together last night.
Yes, i did.
As a matter of fact, i remarked to fane, our leading man, about it.
He saw them, as well, you know.
Why? Is it very unusual?
Unusual? I should say so.
Unusual?
It's an absolute miracle.
As i was saying to my wife, i said, "annie, we met..." hold on, old boy. My cue.
Say, which of the 2 women is this?
Mrs. Druid?
Oh. Ha ha ha.
Now, i'm afraid you're unlucky this time, inspector.
This is handel fane,
100% he-woman.
Mr. Fane's our leading man.
I assure you, inspector, i'm not the other woman in the case.
I know that, mr. Fane, but i understand you saw the 2 women together last night.
Yes, just before i left the theatre, then i went straight to my rooms.
Alone?
Yes. Well, ion stewart came with me.
He came and he wanted to borrow some cigarettes.
He'd lost his case or something, and then i went straight to bed.
Say, excuse me, i'm on
Reginald, darling, has that cat gone yet?
Ooh, it's you, cousin yettie.
Don't you dare to try to run away from me.
Come here when i speak to you.
No, no, you don't.
That's the bathroom.
Come here, or are you afraid of a poor, weak woman?
He promised to meet, dear.
N?
Say, who's that ma oh, that's our heavy lead.
Ion stewart.
Very sound actor.
Is he married?
How did he get on with the prisoner?
Excuse me, inspector.
Say, how did he get on with the prisoner miss baring?
So-so, you know?
Was he popular with the ladies?
You talking about the jerk?
He's a bit too popular if you ask me.
Please, if you could call her a lady.
Shh. Now, doucie, remember, she's only just dead.
Oh, all right, all right.
I've never heard yet that telling the truth was a disgrace.
Only been one year about edna and stewart anyhow.
And the way i take it, mr. Stewart and mrs. Druce... excuse me. My line.
Oh! Don't bother to show me through.
I know my way.
This is not the first time, reginald.
Everything's going splendid.
Well, perhaps i ought not to say edna and stewart like that.
But, ted, you know what edna was like, anyone she liked had to be wrote in.
I can't wait any longer.
Quick! In here!
Excuse me a minute, inspector.
Shan't be long.
There's a quick change.
How do you do?
No, i'm sorry.
He's not here.
What have they done with her?
Who, miss baring?
Why, she's down at the station, i expect.
Did she say anything, do you know?
Is there anything i can do?
Markham, you don't really think she's done it, do you?
Why have they arrested her?
Saw it with me own eyes.
She was with the poker in her hand just by her side anyway.
Blood. Covered with blood.
Oh. Don't.
Why, what's the matter with you?
Blood always makes me feel sick, even the mention of it.
Well, that's all right.
Here's your helmet.
Ready?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hurry up, markham.
There you are.
Ok?
Yeah.
Yeah. Why not?
Members of the jury, diana baring is indicted and stands charge with the willful murder of edna druce.
For this indictment, she has pleaded not guilty.
It is your duty to inquire whether she is guilty or not.
I need not remind you that in the eyes of the law, men and women are equal.
The crime of murder in england, at least, is judged dispassionately.
Neither beauty nor youth nor provocation can mitigate... she gave me the strangest look.
Half-surprised... and half-angry.
And she said, how dare you!
And i don't remember anymore.
I just don't remember.
Whatever i did... must have happened when i was not conscious of myself.
That's all i can say.
Our defense is a complete denial of all responsibility.
E you've been able to observ the behavior of the prisoner in the dock... and in the witness box.
My learned friend has referred to her behavior as hardened.
Gentlemen and ladies of the jury, is there anything so hardy as the behavior of sheer innocence?
If you're convince d that the story of the defense represents the facts of the case, it is your duty to discharge the accused.
I shall like to remind you that truth is often stranger than fiction.
If, on the other hand, you are convinced that the evidence is indeed fiction, then i must tell you in the words of the counsel of the prosecution that neither youth nor beauty nor provocation can be held to mitigate the crime of murder.
Go and consider the facts for yourselves.
Well, uh, ladies and gentlemen,
We can't talk standing would you ladies like to sit together?
Anyway...
Why, i say, may we look?
Yes. I don't see why not.
That is, if the ladies haven't any objection.
No. Not at all.
Now, i think the best thing to do... if you agree... is to allow me to go over the broad facts of the case.
Because after all, i think it's pretty clear and i really don't think it'll be necessary for us to examine all the evidence again in detail.
Now, in the first place, the prosecution.
They say that the girl and the dead woman were on bad terms.
They make it up.
Edna druce comes to supper, they both have a drop too much and begin quarreling about some man.
For instance, you heard how the landlady said that she heard raised voices.
And the girl admits as much but won't give the name of the man.
Now that in itself is fishy.
The girl gets hold of the poker, loses her temper, and there's the end of edna druce.
The prosecution argues that it has proofs.
Practically caught red-handed.
Girl's dress all over blood, the poker at her feet, brandy flask empty, and the girl half-silly.
And in addition to that, no other person was known to have entered the house.
R.
I think that's pretty clea i think you ought to mention that the girl comes of a good family.
Yes, but it's those so-called well-bred people who are able to remain so brazen in the face of a thing like this.
Well, look at the way she behaved in the box.
Half a minute, ladies.
Let's get on.
Now, take the defense.
They don't deny she did it but argue that their case is that the thing happened when... she was in a fit or something.
Surely it is clear to you that in the evidence for the defense the doctor put forward a theory that it was due to the independent activity of the suppressed experience.
In other words, disassociation, which in this particular form is called a fugue.
So that a person displaying the strangest behavior for a considerable period of time would be quite unaware of this when he or she regained normality.
Well, i think the best thing for us all to do is to write down our opinions on a piece of paper, and then we can see how we stand.
Whichever in the minority... can then give their individual reasons and the thing can be worked out that way.
That makes 7 guilty... and 3 not guilty.
There are 2 not in.
I take it you haven't come to any decision at all.
I think the whole business is hateful.
There's too much responsibility put on our shoulders.
Either we've got to let her go free... that's not fair to the rest of the world if she's guilty... or we got to hang her and that's barbarous.
But if we recommend her to mercy.
Mercy? Is that what you call it?
20 years cut out of life.
The best years and to spend them in hell.
Have you ever been inside a prison?
It takes a civilized community to think out a punishment like that.
I think you exaggerate.
It's no use confusing the issue like this.
People who do wrong have got to be punished somehow.
You can't run the world on sentiment.
No, but that's what we've tried to do.
Save the unfit.
Get more children and make glorious wars to be rid of.
The whole world's a reeking pit of sentiment.
Your verdict, mr. Shackleton.
Guilty, i suppose.
Who's the other one?
You, mr. Matthews?
Is there anything special troubling you so that you can't make a decision?
Uh... no.
What is it prevents you from making a decision?
Well, nothing really.
Uh, well, uh... have you made up your mind at all what it's going to be?
Uh... no.
You heard the case for the prosecution.
That's pretty clear, isn't it?
Uh, yes.
And you know what the defense is, don't you?
Yes, but i, uh... don't quite understand what the lady meant when, uh... when she said no.
When, uh... when she spoke.
My dear man, mrs. Ward was only trying to tell you that the defense was that murder was committed in a fit of daytime sleep walking.
Yes. But, uh... the murder took place at nighttime.
Can you write?
Huh? Yes.
Well, will you please write down on a piece of paper whether you think the prisoner guilty or not?
Now that leaves only 3 for not guilty.
I'll give you my reaso ns for not guilty.
The evidence for the defense by the doctor is to my mind conclusive.
Anyone who's followed the modern trend of pscyhological investigations must be aware that any person suffering from severe mental strain, such as the prisoner may have been following on so many rehearsals and things, may bring about a sudden condition in which the patient is no longer either conscious of or responsible for their actions.
We've already had evidence that the prisoner's mind is a delicately balanced one and quite liable through some hidden flaw in that mind to become deprived of all consciousness and readily enter into a state wherein the body is still functioning, though no longer under the control of the will.
And it is on these grounds, that i feel that diana baring must have been the victim of circumstance.
I have no doubt that mrs. Ward is right.
That being the case, it is quite liable to recur, possibly with the same results.
Well, that's a point i hadn't considered.
Well, it's really important.
Because with this poor gal, you have to consider not only this one tragedy but others that may follow it.
There may be other crimes lying latent in her.
You mean, there's a sort of dual personality in her.
One of these persons is violent and cruel and the other, just an ordinary woman.
Of course.
If we set this bad personality free, we must be prepared to show her the responsibility.
Yes.
If we let her go and anything should happen... the blood would be on our hands.
Do you wish to alter your verdict, mrs. Ward? , now, mr. Daniels... after all you've heard does your opinion still remain the same?
Well, you know, i find it very difficult to believe that a girl of that sort should do such a thing.
After all, she looks perfectly riveting, you know.
Well, you know what i mean?
A sort of girl one would like for a daughter.
I presume, sir, that an ugly woman would stand very little chance at your hand.
The thing you've got to decide, mr. Daniels, has nothing to do with the qualities of the young lady as they appeal to you.
Yes, of course.
I know that.
But, that's all, well, you know what i mean.
It's... it's pretty awful and all that sort of thing. , besides the thing you're thinking of t?
What's your verdic well... well... oh... guilty, i suppose.
Well, now we're practically complete.
There's just sir john.
Well, don't dismiss me as easily at that, mr. Foreman.
G.
Yes? We mustn't be lon time is money, you know?
Time in this case, may i remind you, is life.
If i'm delaying you all, i apologize.
I admit that i am not... a man of business.
I'm a poor actor.
Oh, come now, dear sir john.
I repeat... the poorest of poor players.
And my time on the stage will be shortened had i not for years trained myself to... how shall i put it... to apply the technique of life... to the problems of my art.
But today, ladies and gentlemen, that process is reversed.
I find myself applying the technique of my art to a problem of real life.
And my art is not satisfied.
In the first place, i am fairly convinced that diana baring was telling the truth when she said she remembered nothing.
In fact, i have been impressed by her behavior all through the trial.
But my dear sir!
Oh, i say, sir john.
Oh, please don't think i'm taking the same line as our friend mr. Daniels here.
He made a very gallant attempt, but i assure you my reasoning goes a little deeper.
I am convinced further that she was again telling the truth when she said she had drunk no brandy.
Buy you've forgotten the evidence of the police sargant.
He said she smelled of drink and appeared dazed on arrest.
How do you know that was not the wine she had at dinner?
What about the evidence of markham, the stage manager?
He found the empty brandy flask right on the spot.
Yes, but... what about the evidence of the actor, stewart?
He said the women had been enemies for some time.
Ah, he was the one who said prisoner was rough to mrs. Druce on the stage once.
All pointing to her violent nature, sir john.
Yes, but that was not altogether borne out by fame.
You know, the, um... well, the female impersonator man.
But his evidence was of little use.
He was so obviously in love with the prisoner.
In any case, everything was perfectly clear when the body was discovered.
Why, the woman was actually caught in the room red-handed.
And found with a poker by her side.
And her dress all over blood.
And quarrelling over a man.
That's right.
Any answer to that, sir john?
Think of her personality.
She's not the kind of girl to get drunk.
Brandy in the flask, was there?
She doesn't deny it.
That's right.
Any answer to that, sir john?
Not at the moment.
Then there is the question, was there anyone entered the house that night?
Landlady says not.
Girl says not.
They were alone.
That's right.
Any answer to that, sir john?
Not at the moment.
But have we taken it too much for granted that no one else could've done the murder?
They were alone.
Says they quarelled.
Admits it.
That's right.
Any answer to that, sir john?
She does not admit it.
She says she doesn't remember.
Is that a guilty woman's answer?
Red-handed.
And her dress all over blood.
Make an exhibition of yourself.
Waste of time, waste of money.
Quarelling.
Hands all over blood.
Any answer?
Any answer?
Any answer to that, sir john?
Well, now that we've all agreed on our verdict, i can inform the judge that we're ready.
Stand up.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?
And do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Diana baring, have you anything to say?
My sentence of death should now be passed upon you according to law.
It's absurd, i tell you.
It's absolutely absurd.
? Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes?
Praise silence, all of you, on the pain of imprisonment while sentence of death is passed upon the prisoner at the bar.
So the conference adjourned until tomorrow.
The baring murder trial came to a conclusion today with a verdict of guilty, and sentence of death was passed on diana baring.
And that is all the news.
But here is an s.o.s., which has just been brought into the studio.
We've been asked by th e commissioner of police to broadcast the following... will anyone... brandy cocktail you ordered, sir.
Right.
Ring up mr. Bennett, will you?
And ask him to bring around details details of the particulars for the last 3 nights.
For the last 3 nights.
Also, plan on looking at the flask.
Very good, sir john.
Kindly communicate at once with news cup in jar to telephone victoria 7000 or with any police station.
This is the national program.
Our concert tonight is an orchestral one, given by the radio symphony orchestra.
They start by playing the overture totristan und isolde by wagner.
Funny that s.o.s.
Coming on top of that other.
Save her soul.
Save her.
If i'd stood up longer, i might have worn them down.
Why couldn't they see the girl as i did... the rest of the fellows on the jury.
But anyone standing in the dark on a charge like that... probably looks different from the same person somewhere else.
Ah, amusing the way she stood up to everybody.
There's no doubt that did her a lot of harm.
Yet, it was that manner of hers that... very attractive i thought.
And i wonder what her feelings are now.
Who drank that brandy?!
Why didn't i force that point home to them?
Easy to figure these things out afterwards.
The girl said she didn't drink it.
Yet she admits she might have killed edna druce.
That's queer.
Why admit a big thing like that and yet be sure she didn't do a small thing such as drink a drop of brandy?
All that came to light to me today.
I'm sure i was right when i raised that.
Quite frankly, more certain now.
How do we know that someone else didn't drink the brandy?
Perhaps there was someone else, that's the whole thing.
Whoever drank that brandy!
Mr. Bennett has come up to see you, sir john.
Sir bennett.
Glad you're back, sir john.
Been reading about it all.
Plenty of publicity.
Been awful for you, though.
You having met days before.
Well, she wanted to become a star, a year ago that was.
I suppose you can say in a sense that she has.
A star in a murder... bennett, please.
Look here.
Get hold of my understudy.
Tell him he has to go on again tonight.
Pray god that i give him a better role.
Oh, and, um... get on the telephone straight away to my lawyer, mr. Vice senior.
Oh, i can give it to you.
Temple bar.
Yes.
I want you, as well, to get hold of as many as you can of the members of that company.
You know, the touring company at the time of the murder.
In particular, the, um... funny little man, the stage manager.
I forget his name.
I'll see him at the office in the morning.
Temple bar,
5, double 9, 3.
But i thought the trial was over, sir john.
No, my dear, bennett, the trial is not over, by a hell of a long way.
Well... is it conscience, sir john?
Conscience.
A lying man's conscience.
Oh, they're... they're engaged, sir.
Ok. I'll try later.
Don't wait.
I am.
No, don't wait. Go.
Diana baring... why did i send her away?
Told her it'd be good for her to gain experience in the providence.
Good for her.
And now she's come back.
Uh... i think, uh... boiling it all down, dear, i think perhaps we better, uh... accept sir john's offer after all, don't you?
Oh, yes.
Either that one e. Or one of the other
2. It's all the same to m
That would be sir john himself.
I don't think.
Oh, well.
Seems she won't let us stay on here any longer.
That means lucy will have to go back to her aunt's... oh, i mean, uh... sophie will have to go back to her aunt lucy.
I don't want to go back to aunt lucy.
I want to go on tour with you.
I can't let you go back to sir john's.
Here's a letter.
I really thought you were kidding me, i really did.
What is this?
Ooh. It's from sir john himself.
He'd be happy if we could be in his office at 12:00.
Do you think we could get there in time today?
If we try.
I'll turn the kettle off.
This just needs a little benzine.
Dear, i don't think... petrol will get the shine out of this suit.
I'll say! There' s a job for you!
Look sharper.
I think it must be an ankie.
Yeah. I think so somewhere.
Ted?
Yes, dear?
What have you done with me nail polish?
I haven't seen it.
Here.
Hope this... hope this smell of petrol goes off.
Oh, well, you can blame it onto the car.
I think we shall just about do it.
Actually, my dear, it won't be.
Oh, that's all right, missus.
I promise you your bill shall be paid the first.
I'm not referring to bills.
It's druce i'm after
2-6 to the first 10.
All right. We'll see.
How do you do, mr. Markham?
Nice.
Thanks, sir john.
Ohh. How do you do, sir john?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
You know, it seems to me, mr. Markham, that we as artists have a double function.
We use life to create art and we use art to, how shall i put it... to criticize life.
You agree?
Oh, certain, mr. John.
Uhh!
Yes. I knew you would.
Now, mr. Markham, between artists... ahem.
Do we always fulfill our double function?
Are we not so much occupied in using life to create art that we forget our other function?
I foresee your objection.
You're going to say, what opportunities does the round of daily life offer?
I wonder if... if you ever saw a problem play i once did.
Pistols for two.
Oh, yes.
You did.
Yes.
What the critics describe as a high-brow shocker.
Now... when a high-brow shocker occurs in real life, does the public call in the actor?
No.
Uh... mr. Markham, i read your thoughts.
You know, you're saying to yourself, this man is, um, talking to his hat.
Oh, no.
Oh, of course you are.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be the practical man i take you for.
You're also wondering to yourself, why on earth i've brought you here.
Well... that brings me at last... to my object.
Now... yesterday and the day before, i was on the jury at the baring trial.
You impressed me both as an artist and as a man.
Ooh.
By the way you gave your evidence.
Now, i want from you, if i'm not being too indiscrete... oh, no.
The inner history of that case.
Oh, what is it that, uh... see, now, of course, um... bennett talked over with you the question of that engagement?
No, sir.
You see, we'd rather, uh... rather hoped that you'd be free to take on the stage management when i send off this tour at christmas ofthe green eye.
Whew.
I also thought of working out some arrangement of a yearly basis, but we could easily talk that over later with bennett, can't we?
Oh. Thank you very much indeed, sir john.
I, uh... well, i am free at the moment.
And i've had a lot of experience that i'm sure will come in very handy.
Then that's settled, huh?
Uh, yes.
What? What is it, mr. Markham?
Well, it's my wife, sir john.
You see, we've always been joint, as you may say and, uh... well, would it be asking too much, sir john, if a part, i mean, any part that you... ohh. I see.
Mrs. Markham acts.
Acts, sir john?
Heh. Well, uh... perhaps it's not for me to say, but... but my doucie... well, you may say i'm prejudiced, sir john, but i've been stage manager now for 10 years, and it is a fact that a wife, even a good one, is not always the right thing to have in a company, if you understand what i'm getting at, but my doucie, my wife, she's... well, professionally, she's been my right hand.
And there's no one she can't play 24 hours' notice.
All ladies.
From a gladys cooper to a molly lloyd part.
Has she ever... she has her... oh, but... no, no, no.
Go on. Do.
I was going to say she has her off days, of course.
Well, who hasn't?
Yes. I mean, only last summer i had to speak to her seriously about it.
She had a quick change-over from a barmaid to a salvation army lass.
And it told on her, there's no doubt about it, it told on her.
After about a week, i said to her straight out, now look here, my dear, this can't go on.
If you can't pull yourself together, we shall have to go into shakespeare.
Well, she didn't say much.
Not one that was reasonable.
But she thought it over.
And for the rest of that tour i'll give you my word, sir john, she was tallulah.
Pure tallulah.
Where is mrs. Markham now?
She's downstairs waiting in the... oh. One minute then.
Let's send for her to come up.
What, is that you, bennett?
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry. No.
Wait.
Hello, bennett, mrs. Markham is somewhere downstairs.
Would you have her sent up, please?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Up to my room.
Now, mr. Markham... about this trial... i confess to feeling very uneasy about it.
You see, i played a part in the thing, the part of a juryman.
And it was not until the curtain was rung down on the death sentence, that i said to myself... this is not a play, this is life.
Life can be less kind than your dramatists, mr. Markham.
Life permits a beautiful and unfortunate girl to go to the gallows.
Unless... art for once can bring its technique to bear.
Good lord, do you mean to say you think she's... innocent, my dear markham, yes.
It was assumed she was guilty because she couldn'’
’t deny it.
Yes, but i saw the... what did you see?
Diana baring sitting beside the dead body.
She was dazed you say.
What was the cause? Drink?
She hardly ever touched anything.
And who did? Think it over, mr. Markham.
Then there was the pain in her head.
Was she examined by a doctor?
Might he not have found traces of a blow if he'd examined her?
But no, he didn't.
He assumed like everyone else that she was guilty because she didn't deny it.
And there was no private investigation, no inquiry, think it over, mr. Markham.
You know, i feel the most terrible responsibility.
I was one of the 12 people who decided the fate of this poor girl.
I'd found myself caught up with the machine that...
That makes these things... ah, mrs. Markham, so good of you to come with your husband this morning.
Oh, i was quite glad, glad as a breath of fresh air.
Ohh. What a charming place you have up here, sir john.
And piccadilly, with all the shops so near.
You'll, um... you'll stay to lunch, of course.
Ohh!
You know, i must confess, i find it difficult sometimes to wait to a reasonable hour for my luncheon.
Yes, i must say, i feel the same way myself.
It's very rare that i can do without my little tidbits in the morning...
Oh, javier, a cocktail at once, please, and serve lunch. hey.
He's engaged us to see him.
Joint.
No.
Yes. I find mr. Markham is free to join me.
So... please.
So i thought he could, um... oh, we can settle all that later, can't we? Yes, please.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, one more, please.
In the meantime, success to our researches.
Your husband and i have been discussing the baring case.
And we feel that if the murder were approached from another angle, it... oh, sorry.
We shall be able to arrive at a different result.
What?
What? And get diana off you mean?
But she can't get away from that poker.
If you don't share our convictions that miss baring is not guilty...
Well... well, i mean to say diana baring was such a nice girl.
I never thought for one moment she could've done a thing like that.
Didn't i always say, ted, that anybody who knew her never could've thought it for one moment?
Oh, sir john, have you found anything out?
Are you going to take it up yourself?
Oh, we would be so glad to help, wouldn't we, ted?
Shall we now?
I really don't kno w where to begin this thing, do you, markham?
Well, uh... well, yes, sir john.
Oh, i see. Uh... oops.
Yes. I wish i knew where to begin.
Here.
Yes, can i help you there?
Sir john didn't know where to begin, ted.
Huh?
No, no. Let's hear it, mrs. Markham.
See, i'm completely in the dark.
If your husband could show the way, i shall be more than grateful.
Go on.
What is it, markham?
Well, sir john... i should say the best place would be the back of the town where the murder was committed.
Yes. Do you think you could spare me a day or two of your time?
Why, yes, of course we could, sir.
See, if i might suggest that we could go over the ground and you could show me one or two places connected with the murder.
But, you mean, it might have been someone else altogether, what killed edna druce?
Well, i don't know.
It might've been somebody from outside.
How do you make that out?
Well, i don't know.
Miss mitcham didn't do it.
And miss diana didn't.
So it must've been somebody from outside.
If it was, they'd have to get in.
And they'd have to get out again.
Heh. That's clever well, all i can say is... the first thing we got to do is to find out who saw somebody, apart from druce, anywhere near there at half-past one that morning.
Well, ted, for start, there's that chap we thought was the policeman coming around the corner.
Oh, that was nothing.
Just a minute.
I shall like to hear something about this policeman.
Well, you see, sir john, it was like this... only after the murder, when the knocking woke us up, i was over by the window slipping on my negligee, and i popped my head out of the window to see who it was making all that noise.
And i saw the policeman coming around the corner.
So i said to ted, i said, hey, it's the police.
And then i took my eyes off him to tell ted here... and when i looked again, there was no one in sight.
And then ted said, yes, you're right.
Here he comes.
And when i looked again, it was a different policeman altogether.
What had become of the first one?
I have no idea, sir.
He must have turned the corner and come back.
Is that the corner down there?
Yes, that's it, sir.
N? You're sure it wasn't the same ma well, it couldn't have been.
We only took our eyes off of him about 2 seconds.
Oh, blast.
Uh... is there anymore here do you think, sir?
I shouldn't think so.
My god, that's druce.
He must be crazy.
Yeah, we better get down.
You are not going in my house.
Take him away, please.
He's done this before.
Please, promise to stop it.
Yes, that's all right.
Now come along, druce.
My wife's... yes, i know.
But you're muc h better at home.
Come on.
Come on now.
Oh, this is terrible for me this business is.
I shall have to move.
I'm sure i shall.
Yes. Well, uh... mrs. Mitcham, we'd like to show this gentleman around.
That is, if you don't mind.
May i?
Oh. Yes, sir.
Of course.
Yes. Certainly.
Will you come in?
Well, sir john, that's where they found the body.
Right in front of the hearth there.
And, uh... miss baring was sitting just about there.
Oh, by the way, did you ever get your poker back, miss... oh, i can't bear to talk about it, especially with poor miss baring being where she is.
Why, you might as well convict cleopatra.
You think anybody could've got in from the back of the house?
You see just beyond the backyard y, there's an alleywa and just beyond there e.
There's the theatr and look, sir, the dressing rooms are off the back.
Yes, it would take quite an athlete to get in that way.
I don't see how anyone could get in here with this aspedstria filling up the window.
Anyway, without upsetting it, and look at the size of it.
Yes. It's a fine plant.
Unless, of course, it was somebody who knew the room.
But miss baring did not have any visitors, only mrs. Markham every now and again, and mr. Fane and mr. Stewart to tea and mister... what's his name... the little man with the squeaky voice.
Oh, tom druid.
Yes. Yes, that's him.
Squeaky voice, that reminds me.
In your evidence, miss mitcham, you said you had heard angry women's voices.
Yes, sir, i did.
Would you swear to that?
E. Oh, yes, sir. You can' t mistake a woman's voic you know, i had known a contralto... oh, yes, but this was high, quite high. miss mitcham.
Miss mitcham.
Oh, my god, miss mitcham.
Where are you?
The kitchen chimney's on fire, miss mitcham!
That's alice.
One moment, miss mitcham.
Excuse me, sir.
I can't stop just now.
That alice of mine has set the kitchen chimney on fire.
Didn't you hear her calling?
No, no, no.
That was me.
Or did i... you know, markham, i never know.
I'm ashamed to say, i played a trick on you, miss mitcham.
Now, the high voice you heard that night may not have been a woman's.
You've just admitted it.
No. I have not admitted anything.
And i don't hold to playing such tricks.
And i'd like to ask you, sir, what you mean by it.
And you, too, mr. Markham.
Standing there, grinning.
You realize that your evidence as it stands may hang miss baring?
Ohh!
Now, i'm not blaming you.
Not blaming you, miss mitcham.
But you swore that you heard women's voices calling.
And i have to prove to them that it might have been a man's voice, especially a high-pitched man's voice... just like mr. Druid's.
Ohh! I'd do anything for miss baring.
Oh, can't something be done now?
Yes, yes. Now you're going to help us further.
First of all, could you show us some more of the house?
Miss baring's bedroom, for example?
Yes. Certainly, sir.
This way, please.
I don't think you'll find much in here, sir.
There's a few of her things over there on the windowsill.
I didn't like to send them to where she is now.
Oh, i think she'd like them.
Well, let me have them and i'll send them on.
Why, it's one of you, sir.
Uh... lot more places to go to, sir john.
Thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yes. Lot more places, sir john.
There's the stage door and then we'll go roun d to stewart's lodgings and then we might go along to the police station, have a chat with the inspector.
He knows me.
And then, um... well, then we can go across the red lion, g have a sandwich while we're talkin to joe the proprieter.
And then... ooh, and then there's stevens, if the policeman's still on his beat.
Yes, i think that' s about all we can do.
Oh, yes, we'll fin d out something if it takes us all night.
I thought perhaps, um... a little dinner... oh. Oh, that's all right, sir john.
Don't you worry about doucie and me.
We've had to go without before, didn't we, dear?
Oh, i should say.
Well, shall we begin, sir john? This way.
Evening, mate.
I've come to see if any of my people left anything behind.
No, nothing, except that there broken basin in number 4 dressing room.
That was some of your chaps after they left.
They never paid for it neither.
Whose room was that?
Uh, fane's and stewart's , i believe, sir.
No, none of our people broke that, mate.
Oh, there is something for you.
This cigarette case left behind in number 4.
You'll know who it belong to.
Oh, righto. When i find out who it is, i'll forward it.
Can we see that dressing room?
Uh, i'd like to see that broken basin.
I'll take you long where does that window look out to?
The private houses round the corner.
I wish i knew who broke that basin.
Lot more places to go to, sir john.
Thank you, mate.
Good day.
Did you find anything?
No, nothing much.
Oh, honestly.
Well, here we are, sir john.
And, uh, i hope you sleep well.
I expect you'll find she's left something cold out for you.
I'll be along first thing in the morning.
I'm awfully sorry but... get to bed myself.
I must say, this street gives me the creeps.
Well, good night, sir john.
Come along, dear.
I say, markham.
Markham... you don't think that i'd better eat at the red lion after all, do you?
Well, that's, uh... just as you like, of course, sir john, but, uh... i thought you wanted to sleep se at the policeman's hou so as to be able to find out something.
I mean, that's why i made the arrangements.
I mean... considering we haven't found out very much today, i think that... it'd be better if you did, sir.
Perhaps you're right.
Good night, mrs. Markham.
Oh, good night, sir john.
Excuse me, sir.
Be quiet.
You, too, children.
Take it.
Ohh.
We mustn't play on the bed.
Sir, shall i pull over the table?
Leave them things be!
Oh, please, don't trouble.
Just put the plate on somewhere.
I'll, uh... i'll see to it.
I'll dress first.
Oh, don't say that, sir.
I know what you gents like.
"A nice cup of tea and a kipper before i get up.
And i'm a new man."
That's what my last lodger used to say.
Stop playing on that bed!
Damn children.
They follow me about.
Ma this and ma that.
On my word, i don't have a moment's peace morning or night.
What do you two be doing?
That's quite all right, really.
He's got my bootsy well, i never did.
Wait till i get you downstairs.
Take this kitten down and don't you bring it up here again.
Now, please, if you could put this plate on the table and bring up some hot water at once, i'll get up.
Just as you like, sir, but...
Now, go downstairs and get the water on. Go on.
Now, why can't you leave him be?
Time and time again, i've told them not to mess with the lodger's luggage.
I'll have your father take you to the police station if you can't stop touching.
They do keep on touching.
Some lodgers don't like it.
Princeton, i had a couple a little while back and one of them give them a good clip for doing that.
You know the baring case?
Well, they was in it.
As a matter of fact, it was my husband what found the body.
He was part of the baring case. ohh.
Well, i never.
Ha ha! She's taken a fancy to you.
There ain't many she takes to.
You're not coming around now, i suppose.
Yes, oh, yes.
You were saying... about hopping on the luggage... oh, yes. Well, arthur was messing about with one of them's luggage when he come across what he thought was his father's helmet and uniform.
Afterwards, i went up.
Mr. Fane, it was.
And i said i don't like the idea of having this in my home.
Just because he had a uniform in the bag he only thought it was his father' s outfit.
I felt a bit of a fool when i finished because he simply turned around and he said i didn't know what i was talking about.
Well, i said if it wasn't you, it must have been the other one who was here... mr. Stewart.
I spoke to mr. Stewart afterwards but in the excitement of the murder i forgot all about it.
Come in, my dear markham.
I thought i'd drop by, miss.
I'll send the water up, sir.
Come along, now, come along.
Don't encourage her too much, sir. That's right.
Run along down.
Here, arthur.
Just come on, come on.
Now go in the street and play.
Don't you get run over. Go on.
That's right, go on.
Doucie and me found out something, sir john.
Won't you sit down?
Thanks.
You know that cigarette case you found in the theatre?
Well, last night i went to smoke in bed just before i went off, you see?
So i took out that case.
Doucie saw it wasn't mine.
Said, i've seen it before somewhere.
I said, whose is it?
She said stewart's.
And then she took it, she noticed what i thought was a beer stain on it... she says, wait a minute.
That's blood on it.
And sure enough. Well, look, see for yourself, sir john. Look.
I believe you're right stewart.
Who wore a policeman's uniform in the past who lived here?
Fane and stewart, sir.
Stewart had a quick change-over with fane in the third act.
But fane had a special uniform made to fit him so we had 2 uniforms in the company, sir john.
You're an important factor in this case, markham.
In fact, most important at the moment.
Well, uh... well, if it helps, sir john.
No, the most important factor seems to be a policeman whom you did not see on the night of the murder.
You remember your wife saw a policeman coming down the street.
You went to the window and you couldn't see one.
Then suddenly there was a policeman.
Now, markham... that policeman was
2 different people.
And for all we know... the first one was not a member of the county constabulary.
You mean, the first one was a fake, sir?
A chap in policeman's clothes?
Our next job is to find out the name of the man miss baring withheld.
Was he a member of the company?
Did he wear a policeman's uniform?
If she still refuses to give the name... perhaps the cigarette case will help her to remember.
You mean, the name of the man they were calling about on the night of the murder?
This end, please.
Won't you sit down?
Oh.
Thank you.
It's very good of you to have come.
But i can't help saying... i'm extremely surprised.
Well, you see, i... naturally, i... i've taken a very grea t interest in your case.
Don't let's talk about it.
How's your play going?
Oh... pretty fair.
Of course you know i was away from it some time because i was on the jury of your trial.
I know.
I wondered... my countryhouse is in that district.
As you know, i can't discuss with you what happened on the jury... but i do want to tell you... is muriel heatherly still playing the lead with you?
Yes.
I do think she's such a good actress.
Don't you?
Miss baring... you remember our meeting?
Oh, yes.
You do remember.
Of course.
Very well.
You see... if i hadn't sent you away on tour to get experience... you wouldn't be in this position now.
That's, in a way, why i feel... sort of... responsibility.
That's why i've come there might be... there must be some grounds for an appeal.
I knew that would happen.
I knew someone would try and get me off and think they were doing me a kindness.
Imprisonment for life.
Why, a week of it's nearly driven me crazy.
If they want to do the other thing... they can.
I thought it and got over it.
Except at night... it'll be no worse than the dentist.
And if i have done this thing, as they say i have, i'm better out of the way.
As for the other thing, if you're a friend to me, you couldn't do it.
Lock yourself up in your own room... for one day.
Only for one day and see.
Tell me what i want to know, i'll have you out of here altogether.
What is that?
I can tell you.
Tell me the name of the man discussed by you and edna druce.
I've said so many times before.
He has no connection with the case.
Besides, i didn't quarrel.
I'll tell you now.
Edna druce tried to say poisonous things about him.
And i just put my fingers in my ears and kept them there.
So that you actually couldn't hear a sound.
You couldn't have hear d of any other person that had come into the room.
No. I suppose i couldn't.
Why wouldn't you listen to her?
Because... i knew what edna was trying to tell me.
What was she trying to tell you?
I can't answer that.
It involved... somebody else.
Plenty of other people have been involved in this case.
Markham, stewart, druce... fane.
Why shouldn't this one man's name be known?
There was something... something he daren't have known.
But which you knew.
Yes.
What was it?
You realize what you're admitting by your silence?
You're shielding this man because you know you'r e in love with him.
Oh, but that's impossible.
Impossible? Why should it be impossible?
I see no reason why it should be impossible.
Why, the man's a half-caste.
What's that?
What did you say?
A half-caste?
Black blood.
Why haven't you said so much?
Tell me the rest.
What was his name?
I won't tell you that.
Ever.
Will this help you to remember the name of the man you were quarelling about?
Stewart's cigarette case?
That's not one of stewart's things.
Things?
You mustn't give the prisoner anything here, sir.
And the time for the interview has nearly ended, sir.
Oh, sir john.
Please.
For these last few moments, let's talk about something else.
Yes.
There was a photograph of me in your room.
How did you know?
I went there to make inquiries.
How did you come to get it?
I've always been keen on the stage ever since i was a little girl.
One has one's heroes.
That's why i came to you for a job.
And i sent you away.
Oh, let's talk some more quickly.
Diana, i... miss mitcham sent me some of my things.
Your photograph with them.
I've got it in my cell now they let us keep some... come. Time's up please.
Good-bye.
I'm going to find fane.
Handel fane.
Handel fane.
Handel fane.
Handel fane?
What's become of handel fane?
Any news of fane yet, markham?
Not yet, sir john.
I'm trying some more of the agents though.
Haven't you found fane yet, ted?
I can't bear the suspense.
We shall be up all night, you know.
Oh, for god's sake.
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Is that lambersee agents?
Yes. You found fane yet?
He's wanted for an important job, you know.
Yes, at once.
What's that?
Gone back to his old job?
What? Trapeeze artist?
Under what name?
Where?
No, can't stop now.
Got him at last.
Yes, that's him all right.
Dressed up as a woman, eh?
Always was good at that.
An extremely clever way of hiding.
Markham?
Yes, sir?
I've an idea.
You know yourhamlet?
Every line of it, sir.
Then let me suggest for your consideration the series of events embodied in act 3, scene 2.
That's the play scene, isn't it, sir?
Yes. The play scene.
Do you remember the title... the mousetrap?
Yes.
Well, when he comes to my theatre to read a part i shall offer him, s.
There'll be 3 of u
2 cats to one mouse.
Yes, but what about the cheese, sir?
The cheese, yes.
The cheese will be a fat part, markham.
A villain's part in the blood and thunder in a play that i'm going t o write especially for him.
A play based on a recent well-known murder case.
I imagine he will play his part, as i hope we shall convince him... to the life.
Come in.
Can you give me a minute?
Certainly.
Oh. Who is that you have with you?
Of course, i remember.
This is the gentleman you suggested.
Yes, sir john.
Mr. Handel fane.
Oh, yes.
Do come in?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Sit down.
Here you are.
Oh, thank you.
Oh.
Thank you.
No, bennett, don't go.
I may need you.
You see, i always conduct these interviews so badly, i'm just as likely as not to leave out the really important points.
Now, i suppose i better begin by an explanation.
I dare say mr. Bennett has told you the author of the play?
No, sir john.
I understand you wish that to be kept a secret for the time being.
Well, i wrote the play.
That was a simple matter, but it's proving astonishingly difficult to find the right person for one particular part.
Might i ask you to stand up for one moment?
Of course.
You know, bennett, he looks it.
He looks it quite perfectly.
Exactly what i've been thinking, sir john.
Would you mind... oh, sit down, do.
Would you mind reading one or 2 lines?
You know, just to give me some idea?
Of course.
Oh, i say, bennett, this is quite illegible.
Tell... what's his name... baldwin to bring me a clean copy of act 3.
Thank you.
Sir john?
Might i ask you... what kind of play is this exactly?
Well, you may question my taste, but as an artist, you'll understand my temptation.
My subject, mr. Fane, is the inner history of the baring case.
Ohh. Thank you.
Really? Your... your indifference astonishes me.
Aren't i right in thinking that you were a member of the druce company at the time?
Yes, that is so.
Then you knew both women concerned.
Yes, i knew them both quite well.
Now, let's begin.
Oh, by the way, mr. Fane, i understand you're appearing at present at the circus.
Would that interfere?
No, it was my old job, it and i've gone back to because times have been a little difficult and... ng however, i understand you wouldn't be starti for 2 or 3 weeks.
No, i don't suppose so, no.
Let me give you... some idea of the scene.
Here is a table in front of a fireplace, more or less a visage.
On the table there's the remains of a meal.
And, of course, the brandy flask.
You know, mr. Fane, of course, you know all the details of the case. i can't help wondering why nothing spectacular developed in connection with the brandy.
Thinking as a dramatist, i can't help feeling that the brandy was not exploited with sufficient imagination.
Then, of course, the law has no sense of drama, has it?
No.
No.
Then again, let me see.
I'm afraid l... i thought it best to begin from a point just before the actual murder.
There's a short scene between the 2 women... which turns into a quarrel.
In the middle of it, you make your entrance, on the words... i got this from the evidence... on the words...
"friends? I can tell you things about your friends that you don't know."
Just carry on from that point, would you?
Now, how on earth did you know the entrance was from the window?
That's highly clever.
And look, mr. Fane, you've forgotten your script.
The script.
Now, where are we?
Ah, yes.
"Friends? I can tell you things..." wouldn't it be better if i were to pick up the poker from the back fireplace before i made the entrance to the room?
Excellent idea.
I'll put that in.
Thank you.
May i have the poker?
No, i'm terribly sorry we only have electric fires here.
Would this pencil do?
Very well.
We must get on without the poker.
You can use your imagination, eh?
Now then... through the window, into the room.
You creep through the double doors.
The 2 women are facing each other.
You come slowly around, taking care not to be heard and gradually you approach the one whose back is to you.
Now, you raise the poker that is in your hand as the other woman says...
"you fool! Don't you know that he's a half..." what a pity, sir john.
The scene isn't finished.
I was getting quite worked up to it.
I thought perhaps... mr. Fane... you might be able to collaborate with us.
I'm so sorry, sir john.
I'm afraid i understand so little about playwriting.
Perhaps later on... when the script is finished... you'll allow me to giv e you another reading.
Find out what time fane comes on tonight.
I shan't be...
How do you do, sir john?
Markham.
Who'd have thought of seeing you here?
Well, you see, i'm, uh... i'm working fo r sir john now.
Yes. Mr. Markham is helping me with my new play.
I suppose you find brandy steadying for the nerves?
Mine's very nerving work, you see, sir john?
You never know what may happen.
Hurry up. You're next.
I presume you've come to talk to me about... that part again, sir john.
R. You know perfectly well what i've come here fo
Hurry up, fane.
There'll be a wait if you're not careful.
If it isn't... how are you, sir john?
Come to see the show?
No, not exactly.
I've really come to see mr. Fane.
Sir john, if you wouldn't mind coming down to see me after my act, i shall only be too pleased to talk over that little matter we were discussing.
For god's sakes, play something!
Uh... fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all.
He says...
"the 2 women are standing
"facing each other in dead silence.
"They are so lost in the tension of the moment
"that they do not hear the murderer creep through
"the double doors into the room.
"The murdered woman is at that instant
"going to speak.
"The murderer springs forward.
"He hurls the first woman aside.
"She is stunned by the fall,
"but he doesn't notice it.
"Infuriated,
"he strikes out at the other woman
"with the poker.
"She falls by the fireplace,
"she's dead.
"He nearly faints at the sight of the blood.
"He drinks the brandy,
"then he sees the other woman beginning to stir.
"He must get away...
"through the back window.
"A leap or two.
Finally, a climb into the theatre dressing room."
That accounts for the broken basin.
"But how to get home undetected from the theatre.
"An idea.
The policeman's unifor m he wore on the stage."
There's your policeman , markham.
"He walks home a murderer.
"A murderer on an impulse.
"The silence of the mouth of a woman
"who knew his secret and was going to reveal it
"to the woman he dared to love.
There's a melodrama for you, sir john."
Well, markham... you have it all.
Poor devil.
And diana baring... she knew all the time... he was a half-caste.

No, Sir. No such luck, Sir.
Pretty sudden, wasn't it?
A chill killed him off suddenly.
He was as fit as you and I when he came home on leave.
Well, there's one thing.
Brodie the novelist will be remembered...
...when half the brave soldiers of the War have been forgotten.
I wouldn't be surprised, Sir.
No, no. It's all right.
By the way, when is the funeral?
Tomorrow, Sir. Very quietly.
In the country.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good bye, Sir.
- Good bye.
So long, girls. You'll be in the work of caring for our men.

Come in.
What's the meaning of all this?
Who are you?
Giving a soldier the sad news.
Look here, Sir...
I don't even know your name.
"You can call me ‘R’."
R ex-comission?
"No, ‘R’ for rhododendron."
Have a good crossing from France?
Excellent, thank you. Until I found out I was dead.
Very sad. Casualties have been very heavy lately.
Look here. Have you seen this?
What's the explanation of that?
Well, the explanation of that is this.
What does that mean?
We can't advance in Palestine till the Arabs are behind us.
We're not quite sure, is that it?
When the censor snips up to this extent, it seems pretty critical.
Listen, I don't see...
And you won't see it if you keep on talking.
Germany is making every effort at the moment to buy up the Arabs.
Do you love your Country?
Well, I just died for it.
You can't guess why?
I suppose I'm waiting for you to tell me.
The raids always upset the fish.
Never know what to do with them.
Here are your passports.
One British, one American.
You have a reputation of being a true observer of life, Ashenden.
Ashenden, me?
Yes. You.
The late Mr. Brodie was much too well known for our purposes.
Hey, where are you driving at?
Ashenden's going to Switzerland to find a German agent who's...
...leaving for Arabia shortly via
Constantinople.
Description?
- None.
Well, that's helpful.
But your predecessor... Is so...
In his last message he said he
"was staying at the ‘Excelsior’."
I want you to go there.
Here's the man playing for both sides who may help you find him.
And when I've found him?
That sounded just like a pistol shot, didn't it?
Report to me and you'll be given further instructions.
I see.
We have to be allowed to reach
Constantinople?
Precisely. I like a man who makes quick decisions.
Tonight a car will take you to
Dover.
You will change to a boat which you'll take across the Channel.
From there you'll go to
Switzerland by a small route.
Your assistant will be there before you.
Well, I've an assistant, have I?
Yes. A very useful one.
"We call him ‘Hairless Mexican’."
- Why?
He has curls and isn't Mexican.
"You can call him ‘General’." He'll appreciate the compliment.
You will see for yourself.
Where's the General?
He took to the cellar, Sir, when the raid began.
He cannot have lost his nerve?
Mr. Ashenden is leaving shortly.
- Very well.
So long.
- Where's my cap?
If the Swiss know what you're up to they'll have you in the jug.
That's right, I'll watch my step.
Dear, it's much safer down here than upstairs, you know?
I'd rather be up with the bombs than downstairs with some people.
Hello, General. I thought you came down here to dodge the bomb.
"Mr. ‘R’, you should know better."
- Mr. Ashenden.
General Pompeliu Moctezuma de la
Bella del Conde y de Lonbus.
Excuse me, I have very important business. See you in Switzerland.
Hello, dearie! Sweetie!
Just a moment! I love you!
Lady guy?
- Not only ladies.
Now that you've met we won't delay the departure any longer.
I better go see what he's up to.
So long.
Good Evening. You have a room for me I believe.
Oh, Yes.
- My name's Ashenden.
I will see.
Ashenden. Yes, you are here.
Room 234 and 5.
Big room and sitting room.
Will you sign your name, please?
- Thank you.
Is there a private bathroom?
Certainly, Monsieur. Madame
Ashenden has insisted on that.
Who?
- Madame.
Your wife, Monsieur.
She arrived yesterday. You were not expecting her so soon.
Well, not quite so soon.
It's a surprise for me isn't it?
- Indeed. Yes, Monsieur.
Mrs. Ashenden is looking well?
Madame looks great, Monsieur.
Oh, it is nice, isn't it?
I'll fill in this now.
I'll do it when I'm upstairs.
Room 234 and 5, you said?
- Yes, Monsieur.
I suppose Mrs. Ashenden has a key?
Yes, Monsieur.
Shall I come up with you?
- No. I think I'll surprise her.
Have my luggage sent up, please.
- Certainly.
What were those numbers again?
234 and 5. I'll write them down.
- Thank you very much.
There, there. It's all right.
I am so sorry. It was my fault.
It's quite all right.
No harm done.
Poor old boy.
Someone here tripped over him.
That's all dear. It's nothing.
Aren't you through that bath?
I'm coming out soon!
- Good news.
What are we going to do tomorrow?
"- Why are ‘we’?"
Aren't you going out with me?
Didn't you promise?
What about a nice private picnic in the woods around here?
What about lunch in the dining room downstairs?
Oh, lady, didn't I make any better hit with you than that?
No. I'd respect a married woman.
I've only known you 24 hours.
Sure. That means in 48 you'll know me twice as well.
And by the end of the week...
You're looking for anybody around here?
I'm looking for my wife.
And by the end of the week, what?
A divorce, it looks like.
Are you Mr. Ashenden?
- Guilty.
Darling, you're here at last.
Angel, how well you're looking.
Delicious.
I hope you haven't been lonely.
No. This gentleman and I met in the lounge yesterday, didn't we?
Yes. A good angel put us together.
He's been most kind and entertaining.
Mr. Demartin, isn't it?
Sounds well the way you say it, but it's really Robert Marvin.
Pleased to meet you Mr. Larkin.
How do you do, Mr. Ashendan?
Well, it's time for the triangle to retire from family circle.
Exit... battle.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Who's our gallant?
- Jealous?
My good girl, there's no need to play a part now.
Time to tell me who you are, what your name is...
...and why you're acting as my wife.
My name's Elsa Clarington. Answer the other questions yourself.
"You mean that old crazy ‘R’ has" loaded you on me?
Yes. As you so elegantly put it.
- Sent you on the same job?
"Yes. ‘R’ sent me and told me to" join my husband. Mr. Ashenden.
So here I am, sweetie dear.
How do I know you're the person you say you are?
Here's my passport.
That's better.
All right, stick them down there.
Anything else?
First, I'd like to see yours.
- Oh, that's better still.
All right. You're my true and lawful husband.
I have a note for you.
It's in my bedroom.
Our bedroom.
- Mine. You sleep there.
Here it is.
Well, what does it say?
Do you mind if I come in?
If you don't mind my getting on with today's work.
No, I don't believe.
I had to work it out, it in code.
- I know.
You opened it?
- Of course I did, don't be silly.
The part that concern you says...
I'm making you a married man to round off you new character.
What else does it say?
Your wife comes a fighting stock.
A regular fighting time factor.
I look to you to direct her in the right channel.
Be as canuvial as possible.
"Yours, ‘R’."
"What does ‘canuvial’ mean?"
Luxurious.
What does that mean?
Speak English.
Affectionate. In a big way.
So, what do you think of your new husband?
I'm incredibly surprised.
- Thank you.
I've read your books for so many years, I thought you were older.
I'm glad about it, that's all.
That's very kind of you.
What do you think of me?
I don't know. I'll tell you when you finish putting on your face.
Why did you really take this job?
I wanted to do it.
Well, you might have been a nurse or something.
Me? I'm no ministering Angel.
I'm in Switzerland for a thrill.
- Think I'm gonna give it to you?
No. You're the means to an end.
- The end? Being?
Excitement, Big risks, Danger.
Maybe being a little...
This sort of thing maybe not as amusing as you think.
Look, let's understand each other.
Dozens of people have come here to do something worthwhile...
...There's no use of you standing there looking middle aged and...
...bleeding about safety...
- All right, all right.
How do we start?
"I suppose ‘R’ told you why we're" here for.
A little. He said you'd tell me the rest.
Hello.
- How did you get here?
My dear friend. How do you do?
Ashenden! Where have you been all the time? I haven't seen you...
Yes, yes. Take it easy, General.
How did you get in?
I was sitting on door all the time, but...
...And I was knocking and barking but you did not hear.
Too busy in company of beautiful woman... Lady... Girl...
You know this man, do you?
I believe he's a swindler. He followed me around the hotel...
...trying to show me some silly trick with pennies.
Very nice trick.
Your wife?
- How do you know she's my wife?
How do I? Very simple.
Passports in table.
Each one inside each other one.
Just like no other.
- You know him?
Of course I do. He's one of our colleagues, aren't you General?
General Pompeliu Moctezuma de la
Bella del Conde y de Lonbus...
...as I said before.
I may as well tell you at once that this lady is not my wife.
Then what?
She has been issued officially to
"me by our old man ‘R’."
Issued? What do you mean?
Issued like a passport?
"Or you mean ‘given to you’? "
This is too much.
And who has given her to you?
Will you tell me who?
"Maybe perhaps it's ‘R’!"
"This ‘R’ Foul! Merde!"
Incompetent man!
It's awful! This is too much!
For you beautiful woman!
And what for me?! Nothing!
Nobody! Nothing!
Caramba! Caramba!
For you all this!
And nothing for me!
No, no, no.
I resign.
Brodie was a Bachelor, that's why
Ashenden has to be married.
It makes it much safer, that's all.
This girl has been issued to me as part as my disguise.
I resign.
She's nothing to me. I'm nothing to her. Can't you understand?
Maybe perhaps this lie is true?
Well, of course it's true.
What do you mean?
Maybe in this case, affection of beautiful lady are free for me?
Absolutely, as far as I'm concerned.
Can't you do anything about it?
Do I look like I enjoy tricks?
General, no love making...
We can't afford to take risks.
The Swiss Police will be on us in no time.
We have to move on.
What have you done since you got here, anyway?
I am too much of a gentleman to tell this in front of lady.
I dare say.
Let me remind you we're here for a purpose. We start tomorrow.
Our first job is in a village in the mountains called Langenthal.
In Langenthal there's a church.
In that church we'll find the
"organist who ‘R’ says is been..."
...working for the Germans but is now on our side.
When we get in touch with him...
He'll put us on the track to find the man we're after.
What do I do?
Nothing. You stay here and wait in case there's a phone call.
Thank you. That should be a good start.
Mind removing your friend so I can go on with my dressing?
Go on, General.
Well?
- Well?
How does Mrs. Ashenden look now?
This has all been done for your special benefit.
Very kind of you, I'm sure.
You're fond of yourself, aren't you?
Married life has began.
All right. Shout about that as much as you like.
You've a job to do, and part of it is to keep it secret...
...no matter what happens.
What do we do?
Light three candles over there.
He'll see us in his mirror.
Do you know any prayers?
Do not incite me, please.
I know some, so do you?
Put those back, you foul.
This floor makes my beautiful legs very angry.
We better look out. He might be waiting on the other side.
Strangled.
Nice work.
Neat. Very neat.
Someone did not want us to speak to him.
That's what it looks like, doesn't it?
Look.
- What's that?
Not so neat after all.
Big struggle before he died.
Me, better. Much better.
The man who owns this, is the man who killed him.
Yes, Sir. He is also the man we are looking for.
You're right. That's the motive.
One way of stopping a fellow's mouth.
Look, someone's coming.
We'll have to stay up here for hours!
I said, we shall have to stay up here for hours!
But your wife shall wonder what happened to her little General!
Let's do stay a little longer.
- All right.
I've always wanted to come to
Switzerland. The people are nice.
Yes, specially Charlie, there.
Hey, Fred...
Do you mind moving up a bit so we can see the scenery?
Oh, no, don't. It's nice.
Are those your own teeth?
Course they are. Don't be silly.
I bet yours aren't.
Well, I never thought you'd look.
Wait a minute.
Do you mind holing them for me?
You're so disgusting.
Look at that nose.
Bet if you squeezed it you'd get a quarter of whiskey out of it.
Sam, or George... Whatever...
Give me some smoke. Will you?
Smoke.
Voulez-vous...
He's fond of you.
I was afraid of that.
No, you don't understand...
Cigar... Cigaruchen.
Compris.
What is this strange bond you have over coachmen?
No mystery, lady. Just a well equipped man in every language.
Bad language.
- Why you...
Man paralyzed when about to strike woman.
What's the matter? Winned?
No, love.
- Again?
Why not?
Speaking of love...
You think your bow legged husband would mind if I kissed you?
He's not bow legged!
I'll call the police!
He's too bow legged.
If you don't let me kiss you, mind if I bite your adam's apple?
Speaking of your husband, if you keep defending him like that...
...the idea might get around that you love him.
I think I do.
How long has this been going on?
- Since yesterday.
Yesterday? That's defying after the way you flung yourself at me.
Oh, I'll call the Police...
Home, James. I mean, the casino.
Can you play the...
Diablos, she's not in dinning room.
Where can she be?
I don't know.
What's the matter with you?
I'm still blind in this ear.
All right, all right. Calm down.
She'll probably here somewhere.
En Mrs. Ashenden this evening?
Madame has gone with another gentleman to the casino.
Telegram for you.
- Thank you.
First find men.
Then do the job.
Let's go to Casino to see nice
Mrs. Ashenden.
Can't you keep you mind on the business? General this is urgent.
You are always jumping conclusions.
Maybe nice Mrs. Ashenden has found out something. Let's go.
We can't go in these clothes.
First we should go change.
Have you had a nice tip today?
- Yes, Sir.
Is that all I get?
- Yes, Sir.
Use your own money.
- I haven't any.
All right, then.
One.
I could put all those on two.
Cents. Two cents for twins.
That's what you and I gonna raise when we settle down together.
What do you say?
Don't be a fighter, honey.
Let's do this in a big way.
Look, that's the dog from the hotel.
Don't you like him?
You know exactly I hate odd dogs.
Hello, darling.
- Hello, dear.
You must have had a long walk.
I felt rather bored in the hotel so I came here with Mr. Marvin.
You don't mind, do you?
- Good heavens, no.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
Nine of them.
What do you think of that?
Thank heavens you've come to take your dull wife of my hands.
I'm tired of talking words in one syllable.
Don't know each other. Do you?
This is the gentleman I was talking you about this morning.
General Pompeliu Moctezuma de la
Bella del Conde y de Lonbus.
Mind if I call you Charlie?
I mind.
Pardon me while I take up my winnings.
Well?
"- ‘Well’, what?"
What happened?
Did you get any results?
The result of our day's work.
What does that mean?
- I can't tell you here.
That's a lot of buttons for somebody.
You'll have to pay seven buttons, won't you?
Whose button is it?
It's one of your's, isn't it?
What?
I suppose it must be.
Would you kindly take that dog out of here?
Nonsense. The dog was tied up.
Look, it broke the leash...
Why do you think the dog's in?
What is that suppose to mean?
It means that's our man.
You mean we may have to...
How thrilling.
I'm glad you think so.
But he's English.
Let me have another look at him.
There are rules that are quite...
- I don't mind about the rules.
He looks so harmless.
Monsieur, there's a censorship...
That dog's not doing any harm.
It couldn't bite anyone...
What's the trouble?
Seems that the sausage hound busted the regulations.
Good heavens. How many of them?
- All of them, I guess.
Are these regulations governed by the Geneva convention?
No, Monsieur, they are regulations of the casino.
Have you got a copy of these regulations?
There's no need.
They are well known.
He hasn't got a copy of the rules.
Under no circumstances what so ever...
Shall be allowed to have this dog molested...
Unless you show us a copy of the regulations governing the...
...transportation of livestock in this city now.
Right. Now we'll do the whole thing over again.
Do you understand, Sir?
Now I'll go to my office.
And then, we shall see!
May I introduce you to...
- It has already been done...
My name's Keeper.
- Mine's Ashenden.
Remember my wife, don't you?
- I do.
There you are.
You know Mr. Keeper?
- How do you do?
Excuse me. Pardon me.
You also know Mr. Ashenden?
Yes. Me friend of every men and beautiful wife.
That reminds me I haven't seen my wife.
This calls for a celebration.
Anybody here on the wagon?
Well, I'm hardly dressed for parties, Mr. Marvin.
I had to stop by in Langenthal...
In that case you're entitled to the first drink.
Come along.
Did you hear? He was in same village today that we were.
Yes, I've heard. Go on, talk to him. I've got an idea.
This college boy is no simpatico.
Go along. Talk to him. Go on.
I thought you were starting your long trip today.
No, no, no.
The day after tomorrow.
Oh, good.
My dear, I want you to meet Mr.
And Mrs. Ashenden.
My wife.
You've already met Mr. Marvin.
- Yes.
Look at your tie. It's terrible.
Come here, let me show you.
Did you hear? They're leaving the day after tomorrow.
Comprendo.
- This is what I want you to do.
Have you been away from England long?
I have never been to England.
I have never before been away from Germany.
Oh, I see.
I'll have a double Gin Tonic.
We've done discussing the matter,
General. That's quite enough!
It is not enough!
Me, just beginning!
Boy, how about a nice friendly little drink?
Pull yourself together, General!
Don't make a scene! Shut up!
Me, not shut up!
What's the trouble?
- Me not shut up!
It doesn't matter. It's nothing.
It's alright. I'd like a Cognac.
It is not all right!
He insulted me in very big way!
He says this thing is nothing.
I say this thing is very big something.
You bet your sweet little ass.
- General, really.
I make propuesta, that we should climb mountain all together.
He says I'm not fit for mountain climbing because...
...I only think of beautiful women.
This is too much!
All I said was you couldn't go climbing mountains and taking...
...beautiful women with you.
General, he was only joking.
Forget it.
Don't be so touchy, General.
Me, touchy as much as I want.
I bet 5 English pounds that I can climb mountain higher than you.
Don't be so silly.
- Go on Ashenden.
It's just a silly joke...
You see? You see? You see?
He's making the climbout!
You mean, the backdown.
That's what I said.
The bet is set.
All right, I'm on.
- Fine.
Ladies and gents, the fight's on.
All we need now is a mountain.
Anyone got a mountain?
Well, there's the Langenthal...
If you can take a guide with you.
There's a tricky bit, but...
About a thousand feet above the center.
Where in town could we get a guide?
Do you know somebody?
In fact, If I weren't going away the day after tomorrow...
...I'd take you up myself.
That would have been orthodised.
What a pitty.
Of course, it can't be helped.
I suppose you couldn't make it tomorrow, could you?
As I matter of fact, I could.
How about you, General? It would mean breaking a date, right?
Why? What for? Is the mountain climbing in middle of night?
Well, the guide is engaged.
While the boys are mobilizing, how about a dance for you and me?
Sorry, I'm just a little old fashion wife.
How about it?
Excuse us, won't you?
You were wonderful.
What are you going to do?
Wasn't it marvellous the way he fell for it?
I'm glad you enjoyed it anyway.
Do you thinks he suspects anything?
No. He wouldn't be coming with us if he did.
Ok, you better stay behind and look after Mrs. Keeper.
Oh, why?
Somebody's got to keep her busy.
You could have a German conversation with her.
But, why can't I go with you?
- Don't be absurd.
I see. I get to stay here with an old housewife...
...while you go out and have all the fun.
Listen, can I tell you something?
- What?
We aren't handling a fox, we're handling a man.
An old man with a wife.
I know it's war, and it's our job to do it...
...but it doesn't mean being murderous.
Simple murder.
And all you can see in it is fun.
Shame.
Come here, my dear.
Come on, come to me, will you?
Don't you take note on that funny dog there.
I suppose your husband's a very good man.
Yes. When he is there... always safe.
Is this your home?
It was our home.
Where'd you live before the war?
If you please, we do not talk about the War.
Will you sit down and we'll have a little German conversation?
I'd love to.
How much German do you know?
I'm afraid, very little.
Suppose you say to me the days of the week in German.
Samstag... Montag... Dienstag...
Mittwoch...
That is good. But pronounce the words more, as so...
Samstag... Montag... Dienstag...
My mommy says have you room for a new boy in your class.
No. Go away.
Pardon me, I was speaking to the teacher.
Do you understand German,
Mr. Marvin?
Not a word.
But I speak it fluently.
I'll sit down here by this little girl.
I promise to be good. I won't pull your hair or anything.
Little girls shouldn't smoke cigarettes in class.
Would you like to try it, please?
The days of the week in German.
Sure.
Samstag... Montag...
Di...
Your pronunciation is terrible.
Well, I thought so.
Look what it's done to the dog.
Hope we will all be back in time for dinner.
What appetite you'll have,
General?
Sure, sure. We'll have big fun when this thing is over.
Now, perhaps you are going to an hotel, and you ask for a room.
In what way would you say it?
I want a double room and bath for myself and my beautiful wife.
This is my beautiful wife.
I speak to Mrs. Ashenden.
What would you say?
I would say...
I want a single room, please.
Well, the going's not too bad so far, is it?
No. Pretty good, really.
I suppose this sort of work is a child's play for you, General?
For me just second nature.
Look. We have a grand view.
- Oh, yes.
"As Englishmen say: "The better"
"the day, the better the deed."
Correct?
- Yes. Approximately.
He is always troubled when his master is away.
He thinks of him all the time.
Please, do say that again.
There's no sense in doing it.
Did you get it?
So, you're out of luck.
You're forgetting instructions of
"Mr. ‘R’. You prepare, me finish."
Besides, what about my money for this job?
What are you waiting for?
You two fellows tired?
He makes again the back down.
I mean, the climb up.
He's tired, he says.
Well, If you're tired, let's cut it out.
Good.
- No, no, no.
This is only trick, for me loosing my bet.
Oh, you won your bet all right.
I'll pay you the money.
No, but there is my honour... to make the climb.
Oh, go on and climb by yourself.
Stay back here with me, Keeper.
No. Please, come with me.
No, you stay here. He can carry on alone.
No, I better go with him.
It's a bit trick up there.
Thank you.
You can see us reach the top from that observatory over there.
Come on, General. I'll race you.
Nolly is being a very bad dog.
When your master comes home, I'll tell him how you've behaved.
And then what will happen?
You stay there like a good dog.
Now, Mrs. Ashenden... we'll go back to our lesson.
You think 20 marks is too much for the room, so what do you say?
Oh, I don't know.
What does it matter?
Now you can see them easily.
- Thanks very much.
I don't understand.
He's never done this before.
Look out, Keeper. For God's sake!
You're very quiet tonight.
What's the matter?
We go to a nice place.
And this is how you behave.
Sorry. I apologize.
You must be terribly American,
I suppose.
General! How are you?!
Here we are. Good evening.
How have you been?
Good evening. How are you?
Heard the police a while ago.
Perfectamente. Perfectamente.
Beautiful accident. Very sad, but could not be helped.
Poor, gentlemen.
Didn't they found out anymore about him?
Nothing important. Only picture of his wife when she was young...
...and picture of little English village, where he lived once.
I forgot.
I have telegram for you.
Waiting in hotel.
But me, gentleman.
I haven't opened it.
"It's from ‘R’."
I have to decode it.
Chocolate.
But the button...
Wrong man.
They're very much like these buttons.
Are more common here than we thought.
Lovely place Switzerland, isn't it?
So gay, such charming people.
I've never met so many charming people in one place.
I love them all.
Specially, General.
I think the General's so... so funny, don't you?
Elsa... Please...
Hope you don't think I'm cruel, but, I'd like to tell you how...
...How wonderful it's been meeting you, Mr. Ashenden.
I often wondered what you were like before. But now I know.
Think of that.
- Shut up.
I believe you're trying to stop me. Please don't.
I've been terribly sincere about all this. In fact...
...I'm quite ashamed.
I'll tell you a secret...
I fell in love with you at first sight.
I thought it could last.
I barely knew you.
I thought it would.
I've been so faithful to my love for you...
I can't tell you how unkind
I've been to poor Marvin.
I'm glad it's over now.
You say... It's over.
I thought it couldn’t have been, but it has.
Aren't you glad?
It must be boring to be idolized.
Yes, I suppose I'm glad.
Obviously your able to treat this thing as a job you’re paid for.
I suppose you are paid a salary?
Yes. I'm doing it for money.
Didn't you know?
It isn't.
You know it isn't.
- Yes it is, I tell you!
I don't like murderers at close quarters as much I expected.
Or murderers, for that matter.
I don't like them much either.
Don't make me laugh!
It hasn't been much fun to me either lately.
I don't wonder.
I didn't kill him, you know?
You were there when it was done.
Yes. I was there all right.
Half a mile away.
At the end of a telescope.
Yes. It's quite true.
"Just on of those "Lone Ranger" services.
That doesn't make it any better, does it?
I think you're beginning to find that out, too.
Aren't you?
Don't cry. Have a cigarette.
Why can't we give it all up?
Would that make any difference?
- To us?
I thought you said it was all over.
You know...
You weren't the only one that crashed.
Come on. It's getting cold.
Let's go in.
There are times, Mrs. Ashenden...
It's almost a pleasure to be alive.
Is this one, Mr. Ashenden?
I don't quite know yet. Just hold this cup and I'll tell you.
Yes it is.
- Is it?
My coffee.
No, no, no. Business first.
Have you finished that letter of resignation?
Yes, yes. It's on the table.
"Wonder what ‘R’'ll say when he" gets this.
Specially the post script.
What will happen when we get back to England?
Nothing much.
"R" will have to find somebody to" take my place. That's all.
Why? Doesn't matter much to you, does it?
Answer the telephone.
Answer it yourself, lazy.
- Don't be rude.
Hello?
Is that the ugliest woman in the world?
Who is it?
- Your hated rival.
I have many hated rivals.
So, which one is it this time?
Marvin.
Yes, thanks. Much better.
Yes, all alone.
The neglected wife as usual.
Yes. You have my permission to spill it.
That's very sudden and...
- Shattering.
...shattering for a girl.
I'm afraid I can't because I promised my husband I'd...
...you better not let him hear that.
"You can cut out that "Darby and"
"Jones" stuff."
You see, I know your husband.
And look what you're passing up.
Me! A cave man with a college education.
What more do you want?
For heaven's sake.
Get off. You're bending my back.
Well, this is my last word.
Listen...
Pardon me while the brain reels.
Our first kiss...
...or am I just goofy?
Was that really you?
Yes, my love. Another it wasn't.
What's the idea?
Who have I been kissing?
Hold on. Here's your little Elsa.
Hello?
- Is that you at last?
Let's get this straight. Who've I been kissing? You or the old man?
Very well. I'm satisfied.
Now get me:
This, Madame, is the end.
So long... And good bye.
And may you have quintuplets.
I'm quite sorry about that chap.
Believe he's really fond of you.
Isn't anyone else?
Yes. Me.
Hello, General.
- Morning.
Come to join the celebration?
- Yes.
Making the morning husband and wife exercises?
No. Not this time.
We're doing an article today.
One doesn't daily.
I intrude, yes?
No. None the least, General.
We've just come to a decision and we're celebrating it, that's all.
Hurray.
We're going away from here tomorrow.
I've resigned.
Resign. What does this word mean?
It means labour impossible.
Imagine. Could I resign?
Imagine... whole Army would do this resign business.
I wouldn't do it if I were in the
Army.
Fighting in the front line is a better job that this.
"If Mr. ‘R’, doesn't accept it," which he will certainly not...
I can't help that.
- Then, what?
I'm fed up with this whole thing.
It isn't as we've done any good since we're here so far.
We aren't claimed bloodhounds as of others.
What do you mean?
They can easily find somebody better than us to take our place.
Maybe for you, they can find.
Not for me.
Me, very well trained blackhound.
Me, first class blackhound.
Yes, I know all about that, thank you.
Yes? Then it's good.
Come here. I'll tell you...
- What is it?
The reason why I'm here is of very big important use.
Very best up to now...
- I dear say.
Directamente to the right man.
No making mistakes this time...
- No good.
Me promise, me do everything.
You only give advice.
Word of honour. I mean, promise.
Advice is all you get. Hurry up.
Tell me what's it about.
Don't go.
It's all right. I'll only go for a few minutes.
It's all right.
I'll be back.
General, isn't that your room?
Yes, but here is my little baby's room. We go here.
Querida! Queridísima! How have you been all the time?
I brought you a friend of mine to see you.
Why have you come into my bedroom? I'm a nice girl.
So I see.
How do you do?
Isn't she sweet?
Please, sit down.
Your secretary, General...
I suppose.
No. Yes, my private secretaria.
Isn't she sweet?
Please, General. Tell me what's this all about.
"This is very much ‘all about’."
You wait and see.
We met last night and I played my little penny game with her.
We get acquainted very quickly.
- Of course.
We also talked afterwards.
- I wonder what about.
Little conversation.
She tells me about her fiancé.
What? Is he here, too?
- No, no, no.
He works in chocolate factory.
On the top floor.
But he earns 4 times as much as any other clerk.
And here I come to the point.
I can't believe it.
You go and play... find and seek with this. Yes?
Here, baby.
This chocolate factory isn't only factory. It is also...
...you know what it is?
No. I don't know.
It's the big German spy post office.
You mean, a clearing house for information?
Yes. Exactly.
But secret. Very secret.
No one knows.
It's manager doesn't know.
Only 2 or 3 workmen know.
Including her fiancé, I suppose.
Exactly.
Yesterday message gets through which is very big sensation.
Message for someone.
You mean, the man we're after?
- Exactly.
Are you quite sure about that?
- Of course.
The right man this time, really?
That's what I said.
Did he mentioned any names?
No he did not.
- Well, then what good is it?
But he knows.
And I'm quite sure he'll say for small money amount.
Five thousand francs!
What? Are you crazy?
Didn't I give you already big money amount for you?
One hundred francs!
- That was for me?
The other's for Carl.
Because he wants to get married.
Room 234, please.
Hello?
- Elsa, something's happened.
I have to go for a few hours.
Would you send someone with my hat and coat?
We can easily still catch the night train.
Did you get that?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.
Yes, I must.
Haven't time to explain details.
I'll let you know as I get back.
I shan't be long, really.
You do understand, don't you?
- Yes.
I'll go find him and send him to you.
Come along, here's our guide.
No, no. I'm Carl.
- I'm sorry.
Do you have the money?
What does it say?
My trunk.
Has it come down yet?
Yes, Madame.
But it has no label on.
Where shall I send it to?
I don't know.
Could you send it to the station?
And in my name as it calls for?
- Yes, Madame.
And as my letters...
Thank you, sir.
Hello, Elsa.
- You're leaving?
Yes.
Madame, this is the end.
Didn't you hear me?
I didn't think you meant it seriously.
I have to leave, alright.
I just got a hurry up call back home.
So if I don't check out now, it's...
...goodbye to little old Europe.
This trip, anyway.
Where are you going?
To Greece, I think.
I was leaving this for you.
Something to remember me by.
Where are you going?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Do I look like I've been crying?
No, I don't think so.
Why? Anything wrong?
I'm leaving, too.
What about your husband?
I haven't one...
Anymore.
But only this morning you said...
- Please don't ask me to explain.
Sir, the car is waiting.
I could go with you, couldn't I?
But I couldn't... I mean...
Promise I won't get in the way... or interfere with anything.
But couldn't... I mean, shouldn't you go back to England.
I couldn't do that.
They're still at war.
I'd be terrified.
Please, let me come. Won't you?
Only a few minutes left, Sir.
Please.
All right, come on.
Yes, Sir. Yes.
No, Sir.
Mrs. Ashenden just left, Sir.
Yes. She left the hotel.
Mr. Marvin, Sir?
He's gone, too.
Yes. To the railway station with
Madame.
What do you think?
She's gone.
- Is this funny?
Elsa's gone with him.
- No.
She must have known it after all.
She's the firstest class blackhound of all of us.
She jumps ahead of us all the time.
Run! To the railway station! Go!
Colonel Anderson.
Here you are.
- Here's your master.
Upside down.
- Sorry.
Sit down.
What's the matter? Feeling wet?
- No.
Look at that girl getting ahead of them like that.
With any luck, Ashenden will get him on the Greek front, here.
Here, before they go into Turkey.
What if Ashenden makes a mistake?
- We'll see about that.
Get the Army Headquarters on the line when I get back.
You don't think it's dangerous for this man getting through?
I don't. Get me that line.
- Yes, Sir.
It's no use. We can't go on the platform till the train it stops.
Me, idea. Maybe if I give money to the son of a ranking file.
You know buck cheese?
I hate these people. They do everything only for money.
Hello. Money? Buck cheese?
Come here.
One... Two...
More money. Come here.
More buck cheese. Come.
One... Two... Now.
What are you doing with this knife? Me, General!
Me, go to station master!
You will see.
Hello! Station master!
I'm gonna get some cigarettes, you better go in the department.
Have I time to get a magazine?
Yes.
Elsa! Elsa, darling!
You of all people.
I can't get out of here.
How are you, darling?
I'm so glad to find you.
How on Earth did you get here?
Why did you take that risk?
- I had to.
Could have let me know what you were up to.
I couldn't bear it any longer.
When I found out you were going,
I... had to leave.
I'd come back without killing him and I was anxious about you.
Anyway, thank heaven you're here.
Now we can forget it and go back.
No more killing.
No more Mexicans...
Me, have permission!
Me, have permission! Here.
Everybody has permission!
Our beautiful detective.
How did you know Marvin was an enemy agent?
You didn't know?
You must be crazy.
He fouled her, too.
- Where is he now?
He's gone to get some cigarettes.
I hope he's not in the train to Constantinople.
That's enemy territory.
I see him. He's just getting on.
But it's ridiculous. Impossible.
He's been so kind and friendly.
Yes, much too friendly.
See my instinct?
Me think it's him all the time.
Now we do our last job, then we go to...
He must be foolish!
It's just a joke!
Wait here until I come back!
It's too dangerous for you!
I'm coming with you!
You think you'll be all right?
- Yes.
Come on, let's go before we have company.
Elsa, when the man come with the tickets...
I have the tickets.
You had?
Come away from that door.
I won't let you do it.
It's cold blooded murder.
No use to stop us now.
It's got to be done, that's all.
The enemy will be here in a few minutes.
We must be in the front right now.
I've got to do it. It's my job.
You know that perfectly well.
I'll do anything in the world for you, but I can't let you do this.
Don't you care about what I feel?
Of course I do. You know that.
- Then don't do it.
I've got to.
All right.
- What are you going to do?
I'll tell the first enemy soldier who you are.
That's a pretty good sight.
You see them? Spies. Free today.
You, English?
No, American.
- Good.
I have lived Chicago town for three years.
Where do you live?
Hollywood.
- Is that in America?
Sure.
- Fine.
Baby!
Now you can tell.
Please.
Elsa!
Why are you on this train?
I'm going to Constantinople.
Are you alone?
Yes.
Come along with me.
I better keep this handy.
You see, I don't trust you.
What are you doing on this train?
- I told you.
You're here on business.
"Old man ‘R’'s business."
You're a spy, too. Aren't you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right.
I can place you now.
The lovely neglected wife.
And I fell for it.
I was sorry for you.
But I'm sorrier now.
Do you realise were you are?
You're in my country.
Enemy territory.
Where are your two friends?
On the train somewhere?
How would they get on this train?
Their headache, not mine.
But if they have...
They're dead men.
Why don't you have the train searched?
Exactly what I'm going to do.
When you do, perhaps you'll believe me.
I hope you're not bluffing me.
Why should I?
A clever man like you can guess.
- Guess, what?
Why I've trailed half way across
Europe with you.
Really?
How long has this been going on?
I think from the first day we met.
Before the villain was unmasked?
From the very beginning.
How did you find out about me?
Ashenden told me.
- When?
A long time ago.
And it made no difference?
None.
You're either the biggest double crossing liar I've ever met, or...
Congratulations.
For the punctuality of your Air
Force.
I think they've made a mistake.
Should have taken you off the train before they started this.
I told you I have nothing to do.
You know why I'm here.
"It's our old man ‘R’ is making" sure.
If friends fail, the enemy must help in.
German spy protects British lady from British bomb.
Very funny, isn't it?
Too bad I didn't love you.
I never did.
You know that, don't you?
Neat. Very neat.
Mrs. Ashenden, you use too much lipstick.
Well, Gentlemen...
What's on your mind, General?
My dear friend. You have given us big trouble for long time.
Wouldn't you tell us in
Switzerland?
Sorry, but I had other business to attend to first.
Murdering the church's organist.
Unfortunately.
- Yes.
And now is your turn.
Yes. It looks like it.
I congratulate you all.
Specially, Madame.
Excellent.
Most convenient coincidence.
Heaven is always with the good cause.
I think we could forego the
Thanksgiving service.
When does the shooting begin?
Elsa, please go outside.
No guns.
It's my job. You know.
Besides, you're new at this.
You go with Madame.
Our confront will be short.
Call you back soon.
Wait a minute!
- What are you doing?
No violence, I said.
And I meant it.
I'd sooner see you dead than do.
It might be the end of our forces it the East.
What difference does that make to me?
His life, against the life of thousands.
What do I care about them?
What do I care about him?
We don't get to have this on out conscience!
Thank you.
Water.
I hope...
Well, my friend, this is an unexpected pleasure.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
How do you do?
I wouldn't disturb you, but the friend I spoke to you about... is leaving town tomorrow to supervise some new excavations in Egypt.
He was most anxious to see your collection before going away.
- May I present Mr. Galatalin.
- Why, this is a great pleasure.
I've heard so much about you.
How do you do?
Follow me, gentlemen.
My children would become conceited that so distinguished a critic... has thought them interesting enough to review.
Splendid.
Joan of Arc. Beautiful.
It's a pity to race through such an exhibition.
And here is Voltaire.
One might almost expect him to speak.
I wonder what he'd say after all these years.
You would be astonished.
He is more difficult now, to those in authority, than even the records show.
He is a very stubborn person, I assure you.
- Stubborn?
- Unbelievably.
For days I argued with this fellow... before getting him just as I wanted.
But always, I triumphed.
And few people triumphed over Monsieur Voltaire.
And here, gentlemen....
Here is something that pleases me... although of no historic importance.
It was done because
I love to model children.
Note, gentlemen, the line of the shoulder and--
You have no right to hide such genius in a side-street museum.
You are very gracious.
These things have some merit,
I suspect, but this....
Will you come this way, gentlemen, please?
This, I'm convinced, is fine.
- Marie Antoinette?
- Yes, sir.
Beautiful composition.
Even those delicate veins and the texture of that flesh.
I never saw anything more exquisite.
But, tell me, where did you begin to model in wax?
In my native country, at first, as a hobby.
- He has a great reputation as a sculptor.
- You are very kind, sir.
However, I was commissioned to come to England... and with the completion of my work,
I turned my mind to these... because it seemed to satisfy me more.
I felt I could reproduce the warmth and flesh and blood of life... far more better in wax than in cold stone.
If you will grant me the privilege...
I'd like to submit your work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Royal--
You will have won the undying gratitude of all of us.
Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret that I have not the time to give to your exhibition now... but I'll worry you more when I get back.
It will always afford me the greatest pleasure to welcome you.
I must apologize again for coming and disturbing you at this late hour.
It was a great pleasure, I assure you.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- And I'm very grateful to you.
- Not at all.
Thank you for your visit and your encouragement.
- Good night, lvan.
- Good night.
My masterpiece, my Marie Antoinette.
You heard what this man, who is very celebrated, said of you?
Yes, of course. You would say that.
You always told me so, of course.
Hello, there!
Hello.
What are you doing here so late?
I came for some books. I'm trying to straighten out the accounts.
I don't hope to impress you but we haven't a farthing.
That is unfortunate.
You're right, it's unfortunate.
*15,000 it's cost me, and you say it's unfortunate... as though I spilled soup on my vest.
Your money may be very well invested, one never knows.
Something important may come of all this.
Something has got to come of all this.
- The rent on this place isn't paid.
- ls that a fact?
No, I'm lying to amuse myself.
Now, look here. I have an idea that will get us out of all this.
You and I have absolutely no money, but we have got this.
- Fire insurance.
- Yes, insurance. That's our way out.
You know that a fire in this place will give us *10,000?
A fire?
Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I want the money back that I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You're asking to burn these people?
- You are asking to destroy all--
- I'm not asking you.
- I'm telling you.
- You think I'll permit this?
You've got to permit it.
Whose fault is it if people don't come here?
Yours. All this artistic nonsense.
The museum at Walston Lane does well enough.
And why? Because they have
Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare... the Mad Butcher... the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, things that people pay to see!
And they are welcome to them.
To perpetuate such scoundrels is to celebrate their crimes.
What do think I'm in this for?
A match. A cigar stub, even... and you and I have *10,000 to divide between us.
You are insane.
No, I'm not insane. Not at all.
Let me show you how easily it can be done.
Wait, you!
Anything new, Doc?
Nothing we didn't tell you this afternoon.
The coroner confirmed our opinion.
It was suicide.
Gee, that'll make a swell story. Come on.
Hello, is that you, Tim?
I'm sorry, but I've got to have that tonight.
I've got to have it.
No, I tell you, I need it right away.
Who's on the gate down there?
Joe? Then you can get it out, all right.
I'll send a truck right down there.
The harness bull's okay.
I straightened it out this afternoon.
New Year's Eve ain't what it used to be.
This is only the second one tonight.
Times sure are tough.
What happened to this one?
Husband slapped her full of lumps.
Said she talked too much.
What's that?
Embalming fluid. It makes them jump.
Ain't that just like a woman?
Always has to have the last word.
As I live and breath and wear spats, the prince.
You've been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get that news item?
From a little bird?
Have a pleasant vacation?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
That's fine.
Consider yourself crippled financially.
See if you can jar your friends loose for enough to eat.
Meaning what?
You're a sure bet to place in the bread line.
There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental.
You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Is mama's dumpling getting tough?
I'm through clowning, Florence.
You're all washed up. Get out!
What do you mean? It's New Year's!
We still get out a newspaper.
Ever thought of that?
- ls it my fault if nothing happens?
- What do you mean, nothing happens?
Look down there!
Out of that insane mob, you say nothing happens?
There's a story in every person down there.
Do I circulate among them and say
"Would you tell me the story of your life?"
Getting newspaper stories is none of our business.
You're through. Get out.
Go on, get out.
You're fired unless you bring a story for the next edition!
Even if it's only a new recipe for spaghetti!
I thought I told you to keep out of here.
I won't bother you, but I'm all in.
My nerves are all shot.
Your nerves aren't the only things that'll be shot.
You've been smoking again.
Give him a bag.
Thanks.
Come on.
And understand this... you get nothing until you show me something.
The next time you talk out of turn you'll have bad luck.
- Understand?
- Thanks.
Happy New Year!
Hey, Miss Dempsey.
Wonder how they'll settle the heavyweight argument while you're around.
Hello, sweetheart. How's your sex life?
So you're in again.
Hey, Jim, call out the riot squad.
- How's every little old thing?
- Fine.
You're the first reporter here in two hours.
- You people been seeing the old year out?
- I'm people which the old year saw out.
- I'm fired.
- No kidding.
I gotta make news if I have to bite a dog.
Hey, Kelly.
Oh, my gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you.
You know the Joan Gale girl?
She committed suicide yesterday.
I read about it last year.
Yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide.
- She may have been murdered.
- No kidding? Any suspects?
- You know George Winton?
- Old Howard Winton's cub?
- That's him.
- They don't suspect him?
Don't they?
He's down at the Tombs right now.
- lf you're stringing me, old timer....
- Why should l?
- They were sweeties till last month.
- What does that prove?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him.
You know, such things have happened.
Anyway, he was in her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
- Saved, one job.
- The press room for yours.
- Wait till I give you the rest of the dirt.
- Make it snappy.
They've ordered an autopsy over at Bellevue immediately. Go there.
- Don't give this to anyone else.
- It's yours.
Thanks!
Fresh kid!
- Feeling tough?
- Rotten.
]That's too bad, sister.
I have a case of jitters that will cop the Pulitzer Prize.
If they don't hurry up, they'll have another corpse on their hands.
Bring in number seven. The Gale girl.
She's a very interesting case.
When I was called, the girl had been dead for possibly three or four hours.
My examination clearly showed that she died of laudanum poisoning.
I thought at first it might have been an accident. An overdose.
Her eyes indicated that she used narcotics frequently.
- What was the police theory?
- Suicide.
- Leave any message?
- No.
That's why I thought it was an accident.
- Are you in charge of the case?
- Yes, sir.
Who got the information about Winton?
Everyone knew they were living together.
But he was playing around with some other twist.
Winton was in bad though because he left before she folded up.
If she committed suicide with laudanum she probably took it in its true form... and we'll find it in that or very close to that state.
If someone gave it to her, it would be diluted.
- But how could he give it to her?
- ln a cup of coffee or a glass of whiskey.
- That's possible.
- The Gale body is gone.
- What are you talking about?
- Absurd!
What do you mean? The body is gone?
Just that. It's vanished.
Gone. Disappeared.
You mean to say someone stole the body?
We found the slab empty and the window to the alley was open.
Come on.
Boy, and he asked for a story.
Is his face red!
Bryant, 2626.
- Hello.
- Hello, slug.
Kill that Winton story for this.
Joan Gale's body was....
Not John Brown's.
Joan Gale's body was snatched from the morgue two minutes ago.
I'm here now.
Yeah, there were nine or ten witnesses.
No, they didn't talk. They're pretty stiff.
No, dope, not drunk. Dead.
Get out of the Tombs and get to Winton.
I'll have Harry write the first flash.
A cow does that, and gives milk besides.
Send Harry in.
- How do you do? I'm from the Express.
- Yeah?
I don't want to talk to you.
I know you people. You'll try to crucify me for something I didn't do.
Anything you print about me, you've got to prove.
You know you're innocent till you're proven guilty.
That's fine.
But while I'm proving my innocence... you people will uncover every petty kid trick I ever did.
You'll write editorials about every cocktail I drank.
Anything that any normal person might have done... will have a sinister meaning if I did it.
It'll be a lot easier if you come clean.
Let's get down to cases.
- When did you see this girl last?
- ln the afternoon before--
- Why didn't you tell that to the police?
- They didn't give me a chance.
We had a couple of drinks.
She was all right. She seemed happy.
Do you remember what she said?
What did you talk about?
She laughed and she said we were being very silly... that we didn't care for each other anymore but we needn't hate each other.
- Said she wanted us to be friends.
- Was that all?
No. We planned a trip.
I was sending her to Bermuda.
- You weren't going with her?
- No.
- Why didn't I take her away somewhere?
- Let's get back to the case in hand.
They ordered an autopsy and found her body had been stolen.
No.
What are you trying to do to me?
- You're working with the police--
- I'm trying to help you... if you're on the square and I think you are.
- Why are you telling me a crazy lie, then?
- That happens to be the truth.
- But who'd steal her body?
- That's what they'll ask you.
- Come on, time's up.
- Be right with you.
Keep a stiff upper lip, kid.
I think you'll come out okay.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
The whole thing sounded on the up and up to me.
Poor guy's too scared to lie.
I think he's getting a raw deal.
Ain't that a shame.
Nice little chap, wouldn't harm a fly.
Everyone picking on the poor little fellow.
If he was unknown, they wouldn't have pinched him.
He's George Winton and they're playing it up.
It's a Roman holiday for every editor in New York.
Why the goose pimples?
If he was someone like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved,
I would hang him.
All that gaga about that body disappearing....
Eight bodies have been stolen in New York in the last 18 months.
Isn't it more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story?
Don't be silly.
I think this kid's entitled to a break.
- He's getting it. He's front page.
- You give me a pain.
I'm glad to hear it.
Since when did you start crusading for justice?
This mug with all the money has had two or three nasty affairs.
He's kept out of print, because his grandfather was smart.
He couldn't have stolen the body from jail.
Don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself, do you?
I hope they give him the works.
Even if he didn't kill her, he's responsible for her death... and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
- I won't work on it from that angle.
- You won't?
You were pretty tough about
Judge Ramsey, a while ago.
They didn't prove anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was killed by someone afraid of him.
- He took a run-out powder.
- That's got nothing to do with this case.
- Can I handle this my way?
- You cannot.
I'm still editor of this newspaper.
You said I was fired. Well, I quit!
- Give the assignment to somebody else.
- Wait a minute.
No, I'm through!
Come here, sob sister.
All right. Go ahead.
Do it your own way.
On the square, if you'd seen that kid down there...
I'm not holding for him, maybe he is a dirty pup, but he's scared... and so kind of dumb and worthless.
If he is, we'll give him away as a bridge prize.
Come on, beat it.
It's 5:. 00. You need some sleep.
- There's another point.
- Sleep on it. We'll get it tomorrow.
Here's your portrait.
- Which one is me? The horse?
- Get out of here.
If my curiosity is not too great... would you mind telling me what animal you are designing?
One of the Athenian girls for the bacchanal.
It would be interesting to know where and when you studied anatomy.
It doesn't seem so bad to me.
What is wrong with it?
Anatomy.
Heaven forgive you.
You must have studied with a sideshow of .
I'm sorry, sir. I'll change it.
The reason I wanted to work with you was to learn about that.
And this fellow.
Look what this cobbler is doing.
What is this?
Are you so beautiful that you make everything in your own likeness?
It's a mercy of Providence that this fellow cannot hear.
Anatomy.
A great sculptor.
And I am barred.
Look.
Look at these claws.
If I had those hands of yours...
I would show you the meaning of what you are trying to do.
All those beautiful things that were destroyed...
I could restore.
It is a cruel irony that you people without souls... should have hands.
But go on, go back to work.
It is useless and hopeless to talk to such people.
Who is it?
Got it? Is it completed?
Yes, sir, it's ready, but it's pretty heavy and I'll need help.
Come in here. Help Professor Darcy.
And hurry.
The figure has yet to be mounted and dressed.
And now, my friend, you are to see something... that one truly can describe as art.
Professor Darcy doesn't try to keep freedom and sketchiness in his work.
He is an artist.
His figures are realistic, lifelike.
He works at home, hours when such people as you are loafing.
- Shall we open it?
- Yes.
Exquisite. Almost as beautiful as the original.
Someday I hope to have you restore
Marie Antoinette.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.
Take her in. Dress her for the opening.
I think I'll have something to tell you soon.
You have done well, and I too have something for you.
Thanks.
Hello?
Hello! I was just thinking about you.
Yeah, I was, too.
No, I haven't forgotten.
I won't have much time, we'll have to eat someplace close.
Let's go to that little Bohemian place.
- All right, I'll meet you in the lobby.
- At 12:00.
Bye.
Who was it? Penny ante?
- Why?
- I just wondered.
Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't want to offend you but it's none of your business.
- I don't interfere in any of your affairs.
- I don't have any affairs.
- What do you mean?
- I don't think you could have a real affair.
I don't think you could care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times, my heart's calloused.
But I never had one with dough.
This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't agree with you.
All right, you raise the kids,
I'll raise the roof.
I'd rather die shaking cocktails and bankers... than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Would you?
He can look like a gorilla and have no manners... but he must have dough, plenty of dough.
You think money is the only requisite.
It just happens that the poor people are happier.
Then marry Ralph.
You'll be the happiest couple in the world.
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about him.
He's the sweetest kid I know.
What are you laughing at?
I just imagined you telling a landlady some day... you didn't have the rent, but Ralph was awfully sweet.
I haven't noticed any multi-millionaires running after you.
I met one last night.
All the money this side of Peoria.
- Did you? Where?
- ln the can.
The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy, of the Park Avenue Wintons.
- Discharge?
- Yeah.
How are you, Mr. Winton?
When I say I'm happier to see you than I ever was to see anyone... it comes from the heart.
- How are you, Mr. Gates?
- Splendid, my boy.
- What have you been up to?
- Not a thing.
- I hope your father accepts that.
- ls Dad here?
No. We talked to him long distance today.
- Was he pretty sore?
- He wasn't exactly overjoyed.
What did he say?
He said to get you out of trouble, then hire someone to punch your head off.
- Have you had lunch?
- No.
Come on, we'll get something to eat.
- Hello, Florence, how are you?
- Fine. Thanks.
I'm awfully sorry,
I've got to disappoint you.
Don't worry. She'll get used to it.
Disappoint me? Why?
I won't be able to go to lunch with you.
What's happened?
The old man is awfully anxious to open on schedule.
All of the advertising announced it for tonight.
What are you doing here?
There are no visitors allowed.
- You'll have to leave.
- I'm from the Express.
I don't care where you're from.
I said, "No visitors allowed."
You might get some good publicity, if you'll--
We're opening tonight.
You shall have the pleasure then.
You don't understand, if you....
Ralph.
Are you going to stay out there all day?
The old man's pretty peppery.
I'll see you tonight.
All right.
I'm awfully sorry.
I was just explaining about....
- What's the matter, sir?
- Nothing at all, my boy.
I should like to meet your friend.
Why, certainly, sir.
Charlotte, Mr. Igor wants to meet you.
Why, certainly.
Mr. Igor, may I present my fiancée,
Miss Duncan.
- Charlotte, Mr. Igor.
- I'm delighted to meet you.
- Professor Darcy.
- How do you do?
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear...
I am very happy to know you.
You'd be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born.
Before this terrible thing happened to me...
I made a very beautiful statue.
And, my child... you are that figure come to life.
How?
I wonder, sometime, would you pose for one of my sculptors... who does really excellent work?
Why, yes, I'd love to.
Thank you.
...see you tonight at the opening.
- Of course, I plan to come.
- You'd be welcome at any time.
I crave nourishment.
Come on, moonstruck. Let's get going.
So long, see you in jail.
- Good-bye, Mr. Igor.
- Good-bye. I'll see you tonight.
I assume I shall have the privilege of having her pose for me.
- That was my plan.
- Thank you.
I'm going to leave you.
I've got to get to the office.
- But what about lunch?
- I'll have it for supper.
Hello, light of my life!
Well, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Why so mysterious? Spill it.
So you can tell me I'm wrong?
Don't be silly.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
I am right! I know I'm right.
No one would suspect it.
You don't sound right.
If you wisecrack while I'm talking,
I'll crown you.
Go ahead, wise guy. Spill it.
There's a wax museum opening on 14th Street.
Don't that call for an extra.
I asked you to keep it shut.
You can't blame a guy for getting breathless with that scoop.
You poor baboon, you can guess the rest.
Wait a minute.
No kidding. What's your idea?
I got a look at that dump a while ago... and if they don't have a wax figure of Joan Gale, then I'm crazy.
- We'll grant that.
- What?
What of it? Where do we go from there?
Does this mean anything to you?
Joan Gale's body was swiped from the morgue.
Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you.
I know that.
My idea is this: Somebody swipes the body, takes the impression... makes a mold, produces a wax figure, peddles it to the old skate there.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
- You go to....
- What's that?
Let it go.
Come down to earth.
Would they dare to do that?
Wouldn't they know it would be recognized?
Shake your head, you'll be all right.
All right, mastermind.
Something's cockeyed about that joint,
I'll find out what.
By the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
- What?
- That innocent Judge Ramsey... that you were sure got bumped off, has been located in South America.
- No kidding?
- Almost certain.
I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
- That settles everything.
- Yup, everything settled.
Good.
- I'm glad they didn't hold you.
- There's no case against me.
A clumsy thing, but nothing to worry about.
- lf I can do anything for you....
- I know I can always depend on you.
- What do you think is the best time?
- I'll let you know.
- So long.
- See you later.
- I hope, soon.
- Good-bye.
Hello?
Don't swoon. This is the voice of the New York Express broadcasting.
I'm awful glad you phoned.
Thank you for trying to cheer me up last night.
If you're grateful, you can prove it.
And do yourself a good turn too.
About 8:30 p. m., you be in your car at....
Good evening.
The history of these figures becomes more interesting, perhaps... when I tell you that the originals were destroyed... twelve years ago, in London, in a fire... and were reproduced only after years of arduous toil.
To reproduce the figures destroyed,
I had to train men for years... to do the work that I could no longer do.
The results, you see here tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen, here is one of the classic examples of chivalry.
Sir Walter Raleigh, spreading his cloak in the mud... so that Queen Elizabeth might walk dry-shod.
This group represents
His Royal Highness, Le Duc D'Angouleme...
Ieader of the French nobility... praying before the remains of the victims of the Battle of Quiberon.
And next, we see the ill-starred Maximilian... established as Emperor of Mexico by Napoleon lll.
Upon the conclusion of the American Civil War...
Napoleon withdrew his military support...
Ieaving Maximilian to the mercy of his rebellious subjects.
The figure lying in the bath is Marat... one of the most bloodthirsty leaders of the French Revolution.
He perished at the hands of his mistress Charlotte Corday... who was inspired to the deed by her fanatical devotion to her country.
This my friends, is Napoleon,
Emperor of the French... whose overwhelming ambition swept him to world power.
Here we see him after his banishment to St. Helena by the English.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, on the right here... we have a figure of Peter the Great.
- Hello, Ralph.
- Hello.
- Are we late?
- No.
- Pretty dress, have I seen it before?
- Yes, I think so.
- Thank goodness that's settled.
- Pay no attention to her.
I'm so excited to see all these things.
- Mr. Igor.
- Yes?
You're sure of that? You're quite sure?
- I'd know him anywhere.
- Keep track of him.
This is the most important thing of my life.
That'd be easy.
I wish....
- My little Marie Antoinette.
- Good evening, Mr. Igor.
- It's kind of you to be present.
- All these things are beautiful.
They are.
- Too bad the audience was so poor.
- I wouldn't be too disappointed, Mr. Igor.
The people are tired from the festivities.
My boy, I think you're right.
Everybody is tired out tonight.
And now that I've seen my doors open in a new country...
I begin to realize I'm a little tired myself.
- Call that fellow in, I'll close up for tonight.
- Yes, sir.
I might have felt a little discouraged.
But now, everything seems just as it should be.
You know, to find even one person who appreciates my beautiful children here...
- changes everything for me.
- I'm glad.
You're very beautiful.
Thank you.
You must come sometime in the morning when there is no crowd about... and I can give you more of my time.
Good evening, Mr. Igor.
I've just been admiring your works.
Properly lighted, they're even more impressive.
Yes. At first I despaired of ever achieving the same results I did abroad... and then lighting came to my rescue.
I was particularly interested in that group.
Yes, that one is very fine. Its grim tragedy seems to fascinate everyone.
- Yes, and that other one, that Joan of Arc.
- That was the most recently completed.
- lt arrived this morning.
- You did that yourself?
No. Never since these hands were burned have I created anything.
- I only direct the work of others.
- Who did it?
Professor Darcy.
- He has been my hands for years.
- You are very generous, Mr. Igor.
But I don't deserve any credit.
I only carried out your instructions.
Good night.
It's getting late. I better be going.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Shall we go?
- All right.
Thank you for coming.
Good night, my dear.
- Good night.
- Ready, Florence?
You two go without me. I've got a date.
No fouling in the clinches!
Winton!
Follow that man down the street!
And no questions.
We're on the trail of hot news.
- What's this all about?
- I might as well tell you.
That man is connected with the robbery at the morgue.
I don't want anything to do with this matter.
- Even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
- Not even then.
The police should handle this. If you've suspicions we'll go to the police.
And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story?
- Drive me around the corner and wait.
- I don't want to mix in this.
Then you can go to a warm place, and I don't mean California.
- All right. What do you want me to do?
- I told you what to do.
Drive out of sight of the house.
I want to get a closer look at the place.
That's nonsense.
- I figure you're yellow.
- No, I'm not.
- I feel that someone's been watching me.
- Nobody's watching you.
You're yellow and your nerves are shot.
I'll do nothing to help you until it's delivered.
- Get that through your head.
- All right.
- I'll phone.
- Not on this phone, you fool.
Go outside and call.
All right.
Well, buddy, what's the stall?
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Yeah, for who?
- I don't think it concerns you.
- Cut out the bluffing.
We've been following you, and you've done very suspicious things.
- Now, what are you doing here?
- What have I done?
You had a visitor at your apartment this afternoon.
Not the kind of a person
I'd expect you to entertain.
Winton!
- Hello, Express.
- I found the body!
- What are you talking about?
- The body of Joan Gale!
Trying to outsmart the police?
The body of Joan Gale is packed in the box in the basement!
- Are you giving me this straight?
- Take a look for yourself.
Let's take a look.
You, stop!
You cover the house, I'll get the other bird.
Come on.
Open this door.
Take it easy.
- It's down there in the basement.
- Wait a minute.
You boys go upstairs.
- It's not here, it's in the basement.
- Keep quiet.
Let's have a little light.
- See what's in there.
- Yes, sir.
Can you give me a description of this person you saw?
Not a very good one, I guess.
It wasn't like anything human.
It hobbled and swayed like a monkey.
And the face, from the glimpse I got of it was like an African war mask.
- You mean he was colored?
- I don't know.
But he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
- Nothing in there.
- ls there a rear entrance?
- I couldn't find any.
- Let's take a look.
Look, that's the basement.
- You find anything upstairs?
- Just a lot of paper and junk.
See if you can find a back entrance.
Let's take a look at the basement.
Just a minute, you.
- This is the place.
- Shut up!
Come out of there.
There's no one in here.
There he is now.
Turn on that light.
There it is. You'll find the body of Joan Gale in this box.
- Get that hatchet and open this.
- Yes, sir.
- I don't want to see it.
- Stay where you are.
What I wouldn't give for a slug of gin.
So that's your corpse?
Of all the things!
There's your corpse.
I've done nothing.
You've no right to arrest me!
- What's the charge against me?
- Shut up.
Here it is.
Come here.
Come on, spill it.
Who is it that owns this layout?
- I don't know.
- You don't know anything about it?
No, sir. I just know there was man named Worth.
- Worth?
- Yes, that was his name.
That's my bootlegger's name!
A heavyset fellow, with a broken nose?
Yes, that was the man.
I hope he delivered the stuff
I paid him for this afternoon.
I told you it was a bootlegger you saw at my place.
- Take this fellow in.
- I've done nothing.
- I even refused to deliver stuff for him.
- Come on, let's go.
Are you trying to give us the runaround here?
I want two of you boys to work the outside.
Don't let anybody in or out.
Florence, I don't want to leave her--
What're you doing? Put it back!
No, this is my percentage.
You guys are going to get yours.
I found this dump.
- Yeah.
- Whatever.
- Junkie?
- Yes, peddling.
Hold up your hands.
A classy turnip. Must have dipped it.
They tell me your managing editor is poison.
It takes a sturdy person to look at him.
The season's best catch is waiting.
I guess I'll breeze.
Wait a minute.
You want to talk to that junkie, Captain?
No, it's all right.
Lock him up. He'll talk soon.
- What do you think this is?
- What?
- Looks like a watch.
- Yes, but do you know whose watch?
- We don't know anything about it.
- Judge Ramsey's. That's all.
- Where did you get it?
- Took it off the junkie.
Well, I'll be....
- Bring him in. Here's your chance.
- Oh, boy!
Come in.
That yours?
Wait. Get me to the office and step on it.
- You like taking chances, don't you?
- Why?
- You go in for dangerous things.
- Darned if I don't!
Slow down!
I said the office, not the cemetery!
I never knew there were women like you in the world. You're game and decent.
And so determined to live that I'll take a taxi if you don't watch where you go.
I've only known you 24 hours, but I'm in love with you.
Doesn't usually take that long.
I forgive you.
You were in a tough spot when we met.
- No, I'm crazy about you.
- That's what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think
I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
- How much money have you got?
- Heaven knows. A lot.
That being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors.
Listen, aviator. Here we are.
Hold everything, I'll be right back.
- Mitt me, kid. I've got a classic.
- You here again...
Iike an evil spirit to mar my happiness.
I've got a story, but I won't tell you what it is.
- Every time I tell you, it goes haywire.
- What do you mean?
You start out after murderers and bring back three-for-a-dime bootleggers.
You start out to solve murders and break up crap games.
You're stupendous. I'm for you.
You're wonderful.
You're always razzing everything I do, but this time I'm in.
Go on, girl. Tell your troubles to a cop.
I don't feel like talking.
Is there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm gonna make you eat dirt, you soap bubble.
I'm gonna make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
You may be the world to your mother but you're a....
Let's get them some coffee, they've been in there with that junkie all night.
Go on, talk.
You found that watch in a taxicab three months ago. Is that right?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was laying there on the floor.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not very far.
- You remember what day that was?
- No, sir. About three months ago.
- Remember what kind of a cab it was?
- No, sir, just a cab.
- Didn't happen to be going to Worth's?
- No, sir. I'm sure it wasn't there.
You used to go to Worth's place a lot.
What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Well, maybe, it was. I don't remember.
You've got to do something for me.
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't! Please.
He's beginning to break.
He'll talk pretty soon.
I think we got him, Chief.
He's been begging all night.
I never saw a junkie hold out so long.
Ralph?
I beg your pardon. Is Ralph here?
I was looking for Ralph.
No!
Mr. Igor, I'm so glad you're here.
I don't know why but I was a little bit afraid.
Afraid? Poor Hugo is quite harmless.
My little friend, you've honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
No, I wanted to speak to Ralph.
We had a silly little argument last night, and I said something unkind--
Oh, you children. You happy children.
You've quarreled, and now you'll be friends again.
That's exactly as it should be.
Never let any stupid misunderstanding come between you.
- lt was really all my fault.
- Let him think it was his fault.
You must be stern with him before you forgive him, especially if it was your fault.
Now I understand why he was so gloomy this morning.
- Then he's here?
- Yes, down in the workroom.
- I'll call him for you.
- No, please, don't bother.
- I think it'd be better if I surprise him.
- As you wish, my child.
- Just go straight ahead.
- All right, thanks.
Ralph?
Ralph, are you there?
What's the matter, my child?
Are you frightened?
I thought you said Ralph was here.
I came to tell you that I was mistaken.
I've sent Otto to find him.
I hope this little glimpse behind the scenes will interest you.
This is the birthplace of all my creations.
Let me show you.
I don't want to put you to the trouble, Mr. Igor.
No trouble at all, my child.
This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me.
To see others enjoy the beauty
I used to create.
- My footing is none too secure.
- Please, let me help you.
Help me, my dear... you'll help me to give back to the world... my masterpiece.
Marie Antoinette.
No!
Hey, you. Wait a minute.
- You can't park here. Get it out of here.
- Okay, brother.
- I have to park the car. I'll be right back.
- Make it snappy, I might need you.
- Hey, Ralph!
- Hello, Florence.
- Gee, am I glad to see you.
- First time you've said that.
- Have you got a key?
- I just came down to open up.
- What are you doing here?
- After news, as usual.
What are the chances for me to slip in and look around?
You better wait until the old man gets here.
I'll tell you a secret. I like the old gent.
I'm doing a special Sunday magazine--
- I don't think I can--
- lt might help him a whole lot.
The old man was depressed at the opening last night. This might cheer him up.
Hurry up.
Thanks.
All right. I'll talk. I'll tell you what I know!
Ramsey was murdered because he looked like Voltaire.
Do you hear?
Because he looked like Voltaire.
You want to know what became of him!
He's a statue. A silly wax statue.
You killed him!
Come on with the rest of it.
No, I did not.
It was lgor at the Wax Museum.
You were in on it. You worked for him.
The only thing I did was keep track of a man named Worth.
- He runs the place where you arrested me.
- You lie!
No. It was lgor at the Wax Museum.
You'll find your judge embalmed in wax!
He's a statue of Voltaire, with the other corpses!
I tell you, the whole place is a morgue.
Do you hear? A morgue.
My child, why are you so pitifully afraid?
Immortality has been the dream, the inspiration of mankind for ages.
I am going to give you immortality.
Please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
I have no desire to hurt you.
You will always be beautiful.
Think, my child, in a thousand years, you will be as lovely as you are now.
- Come.
- No!
Let me go!
Your face... was of wax.
- You fiend.
- My Marie Antoinette.
- You must not say that to me.
- You fiend!
There was a fiend, of that you can be sure.
There was a fiend.
And this is what he did to me.
You did this.
For 12 years, 12 awful years... this terrible living dead man... with these burned hands and face has searched for the fiend.
Now the account is closed.
He is here!
Charlotte!
Don't be afraid, my dear.
In a few minutes, the container will have filled with wax.
And when it overflows, your beauty will be preserved forever.
Here, go down there quickly.
- I'm getting out of here.
- We'll go down there and help them.
- What can I do?
- I don't know, we must do something!
Come on, boys. This is it.
They're down there. Quick!
Through the center.
Try it again.
Stop where you are!
Take them away!
- You've got the other papers bleeding.
- Now I'm going to scramble this egg.
- Now, Poison lvy, was that a story?
- You had a million dollars worth of luck.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would meet with your approval?
You could. Cut out this crazy business and act like a lady. Marry me.
- Marry you?
- That's what I said.
I'm gonna get even with you, you dirty stiff.
I'll do it.
Right.
Look. Is any woman worth that?
Surely, you regret having betrayed your country.
- You can still have a chance...
- You're wasting time.
Come on, out with it.
Who is she? What is her name?
Tell us, you fool!
Mata Hari.
That's her name, isn't it?
- Let me alone.
- Oh, shoot him.
She bewitches them.
Why not? She bewitched all Paris.
She's France's greatest enemy.
The woman has become a mania with you, Dubois.
After all, you're the only one in Paris that believes she's a spy.
It's very dangerous to accuse a woman who's so powerfully protected...
...without proof.
- I'll get that proof.
And one cold morning, you'll see your fine
Mata Hari tied to one of those posts.
- Dine with me tonight?
- Thanks, no.
- Tonight I'm to see your Mata Hari dance.
- What?
A special soiree at LeMarchand's.
- How dare you.
- It's to be smart and very private.
After all, there is a war going on.
Oh, well, some dance and some die.
And some will do both.
- Is that it?
- I think it is, General Shubin.
- May I?
- Surely.
It is. Amazing.
Something of an event to see a ship arrive from Russia.
Event? Why, it's the first time in history, a flight over the German lines.
Congratulations. A great achievement.
Thank you, sir, but it's just sheer luck.
- And a good engine.
- The dispatches?
Quite safe, sir. I'm to deliver them to the ambassador personally.
Yes, of course. Of course. Major.
May I present Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff of the Russian imperial air force.
Proud to meet such a brave young man.
Thank you, sir. But I was frightened to death all the way.
You'll hold yourself in readiness for a return flight to Russia...
...as soon as our reply is ready.
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- How long will it take to decode this?
- Ten to 12 hours, Your Excellency.
Rush it, please.
General Shubin, please report back here tonight at 11:3o.
This will call for immediate counsel.
Congratulations, lieutenant.
We shan't forget.
General Shubin will give you your instructions.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Well, you feel like celebrating?
Sleep is the only thing I'm interested in.
Can I put you up for the night?
No, thank you.
I still have my little place at Passy.
That is, if I can stay awake long enough to get there.
I'd ask you to dine with me, but I have to go to a reception right afterwards.
Mata Hari's dancing.
Mata Hari?
I'd be delighted to have dinner with you, sir.
- I'm not as tired as I was.
- No?
The prospect of a good dinner, perhaps.
Yes, I suppose that's it.
After all, it's rather absurd to go straight to bed your first night back in Paris.
I think I do feel rather like celebrating.
If you can stay awake.
- Funny, I'm not even sleepy anymore.
- No?
That's all right, Rosanoff.
There'll be such a crowd there, one more won't matter.
What do you mean?
Why, didn't you say you wanted to see Mata Hari dance?
Shiva...
...I dance for you tonight as the bayaderes danced in the sacred temples of Java.
Bravo!
Bravo!
They say her mother was a sacred dancer, her father a temple priest.
You know she married a Dutchman.
My dear, he used to beat her.
Really? I can't believe it.
She makes matrimony seem so dull.
I'd like to know her.
I feel that I do know her.
Madame Mata Hari, may a perfect stranger offer her appreciation?
- Thank you.
- Your costume was exquisite.
And those earrings, are they Javanese?
No, they are from India.
They're so intriguing. May I?
Andriani wants to see you at the Pavilion at once. It's very important.
- Glad you like them.
- Thank you.
Do you think...? Could you introduce me?
My dear boy, one doesn't meet Mata Hari on the spur of the moment like that.
Besides, I'm late now.
- Do you mind if I stay for a while?
- No, no. Not at all.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
- I thought you were different from the rest.
- Champagne, please.
Take this for me. I know what you like.
I know all about men like you...
Permit me, mademoiselle.
- Oh, wasn't she marvelous?
- Wasn't that a wonderful dance, monsieur?
It wasn't a dance, it was a poem.
- Do you know her?
- Who doesn't?
I would give my right arm to meet her.
So would I.
- To Mata Hari the incomparable.
- Unsurpassed.
- Priestess of the dance.
- High priestess.
- Goddess. Goddess of beauty.
- Bravo.
The dancer is only as beautiful as the mood of her dance.
- To Mata Hari.
- To Mata Hari.
Now, gentleman, I'm terribly tired.
You'll have to excuse me.
You've been very, very charming.
I thank you.
Good night, my lady.
Good night. Good night.
- Marvelous.
- Why, of course.
Have you ever seen people's faces when you dance?
Have you any idea of the effect you have on them?
My mind is so far away when I dance.
I live in another age.
Centuries back...
...when man and woman...
Brandy is bad for your heart.
I thought you'd given it up.
I give up a lot of things, but I take them back.
To me, anything I like is irresistible.
I've always been that way.
Unfortunately, it's in my blood.
What people you Russians are.
What charming savages.
Come in.
- The Marquis de Signac.
- Wait. We're going to the Pavilion.
- Pavilion?
- Yes.
I like gambling.
They laugh, it's gay there.
Gay? With Signac?
- Is that necessary?
- Why not?
He's very attractive, young.
Of course, he's not a general of the Russian imperial army...
...so important as you.
- A diplomat...
- or a traitor.
I said it, traitor.
- Now, quiet, Serge.
- The time has come when I can't be quiet.
There's something growing here that's going to make me shout out...
...the whole truth one day.
You want to die so badly?
I'm dead now.
Just as surely as though there were a bullet in my heart.
You killed me.
No. The brandy.
No, no, no. You.
Then why don't you give me up?
- I will.
- Well, do.
Come in.
- So you're going to the Pavilion?
- Yes.
- Much gambling.
- Caron, are you coming with us?
Sorry, my dear, but I have to be in court at 9.
- Most important case.
- Too bad, too bad.
- Shubin?
- Madame, I must be leaving.
I'm due at the embassy now.
Good night.
Good night, general.
- Tonight, late supper?
- No.
Tonight.
I thought it was all over.
Well, tomorrow, then.
I must help you to give me up.
Please, tomorrow.
Good night, General Shubin.
Good night.
Madame Mata Hari's car!
To the Pavilion.
To the Pavilion.
Eight.
Ten.
Four thousand francs.
Here you are, sir.
I have charted all gun emplacements and air batteries.
- Good. You were attached to me as a cook?
- Yes, sir.
- Technical expert, eh?
- Yes, sir.
- With the rank of captain.
- That's right, sir.
- You're a good soldier?
- I hope so.
- And a good German?
- Yes, sir.
Some months ago, I furnished you with plans and specifications...
...of a new weapon called the tank.
- Oh, yes, yes.
- You laughed at it, said it was impractical.
That's my belief, sir.
Well, captain, those impractical tanks went into action in the Somme yesterday...
...costing your country 2o kilometers of front and 18,ooo casualties.
- Impossible.
- So you said before.
Here are a few more of your mistaken conclusions.
Correct them.
- Send Mademoiselle carlotta here.
- Yes, sir.
Well, I was able to deliver your message, Andriani.
Mata Hari is here.
Thank you, carlotta.
That's what I wanted to know.
- Any more orders?
- No. No, just run along and enjoy yourself.
All right. Good night.
Dear lady.
Oh, good evening.
Won't you have my seat?
It's lucky.
It will be so much nicer to watch you.
- Thank you.
- A thousand francs for the bank.
- Two thousand.
- Ten thousand.
- Ten thousand.
- Ten thousand.
Madame.
Are you playing?
Never against you.
Any more bets?
Leon. Monsieur Leon.
- Oui, madame.
- I want some chips for this.
I'm sorry, madame.
We do not accept jewelry.
Perhaps one of the players.
You take it, madame.
He paid 1 o, ooo francs for it.
Who paid 1 o, ooo francs?
Whoever he was, he paid 1 o, ooo for it.
I'll sell it for 5.
He had very good taste.
- It's an unusual ring.
- May I buy it for you?
It's bought.
- Going?
- Wait. I may be back.
Thank you.
Still 4ooo in the bank.
Well, you're looking magnificent tonight, my dear.
Last time I seemed only beautiful to you.
You must have something very difficult for me tonight.
No, it shouldn't be for you. Important dispatches have arrived from Russia.
All right. I'm having supper with Shubin tomorrow night.
Splendid. Splendid. Why not tonight?
He's at the embassy.
- A conference.
- Probably concerns these dispatches.
- Probably.
- Then tomorrow night won't do.
You must see Shubin the minute he returns.
- I have arranged differently.
- Then change your arrangements.
I think you should handle Shubin yourself.
You get along beautifully.
- You're so alike.
- This is no time for any of your moods.
Something vital may be involved in this.
Something vital is involved in it.
- Good night, Andriani.
- Then I insist you see Shubin tonight.
A car will be waiting for you when you leave here.
You also insisted on that submarine job.
You finally had to do it yourself, as far as I remember.
How well you did it.
I intend to do a better job in finding out who informed the French authorities about it.
Of course, there's carlotta, she knew.
- And you knew.
- And so did you.
You don't trust me, do you?
Yes. Yes.
But you're capricious.
You're a little bit mad.
You might give me away just for the excitement of the thing.
You might get me killed.
Unless I kill you first.
Hadn't you better wait until after tomorrow night?
A car will be waiting for you tonight.
Madame.
I beg your pardon.
I saw you admire this ring...
...and I thought perhaps you would like to have it.
Why?
Well, as a token of my admiration for you.
How charming.
Beautiful.
Madame, the car you ordered is waiting.
I won't need it. This young man has offered to take me home.
Good night, Andriani.
- No, no, no.
- Just for a little while.
- No, no further.
- Please, don't say that.
I think you're very absurd, very persistent and...
- Very nice? Thank you.
- And very Russian.
Now, go home.
I'm afraid of losing what I've found.
Meaning?
You.
Hadn't you better take that off?
As long as you insist upon staying.
For a little while.
How long have you been in Paris?
I flew from London this morning.
I saw you once in the Bois.
You were so lovely.
I watched you till you drove out of sight among the chestnut blossoms.
Oh, Paris in the spring.
Spring.
And now I'm here.
- With you.
- But it's autumn.
But perhaps next spring, the war will be over...
...you and l...
- I never look ahead.
By next spring,
I shall probably be quite alone.
Never alone again.
I mean, at least my thoughts will always be with you.
No, you mustn't.
But you are so beautiful.
This is absurd.
I am going to bed.
Don't speak.
Good night.
- Madame, the hairdresser can take you.
- I'm too nervous.
- And the marquis is calling for you.
- I'm too tired, Marie.
- And Baron Michel telephoned.
- Oh, I'm not interested, really.
Mata.
Mata.
- But, no, sir.
- It's perfectly all right.
For the loveliest lady in all France.
I had to see you.
It seemed like wasting life to sleep.
You're even more beautiful than I remembered you.
- Why did you come here?
- I couldn't help it.
Out there, the birds were singing, and there was a softness in the air just like spring.
And you were the song of the birds and the warm brightness of the morning.
- It's very nice but...
- My heart was so full of you...
...I had to come back and tell you I love you and take you to lunch.
It's almost 2:oo and I have an appointment.
But you can break it.
I must take you to lunch.
- I told you I have an appointment.
- And I told you to break it.
You're a fool.
The most conceited fool I've ever known.
Mata.
What makes you think you have the right to burst in here?
I'm sorry. But last night you told me that you loved me.
Oh, did I?
Well, that was last night.
Today I am very busy.
Marie.
- Yes, madame.
- The gentleman is leaving.
You are quite right. I have been a fool.
I won't make this mistake again.
Still a peasant, lvan, huh?
Still superstitious.
Evil spirits come in on the wind.
There's Madame Mata Hari.
Leave that alone.
Hurry up, open the door.
Go on.
Monsieur Dubois.
Dubois?
What on earth can he want?
Tell him...
Tell him I can't see him.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Tell him...
...that I shall be delighted.
My dear Dubois.
I'm afraid I'm intruding.
And inwardly you must be saying,
"confound this man Dubois."
- No. No, not at all, but...
- I'll be brief.
And if I seem to touch on matters that are...
...how shall I say it, too intimate, you must forgive me...
...it is because of my duty.
- Yes?
You are very friendly with a lady...
...perhaps the same one that you are expecting tonight.
Well, what if I am?
We consider this woman a very grave danger.
And as you know her better than anyone else, we want you to help us.
Why, what are you talking about?
- I'm expecting Mata Hari.
- Exactly.
And Mata Hari is a spy.
- In the pay of the Wilhelmstrasse.
- A spy.
Oh, my dear Dubois.
- Now you insult my intelligence.
- Please.
Either that or you've lost your mind.
I'm quite sane, I assure you.
Well, if she's a spy, why don't you arrest her?
Because I need definite proof.
And that's why I am here.
This is an absolute joke.
It's really too good, you know.
Mata Hari, a spy.
You know, for a moment,
I almost took you seriously.
Well, if the joke is as good as that,
I'd like to hear it.
Or maybe it's too bad for me to hear.
No, no, no. Our poor friend Dubois here...
...says that you are a spy.
Well, of course I am.
Everyone is Paris knows that.
Even Dubois, who knows everything.
- Couldn't you guess, Shubin?
- No, I think I'm getting old and stupid.
As I've amused you both so much...
...perhaps I need not apologize.
- Please don't misunderstand...
I don't. Evidently, I'm mistaken.
Good night, madame.
I'm very sorry you found it necessary to put me in this position.
I spoke in confidence.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Please don't misunderstand, the whole thing was a joke.
Mother in heaven, I'm done for.
I'm finished.
What did he say?
He said that you were a spy and that I was your...
- What else?
- Nothing else.
I'm sure he suspects.
Well, he wouldn't come here if he suspected you.
It's me he's after. You're quite safe.
But he must know something. Why should he come here at 11:oo at night?
The chief of the spy bureau.
It's a trap, of course.
Don't be ridiculous.
Ridiculous?
Ridiculous.
Oh, what a fool I've been.
Nothing mattered.
Honor, self-respect, everything gone.
Because of you.
You can't give away like this.
- Dubois knows nothing.
- He knows nothing.
Here I am facing dishonor, perhaps death...
...and it means nothing to you.
You haven't even a word of pity for me.
You're all unstrung, Serge.
Nothing's happened.
Look at it calmly.
Laugh at it.
We'll laugh at it together.
When you hold me like this, nothing seems to matter.
Nothing in the world.
This must never leave your hands...
...till you have delivered it personally to the prime minister. That is vital.
Should you be forced down in enemy territory...
...pull this cord, and the contents will be completely destroyed.
I understand.
The officials at Le Bourget Field will telephone you at your rooms...
...as soon as flying is possible.
It is imperative...
...that these dispatches be in Petrograd as soon as human means can contrive.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Mr. Palin will have these sealed and delivered to you.
And now, goodbye and good luck.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Lieutenant.
On your way, inquire if General Shubin has any further instructions.
Don't be so secretive.
I know that the embassy has received important news from Russia.
Please, don't ask me things.
Not tonight.
But all you've got to say is yes or no.
Well, at least you can tell me how they came, by courier?
- No.
- By wireless, then.
No.
By airplane.
The airplane from Russia?
No.
Please, don't ask me anything more.
I can't stand it.
I can't get that Dubois out of my head.
Well, maybe you'd rather be alone.
You might as well be.
Your thoughts are not with me.
My thoughts are with you always.
Are they?
Is that why you haven't kissed me for hours?
Oh, Mata.
What is it?
Lieutenant Rosanoff.
Come in. Come in.
May I present Lieutenant Rosanoff.
Madame Mata Hari.
I believe we've met before.
I don't think so, madame.
Well, what is it?
I'm flying back tonight, sir.
I am to inquire if you have any further orders.
I don't believe so.
Surely you are not thinking of flying in this weather?
Rosanoff!
- Yes, sir.
- Madame spoke to you.
I know it, sir.
Oh, never mind.
You can't expect monsieur to answer chatter with a flight for Russia on his mind.
Safe voyage, monsieur.
Come back to us soon.
Paris in the spring...
...with all those chestnut blossoms.
Good night, monsieur.
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, sir.
Madame spoke to you.
There was nothing to answer.
You're insolent.
- I advise you to return to your quarters.
- Yes, sir.
Impudent fool.
I really can't apologize enough for him.
He must have been drinking.
I thought he was quite nice.
And brave.
Flying all the way to Russia.
Well, this time you didn't have to tell me anything, did you?
Your conscience is quite clear.
I can't believe they'd send a dispatch that you know nothing about.
I've told you, I have nothing to do with political matters.
Mata, if you don't help me forget...
...this ghastly business for a few hours,
I'm going insane.
Of course you should forget them.
We both will.
Well, doesn't matter.
- He wouldn't dare.
- Who wouldn't dare?
Dubois.
What about him?
I was only thinking if he were to search my rooms while I am here...
What are you driving at?
It doesn't matter.
But those official figures that you sent me...
You haven't destroyed them?
- Not yet.
- How could you be so careless?
I suppose it was a little careless, but they're safely hidden away.
But Dubois may be there now.
It may be too late.
You must go.
I wouldn't think of leaving you for something that can't possibly happen.
Please, I can't stand it.
Come.
I'd go myself, but I'm sure they're watching the house.
Please, now, don't lose a moment.
Telephone me the moment that you've destroyed them.
- Not safe.
- Well, then come back here.
Of course I will.
Don't worry.
- Hey, get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!
Back up! Back up! Back up, will you!
Good evening, Mother Durand.
Come quick.
Call Andriani.
Tell him to send B-14 to Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff's at once.
Right here is the address.
He must wait outside...
Am I allowed to come in?
Why did you come here?
To see you.
You finished your rendezvous early.
No, I ran away from it.
Why?
Because of you.
I'm afraid that Shubin was furious.
- I can't make you out.
- I can't either.
Are you still angry?
Haven't I the right to be?
- This morning you acted like...
- I can explain.
And tonight I find you alone with Shubin.
Alexis, don't think wrong of me.
Artists need help and influence.
And Shubin can do so much to help my career.
- So I can imagine.
- But we are nothing to each other.
Please be glad to see me.
Are you sorry I came?
No.
Well, then, look at me.
Please.
Please forgive me.
Nice character in this room.
- This is the czar, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Who's the old gentleman there?
- My father.
I like his face.
- And this Madonna?
- The Madonna of Kazan'.
My mother made a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Miracles to get it for me.
It's about 1 oo miles from our town.
She walked all the way.
What is it supposed to do?
- Bring you luck?
- Oh, no. It guards you from evil.
I had to kneel before the altar...
...and promise Mother I would always keep a flame burning before it.
- And have you?
- Of course.
My orderly has taken care of it all the time I've been away.
You're a strange boy.
Who loves you.
Do you?
I love you as one adores sacred things.
What sacred things?
God...
...country...
...honor...
: : : you:
- I come last?
- No.
- That's how you said it.
- You come first.
Before anything.
Before...
...anything?
Yes.
There is so much light in here.
Put out that one too.
- The Madonna's lamp?
- Yes.
I couldn't do that.
You said I came first.
But don't you understand that it's a holy lamp?
That I swore to keep it burning?
You wouldn't do that for me?
Why? Why do you ask me to?
- To see if you love me as you say.
- I do, Mata. I do.
Well, then put it out.
If you love me.
I'll do anything, but please don't ask me to do that.
- I'm going.
- No.
Forgive me.
Steady.
Steady.
You are still here, sir.
- And they didn't telephone?
- Yes, someone did.
- Then the plans have been changed.
- I didn't answer. Get me a taxi.
- You didn't answer? Why not?
- I told you to get me a taxi.
If anyone calls, you tell them I'm out.
Quickly!
Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant Rosanoff?
- Gone out.
- This is his servant.
- Where'd Rosanoff go?
- He went to the embassy a long time ago.
- Impossible. We just came from there.
- Then he must have met with an accident.
- But when?
- Oh, these Paris taxis.
- Come on.
I hope it's not a bad accident.
I have to see her.
I'll wait here till I do see her.
Madame Mata Hari is not in.
- Where is she?
- I don't know, sir.
- Where would she be? Who are her friends?
- I don't know. Where would she be?
Where would she be?
- General Shubin's?
- I've told you, sir, I don't know.
All right.
While I know you'll hate to leave Paris,
I must ask you to go on a little mission.
- Yes? Where?
- To Marseilles.
- Marseilles?
- Yes.
Oh, no. Don't do that to me, Andriani.
Think of how I've served, the work I've done.
- Have pity on me.
- No, no. There's no need...
...of you becoming hysterical.
You're simply being ordered to Marseilles to meet our Spanish agent.
- What is so terrifying about that?
- It means my number's up. I know.
You think I'm a traitor. I'm not.
I'll swear by everything I hold sacred.
And what do you hold sacred?
There's a train tonight.
Brille has your tickets.
I won't go.
I won't go meekly to be slaughtered.
Remember, this is Paris, not the Wilhelmstrasse.
If you force me to be a traitor,
I'll go to the French police...
...and tell them everything I know.
They'll protect me.
You ought to know.
Jacques.
Now, now, now. What's the matter, dearie?
Not feeling well?
Hello, Mata.
Well, if everybody obeyed orders as loyally as you do...
Thank you.
- Any further orders for me?
- Yes.
Yes, here are the photographs of the dispatches.
Take that to Shubin and have him send them in the first diplomatic mail to Holland.
Very well.
- You don't seem to be in very good humor.
- No.
I'd think your success of last evening should put you in the very best of spirits.
- To the contrary.
- Why?
Surely, a simple job like that needn't have been unpleasant.
Most unpleasant.
He's in love with me.
Well, that's not unusual.
He wants me to marry him.
Not really? Marry...
Well...
Why is that so funny?
- What is it?
- We are dispensing with carlotta's services.
She seems to resent it.
Poor carlotta.
She shouldn't have fallen in love.
I've warned her and you about that before.
I am surprised she didn't respect your wishes in the matter.
She was afraid of you.
Ours is an exacting profession.
We're permitted no friends, no emotions, no personal life of our own.
What are you driving at?
I'm simply reminding you that a spy in love...
...is a tool that has outlived its usefulness.
You're so subtle.
You imagine that I am in love?
Well, I did think for a moment that you were taking this Rosanoff a little too seriously.
I never expect to see Rosanoff again.
I never want to.
But it's not because I'm worried by any threats of yours.
But I want you to see him again.
He may continue to be very, very useful to us.
- Not to me.
- But...
I don't ever want to touch that boy's life again.
Hello.
What?
Yes.
He did not report to the flying field?
Tell His Excellency I'll be there as quickly as possible.
- Ivan! My tunic.
- Yes, sir.
Hurry, hurry.
I knew this was going to be an unlucky day when I woke up.
Put it down. Put it down!
Get me a dozen orchids and take them to Madame Mata Hari.
Take this note along with it.
Meet me at the embassy.
Yes, sir.
Monsieur Dubois.
Good morning, my friend.
- Good morning.
- Oh, no. No one would ever forgive that.
To spoil a man's supper, then come back and spoil his breakfast.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
- Well, what is it today? More melodrama?
- No, no.
- Today it is a farce.
- Oh, indeed. I see.
Last night I was bold enough to hint at a relationship...
...between you and a certain lady.
And I've come to apologize...
...because I was mistaken.
Oh, yes, because I discovered...
...that this lady's inclinations are entirely elsewhere.
- Oh, yes?
- Oh, yes.
We older men merely furnish the soft lights and champagne.
The mood, as it were.
Youth whistles, and we? We spend the rest of the evening reading a book.
Just what are you trying to get at?
Merely this, that Mata Hari went straight to the rooms of young Rosanoff...
...when she left here last night.
And the previous night, he was with her.
In what way does this concern me?
Well, it doesn't. It merely illustrates what a fool I made of myself.
Yes, yes.
Well, if you will pardon me, I have a most important engagement at the embassy.
I'm very sorry to detain you.
It's stupid of me.
But I had to drop in and apologize for my silly mistake.
- Very kind of you. Yes, charming.
- Good morning.
- Did it work?
- I don't know yet. He seemed calm enough.
But there may be quite an interesting reaction. We shall see.
Shubin?
Shubin?
What's happened?
A private air raid?
You cheat.
- You liar.
- "Good morning, liar" would be more polite.
- Be quiet, you...
- We'll omit the pet names.
- Come to the point.
- Rosanoff. That's the point.
You were with him all last night.
Dubois told me.
How does he know?
Did he look through the keyhole?
- Don't deny it.
- I don't.
Of course I was with him.
He had information I wanted, and I got it.
That's all.
You didn't think I went there because of...?
Can't you understand why Dubois is doing this?
- He knows what you mean to me.
- You're lying.
You love that boy, and I know it.
Would I have taken this if I loved him?
What is it?
Photographs of his dispatches to Russia.
Doesn't that convince you?
Yes, I'm quite convinced.
Convinced it's not the whole truth.
What about the night before last?
Did he have the dispatches then?
No, he did not have the dispatches then.
But he had you, huh?
That's what Dubois said.
We older men supply the champagne.
But when youth sings, the old fool stays home and pays the piper.
That's what Dubois said.
Hello.
- Wagram-6oo.
- What are you doing?
I think it's only fair to apologize to Dubois.
After all, he was right, you know.
Hello, Monsieur Dubois?
Who's calling?
Hold the wire.
General Shubin on number three.
Yes? Dubois speaking.
Will you please repeat that?
I didn't quite hear you.
You were right. She is a spy.
I'll give you all the proof you want.
Well, come over! She's here.
I'll keep her here.
Get me a car quick.
At last, I've got Mata Hari.
You've been cheating men all your life.
But there'll be 12 men you won't cheat, the firing squad.
No firing squad for me, Shubin.
It'll be your word against mine.
And after all, I have friends.
Paris will laugh at you.
A jealous, hysterical fool.
Perhaps not. You and Rosanoff may get out of this, but I don't think so.
Rosanoff?
- And what has he to do with it?
- Everything.
Rosanoff is a traitor. He permitted you to copy his dispatches.
- That's not true.
- Fortunately...
...this time it isn't a question of anyone's word. I have proof.
Proof that you gave me yourself.
You've stood that boy against a wall, just as surely as you're standing there.
I never knew that anyone could be so vile.
Vile? Not at all, madame,
I'm simply doing my duty.
How ironic, you love a man and send him to his death.
Hello.
- Official-27.
- Don't do it, Shubin.
I beg you not to do it.
Hello? His Excellency's secretary, please.
- Leave him out of this. He's innocent.
- Hello, this is General Shubin speaking...
...I must speak to His Excellency at once.
- I'm warning you.
- Don't, don't do it!
- Hello, Your Excellency?
I'm coming to the embassy at once.
I must speak to you on a most urgent matter.
Shubin, if you don't stop...
- Hello, Excellency?
- Shubin!
I'll explain when I arrive. In the meantime, order the immediate arrest of...
- What do you want here?
- You.
Why, you must be mad.
Why haven't you left yet?
- But l...
- I told you. I told you I'm not for you.
Before I go, I want to tell you this.
Whatever you've been, whatever you are, whatever you will be...
...we belong to each other.
- Alexis, it can't be.
I am what I am. You don't know me.
Go away and forget me.
Forget you? How can I?
- Could you? Could you forget us?
- Women like me are trained to forget.
We mustn't admit a heart.
- You are lying. You know you are lying.
- I am not.
- You are.
- No!
You're crying, Mata. You do love me.
Don't you?
Don't you?
- Alexis, you must leave.
- I won't. I won't until you come.
- It's your duty to go.
- No.
Alexis, please go now.
When it's all over, if you still want me,
I'll come to you no matter where you are.
I'll come to you, I swear it.
But go now.
General Shubin? General Shubin?
General Shubin, Dubois speaking.
Something strange about this.
You got something to open this door?
- I'll get something.
- Yeah.
- Will this do?
- Yes, fine.
- That's hardly a surprise.
- Suicide.
- Suicide.
- He's only been dead a few minutes.
Probably long enough for Madame Mata Hari to destroy all the proof he told us about.
- Who are you?
- Russian embassy.
Shubin was talking to His Excellency.
There was a woman's scream and a shot.
- See if she's overlooked anything.
- Is he dead?
- Yes. A woman's voice, huh?
- Screaming.
And the word of a dead man.
Come on.
All the papers are saying it's a suicide.
If everyone's convinced, what's the use of my hiding like this?
Dubois may be doing that merely to trap you.
- It's unfortunate you found it necessary to...
- I'm the best judge of that.
- Have you still got you Dutch passport?
- Yes.
It doesn't suit my plans to have you arrested.
You're sailing tonight for Amsterdam.
I'll go anyplace gladly after three days of this. It's too ridiculous.
And furthermore, your usefulness in Paris is permanently over.
Here is the list of the Allied agents in Belgium.
Commit those names to memory and then destroy it.
And report to H-12 immediately you arrive in Amsterdam.
- Come in.
- Well, what is it?
- Madame sent for me.
- Yes.
I want him to get a letter through.
- For Lieutenant Rosanoff.
- Rosanoff? But he is...
- What is it? What were you going to say?
- Well, l...
Get out. Get out!
Something's happened to him.
Tell me what it is.
He's dead.
Dead?
- How?
- Plane crash.
Just this side of the enemy line.
It's too late to do anything for him now.
No sense in your risking...
- Don't talk to me.
- Well, maybe I'm wrong, of course.
Maybe he's only injured.
Yes, that's it, I think.
Well, can't you remember?
You must remember.
Why is it so important to you?
Where are you going?
- I'm going to find out.
- Wait a minute. Don't lose your head.
After all, he's not dead, he's only injured.
- And where is he?
- I don't know, some hospital, I suppose.
- Well, I'll find out.
- And be arrested?
The police are probably looking for you now.
- Remember, you have your orders.
- What do I care for your orders?
You can't frighten me. I'm not carlotta.
I'm Mata Hari and my own master.
Here are your orders. I resign.
- Not so loud, someone will hear you.
- Oh, so you resign?
Very well, Mata Hari,
I accept your resignation.
- You'll let her resign?
- My dear Durand, you ought to know.
The only way to resign from our profession is to die.
- Wait here.
- Yes, ma'am.
Flowers, madame. Flowers. Nice flowers.
- How much?
- Two francs.
Thank you.
- Room 1, that corridor.
- Thank you.
Could you tell me...?
Could you tell me where Room 1 is?
I'm afraid you'll have to ask someone else.
Sister Teresa, some water, please.
Here. Here it is.
Mata.
It's all my fault, Alexis.
If I hadn't kept you...
If I'd let you go sooner, this wouldn't have happened.
It would have happened just the same.
Really, Mata, you mustn't blame yourself.
I'll spend my life trying to make it up to you.
Oh, but I'm going to be all...
- I'll be out of here any day now.
- On that day, we'll be married.
But, Mata...
You asked me, didn't you?
There is so much ahead of us.
Everything. But I must tell you something.
And as soon as the war is over, we'll go away...
...to all the places that were made for lovers.
- And, oh, the things we'll see together.
- Don't, please.
- What?
- I don't want to frighten you, but...
What is it?
It would be glorious to go with you...
...but I may never be able to see all those splendid things.
Is it your eyes?
Here are your eyes.
What's wrong with them?
With those "ridiculously long lashes," as you said.
Now, please, it isn't worth crying about.
I'm happier this moment than I've ever been in all my life.
What do the doctors say?
They aren't very optimistic.
But you know what doctors are.
- They don't know anything.
- No.
I'll get you great specialists.
They'll make you see.
We'll travel all over the world till we find the right man.
I'll never leave you again.
Gentlemen, I appeal to you.
That man, he's been molesting me.
What? I'll handle this.
I haven't done anything.
- Back to Paris. Quick.
- Yes, miss.
Madame, I have a warrant for your arrest.
Be careful you don't have to apologize again, Dubois.
Now, Monsieur Dubois...
...you say that General Shubin admitted over the telephone...
...that Mata Hari was an enemy spy?
- Yes.
- He had indisputable proof she was a spy?
- Yes.
General Shubin told you, also, that she was there with him...
...while he was talking with you?
- Yes.
And you went there immediately, and you found that Shubin had been murdered?
- Yes.
- That's all. Thank you.
Does the defense wish to question the witness?
No, I don't care to prolong this farce.
You've not brought to that stand one human being who has said that this is so.
- "I know it. I saw it. I swear it."
- The counsel for the defense...
...evidently has as poor a memory as his client.
Didn't General Shubin say that Mata Hari...
...was in his rooms at the time he was telephoning?
Oh, no.
Dubois said that Shubin said that she was there.
We cannot blame Monsieur Dubois, of course...
...for accepting too readily whatever information was given to him.
But has he any proof that it was Shubin who spoke over the telephone?
No. And now I want that.
I demand that the prosecution produce some one witness...
...who will swear to one definite thing...
...or I demand that Mata Hari be acquitted with the apologies of the court.
There is a man who saw Mata Hari at General Shubin's that morning.
This man was overheard by a nurse in the hospital...
...discussing this fact with the prisoner.
Overheard. Overheard.
Something more overheard.
Why don't you bring him here and let me question him under oath?
I had hoped to avoid bringing to court a brave young officer...
...recently blinded in the course of heroic duty.
But if the defense demands it, summon Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff.
No, no, no. He knows nothing of this.
All he can say is what I said to him as I came out of that room.
When you came out of what room,
Mata Hari? What room?
I'll tell you. Shubin's room!
Your witnesses were perjured.
You have no alibi.
When Shubin called you a spy over the telephone, he told the truth.
And you knew it, and you shot him in an attempt to save yourself.
But it has not saved you, Mata Hari.
You stand proven an enemy of France.
Sister Teresa, will you read this to me once more?
For the last time.
- For the last time?
- Yes.
"Dearest, I shall not be able to see you or even to write to you...
...for some time to come.
A sudden attack, nothing really serious, has caused my removal to a sanitarium.
You must not be alarmed...
...because the only pain I feel is that of being without you."
"And when it becomes too sharp, I think of all the happiness we have had together...
...and that which we are going to have.
Then I can bear anything.
Good night, Alexis.
Tomorrow is sure to be glorious.
It brings me closer to you.
Mata."
In the name of the French Republic, this court finds the accused, Mata Hari...
...guilty of espionage and of communicating military information to the enemy.
Therefore, this said court, by virtue of articles 2o5, 6 and 7 of the military code...
...condemns this woman to be shot to death by rifle fire.
On display!
Left.
- Any news about the reprieve?
- We are expecting her lawyer any minute.
Oh, it's getting close to 5:oo.
Here.
Give her that. Cognac.
That'll put heart into you.
- You're a good man.
- Good?
Because I give a dying woman a drink?
You don't want jewelry and you can't use clothes.
- What can I give you?
- There's nothing.
We have everything we need.
Everything you need?
- How is that possible?
- We serve God and are content.
I wonder if I could be like that if I had to do it all over again from the beginning.
No.
That's how I am, and that's how I had to be.
No, little Sister, mustn't waste your tears on me.
Madame, Maître caron.
Oh, he's come to bring the reprieve.
My dear, dear child.
- No?
- I tried everything.
I appealed to the highest quarters.
I know you did.
Come and sit down.
I spent a whole hour with the president, who is one of my oldest friends, but...
What about Alexis?
That's all settled, just as you wanted it.
He's downstairs now.
- I'll...
- Wait.
Will you give him this...
...afterwards?
- And be very gentle with him.
- Of course, my child.
I hope I have written the things that'll help him most.
And if I haven't, perhaps you will know what to say.
I'll know what to say.
That in having your love even for a little while...
...he had more than most men ever have.
No.
Just tell him that no matter what he hears about me...
...and he will hear things...
...that my love for him was honest.
That's all.
Except that he must be happy.
Must laugh and love.
And then, someday, when he's an old man...
...and his grandchildren ask him about Mata Hari...
...he must tell a great lie, say that she was a wonderfully good woman.
And that'll be my heaven.
- Now will you ask him to come up?
- At once.
Sister, the young man is blind.
I've told him that this is a sanitarium.
You must be careful.
They will. They understand.
Come.
Take care of the steps.
Madame, I'm leaving the door open so that the visitor won't hear the rattle of the lock.
Bless you.
Alexis.
Come, nurses. We'll look at the patient in the next room...
...and leave these young people alone.
- Thank you, doctor.
This is most irregular.
And after the operation, how much longer will you have to stay here?
I don't know.
- I'll be well soon, I hope.
- Of course you will.
- And so will I.
- What?
The doctors say now that with time and the right treatment...
...there is every chance I'll see again.
See you again.
That's the one thing I needed to give me strength.
Mata, you are telling me the truth?
It isn't a dangerous operation?
No. No, it's very slight, really.
And in a short time, we'll forget all this and be so happy.
Just the same, I can't bear to think of you suffering.
- Alexis?
- Yes.
- Promise me you won't worry about me.
- Oh, Mata, please.
Now, promise me.
You know what operations are.
Even the slightest, there's always a chance.
Promise me.
If something should happen to me...
...you won't grieve too much, that you'll carry on.
But nothing will happen to you.
You mustn't be afraid.
Well, then hold me.
I won't be afraid if you hold me.
Is it time?
The doctor and the nurses, they've come to take me.
Already? Why need it be so early?
Well, they always operate early in the morning.
And the sooner I go, the sooner it's over.
All right, but you mustn't be frightened.
I'll wait right here till they bring you back.
No, no. I don't want you to.
Monsieur caron is waiting to take you back.
He'll let you know just how I am.
- Very soon.
- You are afraid.
- No.
- You needn't be. I've been through it.
The anesthetic is unpleasant, but that's all.
- Goodbye, my beloved.
- Oh, you sound so tragic.
- Goodbye, my beloved. Is that better?
- Yes, darling.
Courage. Courage, my dear. Be brave.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
God, save her. Protect her.
And if you must take her, take me too.

- Good-bye.
- Come and see us again.
[Voices Overlapping]
Oh, Joe?
Excuse me.
How about you and me gettin' together?
I've gotta see-
Can't make it tonight.
Too many things to look after.
You've been keepin' me waitin' for weeks.
And you'll keep on waitin' till I'm good and ready.
I don't wanna impose on you,
Mr. Chan... but when I sent an invitation to come here tonight... there was a little matter
I wanted to get your advice about.
Excuse, please.
Have promised wife... not to let anything interfere with family vacation.
It'll only take a few minutes.
You'd be doing me a great favor.
Can take matter up now?
Well, uh, I've been gettin' a lot of threatening letters lately.
They're all unsigned, and they arrive very mysteriously.
Now, frankly, I'm a bit worried.
- If you'll notice, they're all, uh-
- [Fanfare]
Oh, well, it's time for the show to start.
I'll tell you what.
If you wouldn't mind slipping out during the performance...
I'll be at the business wagon in the back lot at 9:00.
- Will be there.
- Thanks. You'd better gather your family together.
I'd like to take you someplace where there's a snappy dance orchestra.
Oh, boy, I'll bet you can shake a mean rumba.
I'm shaking you right now.
I told you the show leaves town tonight.
Then how about tomorrow night?
If it's not too far,
I can run over to see you.
Excuse.
Pardon interruption, please.
Oh, Pop, this is Su Toy.
Gee, you ought to see her do her stuff.
So pleased.
Hope romantic offspring... has not tried to twist charming artist around finger.
Oh, no, Mr. Chan.
I had my fingers crossed.
Wise precaution... to accept applesauce with large pinch of salt.
Excuse, please.
Show's starting. Where are brothers and sisters entrusted to your care?
Oh, I've got that all fixed, Pop.
[Whistle Blowing]
[Circus]
[Laughing, Shouting]
[Kinney]
Gaines.
What's the take tonight?
- Not so good.
No. If business doesn't pick up...
I'm afraid I won't be able to pay you those notes by the end of the season.
- That's your worry.
- I know. I'll do the best I can.
- I may have to ask you for an extension.
- Get this straight, Gaines.
With me, a bargain is a bargain.
You can't meet your obligations...
I'm taking over your half of the show.
Good heavens, man, every dollar
I have in the world is tied up in this circus.
- You can't do any-
- Oh, yes, I can. And another thing-
Mr. Kinney, the ape's acting up again.
- Blake says it'll be dangerous to work him tonight.
- Why bother me about it?
- You're head animal man. Use the whip on him.
- Yeah?
I did that once, and you know what it got me.
If you ask me,
Blake's usin' good sense.
Nobody's askin' you.
I'll take care of the ape.
You're makin' a mistake, Joe.
You can't run a circus with a bullwhip.
You look out for your end, Gaines,
I'll take care of mine.
- [Ends]
- [Applause]
- [Roaring]
- [Man] Easy, boy.
Quiet, Caesar.
Steady, boy.
Take it easy.
Here. Quiet!
Why don't you sing him to sleep, Blake? That's what's the matter with him-you pamper him.
Well, he can't be handled tonight,
Mr. Kinney.
If he goes bad in the big tent, someone'll get hurt.
Even the ape knows you're yellow.
You've gotta show him who's boss.
Cut it out! Don't you see you're only making him worse?
You're fired, Blake.
Give me the key to that cage.
That's okay with me.
If I have to crawl... to anyone like you,
I don't want the job.
- I'll take that key.
- Oh, no, you don't!
[Blake]
Why, you-
[Voices Overlapping]
- Get out of here! Get off the lot, all of ya!
- Wait a minute.
Blake isn't going or anybody else.
Get back to your work, men.
You and I'll attend to this later.
Lou, can I see you a minute?
Yes. Come on in.
- What's the matter? Why aren't you working?
- I'm through. I quit.
- What, again?
- Yeah, but this time it sticks, and I'm takin' you with me.
Oh, now, now.
Tell me what it's all about.
Oh, I'm sick of the whole rotten mess.
Let's get away from here and live like regular people.
I'll scrape up enough dough somehow.
You wouldn't leave the circus for all the money in the world.
- You know you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?
Where's your sister?
Marie's over at the wardrobe tent getting her costume fixed.
Oh, so that's what it was.
You had another argument with Kinney.
Yeah. He's not gonna boot me around like he does the animals.
- Marie?
- Oh, hello, dear.
- I'm sending your act on early tonight.
- Why? What's happened?
I had a scrap with Hal Blake.
I fired him. The ape act isn't workin'.
Oh, Joe, you're always getting into trouble with someone.
That's the only way to get things in this world-you gotta fight for 'em.
No, it isn't.
You'll only make people hate you... and I want people to like the man I'm going to marry.
Here's your cape.
- Thanks, Nellie.
- [Fanfare]
There's your music cue.
Come on, kid, get goin'.
What's the matter?
Joe only comes around when Marie's here just to burn me up.
- I'm gonna tell him so next time.
- That won't get you anywhere.
If you were any kind of a brother, you wouldn't have let him treat me the way he has.
I'm taking care of that in my own way.
Ladies and gentlemen... it is my great privilege and honor to be able to introduce to you... that peerless little aerial star...
Miss Marie Normand!
- [Fanfare]
- [Applause]
The only artiste in the world with any circus today... doing a forward somersault from a flying trapeze...
and catching by her heels.
She will perform this death-defying feat... without the aid of a net!
- Marie Normand!
- [Waltz]
[Applause]
[Stops]
[Drumroll]
- [Cymbal Crash]
- [Applause]
Oh. Oh, Pop,
I was just looking for you.
Following road map?
I saw you leave and figured something was up. I wanted to be in on it.
Curiosity responsible for cat needing nine lives.
You looking for somebody, Mr. Chan?
Had appointment here with Mr. Kinney, but find door locked.
Well, this is Mr. Gaines,
Mr. Kinney's partner.
How do you do?
Anything I can do for you?
Hey, Pop, look.
There's a light on the inside.
There shouldn't be. I locked the wagon up myself over a half an hour ago.
Perhaps advisable to investigate.
- Have key to wagon?
- Yes, I have.
- It's bolted on the inside.
- Most peculiar.
Door bolted on inside... suggests someone there... but no answer to knock.
There's one way to find out.
Break the door in.
That isn't necessary.
I'll get a locksmith.
One moment. More than one way to remove skin from cat.
Ventilator on roof open.
Ventilator on roof open.
Perhaps little man can enter.
Why, I couldn't get up there.
Giant very good for first step.
Sure.
There you go.
It'll be a long drop to the floor.
May borrow walking stick?
Why, sure.
Jack have no trouble sliding down beanstalk.
- Lift me up. I can't see.
- Why, certainly.
[Gasps]
Something's happened to Mr. Kinney!
[Gaines]
Unbolt the door!
- Touch nothing, please.
- Towers, get the show doctor.
Too late.
Mr. Kinney dead.
- Dead?
- He must've been murdered.
Neck broken.
Strangled by very powerful hands.
Dan! Dan Farrell!
Caesar's loose!
- How'd he get out? Wasn't the cage locked?
- Sure, it was!
- Someone must've opened it.
- Never mind that. Come on, fellas.
Scatter out.
Don't let him get near the big top!
But the door was bolted on the inside.
[Chan] Much evil can enter through very small space.
Police must find answer.
Wait, Mr. Chan.
You're a detective.
Can't this be handled quietly?
Very happy to be of assistance... but police must be notified.
I'll do it, Pop.
There's a telephone across the street.
All of you go about your business as if nothing had happened.
I don't want any excitement while the show is on.
I'll get Dr. Meade.
The police'll probably want him.
Hello.
Chief of the homicide squad?
There's been a murder at the circus.
Of course I know it's murder.
I'm a detective myself.
Okay, Chief.
[Screams]
[Roaring]
[Gasping]
- Gee, I'm sorry!
- Get out of my way! The ape's loose!
Ape's loose?
You're telling me!
Stop it! Let me go!
How dare you!
Let me go!
Let-
- Let me out of here!
- You'll be safe in there.
- Why, you-you-
- Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Hey, Pop, the big ape is loose!
Had suspected same.
Observe.
Hairs not from human head.
I got it, Pop! They're monkey hairs.
The ape killed him.
Very good deduction.
But how did he get in?
The wagon was locked on the inside.
Suggest we make inspection outside window. Come.
- Found anything?
- Not a trace.
Jerry, look in those shadows over there by the canvas. Frank, go around the other way.
Look out he don't get behind you.
- Ape tracks.
- Gee, Pop!
That is barrel he used to climb up to window.
And here are some more prints on the barrel.
Look out!
Caesar! Caesar!
Farrell! Don't use the whip!
Here, I'll have him. Caesar! Caesar, steady!
Caesar! Caesar!
Steady, Caesar!
All right.
Take him to his cage.
Good work, Holt.
It took a lot of nerve to do that.
Are you hurt, Pop?
Side of wagon not like feather bed.
Thank you so much for fortunate rescue.
That's all right.
- [Siren Wailing]
- Here come the police, Pop.
Recommend you stay here.
- Study approved method of police.
- But, Pop, l-
One ounce of experience worth ton of detective books.
Go ahead, fellas.
Give the place the once-over.
I can give you the dope,
Lieutenant Macy.
The big ape escaped during the show and murdered him.
The proof is right there on the window sill.
Right here, Mr. Macy.
Looks like your tip's about right, kid.
They're ape hairs.
There's only one thing
I haven't figured out yet- how they got there with that window locked.
That's right.
Here.
Well, that's easy. Look.
The window must've been propped open at the time like that.
Now, you stay right here, and I'll show you how it was done.
You'd better come this way a little.
Now turn your back to me.
That's it.
Now, don't move.
The ape creeps up on the outside... reaches in through the bars... grabs Kinney by the throat...
- shakes him, chokes him...
- [Coughing]
And kills him.
Now, then, in getting away... he knocks the prop down-
And the lock snaps shut.
[Coughing]
Gee, Mr. Macy, you figured that one out fine.
- Thanks.
- [Coughing Continues]
- I hope I didn't hurt you.
- Oh, no.
Say, let me have that magnifying glass again, will you?
Sure.
- There's one more thing I haven't figured out yet.
- Yeah? What's that?
The barrel wasn't here.
It was over there.
- Oh?
- Now, here's what happened.
When the ape stepped down, the barrel tipped over, like that!
Gee, Mr. Macy,
I hope I didn't hurt you.
Oh, no.
You're pretty good at figuring things out yourself, ain't ya?
- Here's your glass. I'm glad I didn't break it.
- Oh, thanks.
Now that I got that figured out...
I wanna know how the ape got out of that cage.
Perhaps can offer slight suggestion.
Oh, this is my father, Charlie Chan.
Lieutenant Macy.
How are you, Mr. Chan?
You sure got a bright kid.
He just gave me a good steer.
Uh, sometimes suspect ambitious offspring of giving bull.
- [Chuckles]
- Did you find anything new, Pop?
Ape released purposely.
Hal Blake, who worked animal... have two keys to cage.
Lost one earlier tonight.
Either Blake open cage...
- or person who find lost key.
- Aha.
- Where is he? Where is he?
- They've taken him away, lady.
Just a minute, please.
Who are you?
I'm Marie Normand, Mr. Kinney's fiancee.
I want to go to him.
You couldn't do anything for him now, miss.
- We didn't wanna tell you until after the show, Marie.
- So sorry.
Offer deepest sympathy.
Someone killed him.
I know it.
They hated him.
They all hated him.
- What do you mean by that?
- Later, please.
Suggest you take young lady away.
Come, Marie.
Well, what she said about them hating Kinney proves your point- that the ape was released purposely.
We'd better round up the whole outfit and give 'em a grilling, Mr. Chan.
Oh, one point more.
Would suggest you look for threatening letters...
Mr. Kinney had in inside pocket of coat...
now mysteriously missing.
Excuse, please.
Must return to family.
- Will say good night.
- Well, thanks for the help.
- Don't mention it.
- Dig up the manager of the show...
- and tell him I wanna talk to everyone connected to the case.
- Yes, sir.
Gee, Pop, I hate to walk out on this case.
I can see some interesting angles.
- Contortion lady?
- Gee! That reminds me!
See you later, Pop.
- Help!
- Gosh, Su Toy. I'm sorry.
Let me out of here, you!
- Listen, please, I just couldn't get back any sooner.
- Don't speak to me!
I just had to put you in there to save you from the ape.
[Both Shouting In Foreign Language]
Hey, Su Toy, let me out, will ya?
Su! Su, come back here!
Oh, Mama, you have railroad tickets?
- Oh, yes.
- I can't find my raincoat.
- Hurry to bed, children.
- Here, Daddy. Here's your shoes.
Oh. Thank you so much.
You know, I think we oughta stick with this case, Pop... and go to the next town with the circus.
Have desire to remain permanently in monkey cage?
Have late visitor.
[Tiny]
Here I am, Mr. Chan.
Oh, come in.
Excuse me for coming here so late, but it's terribly important.
Very happy to welcome distinguished little visitor.
[Voices Overlapping]
Oh, Mr. Chan, are you going away?
Yes. Tomorrow, am taking family to observe wonders of Grand Canyon.
Oh. I'm so sorry.
You are in trouble?
Sit down.
Mr. Macy took my husband and Mr. Gaines... and some of the circus people down to police headquarters.
Distinguished lieutenant of police act with streamline speed.
And he says he's going to tie the show up until the murder of Mr. Kinney is solved.
If he does that, the circus will just go to pieces, and we'll all lose our jobs.
That would be most unfortunate.
It'll cost Mr. Gaines everything he's got.
And, Mr. Chan, he's been an awfully good friend to Tim and me and everyone.
We've been with him for five years... and there never was any trouble until Mr. Kinney joined the show.
How long Mr. Kinney been partner in circus?
Just the last two seasons. Mr. Gaines needed money, so he sold him a half interest.
But Mr. Kinney didn't know how to handle circus people.
He was only used to honky-tonks and tried to run things with his fists.
Man who seek trouble never find it far off.
It's Mr. Gaines who's in trouble now.
Can't you do something, Mr. Chan?
Please?
Unfortunately, have already made plans for vacation with family.
Oh.
I was depending on you to help us.
Aw, Pop, don't let 'em close down the circus.
- And don't let them arrest the little people.
- And the clowns.
- And the elephants.
- You see, Pop?
- I knew we should have stayed on this case.
- Aw, Pop!
- Come on!
- Please.
Jury seem to render verdict without retiring.
Then you'll help us, Mr. Chan?
Final decision in hands of judge.
Judge say yes too.
Suggest we visit police headquarters and see Lieutenant Macy.
Oh, thanks.
- I'm going with you, Pop.
- Contradiction, please.
You stay here, help unpack.
[Laughter]
We had a pretty tough season, so naturally, the show went into the red.
I gave Kinney notes for my share of the losses.
Then if those notes weren't paid by the end of the season...
he would have taken over your share of the show.
- He could have.
- Well, as far as I can see...
every one of you might've had a reason for wanting Kinney out of the way.
Now, some one of you had a hand in turning the ape loose...
and until I get the answer, you're all gonna stay right here.
You can't do that!
We may be tied up here for weeks.
This show's got to keep moving to support itself.
It's the law, brother. All right, Stone.
Take 'em out and have 'em booked.
But you-
Just a small-town cop who wants to show how smart he is.
- Yeah.
- All right, get goin; both of ya. Go on.
May offer suggestion, please?
Go ahead.
Frightened bird very difficult to catch.
What does that mean in English?
Old English adage say give man plenty of rope, will hang self.
Not in this case. I'm gonna give 'em a few hours in the jug... and I'll bet they uncork everything they know.
Perhaps facts also remain corked in jug.
Guilty person more apt to betray self... while engaged in everyday work at circus.
[Chuckles]
I suppose I should join the circus as a mind reader and guess the answer.
- Very wise plan.
- Are you kid-
Say, that gives me an idea.
If I let 'em carry on with the show... then I can study the conditions under which the crime was committed.
Trained mind of policeman work like lightning.
Yeah!
Say, listen, Charlie.
You were in on the start of this.
Why don't you stick with me to the finish?
Thank you so much.
Will return to humble family and make arrangements.
Fine.
[Horn Honking]
Su! Su Toy!
- You again?
- Yeah. I'm going along with you.
- What?
- Sure. Haven't you heard?
I'm gonna help Pop solve the murder.
Well, you can solve anything you want to, but keep away from me.
[Lee] Aw, don't be like that.
We'll have a swell time.
I've brought along my phonograph, and I got a lot of records from Shanghai.
That's fine.
Then you can play yourself to sleep.
Good night.
Lady seemed to have dropped final curtain.
Oh, that-that's just her way of saying good night.
Mmm. Very practical.
There is nothing to detain you further.
- What time did you say this train pulls out?
- Midnight.
We'd better get aboard.
What are you doin' in the manager's compartment?
Waitin' to see Gaines.
Well, wait outside.
We don't want the smell of animals in here.
- What is it, Farrell?
- I thought I'd better ride up forward tonight...
- and keep an eye on the ape.
- That's a good idea. Go ahead.
- Is that Kinney's stateroom?
- Yes. Mine's further down the corridor.
Holt, take the bags to Mr. Kinney's room.
You don't mind sleeping there,
Mr. Chan?
No. Guilty conscience only enemy to peaceful rest.
- How about your son?
- Huh? Oh. Oh, I don't mind.
- You can use this room anytime you like.
- Thank you.
This way, sir.
- You are Hindu from the sideshow?
- Yes, sir.
But in the circus, we all have more than one job. I'm the porter on this car.
Circus performer like detective.
- Must beJohnny of many trades.
- Yeah, you said it.
- Bring other baggage, please?
- Yes, sir.
Did Kinney keep all his papers here?
No. He used the safe in the business wagon too.
Well, how about having a look at it?
Be a lot of trouble. The wagon's already been loaded on the flatcars forward.
Oh, well, we'll look at it in the morning.
[Music Box]
- Oh, pardon me.
- It's all right.
[Whistle Blowing]
- Dan, did you tell them?
- No. They'll find out soon enough.
- Oh, you should've told 'em tonight.
- Let me handle it, will ya?
- Where are you going?
- I'm riding forward on the flatcars.
- I saw to that.
- [Whistle Blowing]
[Middle Eastern]
[Continues]
Ancient adage say music soothes savage breast.
Please to reserve for such occasion.
I was just trying to cheer things up, Pop.
It's kind of creepy here in Kinney's room.
Then recommend you brush teeth, say prayers and go to bed.
I'm not sleepy yet.
You know, I'm going out on the platform and think this case over.
Have new problem in female geometry?
You know what you always say, Pop-
If you want to understand men, study women.
- Did Pop say that?
- Yeah.
Tim?
[Yawns]
- Tim!
- Aw, what do you want?
How do you expect me to get any sleep with you stamping around over my head?
You women can sleep no matter what's going on, but I'm worried.
Well, lie down and count sheep.
I never did like sheep, and you know it.
Well, try elephants.
You don't have to count so many.
Think you're smart, don't ya?
[Coughing]
[Middle Eastern]
Gun in coat pocket.
Aim carefully.
Cannot afford to miss.
Perfect bull's-eye.
Very proud of number one son.
Gee, Pop, I knew we shouldn't have slept in here.
Hey, Charlie, what happened?
Somebody object to Charlie Chan as passenger on train.
- A snake!
- How could that have gotten in here?
Very strange. When retired, ventilator closed.
Well, then someone must've opened it from the roof and slipped the snake in.
- Where are they kept?
- Forward in one of the menagerie cars.
- Holt's the only one that handles 'em.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, what's the answer?
- How do I know? I haven't left this car all night.
- How'd the snake get in here?
- How'd the ape get out of the cage?
Question without answer... like faraway water, no good for nearby fire.
Yeah, but I know one answer though.
Somebody's trying to pin this on me just because I handle the snakes.
Well, this time,
I'm going to find out what's what... if I have to keep everyone on this train awake all night.
No cause for hurry now.
Enemy who misses mark, like serpent... must coil to strike again.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[Shouting, Indistinct]
Oh. Hello, Pop.
I was just doing my daily dozen.
Attitude prove
Darwin theory correct.
Suggest you untie human pretzel and get dressed.
Yeah, sure. Hey, Pop, get me out of this, will you?
Very wise to know way out before going in.
Ooh! Oh, thanks, Pop.
Where are you going?
Am having breakfast with little people.
More coffee, Mr. Chan?
Thank you.
Another piece of toast?
No more, thank you.
- Very excellent coffee.
- Thank you.
Tiny's a good cook.
Do they dunk in China, Mr. Chan?
- Please?
- Dunk. Dunk.
Oh. Very ancient Chinese custom.
Tiny, don't be so unrefined.
[Slurping]
I was hoping, Mr. Chan, that you'd have some new clues.
Have, uh, several clues.
One need explanation.
- Perhaps you can be of assistance.
- Sure, I'll be glad to help.
You enter business wagon last night before discovery of body?
You enter business wagon last night before discovery of body?
- Why, I, uh-
- You'd better tell Mr. Chan everything.
- He's a mind reader.
- Very easy to read mind... when clue like, uh, rag on sore thumb.
Marks in dust on light shade prove little man on first visit... slide down lamp cord to reach floor.
It's true.
I did go in.
Mr. Gaines left his keys in there after the matinee... so I climbed down the ventilator and opened the door for him.
Uh, something important
Mr. Gaines want in wagon?
I don't know. He started to open the safe, then Mr. Kinney came in.
They got into an argument about business, so I beat it.
But please don't tell the police.
They suspect Mr. Gaines already.
If they knew that, they'd be sure to arrest him.
Facts, like photographic film... must be exposed before developing.
Thank you for very excellent breakfast.
Don't mention it, Mr. Chan.
Is there anything else we can do for you?
Have desire to again visit ape's cage.
We'll take you there. I always bring the ape a banana in the morning.
He's crazy about them. No matter how mad he is, it always quiets him.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
This is Jumbo.
He's my special pet.
Really?
[Chuckles]
Most fortunate animal.
[Growling]
Look at the size of that fellow, Mr. Chan.
Like Charlie Chan, need to reduce waistline.
[Both Laughing]
[Lions Growling]
How would you like to be inside playing with them?
Much prefer being outside looking in.
[Both Laughing]
- [Growling]
- Quiet down!
Hal, I brought Caesar a banana.
Be careful, Tiny.
He's still pretty mean.
Oh, he wouldn't hurt me.
Will you help me up, Mr. Chan, please?
Here, Caesar.
- Any news of missing key?
- No, sir.
But Mr. Macy put this policeman here to guard the cage.
Hey, Pop! Pop!
I've been looking all over for you.
The business wagon was broken into last night, and Mr. Macy wants you there right away.
More trouble for poor Mr. Gaines.
Trouble rain on man already wet.
Excuse, please.
Excuse.
[Macy]
Looks like an amateur tried to break it open.
A regular yegg would've known he couldn't chisel his way... through a cold steel safe door.
Any fingerprints?
No, not a trace.
- Where was the business wagon last night?
- On the flatcar.
Yeah, and I locked it up before it was put on the car.
Pop!
Look. They filed through the hasp to get into the wagon.
Open the safe, Gaines, and let's take a look.
- What do you make of it, Pop?
- Very clever job.
And, uh, excellent bronze filings.
Nothing's been touched.
He didn't get into the safe.
For a quick guess, I'd say that whoever was responsible for Kinney's death... must've wanted something out of this safe.
Quite possible.
Here, what's this?
"Joseph Kinney. Personal."
Life insurance policy.
Fifty thousand dollars.
- Who is beneficiary?
- It was changed last month to, uh...
Marie Normand.
Trapeze lady.
Mr. Kinney's fiancee.
Yeah. Hey, wait a minute.
- Here's a certificate of marriage.
- What's that?
"Juarez, Mexico. May 30, 1935."
Joseph Kinney and Nellie Farrell.
Say, what is this fiancee business?
Very peculiar.
Man already married announce engagement to trapeze lady.
- [Snaps Fingers]
- I got it.
The Normand girl must've found out he was two-timing her... and decided to collect the insurance.
Too soon to count chickens until eggs are in nest.
- Who is Nellie Farrell?
- The wardrobe woman, Dan Farrell's sister.
She and Kinney used to go together, but he threw her over for Marie Normand.
Did you ever hear Kinney speak of being married to her?
Never. If he did, he kept it to himself.
Well, is that his signature?
- Yes, it is.
- Very strange.
Nellie Farrell did not reveal last night... she was wife of murdered man.
I got it. Maybe this is the lucky break we're looking for.
We'll need it if we're ever gonna crack this case.
One grain of luck is sometimes worth more than whole rice field of wisdom.
Yeah. Say, where can I find this Nellie Farrell?
- She's probably over on the train.
- Come on.
Let's go have a little talk with her.
- Are you Nellie Farrell?
- No.
She was over there reading the morning paper just a few minutes ago.
- Well, where'd she go?
- Who wants to know? Oh.
She said she had some business in town.
- She'd be back before the show started.
- Oh.
Say, Pop,
I just thought of something.
I'll see you later.
So she went to town on business.
I wonder what that's all about.
Perhaps will learn when meet with her.
Very excellent likeness of Mr. Kinney.
But we know what he looked like.
His picture isn't gonna get us anything.
Cannot tell where path lead until reach end of road.
- Let me look at that, will you?
- Say, what's the big idea?
Here it is!
What a break! Come on!
We're on the right track.
There's Nellie's brother.
Where? Let me see.
Well, I should kiss a pig!
Shh, shh, shh.
There, there, dear.
There, there.
There, there.
There's Nellie too.
They're coming this way.
Keep your head down, and we'll trail them.
- What did the lawyer say?
- There isn't a chance of a slipup.
I can claim everything.
[Su Toy]
Good morning, Mr. Chan.
How did you know it was me?
I never forget a face.
Don't give me away.
I'm on a hot trail.
You must be.
Something's burning.
- Hiya, Su. We're detectives.
- We're in disguise.
Well, the first thing you'd better learn is how to keep your disguise up.
[People Laughing]
- Say, Pop-
- You find Nellie Farrell visit lawyer's office?
- Gee! How did you know?
- Very simple.
Saw you get idea from newspaper with clipping cut out.
Uh, very proud you learn tricks of trade so quickly.
And I thought I was putting something over on you!
But she went there, all right.
And when she came out-
She meet brother, Dan Farrell.
I'm telling you?
You're telling me.
Very simple.
Brother also missing from circus lot.
Anyway, I followed them and listened in.
She told them there wasn't a chance of a slipup.
- She could claim everything.
- And then?
And then they walked on, and, well, uh, l-
- You meet contortion lady?
- Oh, how do you do it, Pop?
Evidence like nose on anteater.
Jade pin belong to lady of many angles.
Gee, you can see through anything.
I don't see what you need a microscope for.
Good tools shorten labor.
Have made very interesting discovery. Observe.
- What are those spots?
- Bronze filings... from padlock on door of business wagon.
Discovered in this envelope which contain personal papers of Mr. Kinney.
But that envelope was inside the safe, and the safe wasn't broken open.
Contradiction, please.
Bronze filings prove otherwise.
Same person who file lock also open safe.
Must have known combination.
Then batter safe door to give appearance... of unsuccessful attempt at burglary.
It's over my head.
Particles of bronze filings from padlock... unconsciously deposited in envelope when burglar handled same.
I get it. But what do you suppose they stole from the envelope?
Mystery still to be solved.
Oh, l- l-I was just gonna tell Mr. Chan the matinee is about to start... and I thought maybe he needed something before I left.
Oh, yeah?
Well, get outta here.
And make it snappy.
I just caught Holt listening outside the door.
Inquisitive person, like bear after honey... sometime find hornet's nest.
[Fanfare]
Circus starting.
Perhaps Nellie Farrell now returned.
Yeah, that's why I came to get you.
We'll look her up.
Advise no mention of marriage certificate.
Leave first move to lady.
Oh, sure.
- [Circus]
- [Chattering]
Hey, Jenny, what about my turban?
- It's right there under your nose.
- Where?
- Jenny, where are my slippers?
- I don't know.
- There's no shoes with this outfit.
- Look for 'em yourself.
That's Nellie's job, not mine.
Lou.
Did you think over what we talked about last night?
Yes, Hal, but I couldn't leave Marie, especially now.
There isn't anything you can do for her.
I've got it fixed up for a job in Chicago.
We'll hop the night train-
Jenny, isn't Nellie Farrell back yet?
No, and I think it's a dirty trick piling up all this work on me.
And don't blame me if I'm late for the show.
- Jenny, haven't you found my slippers yet?
- All right.
Do the best you can. We'll have everything straightened out in a little while.
Jenny, get your parade stuff racked over there.
- Make more room for this other wardrobe.
- I only got one pair of hands.
- I'm doing the best I can.
- I know you are.
Well, Nellie... why weren't you on the job?
- I don't have to answer to you anymore.
- What do you mean by that?
I'm just as much boss here now as you are.
I'm Joe Kinney's widow. I've put in my claim for his share of the show.
What are you talking about, Nellie?
We were married five months ago.
- Why didn't you tell me about it?
- Why, you were with-
Excuse. So clumsy.
[Quietly]
Better to slip with foot than with tongue.
I didn't tell you about our being married... because I knew you didn't likeJoe Kinney... and I suppose he was keeping our marriage a secret... because he was making a play for Marie Normand.
That's not true! You're just saying that because you hate my sister.
You keep out of this.
I can see through your game.
BecauseJoe Kinney's dead, you're trying to put something over.
But I know he never married you, or he'd have told me.
Why should he?
You were just another woman to him.
And you thought you were so clever taking him away from me.
Pardon interruption, please.
You have marriage certificate?
No, Joe never let me have it.
When was time of marriage?
It was, uh, May the 30th,
Decoration Day.
We were in El Paso, and the big top blew down, and we couldn't go on that night... soJoe and I went across the border toJuarez, and we were married.
- Now I know you're lying.
- I'm sorry, Miss Normand, but it's the truth.
- We found the marriage certificate.
- It's a fake.
No, it isn't.
Mr. Gaines verified the signature.
- I know whereJoe was that night.
- You haven't time. There's your music.
- He wasn't in Mexico, and I can prove it.
- We'll get your story later.
- Hurry!
- [Fanfare]
Get back to your work, folks.
We've got a show on.
Just a minute.
Why didn't you tell us about this... last night when your husband was killed?
Joe and I hadn't been living together... so I thought I should see a lawyer and find out just where I stood.
- I'll take my marriage certificate.
- One moment, please.
Certificate much safer in hands of law.
Yeah, that's right.
You've got nothing to worry about.
We'll take good care of it.
Come on, Charlie.
[Drumroll]
[Man]
Marie Normand!
- [Cymbal Crash]
- [Applause]
[Drumroll]
[Continues]
[Screams]
[Clamoring]
Marie! Marie!
- Marie!
- Hurry with that stretcher!
Pick her up.
Gently. Gently.
That's it. Easy.
Take ahold of that.
Take ahold of that.
Take her to her dressing room.
All right.
Somebody get a doctor, quick.
Start the band playing, get the clowns out here, and keep things going.
- Right.
- Well, whatever she knew... her mouth's shut now.
Silent witness sometimes speak loudest.
She's still alive but unconscious.
We're taking her to her dressing room.
I don't see how it could've happened.
That rigging is tested before every performance.
Very strange.
Accident most conveniently timed.
- I'll get the doctor's report.
- [Circus]
- Hey, come on, clowns!
- [Clowns Shouting]
Suggest you place very close guard over Miss Normand.
Might meet with another accident.
You're right, Charlie.
I'll see to it.
[Continues]
Observe. Bullet hole in canvas over trapeze.
- Very commendable research.
- Oh, uh-
Have discovered secret of perpetual agitation?
I was only testing the machine, Pop.
Magnifying female charms very ancient optical illusion.
Look, Charlie!
I found this gun under a wagon near the big tent.
Here's the dope. Somebody was afraid
Marie Normand would squawk... about the night of May 30 and tried to finish her off.
- That's exactly what I thought.
- It must've been the Farrell girl... or maybe her brother.
But that doesn't make sense.
This marriage certificate's on the up-and-up.
May examine document, please?
[Lee] They're exactly alike.
That proves it's Kinney's signature.
- Sure.
- Contradiction, please.
Even if name signed one million times... no two signatures ever exactly alike.
Then the Normand girl was right.
It's a fake.
Kinney's name was traced on there from the photo.
- Undoubtedly correct.
- It's a cinch.
Look, Farrell had planned this phony marriage racket.
He turned the ape loose to murder Kinney... and planted the certificate in the safe.
Then when the Normand girl threatened to spoil his game, he tried to knock her off.
- That's enough for me.
- Not always wise... to accept simplest solution.
Mind, like parachute, only function when open.
[Laughs] If I can't make a case out of this,
I'll pin my badge on the ape.
- Mr. Macy, I agree with you.
- Thanks.
- Who is it? What-What happened?
- So sorry.
Unloaded gun always cause most trouble.
- How'd that rifle get here?
- Was reposing against wall.
That's funny. Mr. Gaines never let it out of his stateroom.
Please to return gun.
Much safer in hands of owner.
Gaines's rifle. That takes us right back to the guy we started with.
But he's not gonna talk his way out of it this time.
- We got enough on him now to make a pinch.
- No use to hurry... unless sure of catching right train.
Then what would you advise, Charlie?
Wait for Miss Normand.
She give clue when conscious.
- Is she badly hurt, Doctor?
- There are two compound rib fractures... and a possible spine injury.
I sent for the fluoroscope before I risk moving her.
When do you think she'll regain consciousness?
That's almost impossible to say.
If something doesn't break when she comes to...
I'm gonna pinch the whole show.
[Lou Sobbing]
Excuse, please.
You recall where sister was night of May 30?
No, I don't, Mr. Chan.
I was-
I wasn't with her.
Perhaps she keep book of newspaper clippings?
Why, yes.
May I have permission to examine, please?
Yes. It's in the top tray of her trunk.
- Found something, Pop?
- Telephone police headquarters.
El Paso, Texas.
Get all information concerning this shooting at Ace Casino... also description of killer.
- What's on your mind?
- Have idea for quick solution... of mystery.
Important you return with report as soon as possible.
You can count on me.
Listen, Operator, you gotta get me through.
This is official business.
Clear all wires.
Yes, police headquarters,
El Paso, Texas.
Make it snappy.
And reverse the charges.
Mr. Macy, I can't stand it.
Why don't they do something for my sister?
Everything humanly possible is being done.
- Any change in condition?
- None.
Perhaps we'd better take action.
Each moment's delay increase danger.
I'll make the necessary arrangements immediately.
- [Chattering]
- [Sobbing]
Lou, your sister's condition is quite serious.
An emergency operation is necessary.
We can't move her to a hospital.
It will have to be done here without delay.
Lieutenant Macy, will you send into town for the equipment and assistance?
- Yes.
- [Sobbing Continues]
Don't worry, kid. I'll see that she gets the best of everything.
Drive to the hospital and see that the ambulance... and equipment ordered for Dr. Meade gets here without delay.
One moment, please.
Must ask everyone's cooperation.
Any noise or disturbance during operation may prove fatal.
Please to remain away from tent and be quiet as possible.
Get back to your quarters, folks.
Farrell, you and Blake look after the animals.
Yeah, that's right, Chief.
The Ace Casino, night of May 30.
I want his description.
Yeah. Yeah, I get you.
What? Repeat that, please.
Yes, we've got someone here who answers that exactly.
Don't worry, Chief. This is Mr. Chan Jr., and I'll get your man!
Hey! Hey!
[Ape Growling]
[Growling Continues]
[Banging]
[Growling]
Number one son late.
- Tim?
- [Tim] Aw, stop bothering me.
Do you suppose they'll be much longer with the operation?
- I'm worried.
- Worrying won't get you anywhere.
Why don't you be c-calm like me?
Ouch.
See? You made me cut myself.
I've got a funny feeling that something's going to happen.
Aw, stop acting like a kid.
Why don't you grow up?
[Screams]
The ape!
It's the ape!
- The ape!
- Look at the ape!
[Chattering]
Well, Charlie, your plan didn't work.
Whoever it was got by the guard and released the ape. All right, boys.
Marie!
[Gasps]
- What's happened?
- What's the meaning of this?
Necessary deception to protect life of Miss Normand.
Sister safely taken to hospital much earlier.
Rapid recovery assured.
Suggest you both go there immediately.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chan!
Hey, Pop! Pop!
Pop, I got the information you wanted.
The description of the killer at El Paso fits Holt... and I just caught him letting the ape out.
- I tried to stop him, but he slugged me.
- Holt? Then he's our man.
Cover all roads out of town.
Send out a general broadcast.
One moment, please.
Unnecessary to search further.
Here is killer.
- Holt!
- [Murmuring]
Very clever scheme to establish perfect alibi.
When committing murder, turn ape loose... to give impression real ape guilty of crime.
First, suspected ape was man in disguise... from clue of hairs found on window sill at scene of crime.
Proved to be dead hairs not from living ape.
Second clue: Marks outside window of business wagon.
Real ape would never use barrel.
Would use feet to climb up to window.
And now, report from El Paso complete link in chain.
Mr. Kinney and Holt old friends.
Meet at gambling casino on night of May 30.
This clipping show they use crooked cards.
Were caught cheating.
And in fight that follow,
Holt kill sheriff.
Kinney protect him from police with job in circus as snake charmer.
Later, men quarrel over money won at gambling.
Kinney receive strange messages threatening life.
Send for humble self to discuss matter.
Holt, fearing Kinney would turn him over to police... resort to murder.
Today, when Miss Normand...
reveal knowledge of night of May 30...
Holt, fearing statement would incriminate him as murderer... attempt to remove her also.
First attempt fail.
Suspected he would strike again...
so with aid of Lieutenant Macy, laid trap.
Death write finish to mystery.
Yes, we cleared that up all right, Charlie.
But it doesn't clear you two of forging that phony marriage certificate.
Take them to headquarters.
Charlie, you're a great guy.
Put it there.
- I'll say you are.
- Thank you so much.
- Have a cigar, Mr. Chan?
- No, thank you.
- How about you, Mr. Macy?
- Oh, thanks.
Well, Gaines, I guess you can move the show out tonight, uh, unless Charlie here objects.
No objections.
But Charlie Chan... like sometime to see circus as simple spectator.
I'll attend to that.
You'll have a lifetime pass... to this show for yourself and family.
Now, how many shall I make it out for?
Fourteen or-
Think 14 quite sufficient.
Maybe more later.
What's up?
What's happened?
Somebody is a little drunk.
It's Mr. Harker! He's fallen from the penthouse!
- Harker?
- Is he dead?
- I'll say.
- We better call the police!
Come on, let's pick 'em up and carry 'em inside!
No, don't touch 'em until the police get here!
Calling Car 14.
Calling Car 14.
In 13's district, at 921 Lake Street.
921 Lake Street.
Harker Apartments. Investigate an accident.
That's all.
What are you doing, Wilford?
Reconstructing the accident?
I'm afraid I fell.
Yes, I'm afraid you did.
The next time you do it, see if you can't be a little nearer the edge of the roof.
If he jumped from here, it would land him just about where he fell.
Well, why do you say 'jumped'?
Because I'm an inspector and I can say anything I want to.
- I only thought --
- I know.
I've warned you against thinking.
You think I'm so dumb I haven't considered the possibilities of a murder.
 But I have, Wilford. That's why I'm having so much fun.
Who's the young lady?
If I take her word for it, she was Harker's secretary.
Must be pleasant having such a secretary living on the premises.
I wonder if I could've been wrong about you all this time.
Do you know any reason why Mr. Harker would commit suicide, Ms. Terry?
No. I can't imagine him doing it.
- Now, now I'm --
- Wilfred.
Why don't you go in with the doc? He might need you.
Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, sir.
How long have you been working for Mr. Harker?
Only three weeks.
Not long enough to know much about his affairs, eh?
No.
Did he always have his secretaries live on the premises?
I believe so.
Anyone else live here?
Any servants or housekeepers?
You mean a chaperone?
There's only one maid, Augusta.
She's a little bit dumb, but very respectable, I assure you.
Would you like to meet her?
Just a minute.
Thanks.
Where is your bedroom?
In there.
What time did you go to bed?
About 9:30.
I went to my room earlier than that to read.
I heard Mr. Harker go out about nine o'clock, but I didn't hear him come in.
Do you sleep soundly?
I suppose so.
And you heard nothing? No other disturbance until the shriek?
Not a sound.
Alright. Let's see the maid.
This way.
Listen!
That's in her room!
Augusta! Are you alright?
Yes. No.
I am not. There's a man in my room!
- Where?
- Him!
Oh, he's a police inspector.
Mr. Harker's had an accident.
No!
Was anybody hurt?
He's dead. He fell from the roof garden.
Mr. Harker? Oh, the poor man.
What was he doin' hangin' over the roof garden?
That's what we want to know.
Now, were you here all evening?
Yes, I was.
I meant to go out, but I was reading such an exciting mystery...
... all about a green face that floats up to windows.
Can you imagine that?
I don't know how respectable she is, but you were right about the dumb part.
Outside of green faces, did you see or hear anything?
Now, that's funny. I did.
At least I think I did.
I was asleep when I heard it.
But I was dreaming such an exciting dream,
I wouldn't let myself wake up...
 ... for fear of missing the finish.
You could've stayed for the second show.
What?
Nothing. Let it go.
Well, as I was saying. I heard the noise, but I don't know if it was a real noise...
... or just a noise in the dream.
You see, I can hear dreams as well as see them.
Where's Wilfred?
- Wilfred?
- Yeah, my secretary.
I want him to meet Augusta.
They have so much in common.
What was the noise you may not have heard?
It was a sort of hiss.
Like that.
That settles it. You've got to meet Wilfred.
Gee. You're not at all like Phil O. Dans.
Well, that's alright. You're so much like the maids in the mystery novel...
... that I'm almost convinced that Harker was murdered.
Murdered?
If you're through with me for the moment,
I'd like to go get dressed.
Sure, go ahead. But don't leave the apartment.
Pleasant dreams.
Hello, Inspector Russell speaking.
Who lives in the penthouse across the hall?
 Why, it's vacant, sir.
Oh. Who lives in the apartment directly under this?
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Colby.
Well, give 'em a ring and find out if they heard any disturbance up here tonight.
Call me back.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Jim.
Say, listen, Jim, I...
No, no, I...
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Ted.
- What's the latest?
- Oh, nothin' much.
Gang's still waitin' upstairs.
Why don't you go up?
I'm stuck down here. Chief told me.
Oh.
Say, Eddie, you wouldn't like to make a fin, would ya?
A fin?
This another one of your jokes?
No, on the level.
One of those who's upstairs bet me a ten-spot that there was no eagle on the lieutenant's badge.
Do I collect?
Accordin' to my tag, you do.
Wait'll they see that. I'll give ya five bucks for helpin' me win it.
Too easy.
I'll say it is.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.
Wait a minute.
Who do you think you are?
You must be a new man.
Old enough to know a wise guy like you.
Sorry, Lieutenant. Go right in.
Don't make that mistake again, my good man.
No, sir.
How is it?
Smells alright.
How'd you get in here?
Power of the press.
Well, suppose you just press right out again.
I thought you might need my help.
Not while I have Wilfred.
Beat it.
Alright. You'll be sorry.
- Well?
- No marks of violence.
But it looked like he clutched at something as he went down.
Three of his nails were broken off.
Three of his nails, eh?
Wonder how that happened.
Did you find any evidence of suicide? Any notes?
Nope.
Murder?
Nope. Nobody heard a sound.
Then it must've been an accident.
Yes, I guess it was.
Central 5800.
Morning news? City editor, please.
Mr. Perkins, Pat Morgan.
I don't know enough yet, but you can give it a spread, one of those question things.
'Was Harker murdered?'
Alright, give me your rewrite man.
Hello?
Pat Morgan on the Harker case.
Who?
Stop asking questions and take this down.
I may get stopped any minute.
Okay. Go on.
You can give it a heading in questions.
'Was Harker philanthropist or crook?'
'Who was the mysterious Bee (B - double E) who telephoned Harker's apartment...'
'... two hours before his death and said,
"I've got to see you"?'
'Why was Martini, big underworld boss, a frequent and secret visitor at Harker's apartment?'
Got it. Go on.
'What was the meaning of the serpent card sent to Harker twelve hours before his death?'
I have it, but I'm afraid I can't get it to you tonight.
Describe it.
Picture of coiled serpent in corner of card.
Phonetic spelling of 'hiss' coming from it's mouth.
Letters clipped from newspaper and pasted on card read 'You will hear it'.
Another question. 'Was the hissing sound the maid heard the materialization of the threat of the card?'
And last. 'Was Harker's death accident, suicide, or murder?'
That all?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I thought I told you to get outta here.
I'm goin'.
Hey. Hey, get a load of this, will ya?
Why didn't you send in the dope on that Harker death?
But I did, Mr. Perkins.
I gave it to a rewrite man.
You gave it to The Express!
I placed you on the spot three weeks before the murder happened!
And when it breaks, we're carrying a spread of the European debt situation!
You're fired!
But --
Hello, close out Pat Morgan.
I found it under the rug, ma'am.
Oh, so that's who it was!
Oh, what a dirty trick!
I'll slash his throat!
What a low double-crosser!
I'll get even with him if it takes my last brain cell!
And he knew it'd cost me my job.
I'll get even with him and how I'll get even! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
Is it somebody you don't like, ma'am?
Help! Help!
Lordy!
Help! Help! Lordy, Lordy!
What's the matter? What's the matter?
There's a lady dead!
Who?
Ms. Colby done turned blacker than I is!
I'll see you at the office.
Was she strangled?
Looks like it.
You want to see something interesting?
Come here.
Does that suggest anything to you?
Harker could've fallen from here instead of from the roof garden, couldn't he?
He not only could, but we believe that he did.
That broken pole suggests that someone clutched at the curtain in an effort to save himself.
Now Harker's nails were badly broken.
And there are deep scratches in the paneling there.
 And now we'll talk about you.
You don't mind, do you?
Of course not.
What do you wanna know?
Do you know a reporter by the name of Ted Ryan?
 Yeah, I can see that you don't.
Well, he got a lot of first-hand information in his paper this morning and I can't figure out where he got it.
Unless it was from you.
May I see it?
Well? Did he get it from you?
Alright. Now let's have a little talk.
And then I'll decide whether or not I'm going to lock you up for withholding information from the police.
Yeah, Wilfred is on his way down now, with a picture of Colby.
He's been missing since last night.
Broadcast a description of him.
And tell Brown I want all the hotels checked.
 The steamboats, railroad stations.
Send out a general alarm.
When ya get him, book him for murder.
Alright.
Alright, what's your name?
It's Morgan. Pat Morgan.
I'm a reporter on the morning news.
That is, I was a reporter on the morning news, until Ted Ryan pinched my story last night.
What did they do -- fire you?
What was the idea of posing as Harker's secretary?
What are you after?
Harker. My editor got wind of some connection between Harker and Joe Martini.
He couldn't figure what the town's favorite saint was doing in business with a racketeer.
Were they in business?
I don't know. I know Martini was up here several times.
Always late at night, and always when Harker thought I was asleep.
But as far as getting anything definite on him, I didn't have any luck.
How about the Colby woman?
Her name was Bee, by the way.
It was?
Well, that looks like --
The world's oldest story. That's why we're after the husband.
But what I want to know is about that last phone call of hers.
How did you know about it?
I listened in on the extension.
Oh. What did you hear?
A woman's voice, and she said,
'This is Bee. I've got to see you.'
And Harker said, 'Alright,' and hung up.
Talkative huss, wasn't he?
Has Martini got an apartment here?
How did you get ahold of the serpent card?
Do you think there's anything in it?
I'm asking the questions.
How did you get hold of it?
I snitched it out of his pocket.
Been kind of busy, haven't you?
Did you see him when he got it?
How did he act? Scared?
Puzzled. He tossed it in the wastebasket, and then fished it out.
Studied it for a few minutes, and put it in his pocket.
Where is the card now?
I'll get it.
Did you find another one?
- Yeah.
- Where?
In Mrs. Colby's apartment?
In the wastebasket.
What does it mean?
Oh, it's either a threat, or some fake advertisement.
I'm checking now to see if anyone else in the house got one.
Well, is there anything else you want to tell me?
No. But maybe if I stayed on for a few more days, and went through his papers...
... I might run across something.
And as his secretary, I should help settle his affairs.
Don't you think it's a good idea?
I think it's a good penthouse.
You know, I oughtta lock you up.
If we'd have had this information last night about the Colby woman and her husband...
... we'd have Colby now.
What's the use of expecting a reporter to tell a cop anything?
But I'm not a reporter anymore, and I might run across something.
Don't you think it's a good idea?
I think you're trying to flirt with me.
If I didn't have four kids, and a wife that could lick her weight in wildcats...
... I might like it better.
Go on. Stay here.
But don't get the idea that you're smarter than the police.
And don't hold back anything that you find.
Hello?
I think we have Colby for you.
What do you mean 'think'?
Won't he admit it?
He isn't admitting anything.
He's down at the morgue, on a slab.
What? I'll be right down.
What is it? Where're you going?
Have they found Colby? Oh, let me go with you!
But --
But I'm not a reporter anymore. And you can tell me everything in perfect confidence.
Alright, alright.
Mark!
Hey! Hey, Pat!
Hey, follow that car, will ya?
Hurry up!
Well, I made it.
Hey! Hey!
Well, I'll --
Uh-oh!
 What you all got me down here for?
I ain't goin' in that place!
- Oh, yes you are.
- Oh, yes I ain't.
Can't get me in that place. I done seen one dead body today and that's enough.
It's too much, yes, sir!
We only want you to look at a man.
Dead?
Yeah.
Nothin' doin'!
Who is the man?
Colby.
Mr. Colby dead?
Why, I didn't like that man alive!
So what makes you think I'm goin' to like 'em dead?
Why didn't you like 'em alive?
He didn't talk enough. And it's a sure thing he ain't doin' no talkin' now.
All he did was sit around and look at the walls, starin'. That's what.
 And it ain't good when a man don't talk.
Well, it won't be good for you if ya don't get out of that car now.
It ain't gonna be good for me if I does, so I'm stayin'.
You want me to lock you up?
Where?
In the city jail.
They is alive in jail, ain't they? Alright, sir.
Lock me up with the livin'.
- What's the trouble?
- She won't budge.
I ain't anxious to start no trouble, sir, but I just naturally don't like dead people.
You the janitor?
Yes, sir.
You knew Colby before, didn't you?
Oh, yes, sir.
Alright, that's enough of identification. You can go.
- That a way?
- Right.
Yes, sir!
- Here ya go.
- Okay.
Hey!
Hey, Eddie! Open up, will ya?
Hey, listen. Stick around here, will ya?
I may be goin' right back.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello.
How's the boy?
Hiya, Sam.
What detained you?
I had some business to attend to.
What you mean is you wasted an hour hanging around the police station.
If you'd picked me up, I'd've told you they were headed for the morgue.
Is it the depressing atmosphere of this place or do I imagine that you're angry with me?
I angry with you? What have
I to be angry with you about?
You only pinched my story and made me lose my job.
And what does that matter?
You lost your job?
Yes, I lost my job. I suppose you think that's very funny.
It's probably the funniest thing you ever heard of.
Probably laughed yourself sick over it.
Oh, no, darling, I --
Hey, it's alright to cry in this joint.
But nix on the lovemaking.
Oh, you go to the devil, will ya?
Come on, darling, let's get outta this place.
He hasn't any romance in his soul.
Let's go to a speakeasy.
What's romantic about a speakeasy?
I'm gonna propose to ya again.
And no cracks from you.
The only funny crack I can think of would have to come from her.
Yeah? What's that?
If she said yes.
Funny man.
You know, darling? Eddie's wife got
'em the job here in the morgue.
She thought he'd take the hint and die.
Come on, honey.
Well, do we go straight to the marriage bureau or do I have to do some more talking?
You have to do plenty of talking.
 Okay, we'll go to Joe's.
I'll even take ya in the cab.
375 West 58th.
Couldn't ya sit a little closer?
Not without being arrested.
And speaking of arrest, did you know that the Harker case was all over?
All over?
Yep, all washed up.
What do you mean? What happened at the apartment?
Plenty. Did you see Harker's maid, Augusta, last night?
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Well, believe me, darling, you'd remember her.
You called me 'darling'.
I didn't mean to.
Well, she's something to feast the eyes on.
Or was... She was found murdered this morning.
In Harker's apartment?
No, the janitor's.
Say, are you kidding me?
I? Listen, I'm the one who shouldn't trust you -- not you me.
I'm sorry, darling. Go on.
Well, they found a marriage license in the apartment.
Whose?
The janitor's.
It seems she was married to the janitor, but worked for Harker.
Oh. One of those.
Look here, you worked for Harker, too!
Only on a double-cross.
He only made a couple of passes at me.
He made what?
Why, I'll kill him!
Well, he's already dead.
The janitor killed him.
Killed him, and his wife, and then committed suicide.
They dragged his body out of the East River this morning.
That's what they had down at the morgue.
The janitor's body?
And the maid's, too.
Say, listen, has any of the mob got this story yet?
I don't think so.
Hey, driver. Driver, drive up to that drugstore, will ya?
Ya mind if I phone it in?
- No.
- I'll only be a minute.
- Alright, but hurry.
- I'll hurry.
Driver, drive on.
You don't want to wait?
I don't want to wait!
Driver, drive back to the drugstore.
I figured you might wanna go back.
That's why I made that right turn back there.
You know too much.
I've been drivin' a cab for ten years.
I've seen about all there is to see.
Here you are, miss, and there's your man.
Man? Don't be vulgar.
Where'd you go?
- Listen, Ted --
- What's the matter?
That story I told ya about the maid and the janitor...
Well, what about it?
It isn't the truth. I made it up.
I wanted to get even for last night, so I made it up. There isn't a word of truth in it.
Holy smokes!
Haven't you got a nickel?
No.
I didn't know you'd mind so much.
Mind? I phoned that story into your paper.
- My paper?
- Yeah, I wanted to make up for last night.
Haven't ya got a nickel?
No!
I told your editor what happened last night, and I held the scoop up...
... if he'd give ya your job back.
He said yes, so I gave him the story!
Haven't ya got a nickel?
No!
- Terry?
- Yes?
Come in here. I found somethin' just like in a mystery.
Come on, come on.
 What are you doing?
Oh. Mr. Harker's lawyer said I was to pack up
Mr. Harker's things and clear out the apartment.
But look at those drawers.
Mr. Harker's or the wooden ones?
Oh, Ms. Terry, aren't you the one!
The wooden ones! Do you see any difference in them?
Did they come out of the same chest?
They did, and so I investigated.
And look what I found!
I pressed and pressed all around here.
And finally, sure enough, there it was -- a little place behind there.
- Empty.
- But it wasn't.
There was a letter there.
And it reads like a threat.
And he signed himself 'The Juice'.
What?
Oh, that means the electric chair.
Central 5800.
Morning news? Get me to Files, please.
Hello?
Hello, Willie? This is Pat Morgan.
Would you do me a favor?
Why, yes.
Look in the files and see when and where a man by the name of Denny Fagan was executed.
That's all I have is the name.
What? The chair, yes.
And call me back at Drake 604A.
Thanks. And, Willie, see if it says anything about his relatives.
Particularly a brother, or anyone who visited him on the day of his execution.
That's right. Thanks.
Augusta, will you make yourself scarce?
Scarce?
Scarce. In other words, scram.
What are you going to do, ma'am?
If I wanted you to know, do you think
I'd ask you to leave the room?
Oh. I never thought of that.
Will you send the janitor up here right away, please?
Thanks.
Mr. Martini's apartment, please.
Mr. Martini doesn't answer.
Thank you.
- Janitor, miss.
- Yes, come in.
What's your name?
Peterson.
Well, look. Do you have a passkey to all the apartments?
Yes, ma'am.
For ten dollars, would you let me in an apartment for five minutes?
While you stand guard outside?
- What apartment?
- Joe Martini's.
No, I couldn't think of it, miss.
Not for twenty dollars.
Not even if it helped solve the mystery of Mr. Harker's death?
Mr. Harker's death?
Why, that's solved!
I identified Mr. Colby's body myself.
The police said he did it.
Maybe. But I don't think so.
Come on, nobody'll find it out. I just phoned
Martini's apartment and there was no answer.
Now, all you've got to do is stand guard out in the hall.
And if Martini comes out of the elevator, you whistle, or better still, you could hammer on something.
No, I don't like it, miss. I'd be sure to lose my job.
If I get caught, I'll swear I got in with a skeleton key. Come on!
Well, alright. If you'll keep me out of it.
But I don't like it.
Here you are, miss.
Now you stand by this radiator, and if you hear him coming, you hammer on it.
Alright, miss, but I don't like it.
It'll be alright.
Good afternoon, Mr. Martini.
Hello.
Ms. Terry, in Apartment A.
Just a moment.
Hello?
Oh, so it's you!
Well, I've called every speakeasy in town. Where are you?
I'm at home. What's on your beautiful little mind?
Little mind? Plenty.
Listen, I've just found something.
Did you ever hear of a man by the name of Denny Fagan?
What was that? Did you drop something?
No. Don't say anymore.
I'll be right up.
Thank you.
Blue steel revolver.
Black blackjack.
Pink toothbrush.
Well, what in the world?
I'm spending the night.
 - Here?
- Certainly!
You know, I didn't like that sound over the telephone.
Somebody was listening in.
What's this about Denny Fagan?
Do you remember the case?
Certainly. He was sent to the chair for killing Julius Brigman.
Well, look at this.
- What?
- We found this in Harker's things.
Anything else?
Plenty. Guess whose mob he was in.
I couldn't imagine. Not Mr. Josephus Martini's?
Yes, Mr. Josephus Martini's. I just got the dope on it from the office.
There may be something in it, and then again, no.
Listen, if Colby killed his wife, and then Harker and the case is closed...
Who's interested enough in this apartment to listen in over the phone?
Surely Colby wasn't listening in from the morgue.
Let's hope not!
Help! Help! Help me somebody!
Oh, Ms. Terry, where are you?
Right here. Stop shrieking!
It's only a fuse.
I'll call the janitor.
Oh! There's a man in the room!
I just touched 'em!
He's a friend of mine.
Keep your hands of 'em.
Certainly.
Hello. This is Ms. Terry. Will you send the janitor up right away?
The lights have gone out.
Thank you.
 - There's the ice.
- Thanks, Augusta.
 - Want a lemon?
- Yes, Augusta. Lemon.
You know, come to think of it. This Fagan kid was supposed to be mixed up with Martini.
- Oh!
- That got it, miss.
Oh. I'll see if any of the globes are burned out.
Alright, thanks.
Want some more ice in yours?
She's still lookin' for the lemon.
I'll find it.
Some people would thinks I'm a swell guy.
Oh, you're crazy!
Yeah? Well, that's your idea.
You're only showin' off for my benefit. I can use a gun.
You'd probably shoot me and become a widow before you'd tasted the joys of being married to me.
Good heavens, what a man!
Certainly!
Why don't you shut up and go to bed?
Well, I can't very well go to bed with you hanging around here.
I'm leaving.
And if anything should happen, you stay in here and keep the door locked.
Even if I hear you yelling, 'Pat! Pat! Come save me!'?
Certainly! Oh, go to the devil, will ya?
Don't drink all the scotch!
It's beer.
Come on. Stick 'em up and keep 'em up.
Now, then. Maybe you'll tell me what you're doing in here.
Martini!
Yeah. Old dry Martini himself.
Hey, wait a minute. I'll go with ya.
You stay here.
Don't be silly!
There's a deep cut in the head, but I'm not satisfied.
I want an autopsy.
Alright.
Alright, Martini, talk.
No, you talk!
What was one of your men doin' in my place?
Finding enough evidence to send you up for life.
Yeah, and did he have a search warrant?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Weston was probably trying to serve it on you when you killed him.
You'll have to come stronger than that.
I wasn't even in the apartment when he died.
- How do you know when he died?
- I heard him yell.
They heard 'em yell, too.
I was with them when it happened.
So ya can't pin this on me!
Maybe not. But I can about six gang killings on you and that oughtta be enough.
Take 'em down and lock 'em up.
Who, me?
No, Wilfred. I want 'em locked up. Alright,
Brown, take a couple o' men with you.
Yes, sir. Shall I iron 'em?
You bet! And keep your eye on 'em every minute!
This is gonna cost you your job, Russell.
You shouldn't threaten a police officer. It isn't polite.
Get going!
Go up to the penthouse. I wanna have a little talk with you.
You stay here until I come back.
May I make a suggestion --
No, Wilfred. Make it to the doctor. I'm tired.
I wouldn't stay here another night for all the tea in China.
You're smarter than somebody else I know.
I want you to get outta here in the morning.
You're not only in danger, you're just plain dumb.
When you found this letter, why didn't you bring it --
I was going to.
You were going to?
But first, you thought you'd be smart. You had to go messing around in Martini's apartment.
He didn't see me.
He saw you alright. He thought you got the paper that my man got.
He was here tonight to get it back.
And in being here, he saved his own life.
 What makes you think that?
Brains. And a valentine.
 I can't figure out yet how the mistake was made.
But my man got what was intended for Martini.
We found it in Martini's apartment.
Then I was right. Colby didn't kill them.
 Maybe.
- Mail.
- Oh, thank you.
Good heavens, Augusta!
You look like you're going to a funeral.
I am, ma'am. Mr. Harker's!
Oh.
And they're buryin' Mr. and
Mrs. Colby today, too.
And if I hurry, maybe I can catch them both.
Well, have fun.
Oh, Ms. Terry! How you do say such dreadful things!
Who is it?
Where do you want this?
What's the matter, miss? Did I startle you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
But you told me to bring up the trunks.
Oh, I know. I forgot about them.
You can put them anywhere. It doesn't matter.
I wonder could you come down and pick out yours?
I got Mr. Harker's out, but I don't know yours.
Alright.
But couldn't we go down in the elevator?
Yes, ma'am.
You can't get my trunk up here any too quick to suit me.
I just got a warning that
I was gonna be killed.
You, miss?
Oh, who would wanna kill you?
I wish I knew!
Do you live down here?
Over there.
My, but it's dark!
I'm the janitor.
Where's the trunk room?
There, this way.
Aren't there any lights in here?
I'll go in and turn them on.
Why the gas in the bell?
I was just about to light the incinerator.
Well, that can wait. These gentlemen want you to go with them now.
We want to examine some of the apartments.
Yes, sir.
Start in on this one.
If you don't need me any longer,
I'd like to get back to my work.
Alright, but leave us your passkey.
Yes, sir.
May I make a suggestion?
 - No.
- But you --
I'm busy. Some other time, Wilfred.
What do you want?
Why, I...
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Oh, help! Help!
He's killing 'em, in there!
 Pat, Pat! Here, darling.
You're alright.
He tried to get away.
Hi.
Oh, Doctor, how is Ms. Morgan?
Oh, she'll be alright. Just keep her quiet a couple of days.
 Ted!
Try and keep 'er quiet.
May I come in?
Certainly. Hurry up.
- Has he confessed?
- Yep.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
Well, tell me about it.
Did he kill 'em all?
Yeah. With the exception of Colby.
 How?
With gas. They've just held an autopsy on all the bodies.
I know. Augusta was nearly broken-hearted because they called off all the funerals.
Why did he kill them?
Revenge. You were right, as usual.
He was Denny Fagan's brother. Fagan was a cab driver, just a kid and, according to him, honest.
Fagan was sharing an apartment with one of Martini's men.
 They used Fagan's cab to take
Brigman on his last ride.
They even planted the gun on the kid!
And he was the only one of the mob that didn't have an airtight alibi.
Ah, gee, ya look cute in that bandage.
Please, get on with the murders.
Well, that's all. Denny Fagan was sent to the chair.
That's all? Isn't that enough?
Just a young kid, too.
You're not going to feel sad about it, are you?
I would if his brother hadn't tried to stuff me in a furnace.
Where did Harker come in?
Harker engineered the Brigman killing.
Brigman was in Harker's way, so he ordered him snuffed out.
Martini's mob found it convenient to let Fagan take the rap.
You mind if I hold your hand?
Please, darling, hold my hand.
But why did he kill Bee Colby?
She wasn't mixed up in it.
No. But by killing Harker and her in her apartment, it drew suspicion on the husband.
He even sent Colby a letter telling him to watch her.
But when Colby found out what was going on, he didn't kill them.
He just jumped in the river.
My, but you take this lightly!
What if I'd been killed?
Oh, baby, I'd've written you a swell obituary.
I'll bet you would've, at that.
In some speakeasy!
Don't be silly, gal. You know
I don't go to speakeasies.
I got an idea!
How 'bout a last drink of Harker's scotch?
I've already ordered it. But you might go see if Augusta's drinking it.
Alright.
Is this... Is this Ms. Patricia Morgan?
This is she.
This is Perkins.
Not dear Mr. Perkins.
Cut that!
You wanna come back?
What do you mean 'how much'?
How much more?
We'll discuss that when I see you.
No, we won't, because you aren't going to see her.
What? Who is this?
Ms. Morgan's future husband.
Who says so?
I do.
A woman's place is in the home.
Hey, listen!
What home?
I have an apartment.
I'll bet the rent isn't paid.
Now, don't be mercenary.
Will you listen to me?
I bet you haven't the price of a marriage license.
I wanna talk to you!
- Augusta?
- Yes, sir?
Will you lend me three bucks?
Why, of course, Mr. Ryan.
I'll get it right away.
Certainly I've got three bucks.
Sure.
See here, Morgan! Haven't you any gratitude in your system?
Do you realize what I've done for you for the last three years?
I've kept you on the payroll of this paper!
I've given you more opportunities than any sob sister in the business!
Oh, let's get together on this thing, Morgan.
There ain't any use of us actin' like this.
You know, we've always been able to iron out the little things.
Morgan?
I say, Morgan!
Why don't you answer me?
I'm afraid you're on a wild goose chase, Mr. Chan.
Have sometimes caught wild goose.
Well, if you ask me, there's something fishy about the whole business.
A man walks out on a fortune seven years ago.
Then all of a sudden, he appears from nowhere to claim it.
A little tough on the Colby heirs if he's alive.
- Tough on Allen Colby if dead.
- Yeah.
Ah. They're bringing him up now.
Get back.
Take in on the winch.
All right, swing him aboard.
All right, get him down there.
Body not that of Allen Colby.
- Well, I guess that ends it.
- Not so certain.
Passenger list indicate
30 persons on board.
Twenty-seven rescued by lifeboats.
Two bodies recovered today.
Twenty-seven plus two make 29.
Leave one body missing.
Maybe Allen Colby escape by clinging to wreckage.
Well, if he did, the sharks got him by now.
You can't drift around in these waters for two weeks.
May have been picked up by boat without radio.
Must not overlook any possibility.
Mr. Chan.
- I found this in one of the bunks.
- Thank you so much.
Initials A.C.
Allen Colby.
As soon as you get Duke aboard, get under way!
How soon we make port?
Oh, a couple of hours.
May send radiogram, please?
Sure. They can relay it from the land station.
What do you wanna say?
To Mrs. Henrietta Lowell,
San Francisco.
Fate of Allen Colby still uncertain.
Leaving Honolulu at once on new clipper airship... to continue investigation on mainland.
Sign Charlie Chan, please.
"D."
"E."
"A."
"D." Dead.
There can be no doubt, Baxter.
Allen is dead.
It was a message from his father.
To be perfectly frank, madam...
- this sort of thing makes me quite creepy.
- Oh, nonsense.
A radiogram, Mrs. Lowell.
We haven't finished yet.
Sit down.
Hand me the telephone.
Oh, get off the wire, Alice.
You can talk to Dick some other time.
All right, Mother, in just a second.
Dick, I'll have to go now.
All right.
Now remember, darling... we've got a date tonight if the chief doesn't send me out on a story.
Well, I like that. You think more of your old newspaper than you do me.
Well, Dick, I simply must hang up now.
Mother wants to use the phone.
Of course I do.
Good-bye.
- Call Mr. Phelps's office for me.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What is the wire?
- Another radiogram from Charlie Chan.
- He's arriving sometime today.
- The line's busy, ma'am.
Try again. And remind me to call Professor Bowan.
I want to tell him that we're holding a séance tonight at 8:30.
If you have nothing else to do, take some flowers out to Colby House... and tell Ulrich to have everything ready.
- All right, Mother.
- Do you want Baxter to help you?
No, thanks. I'll shanghai Dick.
Hello, Mr. Phelps?
Just one moment. Mrs. Lowell.
Hello, Warren.
It's your mother.
Yes, Mrs. Lowell.
He's arriving today?
Yes, everything concerning the estate is in order.
I've been going over matters with your son-in-law.
He and Mrs. Gage are here now.
Certainly, I'll tell them to be there.
At 8:30.
Yes, I'll come too. Good-bye.
Was she talking about Allen?
No, Charlie Chan.
He's arriving this afternoon.
He must have definite news about Allen.
Otherwise, he wouldn't be coming all the way from Honolulu.
I don't see why Mother had to drag him into this.
Well, you can hardly blame her for being worried.
If Allen is alive, it places a great responsibility on her.
But from what you've said, it places a great responsibility on all of us.
We'll have to turn the estate over to him and account for every penny we've spent.
Well, after all, it was his father's money.
But Mother was Uncle Bernard's sister.
Regardless of Allen, she should be entitled to something.
Unfortunately not, if Allen is alive.
[Bell Ringing]
[Allen]
Ulrich.!
Ulrich.!
Ulrich!
Ulrich!
[Clock Chimes]
[Clatters]
[Clock Chiming]
- Hello, Alice.
- Hmm. Where were you when I called at the office?
Now wait a minute.
I had to go out on a story.
So I phoned your mother, and she said you were coming here.
- Well, I wanted you to help me with these flowers.
- More spook business tonight?
Oh, please don't kid about it, Dick.
At least not when Mother's around.
I'm always nervous when I come to this old house.
Oh, don't worry. I won't let the old bogeyman get you. I want you myself.
Even if Allen came back and claimed all the money and I was poor?
Say, when I marry,
I don't expect to work for a living.
Aw, go away.
You're just a fortune hunter.
How'd you guess it?
- [Loud Crash]
- Dick, what's that?
Well, it's not a ghost!
- [Meowing]
- [Alice] Oh, it's Lucifer.
Something must have frightened him.
There, Alice. You have the solution to all ghost stories.
Not to all the things that happen in this house.
You know, I don't see why your mother doesn't have this old squirrel's cage torn down.
She's too devout a believer in psychic research.
Why, this place means as much to her as it did to Uncle Bernard.
Yeah, and he was a little cracked.
Oh, don't say that, Dick.
He believed in it.
That's why he rebuilt this house with all these funny rooms.
So the poor spirits could have a home.
Come on. Let's get out of here and go somewheres a little more cheerful.
Not yet. I have to arrange those flowers for tonight's séance.
And you're going to help me.
I very rarely visit the old house, sir, since Mr. Colby died.
It was only because of your late arrival... that Mrs. Lowell told me to bring you here.
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's a pleasure, sir.
I don't mind admitting to you frankly, sir... that I don't feel at all myself in this atmosphere.
- No?
- No, sir.
There's a tinge of the graveyard which positively awes me.
Yes. Mysterious shadows of night cling to old house... like moss on tombstone?
Quite right— Quite right, sir.
That, sir, is the— is the front door.
The—The back door is... at the rear.
Most interesting.
Shall we enter by front door?
Yes. Yes.
This way, sir.
The family will be waiting for you in here, sir.
These are the accounts you spoke of, Mrs. Lowell.
No, not now.
- Mr. Chan.
- Oh. I'm so glad you arrived, Charlie.
I knew I could depend on you.
You know everyone here.
- Good evening, Mr. Chan.
- Greetings at end of journey... like refreshing rain after long drought.
Yes, yes, Mr. Chan, but let's get to your report.
Yes, Charlie.
What about Allen?
Uh—
[Screeches]
Then it's your belief that Allen is still alive?
Cannot be certain but, if so, suspect life may be in danger.
- Now why do you say that?
- Observe.
More than one attempt made on Allen Colby's life.
Just a scheme to create an impression.
This fellow may be an impostor.
Correction, please.
Passport visaed by French and British consuls... indicate he is real Allen Colby.
Then why did he wait all these years before communicating with his family?
Investigation prove Allen Colby... enlisted in French Foreign Legion... was taken prisoner by Riffs.
Escaped only recently.
Could not have communicated sooner.
Unless he was drowned, we can expect him to appear at any time to claim the estate?
[Mrs. Lowell]
He has a right to the money, more than we have.
What is it, Ulrich?
Uh, Professor Bowan and Carlotta are ready to start the séance.
Tell them we'll be there in a moment,
and see that we're not disturbed.
I can't stand that man!
He's forever staring at me.
- Why don't we get rid ofhim?
- We've gone over that before, Janice.
- Shall we go into the other room?
- Perhaps Mr. Chan would rather wait here.
- He may not be interested in a séance.
- I'm sure he will be.
Tonight Professor Bowan has promised us a message concerning Allen.
- I would like to have you present.
- Would appreciate very much.
- Chinese people interested in all things psychic.
- Yes.
Have they started the séance yet, Ulrich?
- They're just about to begin, miss.
- Thanks.
You're always causing me grief.
If we'd been late, Mother would have been furious.
- Is everything ready, Baxter?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Sorry I'm late, Mother.
- All my fault, Mrs. Lowell.
Say, you're Mr. Chan, aren't you?
- Humbly acknowledge name.
- Glad to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Dick Williams of the Globe.
- Anything I can print on the Colby case?
- There's nothing for publication.
I've asked you repeatedly to consider our family affairs confidential.
- Yes, but—
- Mr. Gage very wise.
Best place for skeleton is in family closet.
Thank you.
Nothing to say.
Come, Charlie.
This is Professor Bowan, our adviser in psychic research.
And this is our medium, Carlotta.
So pleased.
Most fortunate gift to be able to cross bridge... to dwelling place of honorable ancestors before arriving.
Shall we begin?
If you'll take your usual seats, we will commence.
Take this chair, Charlie.
- Will that be all right, Professor?
- Quite all right.
Tonight I wish to ask for your special concentration.
We will try to bring word of Allen Colby from the beyond.
It may be difficult.
We shall ask his father,
Bernard Colby...
- who has been our guide before, to assist us.
- [Mouthing Words]
We will pause a moment in meditation.
Mr. Gage, will you turn down the lights?
##[Background: Eerie]
There is a presence here.
He has a message for Mrs. Lowell.
It is her brother, Bernard.
He says that Allen
is there with him.
He is happy.
He wants to come to you.
[Screaming]
- Stop it!
- Lights! Turn on the lights!
Allen Colby... murdered.
Notify police immediately.
Touch nothing...
until police arrive.
- Thanks for your information, Mr. Chan.
- You welcome.
You know, what beats me is how Allen Colby got ashore without our getting wind of it.
Somebody knew it. That's how he trapped Colby here and finished him off.
He must have been trapped, all right.
You know, Allen was the type of fellow who could have defended himself. A knife in the back.
If strength were all, tiger would not fear scorpion.
- Not a sign of fingerprints.
- Oh, he used gloves or a handkerchief.
This fellow was smart enough for that.
Have observed former resting place of murder weapon?
I've already checked that.
No fingerprints there either.
- What did you find, Doctor?
- Knife pierced right ventricle of the heart.
- He's been dead about four hours.
- You want an autopsy?
Oh, no, not necessary.
See you in the morning.
- Oh, Harris, got the rest of them in the other room?
- Yes, sir.
Come along, Mr. Chan.
You too, Williams.
I want to talk to everyone who was present here tonight.
Bowan, you must've been pretty sure
Colby was dead when you started your séance.
That isn't true. We were merely seeking a message concerning him.
Just before this terrible thing happened...
I felt a strange new presence about me.
I knew we were in contact with Allen Colby's spirit.
And with his body hidden behind the panel... it was easy for his spirit to get here, wasn't it?
Pardon interruption, please.
May ask cause of Allen Colby's separation from family?
Oh, certainly, Charlie.
There had been a quarrel... or rather a misunderstanding between Allen and his father.
You see, Allen didn't share our belief in psychic things.
Is this digging into family affairs necessary?
It is when we're looking for facts.
If all I wanted was a motive...
It is when we're looking for facts.
If all I wanted was a motive...
I wouldn't have to go any further than the Lowell family.
What do you mean by that?
Simple enough, isn't it?
Allen Colby alive meant the loss of a fortune for all of you.
So sorry again to interrupt. Uh—
Money from Colby estate used for psychic research?
[Phelps]
As executor of the estate, I can answer that.
Only such sums were used as Mrs. Lowell saw fit to donate.
And that would have ended, too, if Colby had returned?
Yes, I suppose so.
Were you here earlier today?
Why, yes. I stopped by
Ulrich's cottage about 6:00... to remind him to have everything in order for the séance.
You were here at house?
No. I've had a slight cold, and I left almost immediately to take care of it.
- Is that right?
- As far as I know, it is.
Pardon undue curiosity.
- You were here all day?
- That's what I get paid for.
Strange you did not know
Allen Colby had arrived.
I said once— I didn't.
Who else beside Professor Bowan visit here today?
Why, I was here.
- You also?
- What for?
He came here to meet me when I brought the flowers for the séance.
- What time was that?
- Uh, I was here first.
Alice came in at 5:30. I'm sure of the time because I noticed the clock was fast... and I was about to reset it.
Strange.
Ancient clock tell very latest time now.
Someone must have fixed it!
Well, who reset the clock?
You don't think I'm lying, do you?
You arrived at what time, please?
About a quarter past 5:00.
And the murder took place around 5:00.
I can tell you, Morton, there was nothing wrong when I was here.
You and Miss Lowell were planning to get married shortly, weren't you?
Why, yes. What of it?
Congratulations.
- Haven't we had enough of this inquisition?
- For tonight, yes.
But until this matter is settled, be on hand to give the authorities any help they need.
That's all.
Excuse, please.
- Ah, a headache for the police department.
- Yes.
Have you any ideas, Mr. Chan?
Solve mystery, cure headache.
[Chuckles]
Okay, we'll split a box of aspirin.
Oh, Harris.
See you in the morning?
Thank you.
Will bring aspirin.
- Ambulance here?
- They've just arrived, sir.
The men are coming in now.
- Almost finished?
- Yes, last plate.
I guess I'll have to quit. Pretty hard to catch up with murderers these days, Mr. Chan... especially when they don't leave their signatures.
That's what I call fingerprints— signatures.
But when they do leave them,
it's just like signing their confession.
Yes, fingerprints very valuable... if detective can catch owner of fingers.
That's right.
Found anything interesting?
As son Lee would say— play hunch.
- [Mrs. Lowell] Charlie.!
- Excuse, please.
Oh, there you are.
Come along with us.
We'll put you up at the house.
Thank you so much, but with your permission, may spend night here?
- Here?
- Yes.
Would like to make more complete investigation.
Oh, very well. As you wish.
Baxter, prepare one of the bedrooms.
And you had better remain here with Mr. Chan tonight.
- Oh, all— all night, ma'am?
- Certainly!
I'll send something over for your breakfast in the morning, Charlie.
But what about your breakfast, ma'am?
Nobody knows how you like your toast but me.
I know how I like my toast.
Good night, Charlie.
Quiet little place, isn't it, sir?
Yes. Very restful.
Oh, yes, sir.
Like, uh, silence in graveyard.
Oh. Y-Yes, sir.
Like a... graveyard.
This way, sir.
Uh, after you, sir.
Thank you so much.
[Exclaims]
Where'd the— Oh. Hello, sir.
Observe.
Oh, very interesting, sir.
Very, very interesting.
May I inquire what it is, sir?
Corroboration of deductions.
Then we can leave here at once, sir.
Should I pack your bags?
Thank you so much, but, uh... must first request able assistance... in subduing malevolent spirits in ancient house.
Ye—What do you mean, sir?
We investigate downstairs.
N-Now, sir?
Yes.
[Door Opens]
Do you think that could be spirits, sir?
Very practical spirit to enter by door. Come.
That's all. And see that those gates are locked.
Well, here I am.
Why you come back?
You said you were staying here to investigate.
I want to know what's going on.
Uh, others know you return?
I don't tell them everything I do.
- Think advisable
Baxter take you home immediately.
- Hmm!
He's quite right, ma'am.
Now, I think—
You don't think.
You think you think.
I think.
Where should we start?
In here?
Very well.
Perhaps woman's intuition, like feather on arrow— may help flight to truth.
That's settled.
- Baxter, the door.
- Oh.
Well, Charlie?
- May ask question, please?
- Anything you want to.
Phenomenon of music always accompany séance?
Nothing unusual about that.
That was merely a manifestation from the world beyond.
Electric fixtures repaired recently?
No. They haven't been touched for years.
- May step on table, please?
- Certainly, Charlie.
Very strange.
Brass tarnished with age... but screw head very young.
Boy Scout knife like lady's hairpin— have many uses.
Radio speaker.
Very simple solution of music from world beyond.
I can't believe that Professor Bowan and Carlotta... would purposely deceive us.
Necessity— mother of invention... but sometimes stepmother of deception.
Distinguished professor stand here tonight.
- Switch turn on radio receiving set up there.
- ##[Eerie]
If Bowan has done this... then all of our séances have been based on trickery.
When pilot unreliable... ship cannot keep true course.
- Permission, please, to try experiment?
- Certainly.
Turn down lights, please.
But... then we shan't be able to see, sir.
[Mrs. Lowell]
Do as Mr. Chan says.
- They're off, sir.
- Thank you so much.
Please to turn on dim light, as in séance.
Appearance of Allen Colby in secret panel most convenient.
Maybe find clue.
Please.
Would be so kind to take position... occupied by deceased body?
Oh, c-could I be excused, please, sir?
I-I'm not very good at that sort of thing.
Role of dead man require very little acting.
Oh, but really, sir, l—
[Mrs. Lowell]
Go on, Baxter. Go on.
May request, uh... holding handkerchief before face... when in position?
Charlie, look!
There, on the handkerchief!
Earlier in evening, use same handkerchief to wipe face of Allen Colby.
- Oh, now, really, sir, l—
- [Mrs. Lowell] Be quiet, Baxter.!
What about the handkerchief?
Chemical analysis of same... prove face of murdered man... treated with solution of quinine sulfate.
- For what reason?
- Quinine sulfate... when exposed to rays of ultraviolet lamp... produce mysterious light which accompany apparition.
Well, where could it come from?
Answer well hidden, but hope to find same.
Please! Do not move handkerchief.
Ultraviolet-ray lamp.
Filter on back of mirror... allow only invisible ultraviolet rays to enter room.
- Solves mystery of spirit light.
- It solves more than that.
It proves that Bowan knew that Allen was dead.
He may even have murdered him.
Finding web of spider does not prove
which spider spin web.
I gave Bowan all the funds he asked for.
I even made provision for him and Carlotta after my death.
And they knew that if Allen returned,
they would never receive another penny.
In face of present evidence... may be wise to change plans for future.
Huh! I'll see to that.
Mr. Phelps has an accounting of the estate prepared.
I intend to go over it.
And at the same time,
I'll make a new will.
Most excellent precaution.
[Baxter Yelping]
- You are all right?
- Except for the punch in the ribs you gave me.
- Why, you knocked me down.
- Most happy.
Punch in ribs more desirable than shot in back.
There's no argument about that.
Where's Baxter? Baxter.
- Here I am, ma'am.
- Well, you would be.
Well, what do we do next?
Suggest leaving here immediately.
That's a very good idea, sir.
We're—We're locked in, sir.
Locked in? Nonsense.
[Doorknob Rattles]
[Whispering]
Can you hear that, sir?
[Key Turning In Lock]
- Oh! Fred, it's you.
- What's happened?
Somebody tried to kill Charlie.
What?
I think you acted very foolishly in coming here at this hour of the night.
Fear for Mrs. Lowell's safety reason for visit?
Exactly. Janice and I went to her bedroom to say good night.
When I found she wasn't there,
I had a hunch she was over here with you.
I saw her car outside and came in.
Thank you.
Suggest you go home now—
Uh, with Baxter.
Have something very important.
Would like your able assistance.
Of course, if there's anything I can do.
- Now, look here, Charlie. I want to know—
- Tomorrow, please.
- You go home now.
- Oh, very well.
- Come on, Baxter.
- Thank you.
- Observe anyone leaving house when entering grounds?
- Not a soul.
- Ulrich admit you?
- No. The gates were unlocked.
Strange.
Someone very familiar with ancient house... fire gun from there.
I know this place inside and out.
It's a regular honeycomb of passages... that start everywhere and end nowhere.
- You want me to show you?
- No.
Will investigate honeycomb later.
Maybe find bee.
Shall we go?
At present, much concerned about Mrs. Lowell.
What do you mean?
Not so certain gunfire directed at humble self.
You think the attempt was made on her life?
Maybe. Suggest you go to police at once.
Request guard for Mrs. Lowell day and night.
I'll go immediately.
Caretaker keep very late hours.
Ulrich's a queer old bird.
Have noticed Ulrich not friendly to family.
May ask reason why?
Oh, Allen was engaged to Ulrich's daughter.
After he left home, he broke with her, and she committed suicide.
Ulrich held Allen responsible.
Strange house have more than one skeleton in closet.
[Bell Ringing]
[Key Turns In Lock]
- Good morning.
- [Muttering] Good day.
May ask question, please?
You were here yesterday at cottage about 5:00?
Yes.
Then if Allen Colby ring bell, would have heard same?
Well, uh, I didn't hear him.
Strange someone should climb over wall... without first trying bell.
If someone were sneaking in here to commit murder... do you think they'd ring the bell to let me know about it?
Correction, please.
Murderer would not climb over wall near gate.
Would look for more secret place.
Thank you so much.
[Hammering]
What do you want?
Pardon intrusion, please.
Observe radio aerial on roof.
Well?
Perhaps earphones reason for not hearing bell yesterday... when Allen Colby arrive.
I tell you I didn't hear the bell.
I don't know where I was or what I was doing.
Radio transmitter... used last night to broadcast music for séance?
You're barking up the wrong tree.
I don't know nothing about radio.
This stuff belongs to my son.
I'm shipping it to him.
You can't catch me on that.
Only thing Charlie Chan catch is cold in head.
[Sneezing]
[Sniffling]
Uh, can spare quinine, please?
I haven't got any.
Perhaps give to Professor Bowan who suffer from cold... when visiting here yesterday.
Why don't you go and ask him?
Very good idea.
Thank you so much.
So sorry professor not at home.
Hope to get valuable information about séance last night.
- Can I help you?
- Thank you.
Small point of information.
When in contact with spirit world... find ultraviolet light useful?
I don't understand you.
Very peculiar circumstance.
Allen Colby's face treated with solution of quinine.
When exposed to ultraviolet light...
produce glow not from spirit world.
If what you say is true, Mr. Chan... it has nothing to do with us.
There has never been any fraud connected with my work.
The power which was given me to communicate with the other world... has never been misused.
Have utmost respect for true believer in psychic things.
But can explain, please... source of music which accompany séance last night?
Yes. I'll show you.
It was sent from this transmitting set.
We always use music as a background for our work.
Hmm. Most interesting.
Repeating device... with control switch at Colby House...
so music can be picked up
at any time?
Shortwave coil.
[Groans]
That ought to keep him quiet long enough for us to make a getaway.
Then it's true.
You knew about Allen Colby.
There's no time to talk now. If Chan was that close on us, the police won't be far behind.
- Come on!
- I'm not going. I was no part of it.
- But you can't prove that to the police.
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
- Where's Bowan?
- You'd better go in there at once.
- Charlie.
- What happened?
Get a chair.
Are you all right?
Uh, when firecrackers stop exploding in head, will be quite all right.
You need the aspirin this time, Charlie.
Now, where's Bowan?
He left just before you came in.
That's why you sent us in here.
You were covering up for him to make a getaway.
- You're under arrest. Take her out, Harris.
- Let's go, sister.
Get on the phone and send out a general broadcast.
Yes, sir.
I want to be the first to congratulate you, Charlie.
You let the murderer of Allen Colby slip right through your fingers.
So sorry. Like child who play with matches, get burned.
- Live and learn.
- Yeah, live and learn.
When we pick up Bowan,
I'll send you an invitation to the blow-off.
Thank you so much.
I guess Morton's right. It must have been
Bowan who killed Colby... and tried to get Mrs. Lowell last night.
Wheel of fate has many spokes.
Which means you have something on your mind. What is it?
Mind at present like hangover after misspent evening.
Must keep important engagement with Mrs. Lowell.
Hat, please.
"And the sum of $100,000...
"to endow the Colby Foundation for Psychic Research...
"such foundation to be administered by Warren T. Phelps... on behalf of my dearly beloved friends
Alfred and Carlotta Bowan."
That is the clause you want to strike from the will?
- It certainly is.
- Then I'll draw up a new document.
I'll have it ready for your signature tonight.
Have you any idea how much these people have cost me so far?
I'll have to check over your accounts to get the exact amount.
We're going over
all the accounts tonight... when Mr. Phelps brings the new will.
When Mr. Phelps brings the new will.
- Ulrich wants to see you, madam.
- What is it, Ulrich?
- I've come to quit.
- That will be a relief.
And it'll be a relief to me too!
I don't have to stay here
to be spied on by policemen.
I don't know anything about Allen Colby!
It's his fault that my girl is in her grave... and he got what was coming to him.
That's enough!
Wait in the hall, and I'll pay you off.
- [Sighs]
- [Door Closes]
In my opinion, it would be better to watch Ulrich than look for Bowan.
He's hated Allen enough to kill him.
No one being overlooked.
When weaving nets, all threads counted.
- I'll be back with the new will after dinner.
- Make it 8:30.
I'll have those figures ready for you by then.
And don't worry. Mr. Morton will have a police guard here until Bowan is captured.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Good-bye, dear.
Well, Charlie, what are your plans?
- Uh, what hour is dinner, please?
And after dinner, what is usual occupation?
Generally, I spend an hour here at the Ouija board.
I must repeat, madam, that— that this sort of thing... leaves me a— a little creepy.
- Not much chance of anything happening.
Even one of Bowan's spooks couldn't get through this police net.
Unknown danger like summer lightning— strike where least expected.
I'll have another look around.
Just a minute.
- All right, Myers. Mr. Gage is one of the family.
- Thanks.
- Picked up Bowan yet?
- No, but we'll get him.
He hasn't a chance of getting out of town.
[Doorbell Rings]
Excuse me, madam.
- Good evening, sir.
- Has Mr. Phelps arrived yet?
Not yet, sir.
[Bell Tolling In Distance]
[Bullet Whistles]
Search the neighborhood.
What's the matter here?
Mrs. Lowell was shot through the head from outside the house.
- What?
- Must request no one enter except police at present.
- Yes, but you can't stop me.
- Better stay here. You wouldn't like to see it.
[Knocking]
- Find anything?
- Not yet. But this gentleman just drove up.
Dick has told me.
It— It seems unbelievable.
Whoever it was outguessed us.
I don't see how it was done with the place surrounded by police.
- Also strange murder should occur...
- [Phone Dialing]
At exact hour of appointment.
Hello. Morton speaking from the Lowell house.
Send out the homicide squad and the coroner.
You'll want to hold the body till after the inquest of course.
What's happened?
Was it Mother?
- Let me go to her!
- Can do nothing now.
Why did you let it happen?
You knew she was in danger.
It's all your fault!
- [Sobbing]
- Alice, please.
Better take the young lady away from the house for the night.
We'll have a lot to do here.
Come along, Harris.
Mr. Chan, I can't help but feel that Alice is right in holding you responsible.
You proved that Bowan was guilty of the murder of Allen Colby.
You knew he made an attempt on Mrs. Lowell's life last night... yet you failed to turn him over to the police.
Most humbly regret very fatal error... which cost life of dear old friend.
Mr. Chan.
I'm sorry I lost my head.
I know you did the best you could.
Extend deepest sympathy.
But though loved one seem to be taken away... remain always near.
[Crying]
- Mr. Baxter.
- Yes, sir?
[Yelps]
So sorry, but need your help.
What do you make of this?
Someone's been smoking, sir.
Oh. The villain must have stood right here when he fired that fatal shot.
No. Hasty deduction like ancient egg— look good from outside.
Shot come from high-powered rifle fired from distant place.
Really, sir?
May ask, please, to climb tree?
Oh, must I, sir?
Ample proportions limit athletic ability.
Ye—Yes, sir.
Will you give me a leg up, sir?
[Straining]
When I was young, l—
I used to be quite agile, sir.
Well, there—There's not very much to be seen from up here, sir.
Observe small branch near right hand?
Oh. Oh, yes, sir.
Break is clean cut?
Might have been done with a saw, sir.
Thank you so much.
Please hold finger on branch.
Oh!
Ahh!
Please remove body from line of vision.
Well, uh—Well, it— Oh!
Oh.
[Yelps]
Oh, Mr. Chan! Mr. —
Hey! Ohh! Ow!
[Doorbell Rings]
- Good morning.
- You're on the job early, Mr. Chan. Find anything?
- Hope to establish important fact.
- Let me in on it.
- Must first exact promise of silence.
- I promise.
As son Lee would say,
"Okeydoke." Let us go.
Well, what led you to this, Mr. Chan?
At last, find use for simple geometry.
High-power bullet take shortest distance... between three points.
Criminal very clever.
Arrange device so when electric hammer strike bell...
also operate trigger on rifle.
And after the first shot was fired, it kept pulling the trigger.
- Yes.
- Be careful. You've reloaded the chamber.
How you know magazine was full?
Well, l— I thought it might be.
- Quite right.
- But that's dangerous.
- When the clock strikes again—
- Do not disturb.
Twenty minutes after 9:00.
Suggest we return to Lowell house immediately.
She was sitting right there when the shot came through the window.
- Pardon interruption, please.
- Oh, come right in.
- Got into any new trouble?
- So sorry to disappoint.
May offer slight demonstration, please?
Help yourself.
What's it going to be— interior decorating?
[Scoffs]
Why don't you try a couple of sunflowers in it?
Atrocious libel on Chinese art quite sufficient.
Have only little time to wait.
Please to stand back.
- [Bell Tolling]
- Stand back!
- [Bullet Whistles]
- [Gasps]
- Are you all right, Baxter?
- I don't know, sir.
[Sighs]
You win, Charlie. What's the answer?
If tongue in tower bell could speak, would have solution.
- What does that mean in English?
- Suggest we take short walk.
[Ringing]
Hello? Hello?
It-It's your office, sir.
Hello. Morton talking.
Be there right away.
Well, they've caught Bowan.
Instead of your short walk, how about a short ride to my office?
Voice of professor may tell us more than tongue of silent bell.
I didn't do it, I tell you. Whoever killed
Allen Colby tried to hang it on me.
And I suppose you didn't plant that trick light... and wash Allen Colby's face with quinine... so you could pull a phony ghost at your séance.
- Have you anything to say?
- Leave her alone. She had nothing to do with it.
Well, how about it?
You can save yourself a lot of grief by turning state's evidence.
I have nothing to confess.
I have always acted in good faith.
[Sighs]
That's all for now.
Take 'em out.
Four hours wasted... but I'll get it out of'em if it's the last thing I do.
- Have idea.
- Another one?
With proper lever... baby's fingers can move mountain.
What do you mean?
Believe have plan... to secure much-desired confession.
I don't see why we should have been called here for this morbid nonsense.
There's no use complaining about it.
[Muttering]
Why, you got no right to bring me into this.
Yes? Well, you're here, brother.
All right, Harris.
Come on inside.
- All set, Charlie.
- Thank you.
Please.
Request everyone take same positions... as on night of eventful séance.
Oh, Harris. Stand by the door.
Have men in the hall.
- Be sure the outside of the house is covered.
- Yes, sir.
Pardon, please, inconvenience... of bringing everyone here tonight.
Motive for recent murders... like tangle of many strings... ends of which held by persons in this room.
First string held by psychic mediums.
Professor Bowan and Carlotta...
had $ 100,000 endowment
to lose by change in will.
Had $ 100,000 endowment
to lose by change in will.
Same change deprive Mr. Phelps, administrator of estate...
from handling large fortune.
Have ascertained... he had recently big losses in stock market.
Caretaker Ulrich have old-time grudge...
against Allen Colby
for tragedy to daughter.
Other strings held by Lowell family...
who have everything to lose
if Allen Colby return to claim estate.
Tonight, will try very sincere experiment... in effort to untangle motives.
Will call upon spirit world...
for message from great beyond.
Proceed, please.
Mr. Gage, will you turn down the lights?
[Switch Clicks]
##[Eerie]
We will pause a moment in meditation.
I feel... a presence... near.
It is a woman.
She is trying to come to us.
Her image is becoming clearer.
- [Mouthing Word]
- Clearer.
She is trying to speak.
She has a message...
- a message for—
- Mother!
I have come back... to tell you the truth.
I know now...
the one who fears discovery...
the one who murdered—
- [All Shouting]
- [Phelps] Turn on the lights.!
- [Morton] See that no one leaves this room.
Someone make very foolish mistake.
Throw knife at spirit reflection in mirror.
May come out now.
- Mrs. Lowell!
- Mother!
- Mother, darling!
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- Yes, dear.
You have to die to really find out how much people miss you.
- But why did you do this?
- I'll let Charlie explain that, dear.
Sincerely hope explanation will justify cause of anguish.
Person who throw this knife... also kill Allen Colby when he return to claim estate... place body behind secret panel.
Then use ultraviolet-ray device... to make body appear as apparition at séance.
Same murderer also try to kill Mrs. Lowell... on night of business conference...
but make mistake
of shooting dummy... which humble self and Mr. Morton place at study window.
Same murderer now in this room.
Use twin of knife that kill Allen Colby.
Observe.
Both knives now missing.
As I stood up right here, someone passed me in the dark.
I heard someone too.
It was you, Ulrich.
It wasn't!
I-I was over there near Mr. Morton.
- You went for that knife.
- I didn't, I tell you!
- Liar! I saw you!
- I didn't!
- Moment, please!
- You are guilty man.
- I? You're crazy.
Contradiction, please.
Took precaution before séance tonight... to cover blade of knife with graphite.
Telltale fingers sign confession.
Stand back! Everybody!
Stay where you are.!
- [Cat Screeching]
- [Baxter Yelping]
[Women Screaming]
[Yelping]
You commit murder in attempt... to cover evidence of forgery in Lowell accounts.
- Own act tonight convict you.
- All right, Harris.
Come on.
There, there, dear.
I know you had nothing to do with it.
Very grateful for valuable assistance.
Believe that, tonight, you practice deception for first time.
I wish I could say the same for you, Bowan.
After all, I'm the one who was imposed upon... and I withdraw all charges against them.
We'll mark it closed, Mrs. Lowell.
- Thank you.
- There's a train east at 11:45.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
You take now.
Oh, Charlie, I think you've earned a rest.
Now we can settle down to a comfortable visit.
So sorry, but, uh... must return to happy family in Honolulu.
You've done a great job, Charlie.
Heh. I wish I could make you a present of the city hall.
If family continue to increase, may consider generous offer.
[All Chuckling]
Thank you so much.
Halford-Mander
Investment Company.
Mr. Halford?
Who's calling, please?
Just a minute.
But why didn't you tell me that Mr. Mander drew that much cash?
He said he would tell you about it.
Come in.
Well, Mr. Halford, Miss...
The phone, please.
Yes, alright.
Tell Mr. Mander
I want to see him right away.
Yes, sir.
Hello. Yes.
Now, listen, I told you not to waste your time trying to see me.
We're through.
Now, just a moment, sister.
You knew it was only a game and that's the way we played it.
No squawks when it's over.
Oh, oh, cut the hysterics.
I can't help what you've sacrificed.
Besides, you can always go back--
What? Your money?
Well, you had me invest it for you and we lost.
Can I help that?
Oh, go ahead,
I don't care what you do just so long as you leave me alone.
Well, J.S.
- You want to see me?
- Yes.
What about this withdrawal of $20,000?
Oh, that?
We have a deal on with Burnes.
"We have a deal on with Burnes."
What do you mean?
Some bonds.
Got 'em for ten percent.
You mean, they're hot?
Well, they'll cool off in a few weeks.
Now, listen to me, Henry.
You know that six months ago we were investigated and almost exposed.
We made the front page of every big daily in the country.
- Didn't we?
- Yes, that made us famous.
- What of it?
- Just this.
I don't mind trimming a sucker but it's too risky to take a chance with the government.
I don't like penitentiaries.
- I'll risk it.
- Well, I won't.
You seem to forget we're partners.
You mean, we had been until now but this time you've gone too far.
What's the matter?
- Getting honest or yellow?
- Neither one.
But I'm not gonna let you put me on the spot.
Now, get this.
You take those bonds back to Burnes and get that dough.
And if I don't?
I'll put you where you belong.
You mean, you'd haul a copper?
You know what I mean.
Get me Mr. Burnes, please.
Quickly.
Woman overboard!
- Save her, somebody.
- Grab her.
Good evening, Mr. Halford.
Good evening. Anything new?
Oh, just another dame jumped off a ferry boat.
Getting to be a fad, isn't it?
Seems so.
- Good evening, Mr. Halford.
- Good evening.
- Who's the duke?
- Oh, that's Spencer Halford.
A slick businessman.
When I say slick, I mean slick.
Ah, gee, I could shoot.
Yeah, but this shootin' gallery's for men.
Yeah? Well, what are you doing here for?
Hey, go on.
Go on or I'll call the cops.
Aw, call them.
Ah, right into the bull's-eye.
That means a cigar.
- Here you are. Another shot?
- Thank you.
No, thanks. One cigar's enough.
Hey, come here.
You have a message for me, haven't you?
- A message for you?
- Yeah.
I'm Mr. Jones. I'm Mr. Jones.
- No, I ain't got no message.
- Strange.
You're Rafferty, aren't you?
Yeah, Peter J. Rafferty.
But I ain't got no message.
I can't understand that.
If I should get it, where will I find you at?
I'm right across...
Uh, never mind.
I'll be back later. Goodbye.
Hey, here. What's happened?
- Why, he must have fainted.
- Fainted?
With a bullet hole in his head?
- He's dead!
- Dead?
- Oh, Mr. Mander.
- Yes?
I thought you'd gone for the day.
No, I, uh...
Have any messages come in for me since I went out?
No, sir.
Halford-Mander
Investment Company.
Just a minute. It's for you.
- Shall I wait?
- No, that's all.
- Goodnight, Ms. Hopper.
- Goodnight.
Hello.
Yes, this is Mander. What?
I was in the shooting gallery, but I didn't get any message.
I gave it to Halford.
You'll get yours later.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Sure.
The Press room, police headquarters.
Oh, hello, Josephine.
Calling car 321. Car 3-2-1.
Go to 9-7, please.
A dressmaker says a big dog is tramping over her pansies.
- Dogs will be dogs.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Joe.
Well, Marino goes to the electric chair Friday.
Yeah, I got passes but our sports editor wants them.
Says he'll trade me a pair to the Cometta-Spitzky fight.
It's a killing however you look at it.
Are you going up, Shorty?
Yes, if Steve Grey doesn't want the assignment.
Say, stooge, when are you gonna get some identity of your own?
Homicide.
Well, it looks like a murder, huh?
- There's been a murder, boys.
- Well, keep it to yourself.
- We're busy.
- What?
- James Spencer Halford?
- What's he got to do with it?
Everything. It was him who was bumped off.
No. I knew somebody would drop that guy.
- That's a start.
- Where was it?
Region Apartments, they found him in his car with a bullet hole in his head.
- Oh, boy.
- That's a hell of a...
J.S. Halford murder, the chauffer opened the door of the car in front of the Region Apartments.
- And the body dropped out.
- Yeah.
And put in proof that
Halford was an eminent crook.
The murderer was an excellent marksman. He used one bullet.
He was riddled in the upper part of his body by machine gun slugs he's said to have been involved with several women.
- Call you back.
- Waiting for you, captain.
Well, do you have any idea who killed Halford?
Who was it?
The man who fired the shot.
Boy, that's what I call fast thinking.
Hello, hello.
Can't you get the desk?
Still busy?
Well, gimme, gimme Robins.
Hello, Robins speaking. Yeah.
Just a minute, Shorty. Go ahead.
J. Spencer Halford was murdered shortly after 6:00.
- What? Spencer Halford, eh?
- Yup.
The chauffeur drove up to the Region Apartments and the doorman discovered that Halford was very fatally, uh, dead.
Alright, but hold on to Cole now until I get Steve on the job.
I'll give you a rewrite.
Give a rewrite.
Spencer Halford has just been murdered.
Send Steve down to Central
Street Station immediately.
He hasn't been here all day.
What? Is he boiled again?
Why is it genius always has to be either pickled or drunk?
Well, do the best you can.
Make it a three-column spread.
Say there's a woman, um...
There's bound to be one anyway.
Put something in about anxious investors rumors of impending bankruptcy.
Yeah, they've been shaky for some time.
- Okay.
- And find Steve Grey for me.
Meltzer.
After all,
I'm just a city editor and a mediocre one at that but I'd rather try to solve this murder single-handed than to find Steve Grey when he's on a binge.
Why, he's liable to be sleeping it off on the bed of the East River.
Where did you find him the last time he disappeared?
In an elevator that he stole in the Chrysler Building.
- Where was he takin' it?
- Up and down, up and down.
And he was doin' a rumba with the starlet's castanets.
Well, send the boys out to find him and tell them not to come back until they do!
Okay.
Maybe Mary Shannon knows where Steve is.
What does she see in that dipsomaniac?
Here's one for your question and answer department, Mary.
Where's Steve Grey?
Oh, I haven't the faintest idea.
Isn't he supposed to be your boyfriend?
Not quite, if he were my boyfriend
I'd make it my business to know where he was.
Yeah, probably, out with a dame somewhere.
Oh, I don't think so.
Steve doesn't pay much attention to women.
Well, he's got to be found.
Hello, police headquarters?
Yeah, get me the chief.
Tell him Mr. Robins wants to speak to him.
This Halford murder is made to order for Steve.
- Halford murder?
- Yeah, business racketeer.
Maybe Steve's father knows where he is.
Go on down to the press room and ask him. Will you, Mary?
Alright, Mr. Robins.
And tell him, if he doesn't show up today he's through.
Oh, hello, Joe.
Say, this is Hal...
Ask your boys to do something for me, will ya?
Try and locate Steve Grey.
Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Sweeney.
- Have you seen Steve Grey?
Not for a couple of days, but he had enough to last him that long when he left here.
If he comes around, tell him to get in touch with the paper.
- They want him down there.
- Okay, I'll do that.
Has Steve Grey been in this morning?
No, he hasn't.
But, he was here last night and he had four cups of coffee.
- Was he, was he sober?
- I think so.
Why, is anything the matter?
If he was sober, there must be something the matter.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Hey, has Steve Grey been in here?
No, too early for Steve.
Yeah, but it's not too late.
I've been huntin' for that guy all night.
- Hasn't been in here. Okay.
- Okay, thanks.
That guy's got me on a merry-go-round.
- What's he doin' here?
- Sleeping.
He staggered in here about 12 o'clock last night.
Bought a whole roll of tickets and told me not to disturb him.
- I don't know who he is.
- I do.
Hey, Grey. Wake up. Wake up!
The whole force is lookin' for you.
- Where's the rest of them?
- Your boss wants ya.
Some big racketeer named Halford was murdered last night.
So, that's it, huh?
Alright.
Thanks. Here.
Take a ride for yourself.
- Who is he?
- Steve Grey.
He writes all the murders for "The Daily Star."
The one they call
The Murder Man?
Yeah, that's him.
Oh, Mr. Grey?
Mr. Robins wants to see you.
- Thanks.
- Hello, Steve.
- The old man wants to see you.
- So I heard.
Hello, Steve. Call this number, very important.
- Thanks.
- Hi, Grey, had a nice vacation?
Why?
- Hi, Mary.
- Oh, Steve.
We were beginning to think you'd gone to the South Pole with the birds.
No, I couldn't get reservations.
You still love me as much as ever?
Oh, I'm crazy about you.
Well, you better be because I'm dappy about you.
- You know that, don't you?
- Yeah. I know you're dappy.
Alright, but not about me.
Where were you last night?
I went for a long ride.
May I have a little of your coffee?
If you don't mind drinking out of my cup.
I prefer it.
As a matter of fact, I didn't know what time it was myself till I woke up on a merry-go-round.
It all sounds pretty dumb to me.
Ah. Yeah, it sounds dumb to me, too.
Don't you think you ought to go in and see Mr. Robins?
What for? He'll be out here to see me in a minute.
He's afraid somebody will beat you on the Halford story.
- Who's on it now?
- Shorty.
Shorty, huh?
He won't miss anything.
How long have you had this coffee, Mary?
- Well, of all the double--
- Hi, Hal.
Did the wanderlust get you?
Schooner in the offing and all that sort of bunk.
- Why, anything new?
- New?
Spencer Halford, one of our most important financiers was murdered last night at 6 o'clock.
Yeah, I read something about it in "The Globe."
Alright, alright.
Cut the kidding.
Now, you've got half of the front page waiting for you.
Now, get on this story and stick to it until you get something.
- I got an angle now.
- You mean...
- You've been workin' on it?
- No, no.
But I just got a sort of an idea when I was passing
Halford's office.
I'll knock it out for you before I leave.
Yeah, fine. But, remember, while you're sitting here writing your ideas, so-called the rest of the boys are downtown getting the facts.
Don't you worry, they won't beat me on this story.
Well, they haven't yet.
I'll say that much for ya.
Say, you're a crazy, cynical, drunken bum but as a news-getter, you're there.
Thanks, Hal.
You want some marmalade?
Are you working for "The Star?"
You bet your life
I'm working for "The Star."
Believe me, it's a good thing I am with the kind of editors we got.
Why do you bother with that nut, Mary?
What gives you the idea
I am bothering?
Oh, I have a nose for that sort of thing.
Is it true that you write all wind chill stuff for him?
All the evidence seems to point to the murder being a carefully concealed crime by some defrauded investor.
Did they find Steve?
He just wandered in a few minutes ago by himself.
- How is he?
- Sober and sassy.
- Don't worry, Pop.
- Is he in his office?
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Mary.
Captain Cole of the Homicide Squad promises to have the mystery all solved within a few hours.
Now, there's your story,
Meltzer, you son of a gun.
If you butcher this one on me,
I wanna kick a hole right in your torso.
Hello, Pop.
- Yes?
- Send a boy in, will ya?
- Well, son, are you alright?
- Yeah, sure, I'm alright.
Haven't been stealing anymore elevators?
No, no, no, no, no.
Well, I was just wondering, you know?
You seem to be going around in circles lately.
Yeah, yeah,
I guess you're right, Pop.
I spent last night on a merry-go-round.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I just can't sleep. That's all.
- Just wanted to walk and think.
- And drink.
Yeah. Yeah, a little.
- A little too much, I'd say.
- You didn't wait up for me.
- Did ya?
- Oh, no, no.
I turned in at four o'clock.
Pop, what's the matter with ya?
Haven't I always taught you to go to bed early?
- Yeah?
- 'Where is the Halford copy?'
Steve? Shorty said he thinks
Cole's hit a clue.
Well, if he has, it'll be his first one.
Okay, Robo-boy, get goin'.
Then go trail Cole.
What do you mean, "Get goin'?"
The story's finished.
I'm givin' it to the boy now.
Take this.
Steve, this Halford murder case you're on who do you think did it?
Oh, I don't know.
One of the guys he robbed,
I suppose.
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought.
Yeah, well, you wanna quit thinkin' about murder cases.
Better figure those or you'll go nutty.
Meet me over at Pizza Bar at noon, will you?
- We'll have lunch together.
- Sure.
And quit worryin'.
What's the matter?
You'll be an old man before I am.
I'm not worried...
Hey, listen!
I put nine years of my savings in this company and if anybody tries to holdout on me, I'll wreck the--
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
...your money's at stake, you got a right as a citizen--
To see the crooks at the head of the firm and get our money!
Be quiet! Pipe down, pipe down!
- Hey! Wait a minute.
- Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Steve.
- King Cole in there?
- Yes, but I think he's busy.
- So am I.
- Hello, Steve.
- Well, the old maestro.
Come in, we got a story for ya.
- There was a murder last night.
- Yeah.
Here it is.
Just look in "The Mirror."
Never saw anything yet in "The Mirror."
Always the last on assignment, eh, Steve?
But always the first with the story.
- Attaboy, Shorty.
- Hey, thanks.
It's okay, Steve,
I got it all covered.
- Where's the brass hat?
- He's in there.
Lookin' over Halford's papers.
Sorry.
Full house for this performance.
Gotta see him about somethin' personal.
Then you better go to his house.
- You can't come in here.
- Alright.
Hey, don't you go away.
I might wanna see you later.
- How about this guy, Mander?
- Well, he's in his office.
But you won't get much, Steve.
We've all had a crack at him.
Yeah, hold on just a minute, will you?
Say, Burnes...
You've got to give me a little more time.
You can't close me out like this.
But I'll have the money for you tomorrow.
But the insurance company's promised to pay off on that partnership policy.
Yes, 200,000.
Yes, that's all the time
I'll need.
- What do you got?
- Asthma.
- What do you want?
- I want news.
- News about what?
- About murder.
I'll murder you if you don't get out of here.
I'm here as a reporter from "The Star."
"The Star?"
If I knew anything about this mess
I'd do my best to keep it from you.
It's your articles and your paper that's responsible for bringing those frantic fools up here.
Yeah, they were fools once.
Now they're kind of frantic.
Aren't they? Well, after all, you can't blame them very much.
You and your partner robbed all those people.
They invested their money and lost it legitimately.
You and Halford carried a lot of partnership insurance didn't you?
- What of it?
- Not a thing. Nothing.
Except that "The Star" is gonna suggest that you use it to repay all these people that you've robbed.
Have you got any objections?
The details of my business are no concern of "The Star."
Anything that happens in this office is news, Mander.
Is it true that you came back here shortly after
Halford was killed?
I don't know when Halford was killed.
He was killed in his automobile between here and the Regions Apartments about 6 o'clock last night.
- Where were you at that time?
- Well, I was acr...
Say, are you trying to suggest--
I'm not trying to suggest anything.
I'm just trying to get a story for my paper.
- I'll give you a story.
- Now, wait a minute.
Take it easy. You know...
Another murder isn't gonna help you get out of the first one.
Get outta here.
- Thanks for the interview.
- Get out!
Okay, high finance,
I'll see you at the bar.
I suppose you got a full autobiography outta Mander.
Never mentioned the murder.
We talked about paperweights.
How do you spell Halford?
Why?
- "H-A-L-F-O-R-D. Halford."
- Hello. Yeah.
Halford-Mander office. Who?
I don't know anybody.
But, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Anybody around here named Miller?
You know my name is Miller.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's for you, Jake.
You got it.
I think it's your old lady.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
As a cashier of this firm you handled all physical transactions and negotiable securities.
That's right.
When an investor gave you stocks or bonds or other valuables what did you do with them?
Uh, Mr. Halford usually instructed me to change all securities into cash and deposit them to his personal account.
Thanks, that's all.
Hello, Steve. Well, it was about time for you to bother me.
Hi, captain.
Just been assigned to the case.
So have I, Steve. But, I have nothing to say right now.
Oh, come on now.
Be a pal, will ya?
If I don't get some dope on this case pretty soon
Robins will tear the rest of his hair out.
- What's your opinion?
- I have no opinion, Steve.
We know that Halford was shot through the head.
I think I know why, but so far,
I don't know where it happened.
Anybody hear a shot?
If they did, we've had no report of it.
Well, that's funny.
Maxie, what do you think?
In my opinion, it's an open-and-shut case.
Alright, alright, skip it.
Alright, wise guy.
Figure it out yourself.
Well, maybe nobody heard that shot because there was a lot of other shooting.
What do you mean,
"A lot of other shooting?"
See that shooting gallery across the street?
Why couldn't he have been shot from there.
How could anybody be shot from a shooting gallery?
- Somebody woulda seen him.
- Oh, I don't know.
What caliber bullet killed Halford?
- .32. Yeah.
- Sure?
That's what the autopsy chart said. Wasn't it, Sweeney?
- I think so.
- You think?
I'm positive. I...
Get me Spring 6-6-100.
Record clerk.
Oh, I don't know, Steve.
It's a pretty wild guess.
Adams? This is Sweeney.
I wanna make sure
I'm right about something.
It was a .32 bullet that killed Halford, wasn't it?
It was a .22, chief.
- Why, you--
- But, chief, I wasn't far off.
I...
A .22.
Steve?
I think we've got something.
- Yeah, I think we have.
- 'Come on.'
I told you this was an open-and-shut case.
I've just had an idea.
I think Halford may have been shot from a shooting gallery.
- "Shooting gallery?"
- Where?
Tell you more about it later.
See me here in half an hour.
- Let me help you, chief.
- 'Thank you.'
Say, miss, did Mr. Mander go out before Halford left for home last night?
Yes, a few minutes before.
And he returned just as I was ready to go.
What?
- When was that?
- Shortly after 6:00.
He'd been over at the shooting gallery.
What?
Mander didn't tell me anything about that.
Me neither.
Did he tell you he'd been over there?
No, but somebody phoned him.
I heard him say he was at the shooting gallery.
Boys, don't let Mander leave his office till I come back.
Come on.
- Thanks, miss.
- You're welcome.
Hello. Put him on!
Look at that.
Hello, Joe.
Sensational development.
Cole says he thinks that Halford may have been shot from a shooting gallery.
Yeah, and--
Yeah, I've just been reading
Steve Grey's story about it in "The Star."
What?
It's in "The Star" already?
Well, I'll be a slab-side of jellyfish.
- Have a shot, gentlemen.
- We're from headquarters.
What's wrong?
Did you have any customers here about dusk last night?
Yeah, a, a few.
You notice a well-dressed, dark-complected man about six-feet tall, with a moustache?
No... Come to think of it, I did.
He was here the same time as that sailor fella.
- Did they do anything unusual?
- No.
Except, the sailor fellow hit a bull's-eye and cost me a good cigar. Heh!
Then he left.
What about the man with the moustache?
Well, after the sailor fella left why, he leaned over and he said, kinda confidential
"My name's Jones.
Got a message for me?"
- Then what?
- I never had no message.
And I told him so. Say, what are you drivin' at, chief?
Just this.
A man was shot in the street last night with one of your rifles.
What? Why, you're crazy.
No, I-I mean, it's impossible.
Nothin' happens around here with my guns that I don't see.
You watched these two all the time?
Yeah, sure. Why, I...
Wait a minute, come to think of it
I did turn away to take a rifle away from the kid that wanted to shoot.
I never let no kids handle guns.
And while you were doing that, your back was turned?
Yeah, for a minute.
Gee, I almost forgot about that.
But it just couldn't happen, chief.
Nobody could shoot off one of my guns without me knowin' it.
- Did you notice that?
- No, w-well, that is, I--
Where were you standing when you took the gun away from the kid?
Well, I was standin' right there.
Where was the kid standing?
Standin' right there, inside.
Where were the other two?
Sailor was there and Mr. Jones was there.
Alright.
Sweeney? You're the sailor.
- Okay.
- Steve.
- Would you mind being Jones?
- No, no.
Good. Right there.
Now, the, uh, boy was, uh, here?
Yeah, right inside.
Alright, Welch, you're the boy.
Now, Rafferty, you start forward as you take the gun from the boy.
And, Steve, you turn around and make believe that you fire into the street.
Ready?
- Go.
- Hey, come here with that gun.
I don't let no kids handle guns.
Did you see what happened?
No, I never see nothin'.
Good.
Now, which rifle did Jones use?
I can't remember that, chief.
I keep changin' them around all the time.
Oh, Welch, take all these rifles down to headquarters.
Yes, sir.
What about my business?
We're takin' it over for the time being.
And you, too. Come along.
Alright, Sweeney.
- Come on, Rafferty.
- Coming along, Steve?
No, no,
I got enough for a story.
You know, I feel we have a pretty tight case against Mander now.
If I could only find the right motive.
What about a partnership insurance policy?
Steve, I think you'd make a good detective.
Thanks, captain.
I think you would, too.
- Hiya, Pop.
- Hello, son.
I thought you weren't coming.
Well, I got tied up with old
King Cole on the Halford case.
- Did you get anything?
- Yeah, yeah, I think we did.
Looks like the guy was shot from the shooting gallery across from their offices.
Shootin' gallery?
That's a crazy idea.
A clever one, too.
The combination you need for murder.
- What'll it be, gents?
- You want beer?
- Well, yeah.
- A large beer.
- And a slightly smaller whisky.
- Yes.
I'd lay off the hard liquor if I were you, son.
Ah, it's good for you, Pop, especially, when you're working on a story like this.
Is the story so important?
Of course, it's important.
The most important thing to a news writer.
And you got to get it, too.
One way or another.
Son, what's the matter with you?
Nothing. Why?
Did you get another letter from Dorothy?
- Yeah.
- 'When?'
- Oh, a couple of days ago.
- 'What did she say?'
Oh, I don't know, Pop.
She didn't say anything.
Steve, you're not thinking of taking her back again?
Because she'd treat you just like she did before.
No.
No, she'd never do that again, Pop.
- Yes, she will, she's--
- Oh, Pop, Pop.
- Please, forget it.
- I wish you'd forget it.
I wish I could.
- She's dead.
- Dead?
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I guess, she just couldn't stand the gaffe any longer.
She jumped off a ferry boat.
Hey, there's Steve.
Say, big shot, how'd you happen to get Cole to fall for that apple strudel about Halford being shot from a shooting gallery?
Yeah, and what's more, I suppose you think it's smart reporting writing about a story before it happened.
- It isn't cricket, old dear.
- No.
You've picked out the guy you're going to send to the chair for this crime?
Yeah.
Do you wanna know who it is?
- Sure.
- Yeah, sure.
Read "The Star."
- See you later, Pop.
- Alright.
Is it a habit of yours to go across to the shooting gallery?
Why, no. As a matter of fact,
I'd never been there before.
Then why did you go there last night?
Someone telephoned, said if I'd go over to the shooting gallery, the proprietor would give me a message.
Who telephoned?
- I don't know.
- What was the message?
Well, I don't know that, either.
I-I never received it.
Then what happened?
I asked the proprietor for the message but he didn't know anything about it.
Why didn't you tell me this morning that you went across to the shooting gallery?
Why, I, uh, I didn't think it was important.
Anything you did last night at 6 o'clock was important.
Why? You don't think that I--
Why didn't you have the man leave the message at the office?
It was very private.
You didn't know what the message was but you did know it was very private.
It must've been.
Something you didn't want your Pop to know anything about, I suppose.
Is that it?
No.
It-it was about a woman.
About a woman, huh?
- What was her name?
- That doesn't matter.
She couldn't possibly have anything to do with this case.
Send Mabel in here, will ya?
Detective Captain Cole in the Homicide Squad today arrested Henry Mander for the murder of his business partner, Spencer Halford.
Cole claims the motive for the crime was an insurance policy providing for the payment of $200,000 to one partner in the event of the death of the other.
Halford was ambushed from a sidewalk shooting gallery on the night of March the 23rd.
Type this right away, Mabel, and give it to Robins.
Mr. Robins is at that press conference.
Alright, give it to Meltzer then.
See if he can make the next run on it before every other newspaper in town's got it.
Yes, Mr. Grey.
It's a very shaky story, Mander.
Rafferty.
Is this Mr. Jones?
- Yeah, that's him.
- What are you driving at?
- It'll all come out in court.
- What do you mean?
I mean, you went across the shooting gallery last night to kill Halford.
Yeah, reads good, Meltzer.
- Here's your mail, madam.
- Oh, thanks, Steve.
Gee, you get a lot of fan mail, don't you?
Don't tell me somebody's in love with you.
Just because my name's Mary, don't think I've never had anything but a lamb running after me.
Now, I imagine anything running after you.
Oh, shut your silly face,
Steve Grey.
Since you're such a smart, little boy perhaps you can help me answer this one.
"My wife has fallen in love with a musician.
I still love her, but I fear the worst."
Tell him to buy a saxophone and enter the contest.
Idiotic as it sounds it's vital to this poor, silly, little man.
There is such a thing as love, you know?
Yeah, yeah, I know,
I discovered that once myself.
Well, good, I'm glad to hear there's some real emotion under that hard-boiled exterior of yours.
Yeah, I know what love is and I know what hate is.
And I know exactly what that poor sap is going through.
He's in a hopeless muddle, that's why he writes to you.
If I thought it'd help him any,
I'd answer it for him myself.
But, advice is no good.
In a case like this, you're caught in the rapids.
And you go exactly where it takes you.
Oh.
Steve, what are you doin' here?
The opposition slipped one over on you this time.
Cole just arrested Mander for the murder of Halford.
Get down to headquarters right away.
And on behalf and in the interest of the people of the state of New York we shall prove that the defendant, Henry Mander did premeditatedly and in cold blood destroy the life of his partner in business
James Spencer Halford.
That the defendant engineered this crime to cause it to appear an accident.
And that his motive for such a deed was an insurance policy for $200,000 and the control of the business venture.
Lieutenant White.
Steve, I shouldn't be here.
Why not? You work for a newspaper, don't you?
Yes, but this isn't my department.
But you're in my department, aren't you?
Yeah, that's the trouble.
What is your official capacity,
Lieutenant White?
I'm a ballistics expert for the police department.
Will council stipulate that the witness is qualified?
So stipulated.
I now show you people's exhibit S2 for identification.
- Do you recognize this?
- I do.
I've been studying test bullets fired from this gun.
Have you formed an opinion as a result of your research?
Yes, the grooves in the death bullet and the grooves in the test bullets were made by the same rifle barrel.
And no other rifle barrel could form the same grooves as are found in the death bullet?
Absolutely not.
In my opinion the fatal bullet was fired from this gun.
That's all, lieutenant.
"Society's represented by Mrs. Van Holstein" who hasn't missed a big murder trial in years.
She's up to her eyes and chinchillas wearing something on top of her hat that looks like a bulldog. Phew!
Peter Rafferty.
Raise your right hand.
You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothin' but the truth, so help you God?
- Sure, yes.
- What's your name?
- Peter Rafferty.
- Peter Rafferty.
What's your business,
Mr. Rafferty?
I got a shootin' gallery.
You recognize this rifle?
Sure I do.
That's one of my own guns.
There's my initials on the barrel.
Would you recall the customers who visited your place on the night of, uh,
March the 23rd say, about 6 o'clock?
I think so.
You remember a man who called himself Jones?
Yeah. Mr. Jones.
Would you recognize this man if you saw him again?
Yes, sir. That's him.
Thank you, Mr. Rafferty.
Hello, Willard, shooting-gallery man identifies Mander as giving the name of Jones.
Also, identifies death gun.
Howard Jennings.
Raise your right hand.
You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth' and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- What's your name?
- Howard Jennings.
I understand, Mr. Jennings, you're the general manager of the Globe
Insurance Company.
Is it a fact that the firm of Halford and Mander carried a partnership insurance in your company?
Yes, it is.
What is the amount of that policy?
Two hundred thousand dollars.
And since Halford is dead the money is now payable to Henry Mander?
- Yes, it is.
- Thank you.
Your witness, Mr. Colville.
I don't think one man would kill another just for money.
They ruined several thousand lives getting a crooked fortune.
I don't know why one of 'em wouldn't kill the other.
Mr. Jennings can you state whether the partnership insurance payable to a surviving member is in general use?
Why, yes.
It is a fairly general practice.
And did Mr. Mander and Mr. Halford apply for such a policy?
Yes, they did.
How long had this policy been in effect?
- At Mr. Halford's death.
- More than five years.
This is Maguire.
Gimme the desk.
"Insurance was obvious motive," says the district attorney.
And get this.
I think it was, too.
Mr. Jennings, do you know any cases of fraud or attempted fraud, in which the beneficiary committed a crime to collect the insurance?
Yes, there have been many such cases within my experience.
And what was the average length of time that elapsed between the issuance of the policy and the commission of the crime?
Crime was generally committed within six months or less from the time the policy was issued.
Thank you, Mr. Jennings.
No more questions.
Steven Grey, take the stand.
Steven Grey.
What does he know about this trial?
I don't know, but it looks like this murder was just to raise, boost the circulation of "The Star."
Steven. Are you gonna testify in this case?
Looks like it.
Raise your right hand, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- What's your name?
- Steven Grey.
- Steven Grey.
Now, Mr. Grey, you're a feature writer on "The New York Daily Star," are you not?
I am.
On the morning after the crime while covering the Halford murder you called at the offices of Halford and Mander?
Yes, sir.
And while there, you overheard a telephone conversation between the defendant and someone?
Yes, sir. A Mr. Burnes.
Tell the court and the jury exactly what you overheard.
Well,
Mander seemed to be pleading with this fellow, Burnes.
He, uh...
He kept saying, "Now, listen to me. You've got to listen to me.
You can't close me out like this."
Was it a heated conversation?
It was warm.
What else did the defendant say?
He said he'd have the money to pay.
Said the insurance company owed him $200,000 on a partnership policy.
And then?
Then he hung up.
I see. Did you interview Mander personally?
- I tried to.
- What was said?
Oh, nothing of importance.
What was said, Mr. Grey? Please.
- He refused the interview.
- Why?
Well, some time ago,
I wrote a series of articles on investment broker rackets.
And Halford and Mander was one of the firms you exposed, eh?
That's right.
Then you knew the defendant.
Slightly.
While getting material for my articles
I discovered that my father had lost some money in his firm.
I object! This testimony has no possible bearing in the case.
I move it be stricken from the record.
Motion granted.
Did you know that this man's father lost money in your business?
Well, what happened?
No, I didn't, I...
I only knew Grey as a reporter.
Oh, nothing of importance.
Mr. Grey, the defendant is on trial for murder.
I must insist you tell the court and jury exactly what happened.
Mander got mad and grabbed some kind of a glass gadget off his desk and tried to crown me with it.
Yes. And what did he say?
Oh, nothing.
I don't think he meant it.
It's not for you to say what he meant.
What did Mander say?
He told me to get out or he'd murder me.
Thank you very much, Mr. Grey.
Your witness, Mr. Coleville.
Now, Mr. Grey...
- Hello...
- Hello.
Steve Grey, big-shot reporter of "The Star" was on the witness stand and...
Steve Grey, star reporter gives sensational testimony against Mander.
Extra! Extra!
Well, never mind that, Joe.
Here, take this.
Mrs. Horowitz, one of the members of the jury was wearing a horn-colored monkey jacket.
Extra! Read all about it.
"Steve Grey gives sensational testimony against Mander!"
Extra! "Prosecutor wants
Mander death penalty."
Extra!
"Mander case goes to jury."
Extra!
Best job you've ever done,
Steve.
Your testimony went a long way towards sending that rat to the chair.
Yeah, I don't like rats.
I'm not sure I like the idea of killing them, either.
Aw, forget it.
You've been working too hard.
Take a rest, it'll do you good.
Go away for a couple of days.
Thanks.
Next time
I'll strap the guy to the chair.
Then, uh, then maybe you'll give me a whole week off, huh?
Hey, Steve, what are you tryin' to do? Kill me?
Sorry, Mary. I didn't see you.
- Where you goin'?
- Around the world.
- "Around the world?"
- Yeah.
Big-hearted Jake just gave me two days of vacation.
Oh, then I know where you're going.
- I bet you do.
- Sure, to Joe's...
Or Pete's or any other bar you can find.
You know all the answers, don't you, Mary?
Most of them.
Alright, can you tell me what would be better for me then than a good old-fashioned drunk?
Yes, I can.
But, I haven't time now.
Can you meet me in half an hour at The Savoy Grill?
- Buyin' my lunch?
- No, you're buying mine.
- Alright. It's a date.
- It's a date.
Give me two slugs and a soft one.
Hello, Steve.
Give me a shot.
Just been readin' your story.
Clever way that guy did it.
But, I always says killing's bad business, Mr. Grey.
- Well, hey!
- Hello, Steve!
Come on, have a drink.
Hey, Jimmy. A little service.
Well, Steve, you certainly gave us one swell trimming on that story.
Yeah, but you musta had some inside dope.
"Inside dope?"
Nothing, he's a newspaper man.
Come on, give us the low-down.
Where'd you get your--
Hey, can't you guys talk about anything else?
- Yeah, but--
- Aw, shut up!
- How do you do, Mr. Grey?
- Send me a drink over here.
- Will ya?
- Very good, sir.
- Hello, Steve.
- Oh, hiya, captain.
Well, the case is all over.
He's signed and sealed.
And when we deliver him up the river, the job's finished.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, it was an open-and-shut case.
I knew all along we had him but it will be the same old story.
He'll go to the chair, protesting his innocence.
They always do.
Well, so long, Steve.
See you at the next murder.
There you are, Mr. Grey.
Now, what would you like?
Another drink.
Bring it right away, will ya?
Yes, sir.
You might've at least waited until after we'd had our lunch.
Just a little appetizer.
I know your appetite, but you've had enough.
Okay, boss.
Steve, I know what's bothering you.
Your testimony against Mander.
- But it was only your duty.
- Certainly, it was.
- The guy had it coming to him.
- Well, of course he did.
But you've gotta forget about it.
Go away someplace where you can do something worthwhile.
- What is worthwhile?
- Lots of things.
I want to see you accomplish something, Steve.
I wanna see you do all the things I know you can do.
You wrote a book once.
It was quite a success.
You can do it again.
Listen, I know a place away from all this.
We won't let a soul come near you.
And as far as the rest of the world's concerned there won't be a Steve Grey until you've found yourself again.
You think I could do that?
Of course you can, if you try.
Alright, I will try.
For you.
"Your Excellency the death commitment of Henry L. Mander
"has just been returned to me by your messenger
"and your signature is duly noted.
"In accordance with the said commitment
"I shall carry out the decree of the court
"at 11 o'clock tomorrow night.
And we'll notify...
Warden's office.
Just a minute.
It's your call, sir.
- Wh-who is it?
- The long-distance call.
- Mr. Robins at "New York Star."
- Oh, yes, yes.
Hello, Mr. Robin.
This is Warden Powell of Sing Sing.
Mander has agreed to grant an interview and the board has okayed it.
Have your man here at 11 o'clock sharp tomorrow morning.
No, I haven't told Mander which paper.
Thank you very much, warden.
Got it.
Shorty...
...I want you to...
- Clara.
- Yes, sir.
Ask Mary to come in here.
- Will you, please?
- Right.
They've just granted a death-house interview with Mander, tomorrow morning at 11.
That means I take the 9 o'clock for Ossining in the morning, eh, chief?
What? What? Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Oh, come in, Mary.
Mary, you need a rest.
How 'bout taking a couple of weeks off?
- With pay?
- Why, of course.
I'm making the suggestion, am I not?
Well, then, I'll be glad to.
Starting next week?
Alright, thanks.
Oh, wait, just a minute, Mary.
Sit down.
How'd you like to do me a favor?
What is it?
- I want Steve.
- Mr. Robins.
I've told you before,
I can't tell you where Steve is except that he's away writing a book and taking a long rest.
Well, he's been gone for three months.
That's rest enough, isn't it?
It'd be a crime to drag him back now.
- He's salvaging his life.
- Mary, listen. I need him.
We've just been granted permission to interview Mander in the death house tomorrow morning.
Well, can't you send Shorty?
I can send a hundred other reporters and get a statement from Mander on the day of his electrocution but nobody can write that story the way Steve can.
I'm sorry, Mr. Robins.
Well, you're not being very loyal to the paper.
I think it's up to me to decide where my loyalty is due.
- Don't you?
- Alright, never mind.
Forget I mentioned it at all.
And, uh, my vacation is over?
No, no, no, no.
You can take it.
There are no strings attached to it.
Thanks.
Mary, you can go now.
- This minute?
- Yes.
Oh, thank you very much.
- Come here, Shorty.
- Yes, sir.
You're not going to Ossining,
I have a much more important assignment for you.
I want you to get a couple of sandwiches and...
Is that you?
- What are you doin' up here?
- Robin gave me a vacation.
He did?
What did he give ya, two days?
No, two whole weeks.
Two weeks? Gosh.
It sounds like a bribe.
Maybe you're right.
How is the old warhorse?
Oh, he's still pining away for you.
- Ah, let him pine.
- How's your book going?
- It isn't.
- What do you mean, Steve?
I haven't even started it yet.
What's more,
I don't think I will.
Oh, but, Steve, you told me you were gonna--
Yeah, I know, I told you a lot of things.
I don't know, I...
I don't seem to be able to get down to it.
Besides, there are enough punk books in the world without min'
I think. Hey, let's not talk about books. let's talk about you.
Uh, uh, what are your plans for your vacation?
Oh, I'll probably stay down in the village and bother you occasionally.
Well, you'd better bother me more than occasionally or I will be bothered.
- What do you like to do?
- Well, I...
I like to fish.
Alright, we'll go fishing.
What else?
And I like to swim.
Alright, we'll go swimming. And?
I like to walk and dream.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll forget about everything else in the world and we'll just think about all the things you like to do, for two weeks, huh?
That'll be grand.
But you know, you're gonna be awfully busy.
Well, I-I don't think
I'll mind that.
- Hi, Steve.
- How did you get here?
Uh, well,
I just happened to be passing--
Yeah, I know. Robins sent you up here to get me, huh?
Yes, he did, Steve. He wants you for a very special reason.
Steve, he wants you to interview
Mander in the death house.
Yeah, and he had a pretty hard time gettin' permission, too.
'Mander goes to the chair tomorrow, you know?'
Yeah, I know.
As if that could make any difference to you.
Well, surely, you don't want to interview the poor fella.
Oh, Steve, you wouldn't, would you?
You're away from all that now and if you go back...
What'll I tell Mr. Robins,
Steve?
Tell him I'll be at Sing Sing in the morning.
And you can tell him
I'll be back in his office in the mornin'.
Grey of "The New York Star."
Okay, over here.
Sit down.
I'll have him brought out.
You've only got a few minutes.
So, make the interview snappy.
Dave, have Mander brought out for this newspaper guy.
Yes, sir.
Bring Mander out.
- Alright, Mander.
- What is it?
A visitor.
A newspaper man is here.
Come on.
Just a few minutes.
You?
Why'd they send you up here?
You offered a granted interview, didn't you?
Yes. I want the world to know
I'm innocent.
I didn't think they'd send you.
I haven't got a chance with you.
You're not as cocky as you used to be, are you, Mander?
You don't know what it means to be here.
Waking up, wondering what day it is and how many hours you've got to live.
And those terrible mornings when the guards pull the curtains and you hear whispering, shuffling feet and a priest praying for some poor, mourning fool they have to drag to the chair.
Oh, Grey, do something.
- What could I do?
- I didn't kill Halford.
Put it in the paper, tell everybody I'm innocent.
- Tell them I'm not a murderer.
- No, no, no.
You're talkin' to the wrong guy,
Mander.
You and Halford were the worst kind of killers.
Ya killed people with your schemes and with your lies just as surely as if you'd shot them down in cold blood!
But I'll make it up, everything I stole.
I'll go to prison. I'll pay for all the wrong I did to them.
You know, I knew some of the people you robbed.
Men like my father who turned over every cent to you and women like...
We don't have to mention any names.
You had Halford with his love schemes for them.
They came to you in trust and turned over everything they had.
Nothing was too low for you to do nothing too contemptible.
Listen to me, Mander.
I've got sympathy for every man in that death house.
There isn't anything in the world I wouldn't do for them but not for you, Mander because you've got it coming to ya.
But I'm not a murderer!
I didn't kill Halford!
I know you didn't.
What? What did you say?
You know I didn't?
Oh, Grey.
Grey, you gotta do something.
You must do something.
You will help me, won't ya?
You can't let them kill me when you know I didn't do it!
Oh, Grey, for heaven's sake, save me! Save me!
- Time's up, Mander.
- I've only got a short time.
- Until 11 o'clock tonight.
- Come on, Mander.
Oh, Grey, don't sit there staring at me, tell me you'll help me.
You're the only one who can!
You're the only one who knows!
Oh, Grey, don't let them kill me like this!
Grey! Please! Grey!
Grey, please!
Grey! Please, Grey!
Grey, please!
- Yeah?
- Steve.
Where's that Mander story?
I've been waiting hours for it.
We've missed two editions already.
I've been trying to get an angle on this.
Angle?
Do you realize
I had to move heaven and Earth to get that interview?
We're the only paper that could work it.
Alright, alright.
You'll get your story.
They're typin' a copy of it now.
'Is it good?'
How do I know if it's any good or not?
Here you are, Mr. Grey.
It's a wonderful story,
Mr. Grey.
I guess it appeals to me because I had an uncle that was electrocuted once.
- Once is generally enough.
- Oh, but he didn't do anything.
It was all a mistake.
And he was awful pretty, too.
- Mr. Grey, what are you doin'?
- Run along, Mabel.
But, Mr. Grey, you know their--
Go on, get out of here!
Oh, Ms. Shannon, he's torn it up.
- What?
- Mr. Grey. He's torn it up.
The-the story, I mean.
And he's awful extra mad.
Oh, never mind, Mabel.
I'll take care of it.
What's the matter, Steve?
Mabel says you've torn up your story.
Yes, I tore it up.
Why should I pander to the morbid curiosity of a lotta people who wanna know how a guy looks before he goes to the chair?
If you could've seen how he looked if you could've heard him plead with me...
Oh, it must've been horrible.
You shouldn't have gone, Steve.
Ah, what do I care how he looks or how he feels.
What do you call this, a cocktail party?
- Where's that story?
- It's in the wastepaper basket.
If you like jigsaw puzzles, there it is.
- You tore it up?
- Yes, I tore it up.
And I'm not gonna write it again--
Oh, yes, you are, you drunken fool.
- Drunken or not, I'm through.
- What do you mean, "Through?"
Take it any way you like.
I'm quitting.
You can quit if you want to but you don't go until you write that story!
Leave him to me, Mr. Robins.
Yeah, and I'm not gonna write it for you either.
What's the matter, too strong for your delicate stomach you drooling saphead?
Can't stand to see a man in the death house, eh?
You've got the biggest story in months and you're holding it from your readers.
That's the lowest thing a newspaper man can do.
And they call you
The Murder Man.
Why, you oughta be writing bedtime stories.
Okay.
Okay, I'll write your story.
I'll write ya the greatest story your cheesy newspaper has ever printed.
I'll give your million readers something to gloat over.
Now, get out of here and leave me alone!
That's the way to talk, Steve.
Steve,
I hate to see you so upset.
Get outta here, you, too!
At the 11th hour
Henry Mander was saved from the electric chair.
Steven Grey, the man who shot Halford from Rafferty's shooting gallery on the night of March the 23rd...
...walked into
Captain Cole's office at police headquarters at...
...at 5:45 today and confessed the crime.
A sardonic touch was added to the situation by the fact that Grey, who was a reporter on "The Star" interviewed Mander this morning in the death house at Sing Sing.
- Well, he's doing it, Mary.
- Good.
Steve is a tough guy to get along with but he's a peach.
Isn't he?
Yes. Yes, he is.
And that's the story, Mary.
Now, you know what's been the matter with me and why I've acted so strangely.
I guess there isn't anything more to say except...
...except that I think you're a swell girl, Mary.
And I only wish I had met you a long, long time ago.
Mary?
- Yes, Steve?
- Come here a minute, will ya?
Mary, I want you to type this for me.
Alright, Steve.
Hey, I know it sounds a little funny but, uh, well, I want you to be the first one to hear it.
Of course,
I'll do it if you want me to.
I'm sorry I yelled at you a little while ago.
Forgive me, will ya?
It's my nerves.
I guess they're a little shot.
Why don't you go home and take a rest?
No, I can't do that,
I got an appointment with Captain Cole at 5:45.
- Will that keep you long?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's liable to keep me quite a while.
I...
I won't see you again for a long time, maybe.
What do you mean, Steve?
Well, you heard me tell his nibs
I wasn't gonna work here anymore, didn't you?
Hm, yes, but Robins won't let you resign.
He'll find you and bring you back again.
Oh, no, he won't. No, no.
Hey, look, Mary.
Why don't you give up this racket, too?
It's no good, not for a swell girl like you.
Why don't you get yourself a nice husband and get married, eh?
Then you'll have problems of your own, see?
You won't have to worry about other people's.
Thanks for the advice.
I'd like to think of you as being happy, Mary.
There isn't anything you'd care to do about it personally.
- Is there?
- Yeah.
Yes, there's a lot I'd like to do about it personally...
...but I can't.
Why can't you, Steve?
Hey, you.
Your big story's finished.
- And so am I.
- Yes, you are.
You'll be around here tomorrow and I'll tell you about a bonus check
I have for ya.
Yeah, you can...
Give the bonus to my old man.
Goodbye, Hal. Good luck...
...at 5:45 p.m. today and confessed the crime.
Police headquarters.
Except that I think you're a swell girl, Mary.
And I only wish I had met you a long, long time ago.
We're awfully late tonight,
Mr. Robins.
Yes, it was that Mander story.
But you've got the copy now, haven't ya?
No, sir, we're still holding for it.
What?
Mary has it in Steve's office.
- Mary, where's that story?
- I don't know.
Gimme that!
Oh, Pop?
Come along with me, and hurry.
- What's wrong, Mary?
- We've got to find Steve.
Right away. Come on.
Hey, Steve?
You can't go in there.
The captain's asleep.
Been on a case for 48 hours.
What are ya bustin' in here for?
- News.
- No news. Get out!
- I got some news for you.
- It'll keep.
Big news never keeps, this is gonna be screamin' all over the 6:30 "Star."
I thought I'd be a good guy and come down and tip you off to it.
Next time, don't trouble to be so nice.
And this time, get out.
Mander's not going to the chair tonight, Cole.
What do you mean?
I thought that'd make you sit up.
Gimme a match.
- Is this a gag?
- No, it's not a gag.
- Mander didn't kill Halford.
- Well, if he didn't, who did?
That's the news, see, that's the news.
You still want me to keep it?
- No, spill it.
- Alright, I'll spill it.
But I'm gonna spill it in my own way.
Alright.
The story begins five years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah, it begins five years ago with a young wife telling her husband that she had met a couple of upright businessmen that were gonna invest her life savings safely.
- Halford and Mander?
- Yeah.
I see, and the nice young wife was playing around with one of 'em, hm?
That's right, that's right, with Halford.
Halford was a ladies' man.
He was the type that fascinates women.
And this Mander was the kind of a guy that used Halford's charm to snare in any woman who was sap enough to fall for it.
Who was the woman, Steve?
She deserted her husband.
She turned over everything they had to these two guys.
And then when she didn't have anymore she found out she was alone and she found that out, that was too much for her.
The police dragged her body out of the river a few days later.
And that was too much for the husband.
Well, go on.
Then he became a brooding maniac.
He neglected his work.
He stayed drunk for days and days at a time.
And, finally, this brooding drove him to the murder of Halford.
So, he phoned Mander to come to the shooting gallery to get a message.
Well, then he was shot from the shooting gallery?
No, he was shot from a hallway.
- Next to the shooting gallery.
- But the gun, Steve.
That gun was Rafferty's.
The fellow borrowed it long enough to do the job.
- Who was it, Steve?
- He squared everything.
By killing one of them and framing the other.
Well, then all that evidence was framed against Mander.
Yeah, the fellow who shot
Halford sat in the courtroom and watched Mander being tried and convicted for murder.
And he thought he was going to be able to see him go to the chair...
...but he couldn't.
And that's why you're hearing the story.
Steve.
Steve, what have you told him?
- Mary, what're you doing here?
- Oh, please, don't believe him.
He's been drinking, he doesn't know what he's saying.
- Go on with your story, Steve.
- No, no, Steve.
- I've broken that cylinder.
- Who killed Halford?
Steve, don't you say another word.
I did.
Call Sweeney.
Can I use your phone?
Help yourself.
Get me Robins at "The Star" office, will ya?
- Yeah.
- 'Steve Grey on the phone.'
- 'Mr. Robins.'
- Hey, where are you?
Did you accept my resignation?
No, but the next time you resign, you're fired!
Well, here's that story you've been waiting for.
Steve Grey just confessed to the murder of Halford.
What! Are you crazy?
I'm sorry, old timer,
 it's on the square.
Well, son, ya-you did the wrong thing but you straightened it out the right way.
I knew you'd take it that way.
I knew you'd do it that way.
I guess we must be related, huh, Pop?
Yes, I guess so.
Go on back to your work now, Pop.
I'll be here tomorrow to see you.
Alright, I'll be here.
Come on, Mary.
I had to go through with it,
Mary.
I understand.
I'm sure you must've had your reasons.
I did.
It couldn't have worked out any other way.
You remember my telling you a long time ago about being caught in the rapids and going wherever it took you?
Yes.
Well, that's what happened to me.
And I, I'd like you always to remember that.
I'll remember a whole lot more than that.
Yeah. So will I.
Just, just think of me as one of those fellows who wrote you a letter, Mary because your answer to the problem would have been the same as mine, wouldn't it?
You better go now.
Oh, darling.
What is it, chief?
- Book Grey for murder.
- Mu...
- Murder?
- Halford.
Come on, Steve.
Don't feel too badly.
I've been around for 30 years and I want to tell you something.
It's a long step from here to the finish.
You know...
...juries take a lot of things into consideration.
How much farther?
Soon now.
Anyone else living round the old Norman place, besides Miss Lu?
Who?
That woman, the Creole who was with him when he died.
Do you know her?
Hmm.
Anyone else living there?
No people.
There it is.
Here.
Come back for me in two hours, hmm?
Uh-uh.
No more ride for you tonight.
Tomorrow.
But listen...
Oh.
How do you do,
Mr. Crosby?
How are you, Miss Lu?
Are the others here?
Not yet.
Clock's fast.
It stopped when the master died.
You let it remain just that way for 10 years?
Nothing has been changed here.
Everything is just as he left it.
He would've wanted it that way.
Yes, and everything will be the way he wanted it tonight.
We'll read his will in the library at midnight, just 10 years from the time he died.
But that's the end, Miss Lu. A dead man can't stop the clock forever.
There'll be a change from now on.
Yes.
You ought to be glad. It must've been rather lonely here all these years.
I'm never lonely.
I've got my friends.
Friends?
Yes, my friends!
From the other world.
There are always murmurs.
The house is full of murmurs.
They tell me things.
Oh, you believe in spirits, huh?
Well, have they told you that the heirs and I have to stay here all night?
I've prepared for it.
Some of them are coming now.
You've got sharp ears, Miss Lu.
Why, it's not at all involved.
We are second cousins once removed.
Our great aunt Elizabeth was very...
Well, how should I put it, very, uh...
Prolific?
Well, at any rate, she had a large family.
Twenty-nine.
Don't exaggerate, darling.
Thirty.
What are you talking about?
Crocodiles!
Alligators, to you.
Why did old man Norman want to live in this dismal place?
Well, of course, Cyrus was somewhat eccentric.
What you mean is plain cuckoo.
Young man, have you no respect for a dead relative?
None whatever, unless of course he happened to make me his sole heir.
I doubt that.
Cyrus always professed a great weakness for me.
Yeah, you said he was eccentric.
Say!
There it is, just as Mr. Norman put it there 10 years ago.
Exactly as he put it there.
Hello, this envelope has been tampered with.
Both of them.
Somebody must have opened the safe and read the will.
How could they? Nobody knows how to open the safe but you.
Well, I didn't do it.
You aren't suspicioning me, are you, Mr. Crosby?
Well, if anyone tried to change it, he wasted his time.
I made a duplicate of the will, at Mr. Norman's request, and put it in the vault of the
Trust Company in New Orleans.
Someone at the front door.
See who it is.
And mind you, say nothing about this.
Good evening.
So, you're still here.
Hello.
Wait.
Huh?
I know Miss Tilbury, and you,
Miss Cicily, but who are you?
Fred Blythe, one of the family.
You must be the old boy's housekeeper they talk about.
I was very devoted to Mr. Norman, which is more than his family can say.
Really?
I don't think I'm going to like it here.
Shh. Don't say a word.
Are we the first to arrive?
Lawyer Crosby is in the library.
What happened?
Sometimes they get into the machinery.
Sometimes who gets into the machinery, Aunt Sue?
How should I know?
Oh, so it's you,
Miss Tilbury. Cicily.
Evening, Fred.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Hello. Hello, Charlie, nice to see you again.
Thanks, Mr. Crosby.
Same here.
He's pretty, isn't he?
Does he belong to us?
Yes, dear, second cousin twice removed on his father's side.
Hello, Aunt Susan.
Charlie.
This is your cousin Cicily.
I'm so glad.
How do you do?
And here's Fred.
Oh...
Do we have to shake hands?
Oh, come now, boys, whatever the quarrel is between you two...
No quarrel on my side.
No?
Mmm-mmm.
All right, skip it.
When are you going to read the will?
As soon as the others arrive.
What others? Of course, there's Joyce.
Yes, Joyce Norman.
Joyce... Is she the one that draws pictures for the magazines?
Mmm-hmm. The other's
Wally Campbell.
Wally Campbell, the actor?
On the radio?
The original flutterbrain.
Well, maybe I'm going to like this place after all.
Hey!
I'm not really frightened,
I'm just naturally nervous.
Eating in restaurants all the time, up half the night playing Chinese checkers.
Besides, this is my first sea voyage.
You seem like the jolly type,
Clarence. Do you like jokes?
You don't mind if I ramble on, do you?
It kinda keeps my mind off the malaria germs.
Anyway, here's one.
A farmer had a cow, see, but he couldn't afford to feed it alfalfa, so he fed it sawdust.
He saved a lot of money, all right, but he sure wasted plenty of time getting the splinters out of the milk.
Doesn't that just...
Splinters, milk.
Don't you get it?
Hmm. Heard it last year.
Jack Benny Program.
Yes, Cyrus Canby Norman died in that room across the hall, hating all his close relatives.
Well, he certainly didn't hate me.
And if Cyrus turned against any of us, I know where to put the blame.
It was the influence of that...
What is it,
Miss Lu?
Mr. Campbell is here.
Introducing your favorite and mine, Wally Campbell.
May I join the party?
I was invited.
I hear old Uncle Cyrus's ghost is holding bank night.
Oh, I'm sorry, just a pleasantry.
Hello, Mr. Crosby.
Hello, Wally.
This is your cousin,
Miss Susan Tilbury.
I'm charmed. How do you do? He's the actor.
Your cousin,
Cicily Young.
How do you do?
Fred Blythe and Charlie Wilder.
Nice to see you.
Thanks, thanks.
Well, where's the leading lady?
Leading lady?
Young man, did you inherit the streak of insanity that runs in this family?
What was that leading lady crack?
Oh, nothing really, but all this, midnight, the alligators...
I mean, the heirs, and the family lawyer all gathering to hear the reading of the will.
It reminds me of a lot of melodramas and murder mysteries I played in.
It does?
Thanks.
And in every one of those plays, there was a leading lady, young, beautiful, modern, charming...
Would you take this for me, please? Thanks.
Well, I got here.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry to be so late.
Oh, dear Aunt Susan.
And Cicily. Well, this is like old times.
Charlie, they told me you weren't coming.
It's good to see you.
And, Fred.
Hello, honey.
And...
Well, of all people,
Wally Campbell.
Well, don't you remember?
The little girl you took to a high school dance and deserted.
You used to call me the twerp.
The twerp?
Joyce Norman! Say, when did you grow up and get pretty?
Have I kept you waiting?
I'm so sorry.
That's all right, my dear.
Now, shall we proceed?
What a house.
Isn't it?
That's Uncle Cy.
Hello, Uncle Cy.
They tell me he was so crooked that when he died, they had to screw him into the ground.
Shh. Quiet.
Oh, sorry. Here you are, Joyce.
Thank you,
Charlie.
Now as soon as we're all comfortably settled, we'll begin.
Here.
Thanks.
Mr. Norman made his will in two parts.
I will now read the contents of envelope number one.
Oh, tell me. Tell me.
Miss Lu? Miss Lu?
Tell me the name, Master.
The name.
Miss Lu!
What?
What was that noise, like a gong?
It's the warning.
It came just before the master died.
You know, I've been thinking there's no use in my staying here.
After all, I've never inherited anything, except hay fever.
So if nobody objects, I think
I'll swim back to the mainland.
You're going to stay right here...
Yeah, but I can...
I have a million questions to ask you.
Yeah, well, ask her one for me about those seven bells.
They are the spirits.
They mean seven may live.
There are eight people in this room.
One will die before morning.
I feel very faint.
Yeah, well, it's been nice knowing you all but honestly, it's hot in here,
I have to get some air. I...
Now, wait, wait.
Stop all this, Miss Lu.
Do you want to frighten these ladies out of their wits?
There's not much danger of that.
It has happened.
The insane asylums are full of people who've lost their minds through fright.
Oh, may we hear the will, please?
Yes, let's hear it.
I'll bet you two to one that Joyce is the heir.
What's that?
Oh, did I speak out of turn?
What was at the back of your remark?
Oh, why, nothing.
Come on, you know something.
Oh, nothing really.
Well, it's just that in practically every mystery play I've been in, the leading lady turns out to be the heir.
You have the power.
Yes, I... Me?
There are spirits all around you.
Well, could you put some in a glass with little ice?
I need it badly.
Don't you ever stop babbling?
Attention, please.
Usual date and so on.
"I, Cyrus Canby Norman, being of sound mind and body,
"do hereby bequeath all my money, bonds, securities and estate
"under the following provisions.
"Whereas I believe a streak of insanity to be in the family,
"in the event that the heir hereinafter named
"should prove to be of unsound mind,
"or if said heir should become insane
"or should meet death within a month of inheriting,
"then my estate is to be given to the person
"whose name is contained in envelope number two."
Was that his idea or yours?
What's wrong with it?
Well, that will is practically an invitation to commit murder.
Murder?
Certainly.
What's behind that "meeting death or insanity within a month of inheriting"?
That's easily explained.
Mr. Norman was afraid that the shock of inheriting the fortune might prove too much for an unbalanced brain.
And it's also a strong encouragement to the number two heir to do everything possible to unbalance the brain of the number one heir.
Fred, come off. You're talking a lot of nonsense.
Yeah? Murder is committed frequently for less money than old Cyrus left.
That, gentlemen, is precisely the reason why the name of the alternative heir was sealed in this envelope, so that no one should know his identity.
Yeah?
You know who it is, don't you?
Naturally, I drew the will.
"I therefore will that my entire estate be divided equally
"among such descendants of mine of sound mind and body
"who are assembled in my library at midnight
"on the 10th anniversary of my death,
"who bear the surname of Norman."
Norman?
Well, I'm the only one here with that name.
What did I tell you?
I knew it.
It becomes my pleasant duty to proclaim you the sole heiress of the Norman fortune and the new mistress of this old house.
And I sincerely trust that this second envelope shall never be opened.
Thank you.
Oh, it's wonderful,
Joyce, I'm so glad.
Thanks, Charlie.
I congratulate you with all my heart, Joyce.
Well, that's sweet of you, Fred.
It's so unexpected,
I can hardly believe it.
I wish I couldn't believe it.
I'm sorry, Cicily.
You're not a bit sorry.
I know I shouldn't be if I were the heir.
Well, I congratulate you, dear, with definite reservations.
Oh, thanks, darling.
Well...
Well, aren't you going to congratulate me?
Oh, sure. I'll do more than that.
I'll recommend a nice, quiet bombproof cellar to you for the next 30 days.
Thanks.
Here are the keys to the house, Miss Norman.
Oh, well, won't you remain as my housekeeper?
Mr. Norman told me to give this letter to the heir after the will was read.
How did he know you'd be here?
I told him I would be.
It's the first
I've known of it.
Well, what do you suppose...
That's probably about the buried treasure.
Buried treasure!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, well, there's always a buried treasure, isn't there?
You know a pot of gold, or a diamond necklace, or a...
Don't pin me down.
It's very peculiar that you should mention a necklace.
Yeah? Why?
There was one.
See!
Well, did somebody tell you about it?
Now let me think. Oh, it must have been my mother.
The last time you saw your mother, you were three years old.
Yeah, I was just...
I doubt if you'd remember the conversation.
What sort of a necklace was it, Aunt Susan?
Diamonds and emeralds, worth a fortune.
After Cyrus had it made, it was stolen.
Who stole it?
Well, don't look at me.
I just got here.
I've never believed it was stolen.
I always thought Mr. Norman hid it here in this house.
Why would he do that?
Because he was a nut.
There's food in the dining room.
I don't want anything to eat.
Personally, I've changed my plans and I'm leaving.
That's impossible, there are no more trains out until morning, even if you could get to the mainland.
Why can't we get to the mainland?
Because of members of Local Number
2 of the Bayou Canoe Paddlers and Putt Putt Pushers Union won't putt after midnight.
You mean we've got to stay here whether we like it or not?
I arranged it that way and I think you'll all be very comfortable.
So shall we eat, drink and be merry?
For tomorrow, we...
It's on the house.
My house, come on.
Cicily.
I could use a drink.
Yeah, I could, too.
I think I could stiff.
Might as well be a live stiff as a dead stiff.
Since we are all to be prisoners in this terrible house until tomorrow morning,
I suggest that you and I sleep together.
I suggest we all sleep together.
Miss Lu knew we'd have to stay here and...
Oh, Miss Lu.
I don't know much about the house yet, but are there rooms for everyone?
Yes, Miss Norman. The main bedroom, your bedroom, is here.
Mr. Campbell, at the head of the stairs, Lawyer Crosby...
What happened?
They do that when you don't pay your bill. Are you all right?
Yes, of course, but...
Well, how am I?
I'm all right, I always shake this way. Don't...
Well, what in the world's the matter, Miss Lu?
Miss Lu?
Did you have to break one of those old crystal glasses?
I didn't break it.
It was knocked out of my hand.
Come on.
Don't take it so big.
Go ahead.
Keep your shirt on.
I'm just telling you, you keep away from Joyce.
What's the matter? Not afraid of a little healthy competition, are you?
I'm not afraid of anything you've got to offer. I'm just warning you.
Yeah?
What's this all about? I wouldn't know.
Better ask Fred.
Why blame it on me?
Two grown men, it's too absurd.
Fred, I want to talk to Charlie.
Oh?
I'll just be a minute.
Same old Casanova.
Well, I'll be in the dining room, if you need me.
Now, Charlie, once and for all...
Joyce, why do you hate me?
I don't hate you,
Charlie, I...
You were in love with me once.
No.
Yes, you were.
Darling, can't we...
We had this all out a long time ago, Charlie.
Give me another chance, Joyce.
I won't fail you this time,
I swear I won't.
You can forget that girl.
No, it wasn't just that, it was...
We can't thrash it out tonight.
Tomorrow, then.
Tomorrow is better.
Yes, tomorrow is much better.
Here you are, Cicily.
Oh, thank you, Wally.
You know, I've always wanted to be an actress and now, just think of it, some of the same blood that flows through my veins flows through yours.
Yeah, it's gruesome, isn't it?
Let's change the subject.
I may not see you people in the morning,
I have a luncheon engagement in New Orleans.
I have to get up early.
Early? Well, you certainly don't expect to sleep in this terrible house.
Don't big, empty houses scare you?
Not me, I used to be in vaudeville.
Oh...
Here.
Oh, Wally, you give me such a comfortable feeling.
First this old house gave me the creeps.
But with you here,
I don't know what fear is.
That's right, nobody's afraid of an old house except a coward.
Turn out the lights.
What is it?
I don't know.
He's coming toward the house.
Oh, Cicily.
What are you doing?
It's the only way to stop a scream.
Oh, is that so? With me, it's for sneezing.
With me, it's for screaming.
Oh, I didn't...
I got it. Hold it.
Cicily!
She's all right.
She's okay.
We thought we heard some shots.
We thought we did, too. Well, hadn't we better investigate?
Say, maybe you're right.
You may be wrong, though.
Well, I want to go, too.
No, you'd better stay here with Cicily. Come on, Wally.
Oh, no. I'm awfully sorry.
I screamed...
What is it?
Could I talk to you a moment, sir?
Well, come in.
I don't want to alarm you folks, but...
But what?
I'm the head guard over at Fairview.
Fairview?
The insane asylum?
Yes, ma'am. One of our patients got away from us this afternoon.
That's all we needed.
Well, anyway, he'll feel right at home here.
Is he a dangerous maniac?
Yes, ma'am, he's...
He's a killer.
Oh!
How did he escape?
I wish I knew.
We followed him into the bayous, but then we lost him.
But you took a couple of shots at something out in the garden.
I thought I saw him, but the shadows fooled me.
What does the poor fellow look like?
Say, don't waste any sympathy on him, mister.
He'd just as soon rip you wide open as not.
Oh, please, please. There are ladies are present.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
We're still waiting to hear what he looks like.
Oh. Well, he's about 40, but strong as a tiger.
He has sharp teeth and long fingers and fingernails like claws.
And when he's violent, he crawls around on all fours like a...
Like an animal?
Yes, sir, like a cat.
What some guys won't do for a laugh.
Look!
Scat!
That's a good joke on us, all right.
Yeah, I'll say.
That's better.
Well, I guess
I'll be moving on.
Maybe he isn't even around here.
But if I were you,
I'd stay in the house and be sure that all the outside windows and doors are locked.
I agree with you, locked and nailed. I'll handle that.
Won't we?
I'll be around the neighborhood and let you know if we get the Cat.
The what?
Uh, the Cat. That's what the other inmates call him, but they're all crazy.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Listen, I don't think we better say anything about this to Joyce or Cicily.
That's right, there's no use in frightening them, too.
That's a fatheaded suggestion of yours.
If there's any danger, they ought to know it.
Well, somebody ought to go down and lock the cellar doors and windows, anyhow.
Yeah, well I'm going.
I'm... Don't rush me.
I'm going to ask you all not to tell the girls.
Have I your promise?
Good heavens, do you think I'm the type that can't keep a secret?
It's understood, then?
Hey, what's going on?
What are you all talking about?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Well, I'm going to bed.
Good night, all.
Good night.
If you're going to lock up the cellar, you'd better do it now.
That's right.
Oh, that's right.
Is anything the matter?
No, nothing's the matter.
Except there's a maniac loose in this house and we'll all be murdered in our beds.
That a girl. Hold it right there. Stay there.
Well, where's that cellar?
Oh, say, in case I don't come up in about five minutes, better make it four, or even three, you...
Is there a Brother Elk in the house?
I'm not an Elk, but I used to be a Girl Scout.
Oh, good, then you can start a fire with sticks in case our feet freeze.
Come on.
Well, everything's fine.
Well, don't you people want anything more to eat?
Uh-uh.
What's going on?
Oh!
Why...
You go ahead. I'll be with you in a minute.
Listen, Joyce...
Uh-huh?
You know how it is in a play, when just before the first act is over somebody always comes to the beautiful heroine and tells her that she's in great danger, and sometimes she is?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I know it sounds kind of silly, but...
Keep your eyes open, baby.
Thanks.
Well...
Say, why don't you go to the library? It's much nicer in there.
The library, nicer?
What are you...
Well... Well, there's a lamp there.
It hasn't got the jitters like these lights.
Can't do more than explode.
Hey! I'm scared.
Aren't you coming?
Did you find out? Can we go through that way?
Uh-huh.
Oh, well...
Well, I'll be seeing you, I hope.
This is the door all right, but it won't open.
The key, honey.
One turn...
Oh.
Here's a switch.
Won't switch.
You want to go first?
Yeah! No, no.
Certainly not. Ladies always go first.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
I think it was awful funny what Miss Lu said about the spirits being all around you.
What's funny about it?
Well, I mean, I'm psychic, too. I was in a trance once.
I know, I know. When are you coming out of it?
Just kidding.
It's awful spooky down here.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Huh?
You know, that dead people come back?
You mean like the Republicans?
Shh, listen.
What's the matter?
That noise.
Well, what kind of a noise?
It sounds like wheels going around.
Shh. Watch that step.
Watch that...
Hey!
Hold my nose.
I'm screaming!
I can't.
Why can't you?
It's got me. It's got my hands. It's got me.
What?
It's got me. I...
Cheese!
You're not hurt?
No, this one here.
Look, look.
Hurry, hurry.
Oh.
My knee.
Oh, you're not hurt. Come on. We've got work to do.
That window's barred.
I like that.
I hear it now.
What? That noise you just heard.
It's in there.
Oh, that's it.
A home electric plant.
They're nothing but trouble.
How come you know?
We had one down on the farm.
I used to fix it so the lights would go out when my boyfriend was calling on me.
Oh, yeah? Did anything happen when the lights went out?
He always went to sleep.
Wally?
Oh, Mr. Crosby.
Hello, Joyce.
You here alone?
I don't want to worry you, but there's something you ought to know.
Well, won't it keep until morning?
Tomorrow may be too late.
You know, Mr. Norman was a very eccentric man, and I've just made a discovery.
I've been going through some old papers of Mr. Norman's and I...
And I've found something which... Well...
It convinced me it would be dangerous for you to be left here alone.
Mr. Crosby, really.
Don't laugh, Joyce. I know what
I'm talking about, believe me.
I'm alarmed.
I want you to take me seriously.
Joyce, you're in danger, great danger.
Thank heaven I can tell you who they...
I've heard so much about ghosts and spirits tonight that I...
I'm getting jittery.
I'd rather not hear...
Mr. Crosby?
Mr. Crosby?
Oh. Where did
Mr. Crosby go?
I haven't seen him, miss.
But he must have passed you in the hall.
I haven't seen anyone.
Wally. Charlie! Aunt Susan! Wally Campbell.
Coming.
Did someone call?
Are you sure Mr. Crosby wasn't in the dining room?
Positive.
And you didn't see him as you came downstairs?
I did not.
What's wrong?
Well, it's unbelievable.
A few moments ago
I was sitting there,
Mr. Crosby was over there talking to me and suddenly he...
He vanished.
Vanished?
But, Joyce, people don't just vanish.
Well, Mr. Crosby did.
I ran to the door and Miss Lu was there.
I swear nobody left this room.
Are you sure he was in here?
Well, of course.
You must've heard him talking to me.
I only heard you, talking to yourself.
Well, I'm afraid the strain of excitement's been too much for you, Joyce.
When a woman starts talking to herself, when she sees people vanish right in front of her...
Oh, good heavens, what am I saying?
You're inferring rather plainly that Joyce is losing her mind.
Really? Oh, dear.
You mean you don't believe me?
Why, certainly we do.
Certainly.
But you do believe Mr. Crosby disappeared in front of me?
Well, if that's my imagination, where's Mr. Crosby?
Well, he's probably out in the garden with Fred.
Come, Cicily, let's go to our room, pile the furniture in front of the door and go to bed.
With a house full of maniacs, what good is the bed?
There must be some explanation.
Look, where was Crosby standing when he disappeared?
Exactly where Wally is now.
Can you still see me?
Wally, do go outside and see if Mr. Crosby's with Fred.
Outside?
I'll go...
Oh, but, don't you think I... I'll go.
Charlie, you look upstairs in Mr. Crosby's room.
All right. We'll find him. Don't worry. Yeah?
"You will open this envelope tonight in my room, where you are to sleep."
That's the room where he died.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
The room is ready for you, if you aren't afraid to sleep there.
Unpack my bags, please.
I'll be right in.
Have they found
Mr. Crosby?
Nobody's going to find Mr. Crosby.
The demon in this house has got him.
Don't say such things.
Fred?
Oh, Fred?
Is that you, Fred?
Are you catching cold? Your voice sounds a little hoarse.
Fred?
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?
I was...
Hello. Have you seen Crosby?
No.
When did you come in from the garden?
Who told you
I was out there?
Well, I was just...
Why, everybody.
Everybody was wrong.
What's your game,
Campbell?
My game?
Well, I shoot between 90 and 100.
I used to hook my drives but now I slice my putts.
Have you tried that...
Whatever you're trying to do, keep away from Joyce.
Let her alone, see?
Just let her alone.
I'll put these in the top drawer, miss.
Thank you.
When did Uncle Cyrus give you this?
Ten years ago tonight, just before he died on that bed.
It's no use, miss, trying to keep it to yourself.
Keep what to myself?
The thing that frightened you just before you ran in here.
Oh, that was only my imagination.
It was a warning.
I don't believe in spirits, Miss Lu.
You're afraid.
You're afraid the demon that got
Mr. Crosby is coming after you.
Why, that's absurd.
What is it?
Hello.
Oh, Charlie, what is it?
Well, it's...
Miss Lu, aren't you through in here?
Yes.
Well...
Joyce, you'd better lock your door tonight.
Why?
Oh, just to be on the safe side.
Perhaps I'd better sleep in the library.
Oh. Why should you do that?
In case you need me.
Why should I need you?
I don't know.
You might get nervous or something.
What about? Everyone seems to be acting so strangely,
I'm beginning to think
I'm losing my mind.
Well, anyway, if you want me, call.
Thanks.
Oh, and, Joyce, don't forget your promise to...
See you tomorrow.
Oh.
Don't worry about a thing.
You don't have to lock it, I'm here.
No, I'm rather glad you are here, Wally.
Oh, really?
Yeah, it's nice seeing each other again like this after all these years.
Mmm-hmm.
How you feeling?
Oh, I'm all right.
I'd feel better if they'd find Mr. Crosby.
Wally, tell me, what's going on?
What are you all driving at?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
But whatever it is,
I just want to tell you that I'll protect you.
There isn't anything living that I'm afraid of, hardly.
Oh! It's only the clock.
Oh.
Oh, I thought my time had come.
I'm awfully sorry. I guess this house is getting me.
Now what was I saying? Oh, yes.
I'm not afraid of...
You know I'm lying, don't you?
I'm scared stiff.
But I'm always like that.
I'm always nervous just before I go into action, so scared or not, you're gonna get protected.
You always did fight for me, didn't you, Wally?
Even back there in Wickford.
Remember when you used to carry my books to school?
Yeah, what a racket that was.
Yes, and the time Big
Jim Daley pulled my hair and you flew at him and what a terrible beating...
He gave me.
I'll never forget it.
Seems I always got licked fighting for you.
Well, maybe it was worth it.
Cicily!
Oh, listen, Joyce, if there's a rumpus or anything, don't come out.
You just sit tight and yell like the devil.
Well, what will you do?
Why, I'll...
I'll run and get help.
Don't worry.
I don't worry when you're around, Wally.
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks. Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
It just makes my heart ache to see her.
I'm afraid she's beginning to break.
Who, Aunt Sue?
Joyce.
All she needs is one more shock.
A remark like that wouldn't sound very well, in case you happened to be the second heir.
If Cyrus hadn't been utterly incompetent,
I'd have been the first heir.
What's that?
Mr. Crosby?
No, sir. This is
Hendricks, from the asylum.
Can I be of any service to you?
I thought you'd gone.
I can't leave, ma'am, till my men come back for me with the boat.
Oh. Well, have you seen Mr. Crosby?
He's the grey-haired gentleman you were talking to a while ago.
No,
I haven't.
He disappeared.
He couldn't have gone far, unless he went swimming.
Would you mind looking about the grounds for him? lt'll be a pleasure, ma'am.
Thank you so much.
Well, if you need me, just call.
My room is right up there.
Thanks, Fred. I guess
I'll be pretty safe tonight with all the men guarding me.
Charlie just told me the same thing.
So he was here.
Leave it to him to get anywhere first.
Shh!
I wouldn't do that if
I were you, beautiful.
Do what?
Entertain any more people in your room tonight.
I won't.
Have you read the letter?
No, I haven't.
Wally, come in here a minute.
"You will open this envelope tonight in my room,
"where you are to sleep."
Don't do it.
Why not?
I don't know. My Aunt Minnie brought me up to always bite half dollars.
Look, Miss Lu says that
Mr. Norman gave this to her.
But how do we know he did?
Maybe Miss Lu is in cahoots with someone who wants to know exactly where he can find you tonight, while you're alone.
But who would that be?
Well, the person whose name is in the envelope that Crosby has.
Whoever it is would become the heir, in case you were out of the way.
Wally, that's a horrible thought.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
I got goose pimples.
Even my goose pimples have goose pimples.
Let's get a gulp of fresh air.
I'll bet there hasn't been any fresh air in this house for a long time.
There. That's better.
Yes.
Oh, you're going to...
I thought I would as long as you're here.
"To my unknown heir, man or woman,
"because I can take no earthly possessions with me
"I am compelled to leave them to you.
"Your hour will come, too."
"In your brief span of life,
"enjoy the glittering symbols of the world, which I now renounce."
Ooh, that gives me the creeps.
Here's a verse. It's a little more cheerful.
"Find the number beneath the vine.
"The sparkling gems will then be thine.
"O love, what number rhymes with mine?"
It's a silly little verse.
Yeah.
Say, Wally, it's the key to the necklace.
Yeah.
"What number rhymes with mine?"
Well, it ain't 10.
Nine. "Beneath the vine."
That must be outdoors in the garden.
Why does he say "o love"?
What does love have to do with it?
Love, affection, Venus, the goddess of love.
Say, is there a statue of Venus around this joint anywhere? I don't know.
Wait.
Look.
The fountain.
Cupid. Sure. Venus' little problem child.
Let's go.
Let me get my jacket.
Wally.
Hmm?
Look.
How funny.
How comforting.
Come on.
Which way?
Up there at the end of the hall.
Shh.
There's someone in
Mr. Crosby's room.
Maybe it's
Mr. Crosby.
What are you doing in there?
Waiting.
What's she waiting for?
Certainly will be glad to get out of this terrible house.
Well, here's love.
The vine. The vine.
Beneath the vine.
Yes, the vine.
Do you suppose we have to dig it up by the roots?
I don't see any number nine.
Look, look, the knobs.
Yeah. Maybe he meant the ninth knob.
Where do they start? I don't know.
One, two, three, four, five...
Six, seven, eight, nine.
Wait a minute. Here's one that's loose.
Now that we got it, what are we going to do with it?
I don't know.
Turn it, pull it.
Nothing happens.
Well, Uncle Cyrus was left-handed.
Would that make any difference? No.
Well, maybe.
No, I guess the old boy was kidding.
It's no good.
Oh, dear.
Hey, look.
Say...
What's the matter?
Something soft.
Here, I'll get it.
No, I... Let me.
Say...
Wow!
I bet there's a catch in this somewhere.
Oh, Wally!
Say, wouldn't it be a good idea to put it back in there where it'll be safe until daylight?
Well, I don't know... No, I think it'll be safer with me.
Come on, let's go.
Isn't it terrific?
Terrific.
Thanks for everything, Wally.
Uh, say, if you're gonna sleep with those pebbles tonight, you'd better take the gun.
You used to be quite a shot with an air rifle.
Remember the time you shot the hole in old Scrooge's silk hat?
I haven't fired a gun since...
Did you know this was empty?
Empty?
How do you like that?
Hey, wait a minute, I was out there all alone.
Never in my...
Oh. I guess I'm beginning to see things.
What is the matter?
I don't know, only...
I guess, I think.
What's that?
Think nothing of it.
Now, what were you saying?
Keep talking.
It wasn't important.
It was only that I think every woman is happier when she has a lot of...
Oh, be careful.
A cat.
Of all the ridiculous things I ever saw in my life.
You with the chair, creeping up to the window.
Wham! And a cat.
Take it easy.
Joyce! Joyce!
Aunt Sue is loose again.
Joyce! Joyce, are you there? Open up.
Yes. In a minute.
Come on.
Wait. My mother brought me up never to be caught twice in the same lady's bedroom.
Joyce!
Joyce, what happened?
Just a minute.
Open the door, Joyce.
Are you all right? Oh, yes, I am all right.
It was so silly.
What?
I wanted to get a breath of fresh air and the window stuck.
I broke it just as I was trying to open it.
Oh, is that all? How did you get the...
But then I got all tangled up in the curtain with the cat.
The cat. Miss Lu, will you please take your cat?
Now I promise to go straight to bed and I won't disturb you any more.
Well, that window is barred, so I guess it's all right.
Good night.
Oh, wait for me, Fred. Good night, dear.
Good night.
Did you say the window stuck?
Yes, it stuck.
Okay.
Wally. Wally!
Come in.
Pretty good, huh?
Ouch!
Riding boots.
I suppose your Aunt Minnie taught you that cute trick.
No, I got that one from her boyfriend.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I guess
I'll run along.
Do you want me to lock the shutters?
No. Just don't make any more noise.
Oh. Well, good night.
The road's clear. Be sure and lock the door after me.
Don't worry,
I will.
Good night, beautiful.
I didn't mean to be cross.
I'm getting so nervous, I could holler.
Would you like something to quiet you? A sleeping powder?
No, thanks. I have one in my bag.
Well, how about letting me have it?
Good night, Wally.
Never mind the powder.
Who wants to sleep?
Open! Please!
Please, Wally!
Joyce, open up.
Open the door.
Haven't you got another key?
It's locked on the inside. What's happened?
We don't know.
She's alive, thank heaven.
Miss Lu, get a little brandy.
Please help! Please, oh, please! Help me! Wally!
What happened, baby?
I don't know. My eyes were closed.
It was a hand! It came from the dark.
I felt it.
For heaven's sake, do try to be coherent!
Well, it touched me!
The necklace.
It's gone.
What necklace?
Well, the necklace.
Wally and I, we found it in the garden.
Hanging from a tree, I suppose.
It's true, we did find it.
But it's gone.
The hand took it.
Hand. What hand?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hand.
It came out of the wall.
Oh. We'd better send for a doctor.
An alienist would be better.
The poor child's gone stark staring mad.
Shut up.
Every one of you thinks just the same as I do, that Joyce has lost her mind.
But I haven't.
You must believe me.
How can we, Joyce?
After all, when someone starts concocting a story about a hand coming out of a wall...
You can't...
You don't really think that I...
Susan's right.
Every one of you feels exactly as she feels about me, only...
Only they haven't got the courage to say it.
I don't.
I know you don't, Wally.
I've been through enough tonight to drive anyone mad.
But I'm not.
Now listen.
Wally and I found the necklace that Cyrus left me in the garden.
Then he said good night to me and I got ready for bed.
Someone was watching me. I know that now.
Someone who was trying to frighten me.
Then...
Just as I was falling asleep,
I felt somebody in the room.
I opened my eyes, a long claw-like hand came out of the wall!
And it came nearer and nearer to me...
I couldn't move and it touched me.
Very sad.
You'd all like to prove that
Joyce is crazy, wouldn't you?
Because that would give you another chance at old Norman's dough.
That's pretty rotten talk, Wally.
Well, that's the way I feel.
Personally,
I believe Joyce.
You believe that fantastic story?
Haven't you clucks ever heard of secret passageways and panels?
Panels.
Well, how else could the hand that Joyce saw come through the wall?
Let's see this.
It came from right there, Wally.
Well, there's nothing here.
Wait a minute.
This is loose.
Hey, what's this?
Listen, baby, don't be surprised if we discover an old skeleton in here.
Crosby.
He's dead.
What a terrible thing.
Poor Mr. Crosby.
It might just as well have been any one of us.
Can you imagine being in bed with a hand reaching for your throat?
Quiet! Where's Joyce?
Miss Lu and Wally took her into the dining room.
The poor kid. What she's been through.
Isn't anybody going to do something?
Well, if you mean isn't anybody going into that dark passage to argue with a maniac, the answer is no.
You know, I doubt very much that it was a maniac.
Whoever it was in that secret passage acted quite sanely.
That's right.
What would a lunatic want with a necklace?
Don't ask me.
You've got to be loony to answer that question.
Just what's in your mind, Fred?
Well, I...
Wait a minute.
If somebody's trying to drive Joyce out of her mind, it's no impromptu affair.
Well, one of our little family party has called the turn on everything that's happened here tonight.
Uh-huh,
Wally Campbell.
That's a lot of hooey.
Yeah? Don't you remember he wanted to bet you that
Joyce would be the heir?
Yeah.
Well, he was with Joyce when she located the necklace.
But he wasn't with her when it was taken.
And he knew where to find that secret panel in the wall, too.
If you're hinting that Wally
Campbell murdered Mr. Crosby,
I don't believe it!
Neither do I.
Oh, darling, are you better?
Yes, I'm all right but what were you saying?
Go on. I want to hear it.
Well, I was just...
Go ahead, Fred.
I'm just saying, suppose Wally knew that his name was in that second envelope. As the alternate heir?
Well, that's ridiculous. How could he know?
How could anyone?
Someone knew.
Both envelopes had been opened before Lawyer Crosby got here tonight.
Now I know what happened to Crosby.
There must be an entrance to that secret passageway from this room.
What?
Yeah.
Crosby knew the danger Joyce was in, and while he was warning her...
Somebody pulled him in behind the panel and strangled him.
The explanation is so obvious to anyone with an ounce of brains.
You don't have to get insulting about it.
It was a pleasure.
Maybe you and I had better finish this conversation outside.
All right. Fine.
Hey, now. Cut it.
Listen, you gave Wally plenty of reason for any crack he could think of. Now cool off!
A fight won't prove who killed Crosby.
That's the important thing right now.
There's that clock.
It isn't the clock.
Oh.
Five.
Six.
The warning has come again.
Oh.
Nothing can stop it.
Oh.
Last time that gong rang, Mr. Crosby...
All right, take it easy, Cicily.
I'm going to my room.
If Charlie will walk upstairs with me.
Certainly.
And we'll be glad to have you,
Joyce, if you care to join us.
Thanks.
Listen, everybody, until we can notify the police, nobody, under any circumstances, is to go into that room where Mr. Crosby is.
Who wants to?
Whether you want to or not, that's the law.
Meanwhile, I'll try to find Hendricks and send him for the police.
You know this whole thing has a phony ring to me.
A killer who thinks he's a cat.
Have you ever seen a man who looked and acted like a cat?
A woman, yes.
But a man...
Anyway, how do we know a lunatic escaped from an asylum?
Well, the guard,
Hendricks.
Yeah, but how do you know he is a guard?
Just because he wears a cap and a badge?
You can rent them at any costumers.
All right. But why?
To frighten you out of your beautiful wits, baby.
Yes. But why should he?
Why should he?
I don't know.
I wish I knew who that next heir is.
Maybe it's a woman.
Let's see. What women have we?
There's Miss Lu.
Miss Lu, how about her?
She must know a lot about that secret panel.
Why has she lived here all these years if she didn't expect to...
What's the matter?
I'm going into that bedroom and get that envelope out of Crosby's pocket.
The name of the second heir is in that envelope, and the name of the second heir is the name of the murderer.
Oh, if it turns out to be my name, I'm only kidding.
Wally, please don't go in there.
Suppose we've been overheard?
Suppose the murderer knows you're on the right track?
What good would an empty gun be?
But it isn't empty now.
I found the bullets.
Where?
In Miss Lu's room. Here.
You keep it. Well...
Well, legs, let's get going.
Oh, Wally, how can you joke?
I always joke when I'm scared.
I kind of kid myself into being brave.
Ain't that silly?
Uh-huh.
Oh, easy, baby, easy.
I remember a situation almost like this in an old play called The Fatal Hour, or She Should've
Known Better.
At the end of the second act, the leading man takes the heroine in his arms and kisses her.
Then, filled with new courage, he starts out after the villain.
And of course, he comes back in the third act?
Oh, sure.
No, in the third act he's found dead in the bathtub.
Oh, well, that was just a play.
I'll leave the door open.
Say, if anybody comes down, don't let them know what I'm doing.
Wally!
Wally, what is it? Wally!
Somebody please! Wally.
What's happened now?
I don't know.
I don't know. Look, is he badly hurt?
He's got a swell bump.
It's hard to say whether somebody hit him or whether it came from a fall.
What was he doing in here?
He came to get the... To get my jacket.
Charlie?
Hmm?
It's gone.
What?
Crosby's gone.
Oh.
Who could've done such a thing?
The one who killed him.
The law can't convict you of murder if there's no corpse.
Help me up.
Who did it?
I haven't the smokiest idea. I was just...
What became of Crosby?
Are you sure you don't know?
I'm not sure of anything.
Just when I get the whole thing figured out, it goes and gets itself all balled up again.
We saw Crosby fall to the floor, didn't we?
Yes. He was dead, wasn't he?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Ah-ha!
What is it, Wally, what is it?
How do we know he was dead?
He was, wasn't he?
Well, I suppose he was, but that doesn't prove it.
I couldn't swear he was dead, neither could you.
Could you? What are you getting at?
Maybe the whole thing was only a plant.
Maybe he was faking all the time to frighten you and waiting in there to wallop me.
Oh, no, Wally.
No. You don't think much of that?
No.
Neither do I.
Oh, Charlie, did you find Hendricks?
Yes. He said the police can't reach here until morning.
He's still waiting for his own men.
They're lost somewhere in the bayou.
The telephone.
Either you don't know the nearest telephone is 20 miles away or else you should know more about this thing than is good for you.
Who? Me?
Same place.
Why don't they have a telephone?
People going around here bopping each other on the head, they need a phone.
What is it?
Nothing, I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Thank you, Charlie.
I can't stand another minute.
Oh, that's just what they're hoping for, honey.
But you can take it. Come on, roll with the punches.
Let's go over here by the fireplace and relax. There.
You know, what this party needs is more drinks and more laughs.
I'll tell you.
I'll bring a bottle of
Scotch from the dining room and we'll sit around here and drink Scotch and make wry faces.
You get it?
Scotch and rye?
Here. I don't need a gun with jokes like that.
Look, you play Jesse James and I'll play, well...
Well, I'll play like I'm getting a bottle of Scotch.
Come on, relax.
All right.
Whoever it is, speak or I'll fire.
Speak or I'll fire.
I knew it. Joyce!
Joyce!
Joyce, look here.
Wally?
Wally, where are you?
Wally?
Wally!
Joyce, I found it, the clue. I...
Joyce.
Joyce!
Joyce!
No, you don't.
One killing is enough.
Bringing guns and scaring women's one thing, murder's something else.
I'm all washed up.
Where's that necklace?
That's all I want out of this.
Joyce!
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Charlie.
Charlie!
Don't move.
You robbed me of my inheritance.
I was the old man's favorite.
I should have been his heir.
I am the next heir.
Stop.
I've waited 10 years for this.
You poisoned old man
Norman's mind against me.
I've always hated you.
And now
I've got you.
Don't come any closer.
Don't take another step.
Joyce! Joyce!
Wally!
Where are you, Joyce?
Joyce, are you all right?
Yeah, she's all right.
Oh, boy. Some fun.
Hold it. Miss Norman, tell me...
Oh, don't ask me questions, boys.
Wally, Mr. Campbell here, is the real hero.
Mr. Campbell, what was the clue you found?
Hold it.
You'll get a better picture of me from a front angle, Rembrandt.
I knew all the time that whoever killed Crosby was the second heir.
And you found the second envelope?
I found it in the coat that was covering Crosby's body in the secret passage.
It was Wilder's coat.
Say, you better get a couple of shots of Miss Norman and me together.
You're liable to need them very soon for your page of social events.
Yeah?
Congratulations.
How did you know... Do you intend to live in your house,
Miss Norman?
No, it's
Miss Lu's now.
I'm giving it to her.
How did you know the
Cat was Charlie Wilder?
Well, I found something earlier in the night on the floor in the hallway.
What, a weapon?
Patience.
You know,
I always suspected that the
Cat was wearing a make-up.
As an actor I've often used sponge rubber in putting on a character make-up.
So, gentlemen, when I found this piece of sponge rubber...
Sponge rubber?
Have you got it?
Let me get a picture of it. Of course, my good man.
Shove off.
There they go.
Why don't we get started?
Bye.
Goodbye, Joyce.
Bye, Wally.
Goodbye. Bye.
Wally. This rubber, it must have fallen out of my coat.
It's the eraser I use when I'm sketching.
What was that?
What did you say?
Oh, that's funny. She says that's the eraser she...
Huh? What?

- The smaller one's the Tower of the Sun. - [Woman] Oh, I see that-
Gee, Pop, I hope Mr. Essex isn't missing any of this.
[Chuckles] Don't miss the view, Mr. Gregory.
- It's the Fair.
- I'll wait and see the one in New York.
You would. I'll take California.
Hey, Mr. Essex, come over on this side... and maybe you can see your wife from here.
Hey, Mr. Essex, wake up.
Paul. Paul?
Pop! Hey, Pop, something's wrong.
Paul.
- He must be sick.
- Take your seats, please. We're landing.
Your seats, please. Something wrong?
- Is he... dead?
- [Steward] Must have been his heart.
- [Man] What's the trouble?
- Go back to your seats, please. We're about to land.
- Please be seated.
- [Woman] I don't know what happened.
L- Look, Pop. The radiogram was on the floor.
"Sign of Scorpio indicates disaster...
"if zodiac obligations ignored.
Unsigned. "
"Zodiac"? Isn't that the chart astrologers use to tell fortunes?
And Scorpio, I believe, is the unfortunate symbol of death.
Not correct, but thank you.
All luggage to be inspected at Customs.
All luggage to be inspected at Customs.
All luggage to be inspected at Customs.
- Say, Pop, have you seen Paul's briefcase?
- No.
- [Woman] Too bad about Mr. Essex.
- It was here a minute ago.
Where's Gregory?
Perhaps will find same holding briefcase in Customs.
Why, I'll take care of him.
Say, Pop, l- I just thought- Paul's wife-
If she's there to meet him, what are you gonna tell her?
Only that which comes from heart.
- [All Chattering]
- [Man] Hi, Ed!
- I don't see Paul yet. - Paul wouldn't be in the line yet-
- Oh, there's Charlie over there. Mr. Chan! - Who? Oh, uh-
Oh, Mr. Chan!
- I'd better go back to Customs and try to find Gregory, Pop.
- Mmm.
Hello, Charlie. It's grand to see you again. Where's Paul?
Oh, uh, you don't know my uncle, Mr. Redley.
- I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Chan.
- Thank you.
Stella, wish tongue could find words to tell you-
What's keeping Paul? Oh, you've no idea how I've missed him this past month.
Impossible to miss someone who will always be in heart.
Why, everybody's gone. I don't see him.
- Where is he,
Charlie? - Stella-
Is that someone from the plane?
Most unhappy accident.
Something's happened to Paul.
Strength of heart not equal to homecoming.
Paul's dead?
Oh, no! Oh, Paul!
I knew there was something wrong. His strange radiogram-
It came last night. We couldn't understand it.
"Can't escape zodiac.
Good-bye, my love. Paul."
May see, please?
We don't know what he meant by that word "zodiac."
Paul certainly didn't believe in astrology.
Think best you take Mrs. Essex home now. Will join you there.
Oh, uh, did he finish the manuscript?
There's a check waiting for it from his publisher.
Please, what is your interest in same?
Why, I handled his business affairs.
- Better to consider Mrs. Essex at this time.
- Yes.
- Cab, sir?
- Uh, thank you. May reserve one, please?
- [Whistle Blows]
- Number eight up!
- Get in.
- Uh, must wait for son.
- That's all right, sir. You can wait in the cab.
- Oh.
Excuse, please. Have no wish to intrude. Wanted private cab.
Never mind what you wanted. Stay put.
And don't try anything funny.
Something very funny in being taken prisoner in broad daylight... in city renowned for hospitality.
You're gonna get plenty of hospitality.
Hope hospitality will have same generous size as shoes of brother policemen.
- [Both Laugh]
- Hey, why'd you go for the rib, huh?
We couldn't put anything over on you, Charlie.
[Men Shouting]
- Some pinch, eh, Charlie?
- How was it?
Recognize your hand in joke, Mr. Kilvaine.
Well, we just couldn't let you slip into town without a welcome, Charlie.
Appreciate most hospitable welcome... but have matter of importance which need attention first.
Oh, don't give me that.
Come on into my office.
It's been a long time since
I've seen you, Charlie.
You and I are gonna have a good old- fashioned chin-fest. How's everything in Honolulu?
- Anybody stealing pineapples?
- What are you horning in for?
- Charlie doesn't want to be interviewed.
- Interview, my eye.
I've known Charlie ever since I started covering the police blotter...
- at the old Powell Street station.
- Police reporter...
- Pete Lewis friend of many years.
- Well, I'm on time.
Oh, it's you. Say, isn't that sign
"private" on my door big enough for you?
Forget it. I told him to meet me here. Fred, I want you-
Don't tell me. Charlie Chan.
I'd know that face anyplace.
Can return compliment. You are magician named Rhadini.
Cannot forget watch you borrow five years ago for trick and return in many pieces.
- [Laughing]
- You're lucky you got it back at all.
Rhadini's improved now,
Charlie. He's a big shot.
Has his own theater
- the Temple of Magic on Treasure Island.
And my paper's backing him in an exposé of fake psychics.
Would you like to see some of my press clippings?
Pete's paper's offering a thousand dollars to any psychic... phony or otherwise, whose stunts I can't duplicate on the stage of my theater.
[Pete] And so far no one's collected
- not even the great Dr. Zodiac.
- Zodiac?
- Yeah, he's the big shot in the spook racket around here.
The only trouble is, he won't fall for our challenge.
- He won't come out in the open where I can get at him.
- Now listen, you two mugs.
If you don't mind, I got Charlie up here for a little private conversation.
He's heard all he wants about black magic.
No, no. Most interesting.
Sometimes black magic very close relative to blackmail.
Now who said anything about blackmail?
Why, don't you get it? Those phony psychics dig up the dirt... hand it over to the customers in a séance, then hold them up.
That might be the reason for those three suicides recently.
Say, they all happened to be clients of Dr. Zodiac.
Yeah, but they're dead. They can't help us prove anything.
And the living ones won't talk because they're afraid...
of rattling the skeletons in the family closets.
[Kilvaine] Ah, you're talking through your hat.
If there was any evidence connecting
Zodiac with those suicides, I'd-
Well, what can I do without evidence?
Uh, very little, perhaps. But will ask coroner to perform autopsy...
on body of Paul Essex, who died most suddenly on China Clipper this morning.
Essex, mystery writer?
He took a trip to Honolulu about six weeks ago to write a story about the spook racket?
Say, we were talkin' about
Zodiac. Or does that connect up?
[Rhadini] It might-if Essex was a client of Dr. Zodiac's.
- What are you holding back?
- Did you speak to Essex before he died?
- Did he tell you anything?
- Was he a client of Dr. Zodiac's?
- Did he commit suicide?
- Please, please. Cannot answer question now.
But in humble opinion, suicide induced by blackmail is murder.
So sorry. Must leave now... to meet unfortunate widow, Mrs. Essex.
Excuse, please. Excuse.
- Gimme that telephone!
- Outside! This is for official business.
Hey, Charlie said he was going to meet Paul Essex's wife.
- One'll get you 10 he's on his way to Zodiac's right now.
- And he'll get in. Come on!
- What are we waiting for?
- To give him a head start. We'll crash Zodiac's gate with him.
Hey, Pop. The taxi starter told me a couple of fellas brought you here. What's up?
They merely brought greetings from old friend Deputy Chief Kilvaine.
Oh. I didn't find Paul's briefcase.
Gregory gave me the slip at Customs. But if we could get ahold of that manuscript-
Please remember
- Have given trusting parent promise... to apply mental ability to schoolbooks.
- Mr. Chan, I've got a message for you.
- Oh.
What is it?
What is it, Pop?
Here. Engage rooms at St. Francis Hotel.
And when Mrs. Essex call, say will be delayed.
- But what's in the note?
- Ancient Chinese proverb, badly misquoted.
Should read: "Do not challenge supernatural... unless armed with sword of truth."
[Vehicle Approaching]
- Wait for us.
- Nothin' doin'. I know this spook joint.
Full of dead people talkin' their heads off.
[Chuckles] Well, Charlie, fancy meeting you here.
Had anticipated fancy. Surprised you did not arrive first.
Oh, let me introduce Professor Bixby of Berkeley. Great psychologist.
- Mr. Chan.
- Most happy to meet eminent professor of magic...
hiding under psychological whiskers.
- Quiet, Charlie.
- I told you we couldn't fool him.
If Zodiac finds out Rhadini's with us, he'll never let us in.
Thrown me out a dozen times, but I figured
I could sneak in under the hair mattress.
Will make first test of Dr. Zodiac's mystic powers on penetrating false whiskers.
Let's go.
Excuse, please. May consult with Dr. Zodiac?
Dr. Zodiac will be happy to receive the celebrated detective, Charlie Chan...
and his friends.
Thank you so much.
It beats me, Charlie. That face of yours can open more doors than a passkey.
Dr. Zodiac is native of San Francisco?
Dr. Zodiac is a native of the universe.
He knows all things about all people.
Follow me, please.
In this room, gentlemen.
- ~~[Eerie Background]
- Make yourselves comfortable, please.
I will announce you to Dr. Zodiac.
Boy, what a layout.
Say, I couldn't put on a better act myself.
He's got all the props: incense, music-
Advise caution. Even draperies may have ears.
What a lot of phony junk.
No. Very genuine and valuable antiques.
Table lamp of ancient Egypt
- Ramses dynasty.
This is Persian sacrificial knife.
Also very, very old.
[Gong Resounds]
[Man's Voice] Dr. Zodiac, the Eye of Allamata.
Mr. Chan, I am honored.
Thank you. Privilege is mine.
It certainly is a privilege, Dr.
Zodiac. I'm Pete Lewis of the Chronicle.
How do you do, Mr. Lewis?
I have heard of your campaign to expose the charlatans... who prey on a too-susceptible public.
- I heartily agree with it.
- And I'm Professor Bixby of Berkeley.
I'm profoundly interested in your work, Doctor.
Thank you. Be seated, gentlemen.
You will make a most intelligent and unusual circle.
How can I serve you?
Humbly request you penetrate beyond the mystic veil of life... and communicate with friend recently departed.
That is the supreme demonstration.
Please join me in silent meditation... while I seek my control-
an Egyptian priestess who passed beyond 3,000 years ago.
[Moaning Through Horn]
[Rattling]
[Woman's Voice] Zodiac. Zodiac.
I am here.
I am here.
You have a message for Mr. Chan?
There is someone... newly arrived in the spirit world... who wishes to get through to Mr. Chan.
I will help him.
He is a man who was named Paul Essex.
Ask the question that fills your mind, Mr. Chan.
Paul, old friend...
Charlie Chan most grieved.
Cannot understand death which struck so suddenly.
[Paul's Voice] My heart-
My heart was tired.
Stopped.
Who drove you to suicide?
[Paul's Voice] No suicide.
Then you were not victim of blackmail?
There was no blackmail.
What was meaning of radiogram,
"Cannot escape zodiac"?
Stars were against me.
[Charlie] Can explain more clearly, please?
[Woman's Voice] Paul Essex... is not strong enough yet to talk any longer.
Do either of the other... gentlemen care to ask a question?
Yes. I'd like to know something about a girl.
And she's not in the spirit world either.
You want to know about... a girl named Eve Cairo.
You must not think of marrying her. She is psychic.
She is one of us.
You must not interfere with her work.
So that's what you've been telling Eve! I know she comes here.
- You might have her buffaloed, but you don't fool me.
- I've had enough of this faker.
How can you sit there and insult our intelligence? I'm going to expose your tricks-
Stay where you are, Mr. Rhadini.
So you thought that I would not see through your childish disguise.
I would have let it pass in respect to
Mr. Chan had you not shown your hand.
- Now leave this house. - Why, you cheap four-flusher. I'll give you a blast... in print that'll run you out of this town like the rest of the gyp fortune-tellers.
If you do, Mr. Lewis, your paper will pay me a large sum for damages.
I do not predict the future.
What you witnessed here was a scientific demonstration.
Regret most sincerely unfortunate termination of séance.
I accept your apology, Mr. Chan.
I know these two... gentlemen forced their company on you when you entered my house.
My servant will see you out. Good day.
Are we gonna let him get away with that?
- We oughta take the place apart.
- Would not recommend violence.
Have no authority to intrude on privacy without search warrant.
The fee for the consultation, gentlemen, will be $20.
- What?
- What? Try and get it.
If request music, must be willing to pay for fiddler.
- I could get you a whole orchestra for that price.
- [Charlie] Should not complain.
Received most enlightening message concerning lady friend.
Well, Eve and I are going to get married, no matter what that faker had to say.
Eve Cairo's part of my act,
Charlie. Pete met her through me.
She's tops in mind reading.
- Mind reading?
- She's on the level, Charlie. Her stuff's no gag.
And I'm gonna have a showdown with her tonight. She's not coming here anymore.
Very wise. Dr. Zodiac man of great ego.
Enjoys using power to dominate lives of others.
Advise caution. To destroy false prophet... must first unmask him before eyes of believers.
[Phone Rings]
Yes, please?
Oh. Hello, Mr. Kilvaine.
You get autopsy report?
You had a hunch, Charlie. There was enough poison in Paul Essex's stomach... to have polished off 10 men.
Think it was plain suicide or fancy murder?
Voice of crime still very faint.
Think it best you tell newspapers, coroner reports suicide.
Pete tells me you sprung the blackmail angle on Zodiac.
What's up, Charlie? Was he squeezing Paul Essex?
Hunch say yes, but facts say maybe.
Will keep you informed. Good-bye.
[Deep Voice] Good evening, Mr. Chan.
May I have a minute of your time?
Do you have a son named Jimmy Chan?
Wearer of disguise only fool chambermaid.
[Normal Voice] Aw, gee, Pop.
Father who depends on son is happy or foolish according to son.
Please, job.
Hey, this is my tie
- my best tie.
Little mouse lucky his clothes do not fit elephant.
You haven't asked me where I've been.
Looking for Mr. Gregory.
Yeah. I checked at several hotels, and I found him too.
He's registered at the Walling, and he's got Paul's briefcase with him.
But when he saw busybody son, he vanished.
That's right. When he saw me, he ducked out of the lobby, and then I lost him.
What time was this?
Gee, Pop, l-I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't look at the time.
Was Gregory at Hotel Walling at 4:00?
Yes. No, uh, earlier, I think.
Yes, earlier. No, I'm... not sure.
But if it's important, I can check.
- Right now check into dress clothes.
- Where are we going?
Have invitation to a small party
Mr. Rhadini gives on Treasure Island.
- You don't like parties.
- Am anxious to make acquaintance... of girlfriend of newspaperman- girl who believes and obeys Dr. Zodiac.
But I'd like to help out. We've got to find that briefcase.
Can best help out by disguising self as obedient son for few hours.
Come.
Don't wait for me, Pop. See you later.
What you say?
- ~~[Hawaiian]
- [Men Chanting]
Hello, Irma. How are you?
It's swell of you to come. Glad to see you.
Make yourself at home, will ya?
~~[Continues]
Hey, why aren't you serving?
- You told me to act like a guest, didn't ya?
- Now look, Elmer.
I only asked you to be helpful.
Now leave the food alone.
What's the matter? Ain't it any good?
~~[Continues]
Okay. I can take a hint.
I've been anxious to meet you, Mr. Chan.
Also happy to meet future wife of old friend.
Very future. I'll have a long white beard down to here if she keeps holding out.
Pete told me what you're up to, Mr. Chan, and you're wrong.
Dr. Zodiac's a genius. You'll never expose him as a fraud.
[Pete] Don't stop a fella from trying.
Pete, if I have any gift for reading minds, then-
There's no argument about that.
Then others can be gifted to read the future.
Can tell if anything is on mind of that young man?
[Grunting]
- [Grunting Continues]
- [Others Screaming]
[Pete Laughs]
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hello, Mrs. Sibley.
Still monopolizing Mr. Chan? Won't you give poor little me a chance to talk to him?
Here he is. Talk your head off.
Tell him what a great guy Zodiac is.
- [Eve] Now, Pete, none of that.
- [Pete] Sometimes I think she steers for him.
- What on earth do you mean?
- You got Eve to go to Zodiac. She was sane till then.
Darling, she didn't make me go.
We never had a row till you met him.
- You better get ready, Eve. You're on soon.
- Yes. Excuse us, please.
Well, Bessie, I see you've cornered Mr. Chan.
You better watch out, Charlie. Mrs.
Sibley thrives on scandal and husbands.
Never let one go around with a mussed-up tie.
[Rhadini] You, uh, better not let my wife catch you doing this.
Mmm. She knew she was marrying a popular man, didn't she?
Yeah. She hasn't asked for a divorce yet either. [Chuckles]
Well, let's sit down.
- Oh, hello, Myra, darling. Where have you been?
- Behaving myself.
- Do you know Mrs. Rhadini?
- We've met.
- Now who on earth mussed you up?
- Huh? Oh.
Does anybody want some of this stuff? It ain't bad.
No, Elmer.
Well, I just said it ain't bad, that's all.
The people my husband picks up. Anything for a laugh.
Myra, darling, you're not looking a bit well.
Hasn't Dr. Zodiac been able to cheer you up?
- I wouldn't believe that faker under oath.
- Then why go to him?
[Myra] It was Mrs. Sibley's idea.
Oh, but you were so worried about
Rhadini and his popularity with the girls.
- [Laughs]
- Darling, let me worry about him.
You worry about that husband of yours who died.
What do you mean?
Didn't his sudden exit have the district attorney bothered?
- Oh, now, Myra- - It's awfully stuffy here.
Excuse me, please.
Why, that jealous guttersnipe.
Don't ever pick a knife thrower for a wife, Mr. Chan.
- Sharp words from sharp tongue?
- No, I mean real knives.
She used to be in vaudeville.
Thinks she's an actress.
Dr. Zodiac can't help her. She's too conceited.
I beg your pardon. Are you Mr. Rhadini?
No. There's Mr. Rhadini over there.
Oh, thank you. Excuse me.
- What- Uh, excuse, please? -
[Bessie] I said she's too conceited.
Good evening, Mr. Rhadini. It's awfully nice of you to invite me here tonight.
I'm glad to have you. Make yourself at home. Give the house a good name.
Thank you. I'll do my best.
Say, Bessie, you know everybody.
Who's that fellow over there?
Thank you.
Well, he's a new one to me.
But he looks interesting.
- You do not know own guest?
- I never laid eyes on him before.
Pardon me, Mr. Chan. You're wanted on the telephone.
- I'll show you the way, Charlie.
- Excuse, please.
Hurry back, Mr. Chan. I want all the news about Honolulu.
Oh, excuse me a minute, Charlie. The phone's right over there. You can't miss it.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Didn't you say I could be a guest?
I didn't tell you to make a pig out of yourself.
Well, if you invite me, you gotta invite my tapeworm.
Yes? Who, please? Who?
It's only me, Pop-Jimmy.
I've located Gregory, and he's registered right here in our hotel.
Mr. Gregory here at party now.
I know it. I sent him a fake invitation so that he'd leave his room, and I could search it.
You invite Gregory?
Keep an eye on him, will you? Good-bye.
- ~~[Ends]
- Uh-
- [Applause]
- Mr. Chan, I thought I recognized you.
- Good evening.
- Strange we should meet again so soon.
Odds are about 40-to-1 against travel mates meeting within 48 hours.
- I've made a study of it.
- Even here you pursue art of statistics?
Everywhere
- even in my sleep.
[Bells Chiming]
Charlie, Eve's just about to go on, and I don't want you to miss her.
Now look, if you folks will bring your chairs up a little closer... we're gonna have a little entertainment for you... by one of the finest prestidigit- presti-
He's a magician. I know you all know him. Needs no introduction to you.
The Great Rhadini! Ta-da!
Thank you, thank you. Now before we go any further, l-
Uh, Irma, would you mind holding this cage for me, please?
- [Irma Laughs]
- Just a sample.
As you all know, I give two performances a day at the Temple of Magic.
I didn't ask you to come here tonight to watch me perform.
I want to introduce a little lady from my show whom I consider... the world's greatest living mind reader.
It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Eve Cairo.
Would you mind putting out the lights, please?
Thank you. Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I must ask for absolute quiet.
Under hypnosis, Miss Cairo becomes a delicate radio-receiving apparatus... tuned to every forceful mind.
Thank you.
[Steady Ticking]
Your eyes close.
You will sleep.
I am your control.
You will seek the mind I name.
I will seek the mind you name.
All right, give me something
- anything.
What have I in my hand?
It is a ring- a gold wedding ring.
In it are engraved words:
"Bopsie loves Toots."
- [Woman Laughing]
- Okay, Toots?
- Oh, why, it's simply incredible.
- All right, how about you?
- No?
- Very clever. How does he give her signals?
I tell you, it's real.
They don't use any code.
- Would you care to try it?
- I would.
- [Whispering, Indistinct]
- What? Again?
I've been asked a question. What is it?
The lady wishes to know if- if she will marry again this year.
- Oh, that's wonderful. That's right. Will I?
- [Gregory Chuckles]
I'm sorry. She cannot predict the future.
There's nothing supernatural about Miss Cairo's powers.
They've been recognized by scientists as extrasensory perception- or the "sixth sense"
- which we call mental telepathy.
[Pete] Go on, Charlie. Test her.
[Ticking Continues]
What have I in my hand?
A card.
There are... Chinese characters on it.
Possible to read characters?
I tell you what you do, Charlie.
You concentrate on the translation, and Eve will read it from your mind.
The Chinese words mean...
"Great happiness follows great pain."
Is mind still open book to young lady?
Can you tell us what else Mr. Chan is thinking?
Dr. Zodiac.
I hear the name "Dr. Zodiac" in his thoughts.
Most uncanny.
All right. Now let's have something real hard.
This last demonstration proves that she doesn't read my mind alone.
She can read any strong, dominant thought.
- Would anyone else care to try it?
- [Woman] I would.
[Rhadini] Will you please concentrate, Miss Cairo?
What do I hold in my hand?
It is-
You-
- There's someone else!
- [Ticking Continues]
I can't go on!
I can't! I hear death among us!
I'm frightened! There's evil here!
Someone here is thinking murder!
[Audience Murmuring]
- [Pete] That was Charlie, all right. He came in this way.
- Are you sure?
Sure. Hey, Charlie. Come out, come out, wherever you are.
- [Whispering] Please, quiet.
- [Gasps] Don't do that.
You left like a bloodhound on the trail. I knew you were up to no good.
He had a hunch you were coming this way.
Do not need brass band to commit simple burglary.
Burglary? Which window do we use?
Better to ring bell like law-abiding citizen... to make sure house is empty.
- [Pete] But suppose the Turk's here.
- That'd be a break.
He'd either talk or take a punch in the nose.
- [Pete] I think we ought to try a back window.
- No, try bell first.
Oh. Only honorable sprout.
Gee, Pop, I wasn't expecting you.
- Surprise mutual.
- You scared the daylights out of me.
Can explain presence here?
- I wanted to find out who the doctor is for you.
- How'd you get in?
- Through an open window upstairs.
- Where's the light switch?
No. No lights.
Please remove disguise.
[Jimmy] Gee. Nothing but black curtains.
- This must be the spook room.
- ~~[Eerie Background]
- [Pete] What was that?
- Shh!
- [Gasps] Pop!
- [Crash]
- [Moaning Through Horn]
- [Tambourine Rattling]
- Hey, look!
- [Gasps]
Ectoplasm most interesting.
Ghost filled with hot air.
Well, what about Paul Essex's voice?
Proof Dr. Zodiac knew Paul Essex.
Doctor excellent ventriloquist.
Uncle maybe to Charlie McCarthy.
Yeah? What makes all this operate?
Mechanical spirits respond to buttons concealed in floor.
Dr. Zodiac sit here with feet hidden underneath table... and conduct spook show like leader of orchestra.
Observe.
Boy, oh, boy. Whoever rigged this up is a mechanical genius.
I could use him to design some illusions for my show.
So this is how he fools his customers.
Favorite pastime of man is fooling himself.
- [Door Opens]
- Pop!
[Quietly] Get beside door.
[Switch Clicks]
You will please drop revolver to floor.
Mr. Chan makes empty command.
Man with gun stand behind you.
- Drop it.
- [Gun Hits Floor]
- Search him.
- Now don't try to put anything over on my pop.
Please lock door.
Go ahead, Pop. Ask him anything you want.
[Door Closes]
Finger of death fit glove perfectly.
- What are you getting at?
- This weapon sought my life at party tonight.
- [Pete] Did he try to kill you?
- Believe gentleman to be same.
Gee, Pop, you got him for attempted murder!
- [Pete] Lights! Hey, turn on the lights!
- Come on. Put 'em on, will ya?
- I can't find the button!
- Well, feel around there. You had it before!
- [Pete] Push the table!
- [All Chattering]
[Jimmy] Where's that light button?
- Where's the Turk?
- Where's my pop?
Now wait a minute. People can't vanish into thin air. Come on! We've gotta find them.
[Pete] That door's still locked.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Shh! Look.
Gentlemen, what are you doing in my house?
Wh-What have you done to my pop?
You have search warrant?
Come on, Zodiac. Open up and talk fast.
[Charlie's Voice] Thank you so much. Appreciate bravery.
- [Rhadini] Why, it's Charlie!
- [Jimmy] Pop!
- Pop, don't ever do that again.
- What have you got there?
Face rubber. Beard false.
Massive body an illusion.
Elaborate disguise indicate
Dr. Zodiac two other people.
Wait a minute. Do you mean to say that wire framework... is used to make a person appear taller?
- Exactly.
- Then Zodiac could be a woman.
- Or the Turk.
- Anything possible.
But where is the Turk?
Make disappearance like ghost.
Ran into closet. Found blank wall but no Turk.
Zodiac disguise hang here.
One of these walls must be false.
[Rhadini] Ah-ha. That's it.
This is the office.
He certainly did a goodjob of concealing this place. Did you find something, Charlie?
Have found elusive manuscript of Paul Essex
- one taken by Gregory.
Oh, that. I brought that here.
I got it out of Gregory's room at the hotel and left it here when I broke in tonight.
- You brought it here?
- Yeah. You didn't give me a chance to tell you before.
If befriend donkey, expect to be kicked.
How you get in here?
Through here.
I couldn't find my way out of this place, so...
I went back out through here
- same way I came in.
Then I saw you from the window and let you in.
Get a look at the size of this safe.
I wonder what a fortune-teller's doing with a safe this big.
[Pete] I wish we could open it.
Suggest you start zero.
- Are you kidding?
- [Charlie] No.
Make two turn to left to five.
- One turn to right to 18.
- [Dial Clicking]
Two turn back to left to... 21.
- Back to zero.
- [Dial Clicking]
- [Door Bangs]
- [Pete] It works.
- How did you get the combination?
- Found same among possessions ofTurkish gentleman.
[Pete] Boy, it's dark in here.
There must be a switch someplace.
[Rhadini] Here's one.
Boy, what a setup.
It's a fireproof room.
What kind of a business is Zodiac in anyway?
Reason for presence here.
[Whistles] All kinds of dope about all kinds of people.
Please, do not touch.
Suspicion confirmed.
Unfortunate and illegal experiences of many people hidden in these boxes- information collected from false psychics in many cities.
- Organized blackmail.
- We'll get Kilvaine to seize that stuff.
Gee, Pop, here's one on Honolulu
- people who live there.
Here's something on somebody named Bessie Sibley.
Mrs. Sibley doubtless supply information on many others...
to buy Dr. Zodiac's silence.
I'll bet he had plenty on her.
What have you got there, Charlie?
Envelope on Paul Essex.
This letter written by
Paul Essex positive proof...
Dr. Zodiac demand money under threat of exposing past misdeeds.
- Now we can nail him!
- Must punish Dr. Zodiac... without betraying Paul
Essex secret... to widow.
- Uh, suggest thorough search of office first- Dr. Zodiac desk. - Okay.
- What a yarn. This dynamite'll blow the whole town wide open.
- We oughta phone Kilvaine.
- I'll yell if I find anything, Pop.
- Mmm.
How to Tell Fortunes by Cards.
Maybe that's how he got his start.
Almanacs, horoscopes, astrological charts
- Ah, what a lot of trash.
- Say, we better get outta here before the Turk comes back.
- We are about ready to leave.
[Rhadini] Hey! Something's burning!
Am asking flames to keep secrets of many unfortunate people.
- But, Charlie, the evidence- - It is best.
We are destroying web of spider. Now let us find spider.
[Yawns] Oh, good morning, Pop.
Hey, your bed's still made up. Didn't you turn in at all?
- Have just read most interesting story.
- Paul's book?
- Yeah.
- Any clues in it?
Possible truth disguised as fiction.
Secret of Pygmy Arrow is story of fake psychic who blackmail clients.
- Swell. How does that help us?
- No help.
Last page containing crime solution missing.
Yet we know Paul finished same.
- Then Gregory must have it.
- [Phone Rings]
Say, I can't understand why you don't arrest that guy.
- [Rings]
- Please, do not ignore telephone.
Hello. Who?
Gregory wants to see ya.
Well, what you wait for?
Here is man ready for arrest.
Please come up, Mr. Gregory.
- [Handset Settles In Cradle]
- Boy, am I gonna pin it on him.
Would favorite son like to make personal pinch?
Oh, you're kidding, Pop.
- Say, we'd better have a gun.
- [Knocking]
- Good morning, Mr. Chan.
- Good morning.
Say, didn't I see you yesterday at the Hotel
Walling wearing glasses and a false mustache?
- O-Oh, that. -
Good morning, sir.
- Please accept humble hospitality.
- Thank you very much.
- Have cup coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Mr. Chan, I've come to lay my cards on the table.
- Yes?
- First of all, I'm not an insurance actuary.
- Please continue.
I'm a private investigator for the Granville Insurance Company.
- A detective?
- That's right.
- Gee, Pop, he's one of us.
- If I were one of Mr. Chan, I shouldn't be so worried.
Modesty forbids acknowledgement.
- Mr. Chan, I need help.
- Cooperation possible, Mr. Gregory...
- if you will answer one question.
- With pleasure.
Why did you remove Paul
Essex briefcase from Clipper?
I thought it might furnish me with some leads.
I was unable to make head or tail of it.
Somebody took it from my room last night.
You follow Paul Essex to Honolulu?
- Yes.
- Why?
My company's already had three suicides down there.
I thought the islands might furnish the motives. It was a blind alley.
The only thing I discovered was... that Dr. Zodiac had told Mr.
Essex that he would die this month.
Dr. Zodiac predict Paul Essex death?
Certainly. You knew I read that radio that came to Mr. Essex.
- I've been trying to see Zodiac. I can't even get an appointment.
- Please, what can I do?
You get to Zodiac and make him talk, and my company will take care of you.
Always willing to cooperate with insurance company.
Will keep you informed of developments.
Well, that's fine. I'll let you know if anything turns up.
- And I'm awfully glad I came to see you.
- Thank you. Pleasure is mutual.
- Thank you very much. - Good-bye.
- Thank you.
- Oh, not at all.
- Gee, Pop, I certainly had him pegged wrong.
- You did?
Uh, the manuscript
- He's taken it again. Hey!
- Morning practice for track team?
- Young man imitate puppy dog chasing bumblebee.
Well, where do we stand? Did you read our mystery story? Get any leads?
- Crime never solved by books.
- I lost him. The chambermaid said he checked out this morning.
Gee, now that manuscript's gone again.
Gee, Pop, you're a magician.
What was in the briefcase?
Very comprehensive San
Francisco telephone directory.
Gee, nice goin', Pop.
- Hey, what's this all about?
- Say, I've got an idea.
Let's call up the Granville Insurance Company and find out if Gregory's on the level.
Telephone all insurance companies yesterday.
No one ever heard of Mr. Gregory.
I knew it. I knew he was a phony.
Say, he might even be Zodiac.
One'll get you 10 we'll never see
Zodiac with his whiskers on again- not after the way we went through his place last night.
It is possible.
But Dr. Zodiac not ordinary criminal.
He is man of great ego...
with disease known to science as pseudologia fantastica.
- [Whistles]
- Is it serious?
Listen: "Pathological liars and swindlers suffer from exaggerated fantasy...
"unleashed vanity and great ambition... which robs them of caution known to saner men."
Or, as Pop would put it, "Swell head gives owner more trouble than indigestion."
Correction, please. Swell head sometimes give police... more cooperation than criminal mistake.
Say, I'll buy that. We might trip Zodiac through his vanity.
Criminal egotist find pleasure in laughing at police.
If we give him a chance to laugh at us-
That might bring him out in the open, and then
- But how are we gonna work it?
Suggest artful flattery in form of special challenge from Rhadini... to demonstrate powers before men of science.
That's great, Charlie, and I know my paper will go for it.
- [Man] Say, my nose on Rhadini. Who do you like? - [Man #2] Well, I like Zodiac-
[Crowd Continues Chattering]
- That Dr. Zodiac certainly has his nerve with him.
- [Chattering Continues]
Charlie, you were right. It's happened.
Zodiac took it hook, line and sinker. Come on.
Please, folks, step aside.
Gee, that's a funny-lookin' knife.
Balance weapon used by knife throwers.
What is it, a P. S?
This is missing last page of Paul Essex manuscript. Note was written on back of it.
- What do you mean?
- Say, then Gregory must be Zodiac.
- Unless you drop same in Zodiac house last night.
- Gee, Pop, maybe I did.
Carelessness may prove blessing in disguise.
Hey, I betcha we'll have a full house tonight, I'll betcha.
- What does it say, Charlie? Does it help us?
- No.
Merely that murder was not caused by sword cane, as suspected... but by poisoned Pigmy arrow.
Pigmy arrow? We got a Pigmy arrow.
- Where?
- Over here. I'll show ya.
The bow and arrow's gone! I know it was here this mornin'...
- 'cause when I was sweepin' up, I went by and it stuck me.
- Some souvenir hunter took them.
[Jimmy] If Zodiac left the note, then he probably took the arrow.
- At least we know where to find it.
- ~~[Orchestra: Overture]
- ~~[Continues]
- Hello, Charlie. What a house.
I socked Zodiac's acceptance across the front page, and look at that sellout.
[No Audible Dialogue]
- We've got every door in the place covered.
- Good.
Now when Zodiac gets here, seal the place up.
Don't let anyone out till after the show is over. And be ready for trouble.
- If we don't see a show tonight, we'll never see one.
- What's your plan, Pop?
Expect to witness most interesting performance... if attention not distracted by too much conversation.
Well, we're all set, Charlie.
~~[Overture Continues]
- Well, is Dr. Zodiac here yet?
- No, I don't see him.
What a fine spot I'll be in if he doesn't show up.
- A fine spot if he does and you don't show him up.
- Aw, don't even think it.
- [Elmer] Places, everybody. All set, Mr. Rhadini?
- Yeah, okay.
All right, clear the stage, folks. Kill your houselights.
## [Overture Ends]
## [Fanfare]
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as you all know... the famous Dr. Zodiac has accepted a challenge to meet me here tonight.
- Is Dr. Zodiac in the house?
- [Murmuring]
Not even the ghost of a whisper.
- Or the whisper of a ghost.
- [Crowd Chuckling]
So, while we're waiting for the renowned doctor of the occult to materialize...
I will endeavor to entertain you. Professor, please?
- ~~[Dramatic, Exotic] - Of course
I'm just an ordinary magician myself-
one of the old-fashioned kind whose hand is quicker than the eye.
Now watch very closely, ladies and gentlemen. Empty, empty.
- That's what you thought.
- [Laughter]
- Flowers for madame.
- [Applause]
~~[Continues]
Nothing in here...
- nothing in here.
- [Laughter]
Empty, empty.
What a fix for a sphinx.
Elmer, if you please, rotate.
Well, there's life in the old sphinx yet.
- ~~[Ends] - Miss Eve
Cairo, ladies and gentlemen-
a very charming and mysterious young lady who will assist me in deceiving you.
Excuse me, please. Now, ladies and gentlemen, for our first illusion...
I will require some witnesses here on the stage.
Are there a couple of good witnesses in the house- the kind to have when you bump into the other fella's car?
- How about you, sir?
- Oh, no, thank you.
Come on. Don't be bashful. Leave your watch and wallet with your wife.
- Oh, she's not your wife.
- [Crowd Chuckles]
Well! Spotlight. Charlie, stand up.
- Come on, Pop. Take a bow.
- [Pete] Go ahead, Charlie.
Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to meet Mr. Charlie Chan- the world's foremost whodunit celebrity.
I'm going to ask Mr. Chan... to honor my performance by acting as a witness of my illusions.
And if I can trick him, I'm good.
- This'll give you a chance to watch
Zodiac while he works. - Hey, Pop-
And you too, Jimmy. And Jimmy
Chan, ladies and gentlemen-
- a chip off the old chopstick.
- [Crowd Laughs]
And this gentleman completes our gold-panel jury:
Deputy Chief Kilvaine of the
San Francisco Police Department.
[Rhadini] Now stand wherever you wish.
Stubs, please.
[Gasps] Oh!
- ~~[Continues]
- [Crowd Murmuring]
Dr. Zodiac, I believe. Spotlight!
Would you care to come up on the stage, Doctor?
I was just about to toss off one of my best illusions.
I'll give you a chance to unmask me, Doctor, before I... unmask you.
- That would be a pleasure, Mr. Rhadini.
- That's the spirit.
[Rhadini] Stand wherever you wish, Doctor.
- Now, ladies and gentlemen, before I continue- - ~~[Ends]
I want to say in fairness to our distinguished guest... that I do not intend in any way to ridicule his faith in the supernatural.
But I will prove that I can duplicate anything he does...
with the same old bag of tricks that have been mystifying gullible humanity...
- since the first magician laid an egg.
- [Laughter]
My initial endeavor will be to nullify the law of gravity through levitation- an art practiced by the holy men ofTibet...
who are credited with being able to project their bodies through space.
- Thank you.
- ~~[Resumes]
Now watch Miss Cairo and particularly the table.
We are under observation by a supercritical jury of witnesses.
Nothing below, a beautiful lady above.
No wires connected to the table, no mechanical devices... yet, unless your eyes deceive you, the table and the young lady... are rising into the fourth dimension of space... supported by nothing but thin air!
Levitation was a religious rite of the ancient world, known to the priests of Chaldea-
a guarded secret in the temples of Babylon-
a fearsome ceremony of the pagan gods who cried for sacrifice... and before whom victims vanished and disappeared!
~~[Ends]
- [Applause]
- [Screams]
[Applause Fades, Crowd Murmuring]
[Pete] Eve!
[Kilvaine] An arrow!
Stuck directly in heart. Death instantaneous.
Boy, what a finish for
Dr. Zodiac. Who is he, Pop?
[Rhadini] It's the Turk!
[Kilvaine] Wait a minute. Houselights!
Everybody stay right where you are.
No one is to leave this theater.
[Whistle Tweeting]
Have everybody go back to their seats!
Please, remove body out there.
- Back to your seat, lady.
- You've no right to keep me here. Let me by.
Look! Somebody threw this bow in here.
Get bow, please.
This is what he was shot with, all right.
Gee, Pop, l-I didn't mean to do that.
No matter. Accident proves arrow not shot from bow.
Weather-beaten wood too old to put driving force behind bowstring.
Why, that's from my exhibit in the lobby. It's the Pygmy bow.
Problem number one then: How was arrow which killed Turkish gentleman... projected into his body?
- [Rhadini] Someone must've been close enough to stab him.
- It must've been from the stage.
Maybe, maybe not. The lights were out long enough... for anyone to come up on the stage and then gotten back to their seat.
Makes problem more difficult
- takes in entire audience.
Suggest confining selves to one who could have been within striking distance of victim.
- When did you leave stage, Mr. Rhadini?
- As soon as the lights changed.
I follow the table down the aisle. I'm at the back when Eve makes her entrance.
Rhadini must have been in the aisle. He dropped this wand... beside my seat in the second row.
- Hello, Stewart. What are you doing here?
- Kilvaine.
- Say, do you know him too?
- Sure. Charlie, I want you to meet Stewart Salsbury...
the investigator for the
Granville Insurance Company.
Then he is a detective?
But now his name's Salsbury.
That's why the insurance company didn't know anyone named Gregory.
May chalk up one error against blundering parent.
Mr. Salsbury, you were sitting in second row?
I was interested in watching you work. I knew you were on the stage for a purpose.
I wanted to be nearer to you and Dr. Zodiac.
Thank you so much. May see wand, please?
This is wand used in floating table illusion?
Yes. I guess I dropped it in the aisle as I ran back to the stage.
Silver-tipped wand more prolific than silkworm.
- You're stealing my act, Charlie.
- [Audience Laughs]
Perhaps have extra one handy? Up sleeve maybe?
Say, I shouldn't have let you watch me so closely.
- An orchid for you, Charlie.
- Thank you so much.
Miss Cairo, please, just when you cease to float on flying table?
I wasn't on the table, Mr. Chan. I was in the wings waiting for my entrance.
Not on table? Very mysterious.
Just a minute, Charlie. You don't mean to say that Eve had anything to do with this.
Please, I'm merely trying to place positions of people on stage... to get clear picture of crime.
Well, I don't quite get you, Charlie.
Let's place 'em in the positions they were in before the lights went out.
[Charlie] Very excellent suggestion.
Would request, Mr. Rhadini, you start act all over again... from point where Miss
Cairo is placed on table.
- Right.
- [Crowd Murmuring]
Now, you people in the audience please settle down and be patient.
- We're going to stage Rhadini's act again.
- [Exclaiming]
We want all the cooperation you can give us.
The person sitting next to you might be the murderer we're looking for.
Will need volunteer to take place of victim.
- You will oblige?
- What? Me be the murdered man?
- But I ain't a good subject, Mr. Chan, I ain't.
- Hmm. No.
Can request you assume humble position, Mr. Lewis?
- To break a story, I'd do anything, Charlie.
- Thank you so much.
Miss Cairo, it will be necessary for you again to take place on table.
- No, no, I can't do it.
- What's the matter, honey?
I wouldn't advise you to use Eve.
She's different from the rest of us- high-strung, nervous temperament, sensitive to things like this.
One moment, please. Have thought.
Will not be necessary to use young lady.
Uh, let everyone assume original positions.
You, Miss Cairo, were in wings.
Mr. Rhadini, you were on platform, please.
- Who's gonna ride on the table?
- Number two son.
He long have weakness for displaying histrionic ability.
Here is opportunity to disguise self as Sleeping Beauty.
Who, me? Take a ride on that table?
- Oh, but flying makes me seasick, Pop.
- Go.
All right, Jimmy. Come on. Come on. Hop up.
You're gonna get a lot of surprises. Okay, Charlie?
- Lights!
- ~~[Resumes]
[Rhadini] Watch Miss Cairo and particularly the table.
We are under observation by a supercritical jury of witnesses.
Nothing below-
No wires connected to the table, no mechanical devices.
Yet, unless your eyes deceive you, the table and the lady... are rising into the fourth dimension of space...
supported by nothing but thin air!
Levitation was a religious rite of the ancient world, known to the priests of Chaldea- a guarded secret of the ancient temples of the-
Mr. Chan, something's wrong.
Rhadini didn't finish his speech!
Lights! Lights! Turn on the lights! [Screams]
[Crowd Clamoring]
- How did that happen?
- Do something.
[Kilvaine] All right, folks. All right. Take your seats and be quiet.
[Man] Get him to his dressing room!
Why, he's wounded! Get him to his dressing room and call a doctor.
Now, keep calm, folks!
Joe, get everybody out of that aisle.
Lady! Lady! Sit down, lady. Be calm, be collected.
Don't get excited. That won't get you anything.
Take his coat off. He's bleeding.
Come on. Come on. Get him to his dressing room.
Well, if this don't send me back to Billy
Goat Hill pounding pavement, I'm an Eskimo.
Not necessary to take such icy view of situation.
- Matters progressing most interestingly.
- Interestingly? For who, Rhadini?
Fortunately, only wound in shoulder, induced by this knife.
- Where did you get that?
- On step.
It is brother to one used to pin
Dr. Zodiac's note to door of theater.
It's a cinch whoever threw that knife is the same one who knocked off the Turk.
We're through playing theater. If I can only figure the angle that knife was thrown from... it'll give me a clue to where the killer was standing.
Position of killer not so important to anxious parent... as position of number two son who took trip on mysterious flying table.
- He's in the cellar. All he has to do is come upstairs.
- Oh. Show way, please.
- Surely. Come on.
- [Kilvaine] I've got an idea.
I've been tryin' to figure out the angle this knife was thrown from. I figured-
Captain Kilvaine, will you tell your stupid cops that they must let me be with my husband?
Now just a minute, young lady. Nobody can talk to him until after I've questioned him.
And I have a few questions for you too.
You're a fine detective
- letting one man be murdered right under your eyes... and then setting the stage so they could try to kill my husband!
I've tried to be calm-
Come out of there! Come out of there!
[Charlie] Jimmy!
Did not know theater provided elevator service.
That comes from inside the sphinx.
Mr. Chan, I want to go to my husband.
The detectives won't let me see him.
Thought Rhadini's dressing room was on stage.
It is, but there's an entrance from down here too.
Son seems to have disappeared as completely as flying table.
Maybe he went up into the boss's dressin' room.
- Come with me, Mr. Chan. We'll see.
- Mmm. Yes.
I hope somebody sees somethin' around here pretty soon.
I wish I was back with my trained seals.
You could try a cross-stitch- the kind we use in appendix operations.
Please explain absence of pants and self.
Gee, Pop, l-I had an accident.
Get dressed quickly. Disappearance take one year off father's life.
Uh, you are doctor? Uh, how is Mr. Rhadini's shoulder?
Not too bad. It's only a flesh wound.
He's suffering from shock right now.
I fixed him up, and I think we'd better let him go home as quickly as possible.
Most fortunate escape. Can offer no solution as to who make attempt on life?
I haven't the slightest idea, Charlie.
I'd just reached the bottom of the steps, and I felt a blow.
And my shoulder seemed to be on fire. That's all I remember.
- It must've been thrown from the audience. And if it was, l- - Recommend we remove selves... from dressing room and allow
Mr. Rhadini needed rest.
Excuse, please.
Look here, young woman. You knew all about this before the lights came up- before anyone else knew that Rhadini had been clipped with a knife.
- How did you know it?
- I've told you before, I can sense things like that.
I had a mental vision of him lying there with a knife stuck in his shoulder.
Mental telepathy confirmed by scientific investigation.
Am convinced young lady's strange power can be... of utmost assistance to us in apprehending murderer.
Better to probe through penetrating mind of one girl... than try to sift contents of whole theater.
All right, then go ahead. I'm in this with ya. I might as well stick.
I'll tell the audience, Pop.
One moment.
Refrain from showing to audience seat of pants, please.
Oh. I'll take care of that.
I'll wear this coat.
Ladies and gentlemen...
my father has requested me to, uh-
[Audience Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues] - My father has requested that I call your atten-
My father has requested that I call your-
[Laughter, Applause]
[Laughter Continues]
[Laughter]
Oh, gee, Pop, this isn't my fault.
Recommend you imitate excellent example of sphinx and keep silent.
Ask you will please excuse amateur exhibition of magic... by ambitious offspring... and request you will again lend most necessary cooperation. and request you will again lend most necessary cooperation.
With assistance of Miss Cairo... will try to find solution of most perplexing crime.
Can assure you will witness most scientific and remarkable demonstration...
of mental telepathy.
Electrician, you will turn off all lights except one on mirror, please.
You will read thoughts in my mind until dominant thought of killer comes to you.
[Steady Ticking]
[Ticking Continues]
Concentrate.
Close eyes, please.
Am now your control.
You are my control.
You lips will speak my thoughts as they come to you.
I will speak your thoughts.
[Ticking Continues]
I get the impression of a strange, mysterious room.
There is a man. It is Dr. Zodiac.
He has learned secrets of people's lives...
and uses his information to blackmail them.
I see one of his victims.
He's in an airplane.
He commits suicide because Dr.
Zodiac threatens him with disgrace.
That man's wife is here in the theater.
Her heart is filled with bitterness.
There is another woman here who is helping Dr. Zodiac...
but she fears him.
Only his death can bring her freedom.
I see another man here
- a rival...
who has staked his reputation on unmasking Dr. Zodiac tonight.
There is another...
who fears the loss ofhis position and prestige...
because Dr. Zodiac has outwitted him.
And a young man who believes Dr.
Zodiac is interfering with his romance- trying to separate him from the girl he loves.
There's someone confusing our contact, Mr. Chan.
Go on, please.
Yes, I have your control again.
There is a woman who is filled with jealousy and hatred.
Dr. Zodiac is trying to influence her.
Mr. Chan, there's a mind here that is fighting me
- trying to keep your thoughts from me.
Continue, please.
He is frightened, desperate. It is-
It is Dr. Zodiac! He is not dead.
- He is here in this theater!
- [Murmuring]
Zodiac here? Then who was the Turk?
Will soon learn.
[Charlie] Concentrate, please.
The man who was murdered was Dr. Zodiac's servant...
who was impersonating him here tonight to throw the police off the trail.
What was motive for murder, please?
The servant was the only one who knew his master's secret.
Zodiac killed him to silence him... and make the world believe that Dr. Zodiac was dead.
Who is Dr. Zodiac?
It is-
It is-
Something is keeping it from me
- a control stronger than yours.
Killer is trying to prevent you from reading my thoughts. Make effort, please.
I'm trying. It's coming closer.
It's filled with evil, with thoughts of murder.
It's Dr. Zodiac!
He's ready to strike again! [Screams]
Lights! Lights!
- [Jimmy] It's Rhadini!
- Fred! - My boss!
Otherwise known as Dr. Zodiac.
Very clever to have Turk impersonate you at séance and thus avoid suspicion.
Nice work. But you'll never convict me of killing the Turk.
Contradiction, please. Will demonstrate.
Silver-tipped wand used in floating table illusion not same as this one... which you carry up sleeve, from which you produce orchid.
Mechanism make most potent murder weapon. Observe.
[Clicks]
Easy for magician to confuse picture of crime- even to inflicting wound in own shoulder to avert suspicion.
All right, men. Take him out.
- So sorry.
- I didn't know, Mr. Chan. I never even suspected.
Rhadini sure was covered up, but we nicked this case.
Appreciate valuable assistance. But please remember:
Obvious clues, like tricks in magic, usually prove deceptive.
You bet. From now on, I'll be just like you.
I'll keep both feet right on the ground.

[THEME MUSIC]
[TRAIN CHUGGING]
-No loving deck.
Hey, Jenny.
You have in.
I can't open it.
-Too right, though.
Oh, blimey.
-Call his name.
 -Mr. Partridge.
Hey, Mr. Partridge.
-Now what's the trouble?
-Can't open the blinking door.
-Come out.
You hear me?
This is Victoria Station.
-Some drunk sleeping it off.
-Young gents
 traveling first class.
-My word.
-Hi, Jim.
Let's have your ladder.
-Yes.
-Open that window.
 -Right.
I can't budge it, Mr. Partridge.
-Budge is the word.
You'll have to smash it, then.
 -Right.
Oh!
Mr. Partridge, there's--
-Hold it.
Run, [INAUDIBLE].
Fetch the police.
Don't stand there lollygagging.
-This must be the place.
-We made it.
-You'll have to wait here.
-I'm not going to let you go
 in a place like this alone.
-You must, really.
I'll be all right.
-This meeting is
 now called to order.
The unfortunate death in a
 train of one of our members, Mr.
James Murphy, who departed
this life by his own act while of unsound mind, has
 necessitated this meeting.
-That's what you
 say, Mr. Merrydew.
But how do you know?
-A verdict of death by
 suicide was returned tonight.
This is the second occasion that
we have been brought together by the mishaps to our members.
The first being the passing
away by natural causes of the late Colonel Forrester,
whose charming daughter so gracefully honors us with
 her presence here tonight.
It is agreed in the pact
drawn up and formally attested to by its founders that
should the grim reaper overtake one or more, the interests of
the deceased in the society will be divided equally
 among the surviving members.
It is also provided
for in the pact that Miss Forrester becomes
 a participating member.
Consequently, the interests
of the late James Murphy will be divided equally
 among the seven of us.
I move that my fee for the
necessary legal representation, funeral expenses, and a
modest urn for the ashes be defrayed by our organization.
I understand from
the widow that he expressed a preference
 for cremation.
-I second that.
-All those in favor will please
 signify by raising their hand.
Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Baker.
Mr. Dearing.
Mr. Pyke.
Ah Yet.
Good.
-Has any provision been
 made for the widow?
-No.
-I presume that we could
 stretch a point in her favor.
-Emphatically not.
Things are complicated
 enough as they are.
-Why did he want
 to kill himself?
-Have you ever met his wife?
-No.
 -No?
Well, I have.
A pest if there ever was one.
We can attribute
his death solely to the general deficiencies
 of one Annabelle Mary Murphy.
-What would you
 deduce from this?
-Obviously an attempt to
 convey secret information.
-Could you decipher it?
-I could not.
Nor could you.
-Would you like to bet?
-Certainly.
-How much?
-A shilling.
My time is too valuable.
-The answer will be
found in a large book because the numbers are large.
I'd suggest the Bible.
A client, Watson.
-Where?
-The widow standing
 under the streetlamp.
-A widow?
Would you like to bet on that?
-Of course.
-Well, I'm not going down
 the street to ask her.
-Ah.
Won't be necessary.
She's made up her mind.
-So you deduce at
 a distance, eh?
-Not in this case.
I recognized her features.
She's a Mrs. Murphy.
Her husband was
 murdered three days ago.
-Do you mean the man that
 was found dead in a train?
-Exactly.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Come in.
-A Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir.
-Mr. Holmes, I'm in such a mess.
Such a mess.
My husband up and
died without leaving me as much as a threepenny bit.
I-- It's a crying shame, Mr.
 Holmes, that's what it is.
-Sit down and try
 to compose yourself.
-Cut off without a farthing by
 an ungrateful good-for-nothing.
Me!
 And my kind of life!
No dirty dog had a better wife.
I've waited on
him hand to mouth, stood by his side
morning, noon, and night, and what does the stinker do?
He ups and kills
himself and-- and leaves his money to a trust.
And Mr. Merrydew.
Yes.
And there's another stinker
 if I never saw another.
Won't even let me
 have a sixpence.
He won't even let me have
 an ha'penny, Mr. Holmes.
-Thaddeus Merrydew, the lawyer?
-Yes, the thieving hound,
 the dirty rat, the--
-One moment.
You were married how long?
-Five blessed long years.
-Previous to your marriage,
 your husband served in the army?
-You knew him?
-A bit.
He got his charge in China?
-Yes, that's right.
-Then you married.
-Yes, and I gave up
 everything, Mr. Holmes.
You ask the proprietor of the
 Black Sow, he'll tell you.
It was me that made
 that pub what it was.
-And your husband had money?
-Barrels of it.
And when he wanted more, he
used to come up to London and get it.
It was that that took him to
 London when he killed himself.
-How do you know?
-Well, Jim comes into my room.
I was in bed with a piece of
cucumber rind round my head, trying to cure an headache.
He had a letter in his hand.
"See, here, pig," he said.
That was his pet name
 for me when he was drunk.
"I'm going up to London."
-Did you read the
 contents of the letter?
-Oh, it wasn't no letter.
It was just a piece of doggerel.
-Watson, make a note of
 Mrs. Murphy's address.
-It's 232 King's Cross Road.
Then you'll have to
 take me, Mr. Holmes?
-I'll, ah, take up your case.
-Ah, mind you, it'll
 have to be for love.
-Love?
-For nix.
I've noticed how you
 like working for nothing.
-My interest is to bring
 the criminal to justice.
-Well, never mind about justice.
Never mind about the crime.
All I want is my
 husband's lawful money.
And I want you to slap that
thieving lawyer's face right across, between his
 greasy, fat chops.
Goodnight, Mr. Holmes.
I'll be seeing you,
 and thank you kindly.
-Good night, Mrs. Murphy.
Deep water, Watson.
-She needs some shady
 lawyer, not you.
-Think so?
-I'm amazed at your
wasting your energies on such a morbid trifle.
Who is this Merrydew?
-London's most dangerous crook.
The king of blackmailers.
A gliding, slidy,
 venomous snake.
Once in his power, he'll
squeeze and squeeze until he's drained
 his victims dry.
More than once I've
had my net around him, but so far he's managed
 to wriggle his way out.
The time has come, Watson.
The time has come for
 Mr. Thaddeus Merrydew.
-And now Miss Forrester
and gentlemen, this concludes the meeting.
I would like to have
 a word with you alone.
I sincerely trust
no further accident will happen to occasion
 another meeting?
-Never can tell.
-Are you going my way?
-Which way do you go?
I go the other.
-That leads to a dead end.
-That's the way I go.
-Good night, then.
-Good night.
-You must never mention anything
that transpired at this meeting tonight, or even that
 this meeting was held.
I saw a young man standing
 on the corner as I came in.
-Yes, my fiance.
He brought me here
 and is waiting for me.
-Oh.
Then you're thinking
 of being married?
-Yes.
-I wouldn't, if I were you.
That is, at least until
 you've consulted me.
-But why?
-I can't explain.
In a short time, the society
 will no longer exist.
Until its affairs
are winded up, it would be most unwise
 for you to marry.
Your father would
 not have wished it.
-What had my father to
 do with these people?
-Didn't he ever tell you?
-No.
-Then I must
 respect his silence.
Remember, not a word
 to a living soul.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-He's after me.
He's after me!
-Captain Pyke!
 [GLASS BREAKING]
[SCREAMING]
Ah!
Ah!
 -Dead.
-Dead.
Shot through the heart.
You wait here.
[SCREAMING]
-What is it?
 What's happening?
Are you hurt?
-Someone-- Look!
He's disappeared!
What does it mean?
-The murderer must
have had an accomplice and removed the body.
-We must call the police.
-No, no, the police will
 be here soon enough.
You mustn't become involved.
 -But it's murder.
-As you respect your
father's memory, you must preserve
 a strict silence.
Not a word.
Come.
-The body was pulled
out of the Thames at 5:00 AM at the
 Lighthouse District.
The autopsy shows the death
was caused by a bullet through the heart.
The features that you
see are unrecognizable, caused possibly by the battering
of the head against the wall before the body was found.
We have identified the
 body by means of that ring.
-Ah.
A very rare and very
 beautiful ring, Lestrade.
-There isn't the slightest doubt
 the deceased is Captain Pyke.
The clothes were identified.
Initials were on the
 collar and on the shirt.
Further identifications are
contained in these letters that were found in the clothing.
-Where is the widow?
 -We asked her to wait.
She's in the adjoining room.
-Mrs. Pyke?
-Yes.
You are?
-My name is Sherlock Holmes.
When did you last see
 your husband alive?
-We dined together last
 night at the Savoy Grill.
He left me shortly
 after 9 o'clock.
I never saw him again.
-You are staying?
-At the Savoy.
-You've been in London how long?
-About a week.
-And you live where?
-At the Grange Sherbournes.
-When your husband
left you, did he inform you where he was going?
-No, but I fancied it was
 on a matter of business.
He was a man very
 precise in his habits.
When midnight came and
 there was no sign of him,
I became rather alarmed.
-Midnight should be
 a late hour for him?
-Very.
As the time went on, I
 became more and more worried.
At last I informed the police.
An hour ago, I
received a message to come here, where I identified
 the body of my poor husband.
-By the ring?
-Yes.
-Did he always wear a ring?
-That one, yes.
I gave it to him
 when we were married.
-That would be?
-About six years ago, in China.
It is an heirloom
belonging to my family and has been handed down
 through generations.
-I see.
Permit me to express my
 sympathy for your great loss.
-Thank you.
Is that all?
-By the way, should
it become necessary, shall I communicate with you
 at the Grange or the Savoy?
-Through my lawyer.
-His name?
-Mr. Thaddeus Merrydew.
Good morning, Mr. Holmes.
-Well, what do you make of it?
-Murder.
 Unquestionably.
-Is that all?
-That's all I have to say.
-What do you think?
-I think that the
 lady is a liar.
-You!
It's not possible!
What do you want with me?
[GUNSHOT]
-The papers are full of
 the Pyke murder mystery.
-Seemed to me particularly
 senseless and futile.
There was no motive.
-No motive?
Peer deep down in the black
heart of Thaddeus Merrydew and you'll find a motive.
-You don't mean to suggest that
he had anything to do with it, do you?
-I suggest nothing.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
 -Come in.
-Inspector Lestrade
 to see you, sir.
-Mr. Holmes.
 Dr. Watson.
-Mr. Holmes.
 Dr. Watson. 
 Dr. Watson.
 -What's the matter?
Dr. Watson.
 -What's the matter?
You look worried.
 -Worried?
I'm up to my neck.
 -Again?
-Before I can begin
 to finish one case,
I'm plunged into another.
-That's the penalty
 of being smart.
You came to see
 me professionally?
-Well, unofficially.
 -I see.
Heads you win, tails I lose.
-There's been a bad
 business during the night.
An old gentleman.
You'll find it a
 bit of a puzzler.
-You mean you found
 it a bit of a puzzler?
-We've left everything
in status quo hoping you'll favor
 us with an opinion.
-Dead?
-Mm-hmm.
-Murder?
-Suicide.
-Come, Watson.
The game is afoot.
-He was well-known
 as a stamp collector.
-Hmm.
Very interesting.
-What is it, Holmes?
-That leads out to the garden?
-Seldom used, to judge
 by the rusty hinges.
-Good morning, sir.
 -Good morning.
-You can see that I've
 left everything untouched.
-If a herd of
buffaloes passed along, it couldn't be a greater mess.
You can take a smoke.
-Thank you, sir.
-What do you think?
-There's been murder done.
The murderer was a man.
He was in the prime of life, six
feet in height, has small feet, wears square-toed boots, limps
slightly on the left foot and smokes Trichinopoly cigars.
-Well, if it was murder,
 how was it committed?
-The assassin was in the house
 before his victim arrived.
He hid in the recess
 behind the window.
While there, he smoked a cigar.
He fired a shot which hit the
victim on the back of the head and then dragged the body
 to where you found it.
He left and returned
some while later to fire a second shot, this
 time through the mouth.
You'll find the mark
of a boot clearly imprinted on the
 congealed blood.
-What was his object?
-To obliterate the
effect of the first, hoping by so doing to transfer
the crime from that of murder to one of suicide.
Bullet number one you
will find in the wall on the farther side of the room.
The other will be found
embedded in the body of the murdered man.
 Come, Watson.
We mustn't keep Mr.
 Merrydew waiting.
-Mr. Holmes is
 still waiting, sir.
-Oh.
How long has it been, now?
-Fully two hours, sir.
-That's as it should be.
You may show him in now.
-Very good, sir.
-Mr. Holmes, this is
 the bigger pleasure.
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting, but I had to digest my lunch.
-This is my friend and partner.
 Dr. Watson.
-How do you do?
Fancy a pour, gentlemen?
-Thank you, no.
-Hmm.
Cigar?
Thank you.
Ah, be seated, gentlemen.
I represent Annabelle
 Mary Murphy.
Charming lady.
-I'm empowered to
 act on her behalf.
-Congratulations.
-As you are doubtless
aware, her husband came to a premature
 and sudden end.
-Dear, dear.
-My client is
under an impression that certain monies
belonging to the deceased are being unlawfully
 withheld from her.
-By whom?
-By you.
-And you believe
 this delightful lady?
-I'm paid to find out.
An angry woman is
hard to pacify, so I thought an
amicable discussion with you would put me in
possession of certain facts with which I could
prove to my client the absurdity of her claim.
-I see.
Is that all?
-That is all.
-Dear, dear, you're
 not smoking my cigar.
-You refuse to assist me.
-My dear Mr. Holmes, I have
neither the information or the authority.
You see, until a few
days ago I was not aware that your distinguished
 client existed.
In my profession, I
deal with many cases impartially and legally without
coming into personal contact with my client.
-It won't do, Mr. Merrydew.
-Anything else?
-May I trouble you for
 a pencil and paper?
-Help yourself.
Mr. Busybody Holmes.
-By the way, I think you
should know that another client of yours met his
 death last night.
Mr. Malcolm Dearing.
Found murdered.
Good day, Mr. Merrydew.
Come, Watson.
Cold-blooded monster.
Well, I've given him
 something to think about.
-Did you see what I saw?
His feet.
-What about them?
-Well, they were small
 feet, and the boots--
-Well, well?
 -Were square-toed.
Square-toed!
 -Really?
-Yes, and-- and did you
 remark the brand of cigar?
-Cigar?
Trichinopoly.
It was stenciled in big
 letters on the top of the box.
-Is that all you observed?
-Was there anything else?
-100 things, among them
 the cipher to the code.
A large book, Watson.
-I saw no Bible.
-Would you call a "Whitaker's
 Almanac" a large book?
-Yes, indeed.
-In that book will be found
 the message of the numbers.
-Mr. Holmes.
-Mrs. Pyke.
-Holmes, what did you write
 on that sheet of paper?
-A long shot in
 the dark, Watson.
But it hit a bullseye.
-Miss Forrester lives
 here, I believe.
Tell her that Mr. Merrydew
 wishes to see her.
Mr. Thaddeus Merrydew.
And hurry.
-Mr. Merrydew calling
 to see you, Miss.
-Miss Forrester.
You're looking charming as ever.
I see you've
 received my flowers.
-Thank you.
-I sent them to soften the
 unexpectedness of my visit.
-You've come about the
 murder of Captain Pyke?
-No.
Have the police
 been pestering you?
-No.
-I was fortunate enough to
 keep your name out of it.
Have you seen today's papers?
Shocking, shocking.
Poor old gentlemen.
This is a very
wicked world we're living in, Miss Forrester.
Now, this will necessitate
 another meeting.
That's why I came
 myself to tell you.
Safer.
Too many eavesdroppers,
busybodies concerning themselves with other
 people's business.
[PHONE RINGING]
-The same time, the same place.
 Tomorrow night.
-Oh, please don't ask me to go
 to that dreadful place again.
-Well, unfortunately,
 in this case,
I'm a servant carrying
 out instructions.
You have nothing to worry about.
Not a thing.
Not a thing to worry about.
-Oh, hmm-- this-- this is my--
 Mr. Stanford, Mr. Merrydew.
-Remember.
I seem to see you everyplace.
-Who is that man?
-He's my lawyer.
-Hmm.
I remember seeing
 him the other night.
But what's he doing here?
-Oh, please don't begin
 that all over again.
-But Eileen, surely I
 have a right to know.
-Oh, John.
I'm so miserable.
It's something that
 concerns father.
Just before he died,
 he sent for me.
I remember his words.
On my death, you'll find
 yourself well provided for.
You'll be rich.
Remember this name.
He repeated it twice.
Merrydew.
Should he communicate with
you, follow his instructions, for through him will
 come this inheritance.
-And the meeting three days ago?
-Began the fulfillment
 of father's words.
-I think I'm beginning
 to understand.
[RAPPING ON DOOR]
-I thought I saw--
-John, John!
-He's a black-bearded
 man, ill-dressed.
Looked like a tramp.
-How tall?
-Oh, quite tall.
-Could you keep Miss
Forrester under observation without her knowing it?
-I don't understand.
Is Eileen in danger?
-In great danger.
You were wise in
 coming to see me.
Should anything unforeseen
 occur, get in touch with me.
Go to her.
Remember, get in touch with me.
[DOOR CLOSING]
-We are getting on, Watson.
-I'm glad to see you in
 a more cheerful mood.
-We've done remarkably well.
-I'm pleased.
I admit I could do with
 a little explanation.
I, too, feel a little curious.
-I considered the claims
 of "Whitaker's Almanac."
As I suspected, the
large number represented the page, the second, the
small number, the column, and the other
 figure's the message.
You'll find it
 decoded on the table.
[PLAYING VIOLIN]
-Meeting of scarlet ring.
Tuesday.
Limehouse.
M. Merrydew?
-Possibly.
Tomorrow will appear
in the personal column of the Daily Telegraph
 a second message.
A request for information.
 -Your message?
-My message.
-And the next step?
-The need of fresh air will
 take me in the country tomorrow.
In the meantime, relaxation.
Music.
I hope I won't bore you.
-Not if you make it soft.
-Ah, these is getting
 worser and worser.
-All you do is hope they
don't get more worser before they'll get less worser.
-Same as I say.
-That were a very bad
 business about Captain Pyke.
A very bad business.
-Same as I say.
I hear tell is
how the old Grange has gone under the hammer.
-Lock, stock and barrel.
-Same as I say.
-And I almost broke this
old back of mine weeding their old garden, and
to look at it now, you'd think I'd spent
 all my time in here.
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.
-Morning, morning.
How far is the Grange from here?
-Some will tell you four miles
 and some will tell you five.
But I say it's more than
 four and less than five.
-Is there any means of
 getting there besides walking?
-Bless your heart, yes, sir.
I've an hold trap.
I'll harness up old
Caesar and old Will here will drive you over.
-Will he take anything to drink?
-Wouldn't come amiss.
Scotch.
Scotch and splash.
-Put a bottle on the
table, some glasses, and a side for his soda.
-Coming, sir.
Coming.
Lord, love it if it was
 going to be busy again.
-You're a godsend to him, Sir.
He hasn't had a paying
 customer for a long time.
-I'll have a chit for
 you in a jiffy, sir.
Afore you can say Jack Robinson.
-Help yourself.
-Thank you, sir.
Just a little dropsy.
-Say when.
-When.
Well, here's to your
 very good health, sir.
Aww, feel like a new man, sir.
-Well, then I'll give
 the new man a drink.
-Right-o, sir.
Well, to your very
 good health again, sir.
-Good health.
Were you born in these parts?
-I've never seen none other.
Worked for the Pyke
family all my life until I got tired of working.
Got this old
backache from weeding their bloody old garden.
-Then you would remember
 the late Captain.
-And his father, and the old
 gentleman afore his father.
See that dent?
That belongs to Captain Pyke.
-A mark caused possibly
 by the imprint of a stone.
-And right you are, sir.
Many a good licking
young Master Robin got for chucking
 stones at me, sir!
-Sounds as though the
 young man was someone wild.
-Wild?
He was a holy terror.
-Ready and waiting, sir.
I've harnessed up old Caesar
 and he's raring to go.
-You must tell me some
 more on the way over.
Better bring the bottle.
-Right-o, sir.
Scotch is sure good
 for the backache.
Steady, Caesar.
 Steady.
He's hard to handle when
 he's raring to go, sir.
-You were saying?
-You can't make English gentry
out of the heathen Chinese, no how.
Not in these parts.
-Very difficult, I imagine.
When the captain was alive,
 did he stay here often?
-Until last Tuesday,
we ain't seen nothing on him to close
 nigh on two years.
-Hmm.
-Shall we, ah, have one, sir?
-You take two.
-Right-o, sir!
The old back feels
 better already, sir.
-Magic.
-There's the Grange now, sir.
-Any servants there now?
-Well, nothing what you might
 call real servants, sir.
There's Daffy
Dolly, and well, you might have to be
 to keep that place.
I kept it for 30 years.
-Stop a moment.
-Woah, Caesar.
-I'll walk the rest of the way.
I'm in a hurry.
Wait here for me.
-I won't budge an inch.
[BURP]
-I beg your pardon.
[BELL RINGING]
-Is your mistress in?
-No, sir.
-Where is she?
-London Town.
-I understand this
 house is for sale.
I may wish to buy it.
I'll look it over.
I'll look it over.
-That's the mistress.
Such a good looker.
Such eyes.
She walks like a cat.
Such a figure.
Such a fine bit of good.
-Buzz, buzz.
-Mistress sleeps here.
[PANTING]
-Aren't you feeling good?
-It's my heart.
Water.
 Quick!
-Just a minute.
Just a minute!
[KNOCKING ON WOOD]
-Drink this!
-I'm dying.
Do phone for a doctor!
 -Oh, dear!
We haven't got any
 phones in the house.
-Then go for one!
-Doctor's a good
 five miles away!
-Fetch him.
 Hurry!
Hurry!
Run!
-All right, I'll run, I'll run.
-It's so kind of you to come.
Knowing my late husband
 as intimately as you did,
I felt I could turn
to no better person to help me through
 this trying time.
-Well, you know,
 anything I can do.
-You are very nervous today.
-Well, I can't help it.
Look at my hands.
You know, I'm-- I'm
 trembling all over.
That'll stop the
 racket, at any rate.
-My late husband always spoke
of you in the warmest terms, and you know the high regard
 in which I've always held you.
-Oh, have you?
-Can you doubt it?
You are the only one who
 knows my husband's affairs.
Everything has been left in
 the most terrible disorder.
My house in the
 country will be sold.
I wonder, if you
 could spare the time--
-Yes?
-You could be my guest
 over the weekend.
And we could go through
 his papers together.
-Well, you know, with pleasure.
I could do with a
 bit of a change.
-We could drive down.
Would tonight be possible?
 -Tonight?
No.
You see, I've got an
 important meeting tonight.
-Then tomorrow?
-Tomorrow.
May-- may I make a
 little confession?
You know, Mrs. Pyke, I've
 always admired you tremendously.
-Who's there?
-Baker.
-Oh, it's you, is it?
-Who did you think it was?
Where are the others?
-I'm the first one here.
-There's a rat among us.
-Yes, and he's facing
 me, seated on a chair.
-Today someone has
 given away the code.
"Anyone supplying information
concerning the Scarlet Ring will be rewarded.
Apply Sherlock Holmes,
 221A Baker Street."
It's one of us.
 That's certain.
We can leave out [INAUDIBLE].
Can't be that dumb Chinaman.
There remains you,
 myself, and Merrydew.
-Well, it's not me.
 On my oath.
-Or me, I swear it.
-Menace.
-I thought that snake
 was double-crossing me.
-Well, it's getting
 on my nerves.
-It's now going
 to be a nightmare.
-First Murphy, then
 Pyke, then Dearing.
Who will be next?
Listen.
Suppose someone wants to supply
 information to Sherlock Holmes.
-Then it'll all come out.
-No, no.
Holmes is different
 from the police.
He protects clients.
-Holmes works with the police.
What's in the back of your mind?
-I want a fine carriage.
I want to leave.
The suspense is
 getting on my nerves.
It's killing me.
-What suspense?
Well, pray be seated, gentlemen.
I overheard your conversation.
It's most illuminating.
-We are not going on.
-No?
And why not, Frank?
-I don't want to
 die like Murphy.
-Or be found dead like Pyke.
 -No?
Perhaps you'd like to spend the
 rest of your lives in prison.
Hmm?
No, my friends.
Crime brought you
together, and by crime you will stick together.
Gentlemen, in a few more
days, the Scarlet Ring will cease to exist.
-We'll cease to exist, you mean?
-I have just received word
 from the agent of Antwerp.
The plunder has finally
 been disposed of.
This time next week, the
 principal will be in my hands.
A small, unimportant matter
of some 1 million pounds to be divided equally among us.
200,000 pounds apiece.
Ah.
200,000 pounds.
-And meanwhile?
-You've waited for five years.
What's a matter of a few days?
-Here, what guarantees that
 we'll be alive to receive it?
-None.
Of course, if it were a question
of your life without the money, it might be arranged.
-How?
-Letter in the form
of a deed of gift relinquishing your
right to any benefits accruing to the Society.
-And give up 200,000 pounds?
-It might ensure your life.
-I'll see you burn first.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Shh.
Not a word.
Well, Miss Forrester.
 This is a pleasure.
Come in.
Would you sit down?
And now to business.
Miss Forrester and
gentlemen, again I have the pleasure of
 presiding at this meeting.
[PHONE RINGING]
-Hello?
One moment.
 A Mr. Standford.
-Yes?
 Where?
-Well, thank
 [INAUDIBLE] you've come.
I followed her here and
 phoned you immediately.
She went through the side door.
And there were four others.
A lawyer, two white men,
 strangers, and a Chinaman.
-When it comes, it
 won't come from the sky.
-Oh, shut up.
-Oh?
-I'm on fire.
Life's worth more
 to me than money.
-Yours may be.
Mine isn't.
Shall we walk to the
 station together?
-No, no.
 You go ahead.
-She's inside.
They've left her inside!
-Shh.
-Dash.
Check the door!
Eileen!
My darling!
-Get in the fresh air.
-God.
-You came in the nick of time.
Get her home.
Don't let her out of your sight.
 Go on.
-Arrest him, save me save me!
-Speaking as a medical man,
it is extremely dangerous to run at your age
 and with your weight.
-Could I-- could I have
 a glass of water please?
-Sit down.
-Oh, thank you.
I must apologize for bursting
 in like this, Mr. Holmes.
-I'm Dr. Watson.
I don't know when Mr.
 Holmes will be back.
Please wait.
-Thank you.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Come in.
Sit down.
Cigarette?
Any luck?
Too bad.
I have here the securities.
Easily negotiable
 for a million pounds.
The Chinaman Ah Yet is
 devoted to his mistress.
Doubtless a generous
 purse will satisfy him.
On account of Holmes, I
cannot impress upon you too sufficiently the
 necessity for speed.
Everything must be finished
 tomorrow night at the Grange.
I will make all
 the arrangements.
-You've got to help me.
Mr. Holmes.
If you don't, I'm a doomed man.
Not 10 minutes ago, an
 attempt was made on my life.
You see, I live on Ebury Street.
I was on my way there.
I was about to
cross the road, and some instinct made me leap back.
As I did, a car, driven
with terrific speed and coming on the wrong side
 of the road, whizzed by me.
How I escaped was a miracle.
-Did you by any chance see
 the occupant of the car?
-Yes.
As it flashed by me, I caught
 a glimpse of the driver.
A black-bearded man.
-Is there anyone who would
 benefit by your death?
-Yes.
 Four persons.
You see, Mr. Holmes, there's
 an estate to be settled up.
And if I should go out,
 well, they get my share.
-Is any one of them capable
 of committing a crime?
-Yes.
Three of them.
-How much is your
 share of this estate?
-200,000 pounds.
-Naturally, you would
 wish to live to enjoy it.
When were you in China last?
-I was never in China.
-Come, come, sir.
Then the tattooing
 above the right wrist?
-Well, that-- that
 was done in England.
-You must be mistaken.
That particular yellow is
 to be found only in China.
What made you come to me?
-Well, you see, Mr.
 Holmes, I-- Well,
I'd heard of your reputation.
-How did you know my address?
Aren't you here in answer
 to my advertisement?
Were you not returning
 from Limehouse?
Are you not a member
 of the Scarlet Ring?
Is it not a fact that
three of your members have met with very
sudden ends and you're terrified lest their
 fate before you?
-Why, you must be
 the devil himself.
-Answer me.
-Yes, Mr. Holmes.
But I'm guiltless.
I'm up against some
power that no precaution can guard against.
-Go straight home and lock
 yourself in your house.
-But it's very old and
 easily broken into.
-Do you have a cellar?
-Bomb-proof.
-Hide there.
On second thought, we'll see
 what we've been [INAUDIBLE].
Take a revolver, Watson.
-So, do you think
 there's any hope?
-Obey my inspections
implicitly and I can promise you almost a chance.
Tomorrow, leave town.
-You see, Mr. Holmes,
 I get in pay today.
You see, I know it is
 a place in the country.
Very secluded.
Miles away from any place.
It belongs to the widow of
 an acquaintance of mine.
The lady is an
 Oriental, an Asiatic.
As a matter of
 fact, she's Chinese.
-Mrs. Pyke.
When you arrive at the
Grange near Sherbournes, you'll probably be given
 the room next to the lady.
You'll find a door
 connecting the two rooms.
Keep it locked.
Arrive there neither before
 nor later than 9 o'clock.
On your arrival,
 pretend a headache.
-Pretend one?
Oh, Mr. Holm.es
-Go straight to your room.
If you value your life,
 don't open the door.
-Baker!
They got him too.
 -Poison.
-Wait here, says he, for me!
And that's the last
 I've seen of him.
-A rake and a queer one.
Free with his money.
Same as I say.
-He must have been the
 picker when he was a lad.
Dolly ran all the way
to fetch Dr. Smallwood, and she and Smallwood
nigh burst a blood vessel trying to get to him.
And when they found
 him, he wasn't there.
And nary a one of them
 ever set eyes on him again.
-Same as I say.
Company!
Evening gentlemen, evening.
Up you get, Will, and
 make way for the gents.
Good evening, gentlemen.
 Good evening.
-Good evening.
 -Good evening.
-Take anything to drink?
-Wouldn't come amiss.
-Scotch and splash?
-Scotch and splash,
 how did you know, sir?
Thank you, sir.
-Give your order, gentlemen.
Put the bottle on the table,
 glasses, and [INAUDIBLE] soda.
-Right, sir.
 Bottle of whiskey.
Four glasses. [INAUDIBLE].
Gentlemen?
[CHATTERING]
-Four glasses.
-There you are, sir.
What brings you gentlemen
 round these here parts?
-This friend of mine belongs
 to the medical profession.
A patient of his has escaped.
An old gentleman of any
 dangerous character.
That's the reason for
 all these wardens.
-An old gentleman?
Wearing a cape?
Stoops a bit?
 Big in the belly?
-You've seen him?
-Have I seen him?
Yes, sir.
And Dolly at the Grange
seen him and Dr. Smallwood ought to have seen him but
 he never set eyes on him.
As sure as I'm
 standing here, sir.
He sat right there.
It was the day before yesterday.
-Doctor, we're on the right set.
 Say when.
-When.
Well, here's to your
 very good health, sir.
-Another beer?
Thank you very kindly, sir.
-Pay the bill, Watson.
And take care of this gentleman.
-Come along.
 What'll you have?
-Well, here's hoping
 that we get him.
-Who?
-Cash my buttons if I know.
My mind has never
 been in such a fog.
-It's time to leave.
-Gregson should be there by now.
We'll have the Grange so
well-surrounded a cat couldn't get through without being seen.
Come along, men.
-Mr. Holmes, something
 terrible has happened.
Miss Forrester has disappeared.
 -Disappeared?
But I told you to guard her.
-But I couldn't
 understand your telegram.
-Telegram?
 What telegram?
-Instructed me to
 meet you at Dover.
-Are you mad?
-I don't know, I'm
 almost insane with worry.
-Go on.
-When I arrived at Dover,
 I suspected it was a hoax.
I returned to
 London immediately.
Fortunately, I
 have a racing car.
Arriving there, I went
 straight to Eileen's house.
She'd gone.
A maid told me that she
left in the early afternoon with a strange woman.
-A Chinese woman?
-Yes.
I called you where you live.
When I gave my name
to your housekeeper, she told me where
 I could locate you.
Oh, Mr. Holmes, what
 could have happened?
Oh, where could she be?
-Come, Lestrade.
There's not a moment to lose.
-Mr. Holmes is late.
-Are you sure
 you're not mistaken?
-I have written instructions
 to bring you here.
You saw them.
-Perhaps the fog.
-I'm certain he'll be here.
If not tonight, then
 tomorrow morning.
[BELL RINGING]
 -Who's there?
-Strange.
I seldom--
-Stop!
You open that door, and I'll
 choke the life out of you.
-Mr. Wilson, have
 you lost your reason?
-Tell him if he opens
that door, he'll never live to open another. never live to open another.
 -Off you go.
-Off you go.
-Who is it?
 -Telegraph.
Telegraph for Miss Forrester.
-I'll give it to her.
 -All right.
-Good news?
Excuse me.
 -Here, what is it?
What is it?
-What does it mean?
-Dear, I'm going to bed.
Miss Forrester, when you go
 to your room, lock your door.
Shh-- And keep it locked.
-What's the matter?
-I'm rather chilly.
-Who's there?
-It's me, sir.
-Did you deliver the telegram?
-Yes, sir.
-To Miss Forrester herself?
-I gave it to one lady to
 give to the other, sir.
-Thank you.
 Good night.
-Good night, sir.
-Will you let me go to her?
-Wait.
-I'll never do it again.
-What?
-Stand about all
 night without a flask.
Look, Holmes.
Over there.
-Drop your gun.
Well, Inspector?
-I checked up on all points.
No one could have
 slipped through.
-Good night, my dear.
My bedroom is just
 across the corridor.
If you should want
me for anything, don't hesitate to call me.
-Thank you.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Mr. Wilson, are you in bed?
-Yes, yes.
Sorry.
Good night.
-Good night.
-Who's that?
-Sir.
He's there.
Came by boat.
-When?
-15 minutes ago.
-Why didn't you
 let me know sooner?
-It's this fog.
Our men lost their bearings.
-At once to the
 front of the house.
Come, come.
-You stay here.
-Very good, sir.
-I thought you would never come.
-This cursed fog.
Where's the girl?
-At the end of the corridor.
-Good.
 Wilson?
-He's locked his door.
-Get him out.
Offer him any inducement.
-He's in the house.
[SCREAMING]
-Miss Eileen!
 That's Eileen!
-Mr. Wilson, quick.
Miss Forrester-- something
 terrible has happened.
-Eileen!
Eileen.
Eileen, my darling,
 are you all right?
WILSON: Help!
Murder!
Help!
-Break it down.
-I have--
-Halt!
Halt!
Halt!
-Are you all right?
 -Quite all right.
Thank you, Watson.
Take them downstairs.
-As I suspected.
 -Captain Pyke.
-You are charged with the
 murders of James Murphy,
Malcolm Dearing,
 and William Baker.
-And this woman?
-As an accomplice.
 Take them away.
-I saw him killed.
-You saw him pretend
 to be killed.
It was he who attacked you.
-He was shot.
-No shot broke that window.
He broke it himself.
-But the blood.
-Animal blood.
On a sponge.
Merrydew, of course,
 was in on it.
-Mr. Holmes, there's
 a second man outside.
Came by car.
I thought it my
 duty to detain him.
-Bring him in.
-Well, well, well, Mr. Holmes.
This is indeed a surprise.
-What are you doing here?
-Well, surely a man has a
 right to visit his own house.
I own the mortgage
 on this place.
I've invited some friends
down for the weekend to discuss some business.
-Won't do, Merrydew.
Arrest him.
-Well, this is rather a
 high-handed procedure.
What are the charges, Holmes?
-The gravest possible.
That of being accessory to
 the murders of James Murphy,
Malcolm Dearing,
and William Baker, and with the attempted
 murder of Javis
Wilson and Miss
 Eileen Forrester.
-Hmm.
Rather a tall indictment.
I think you'd better
 have the bracelets.
-May I help you?
-I've more than enough here.
-Then who can tell?
I say, who can tell?
-This will mean a
 promotion, Lestrade.
-I'm very grateful
 to you, Mr. Holmes.
But how you did it beats me.
-Simple enough.
Simple.
-Simple?
-By the examination of the
 footsteps in the garden of Mr.
Dearing's house, I was certain
 of the murderer's description.
You will remember the ring.
There was no mark to
indicate that it had remained on that finger for a
period of six years as stated by his mistress.
-His wife, you mean.
-Mistress, Watson.
Mistress.
-Well, you ought to know.
-And the Scarlet Ring?
-Perhaps you'll
remember the appearance of the Mandarin's gems
 in China some years ago.
-Perfectly.
-To realize on gems of
international repute to be a ticklish matte?
 -Very.
They'd have to be
broken up piece by piece and then disposed of
 carefully and slowly.
-Exactly.
The Scarlet Ring was
formed by the instigators of the original crime to
 protect the receiving end.
-And what was Pyke's motive?
-Greed.
The last survivor will
become the recipient of the entire booty.
I think it will
be found that Pyke was the original ringleader.
But Mr. Wilson could furnish
 us with an answer to that.
-Not one word.
-We shall never forget
 you, Mr. Holmes.
-Rather not, sir.
-You must invite
 me to the wedding.
-Perhaps you'll give me away.
-I appreciate the
compliment, but I never give a lady away,
 except professionally.
Come, Doctor.
They'll send for you
 when they need you.
[THEME MUSIC]
- Oh!
- Sorry!
This way.
Two of you, smash it down.
Get ready, boys.
See what you can find.
- See what there is in there, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Inspector.
- Yes?
- There's a body in here.
- A what?
Murder, eh?
Huh? Wh-What is it? What's the matter?
- Tell her I'll ring her back in five minutes.
- Come along.
I say, this is a bit thick.
This is a bit thick.
Prancing without a word of warning into a man's private bedroom.
Come along, now. This isn't a bedroom, and it certainly isn't yours.
The significance of that uniform doesn't escape me.
But to prance in on a man in his pajamas is...
Oh.
I see your point.
I shall have to take your particulars.
Name, please.
Certainly. My name's...
Ehrm... name's...
By Jove! It's gone.
- Come along, don't try that.
- Bad show, quite gone.
I'll give you one more chance.
Who are you?
I-I c-can't remember.
Am I Smith, am I Jones?
I couldn't be Goldberg.
- What's your business here?
- I'm not engaged in business.
I am not engaged in business.
Is it King? Kingfisher? Fish?
Foch?
How did you come to be in these offices?
- Hello?
- I beg your pardon.
- I came here to see a fellow.
- Can't recollect if you saw him?
I didn't see him... but I've an impression that he saw me.
- You're in a very compromising situation.
- I object to that adjective.
- You've been found on suspected premises...
- Quite.
- Can't explain why...
- Quite.
- Don't know who you are, why you came here.
- Quite.
Do you know where you're going?
- At a rough guess, Scotland Yard.
- Quite.
Come along.
- Oh, the paper.
- Search for missing plane abandoned.
You can't do that. You're under arrest.
If a man's lost his memory, has he lost the two o'clock?
Wait a minute!
- What won the two o'clock?
- Sir Eaglemore.
- And the two-thirty?
- Maiden's Kiss.
Give him the paper.
Thank you, Inspector. Er...
In!
Come in.
Inspector Davis, sir.
Yes, Inspector?
We found this man asleep at 15 Humphrey
Street, sir. He refused all information.
There were no identification marks but we found this bunch of skeleton keys on him.
Take him straight to Major Hammond,
Air Ministry DI5.
Magnificent, nabbed the lot.
- Come on.
- Good day.
Inspector Davis, sir.
Morning, Inspector. What's all this?
This man was arrested in the Humphrey Street operation.
He's to be handed over to Major Hammond for interrogation.
Oh, I see. Well, he's just come in.
- Get Major Hammond to sign for him.
- I'll sign for him.
- Keep an eye on him, won't you?
- Don't worry, Inspector, I know the type.
- This way, please.
- Oh, a second. My umbrella.
Thank you.
What do you mean, you know the type?
What's Major Hammond been doing to be brought to be questioned by him?
Getting hit on the head like a clumsy amateur.
- What's the time?
- A little after four.
Get me Portman 2323.
Have a look at that, will you?
- So they've abandoned the search.
- Yes. Can you beat it?
Hello?
Daphne, my darling, I'm sorry. I shan't be able to have tea with you this afternoon.
What?
But, Charles, I'm all ready to go.
Oh, I'm sure you look beautiful.
But I just can't make it.
We'll have dinner together tomorrow night.
And wear that new dress you told me about.
But, Charles, there's something very, very important I have to tell you.
Tell me tomorrow, my sweet. Must dash now.
I'll call for you at eight.
Why have they abandoned the search?
Because they think it's just another accident. Come here.
March 15th, a French Hirondelle on test off Toulon - lost, an accident.
4th April, a double day bomber lost off Los Angeles - accident.
May 19th.
From Kronstadt in Russia, the Radensky bomber disappears - another accident.
All these machines were carrying valuable experimental apparatus.
Last week, off the Firth of Forth, Barrett &
Ward test their Tornado Super X. Vanishes.
Accident.
September 20th, London.
Major Hammond makes an ass of himself trying to find out why.
- Another accident?
- Almost a catastrophe.
Yes, fools walk in where angels fear to tread.
The world's full of wise men and only three fools, three fools who don't think they were accidents -
Monsieur Gambetta from France,
Robert Hooker of the United
States Intelligence, and your humble servant.
Ask Marshal Gosport if he could see me, would you?
- He can't be disturbed, sir.
- Who's with him?
- Mr Barrett of Barrett & Ward.
- The plane manufacturer?
Yes, and I gather he rather resents our enquiries at his factory.
And I rather resent Mr Barrett.
- Where'll you be?
- Disturbing Gosport.
- Marshal Gosport's not to be disturbed.
- Right.
In my opinion, the only thing...
Sorry, Marshal,
I understood you were disengaged.
All right, Hammond, come in.
This is one of my ablest men.
Hammond was pressing for this investigation of your factory.
Just because a firm has a government subsidy, the slightest accident sees swarms of you Secret Service fellas nosing about, putting the wind up the workers - industry's becoming unworkable.
- The point is...
- I know the point. You can save your breath.
Service and civil airplanes crash every day, hundreds in a year.
But you don't spy on the Royal Air Force or liner companies.
We're engaged in dangerous experimental work.
One airplane hasn't come back and you're on us like a ton of bricks.
Out it all comes in the press - inefficiency, sabotage in aircraft factories. Monstrous!
- The press have to have a good story.
- It's not good for me.
Every operation in my factory is under my supervision.
I tell you, everything's absolutely OK!
- Have a cup of tea.
- I never touch the stuff.
- If you've got a spot of whisky...
- Certainly.
I appreciate your feelings and like your point about the whisky.
Sorry I got overheated, but we industrialists are splitting our shorts to help you official fellows out of the spot you got in over rearmament.
It's a bit hard if you come down on us like this.
A few months ago, there was a disappearance of a high-speed aircraft off the Isle of Wight.
Thank you. It went up, never returned, not a trace was found, and not even a fragment of wreckage washed up.
In the past year, machines on test flight have disappeared from Bordeaux, Toulon,
Los Angeles, Kronstadt - all these machines carrying valuable secret apparatus.
Is that coincidence?
There he goes, there he goes.
I sympathize with you fellas.
Your job's sensationalism, and you look at things like a melodrama.
- I forgive you.
- We hope you won't forget us.
Thank you, gentlemen, I'll keep you posted.
If I need you, I'll send for you.
Meanwhile, carry on.
So more machines are to disappear into the blue.
I think it would be a good idea for you to cast your eye over his plant. Unofficially, of course.
I'll give you every facility, but if he finds you out, you're acting against instructions.
- The Nelson touch.
- He's testing out the new QE97 tomorrow.
I've detailed Commander Robertson.
Accompany him.
After all, in my position, I've got to go slow with these industrial magnates.
The safety of the country depends on their goodwill.
Their goodwill extends about as far as their subsidies.
Viking off on another job, eh?
She's been commissioned to recover gold from the Panther.
Panther? I remember, she went down with all hands in 1922 in a fog.
Yes, and she went down deep.
This is a tough job.
Urgent message from the Viking, sir.
- Well, Carl?
- A wireless message from the Viking, sir.
They've located the Panther and start diving at once.
- You've notified Lloyd's?
- It's all clear.
But I haven't told them the Viking's in position.
Why not? You know the regulations.
It is difficult enough to do business here when one observes the regulations.
- When one does not...
- I'll let them know at once.
Please. This is the most important commission this company has had. Much depends on it.
Could I have a word with you, Mr Barrett?
Certainly, McVane. Come along. What is it?
- Shall I go, sir?
- No, Jenkins, stay here.
Get if off your chest, McVane.
- I'd very much like to take up the new ship.
- So would the other lads.
- But after what happened to Griggs...
- We won't discuss that.
- The crew will be chosen by lot.
- But I'm the only unmarried pilot here.
Time will cure that, no doubt.
We won't argue that, McVane.
He's a pig-headed old so-and-so.
- What?
- I know you're the best pilot we've got, McVane.
How do you manage that?
Have you ever been up in the air?
It's obvious. All the fellows say so.
Barrett's keeping you back cos you're not a yes man.
If you're thinking of changing your job,
I can easily get you fixed up.
- Well... thanks.
- Here's my card. Drop in and have a chat.
25 Elder Street.
Thanks.
Well, she's ready to go, sir.
She's a nice job, a beautiful job.
Ideal conditions. She should jump up the record several notches.
Jenkins, have you got those instructions?
Here they are, sir, sealed as you directed.
- What about the crew?
- I'll see to that.
We can't take too many precautions.
- Air Ministry plane arriving.
- Good.
We'll get off just after he lands.
Come along and meet him.
- How do you do, Commander?
- Mr Barrett.
- Our designer, Mr Pollock.
- How do you do?
The ship's just over here, if you'd come along, sir.
L 58)'-
- Will she be all right here?
- Yes, we'll move her up for you.
Thank you.
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
- That's all right.
What would you like?
Whisky, but I shall have to have some of your rotten tea.
We have two kinds of rotten tea.
Indian or China?
Pretty fresh for a new girl.
- All new things should be fresh.
- Skip it, and bring me some coffee.
- They're having the test flight today, aren't they?
- It's only a rumour.
Who's to be pilot?
How do I know?
Suspense getting on your nerves, huh?
Keeping us standing around like this for hours on end. It's like going over the top.
You can hardly blame them for being cautious after losing poor Griggs and that crew.
That was before you came here, wasn't it?
Yes, I heard about it.
He must have been very popular.
Yeah.
Your best friend?
Yes.
What do you think happened?
If they'd give me that plane today, maybe I'd be able to answer.
Get at the real truth, huh?
- Two more cups of tea, beautiful.
- Coming up, handsome.
That's the first thing she's got right.
- Hello, McVane. Anything fresh?
- Yeah.
She'll learn. Well, what did the old man say?
"The crews will be chosen by lot."
It seems such a dumb way to go on.
Puts the wind up everybody.
I expect every clerk in Whitehall knows which of us is going up and in what.
I expect we'll read it in the papers.
They have no difficulty finding out.
Other people than the newspapers know what goes on.
- The black hand at work.
- Griggs knew when he went up.
Somebody else knew too.
That's why he didn't come back.
Are you suggesting Griggs sold out?
Aeroplanes don't just go into the air and stay there!
Now, now, boys, no tailspins in the canteen.
How are you, rat poison?
I'd like a packet of cigarettes, a box of matches... and a kiss.
Cigarettes, matches...
That'll be one shilling, please.
- You're a nice little bit, aren't you?
- I'm my mother's favourite child.
She'll have you back on her hands soon.
Shut up, Jenkins. She only started today.
And she finishes tonight.
- Who's that?
- That's Jenkins.
- Barrett's confidential clerk.
- Nice person.
Yes, charming. I'm sorry you got the sack.
It doesn't matter. I'm used to it.
Stand by, please. Stand by, please.
The following to report immediately to No.5 hangar on special duty.
Pilot, John Peters... Pilot, John Peters.
- Now we know.
- Well, good luck, John.
Observer, J Nicholl's...
- Observer, J Nicholls...
- Well, sorry, boys.
Navigation Officer, R Mackenzie.
- Navigation Officer, R Mackenzie.
- Thais me, boys.
- Let me have your book.
- Don't lose my place.
And Wireless Operator, C Scott.
- Well, here we go, boys.
- Best of luck, lads.
Wireless Operator, C Scott.
So the lot didn't fall on Elisha after all, eh?
Peters didn't seem keen on going.
He was mumbling about presentiments.
Why have they broken up the crews? Your sparks, my observer, Wilson's navigator.
They think each crew's in the pay of a different government.
If they mix us all up, we shan't be able to agree which foreign power to sell out to.
Here's the course, Peters.
Take things easy.
We don't know what you may run into.
- I understand.
- Get off and good luck.
Thank you.
QE97 calling... QE97 calling...

Inform, please, ray is switched on.
All ready, sir.
Contact!
- We've got it!
- Good!
- Both engines cut. Report.
- The set's dead. Something's blown.
Contact with Peters is completely out sir.
We'll have to bail out.
Keep on trying, man.
It must be only a radio breakdown.
I hope so.
Dump as much petrol as you can.
- There's a ship below.
- What is it?
Looks like a dredger.
I hope he brings her down gently.
- We'll circle and pancake down to her.
- Good.
Hope she won't have to dredge for us.
- Clear away forward derrick.
- Boatswain!
Aye aye, sir.
Clear away the forward derrick and stand by!
Aye aye, sir.
Clear away the hatches and prepare the derricks!
- How was that, lads?
- A mother couldn't put a baby down gentler.
- They're coming.
- Any way to get aboard?
What happened to these engines?
We'll bring her alongside the plane.
Slow ahead both.

Boatswain! Take them below.
Aye aye, sir.
Absolutely no trace, sir.
I've drawn a blank everywhere.
Hello. We've lost contact with Peters.
Last reported ten miles out to sea off
Land's End. Send up every plane and search.
McVane, McVane, Peters has faded out, ten miles off Land's End!
- Did he radio any trouble?
- Not a word. They were doing 440 when the whole works cut out.
- If they're down, they're sure to be picked up.
- No, he's gone the same way as Griggs.
Stand by. AH pilots and mechanics to report outside the west hangar.
That's us, boys!
I'm glad it wasn't you, Mr McVane.
What does it matter who it was?
What about Peters?
- Was he married?
- Yes.
- Any children?
- A boy and a girl.
- Where do they live?
- In Highgate... Why do you want to know?
Just curious. Aren't you going to look for them?
Of course, we're all going!
But it's too late!
Let me know what happens.
You'll read it in the papers.
Spread over the course fanlike.
McVane, keep dead on it. The others will be five miles apart on either side.
Now get off.
Yes, it's one of our planes, all right.
It's A-B-T-D.
That's McVane, looking for us.
Wish he could find us.
The searching plane asks whether we've seen E97.
- Report we have seen nothing.
- We've seen nothing.
Oh, he's off.
I see. All right, thanks.
The Air Ministry have said they have a search patrol standing by.
- They won't act until your last pilot has reported.
- They have, except McVane.
What's he playing at?
The rest have been back an hour.
- Perhaps he's found something.
- Think so?
- Plane landing, Mr Barrett.
- That'll be McVane.
Well?
Come on, man, what did you find?
Didn't you find anything?
What the blazes have you been doing?
What do you think? Joyriding?
I've been over the course half a dozen times - not a trace.
The Savonia outward bound, a few trawlers and the Viking on a salvage job.
- None of them reported a thing.
- No sign of oil?
When you didn't come back, we thought you'd found something.
Your optimism is touching! That plane was lost when it left the ground.
What are you suggesting?
Let's get this thing straight.
You're criticizing the pilot.
I see your game!
No, that pilot was one of the best you had.
- He's trying to say the plane isn't airworthy.
- No, the plane was 100%.
- What are you insinuating?
- It's obvious to anyone but you.
You won't admit the fact that there's something very wrong with your factory.
Those planes didn't just disappear.
Enough, McVane! This is a very serious charge at a moment like this!
You've said this before in front of witnesses.
Lucky for you I don't take you to court.
Keep your eyes off the yellow press and your mouth shut!
You'd like everybody's mouth shut!
If you've anything more to say, say it off my payroll!
Do you want me any more tonight, sir?
Is there anything else I can do tonight?
Tell me what's happened to my plane.
As a matter of fact, sir, if you could excuse me,
I know the wives of the men pretty well and I thought I might prepare them for the bad news.
- It isn't certain. There's still hope.
- Yes, sir.
Even then, I thought it might be kinder...
Do what you like. Get out of here.
Well, what do you make of it, eh?
Losing two aeroplanes, one after the other.
It must be some defect. It must be!
There can't be anything in that nonsense about enemy agents.
- Perhaps it isn't nonsense.
- What if it is enemy agents, and they have got that new supercharger?
- What supercharger?
- The one we were trying out.
- It wasn't on the aeroplane.
- What are you talking about?
- You sent instructions to have it changed.
- Are you mad?
- Here's your note.
- I never sent any note.
- You signed it.
- I never signed anything.
- That isn't my signature.
- Then whose is it?
It's mine.
What the blazes are you doing here?
I shared your view as to the importance of the supercharger, so I removed it for this flight.
- Did you fellows know anything about this?
BOTH: No.
I resent your intrusion in my factory, Hammond.
I won't say any more, as you saved a valuable piece of apparatus.
But in view of your means of achieving your end...
In view of your attitude... l don't think I'll come in. Good night.
Well, are you going to sit here all night?
Have you any objection?
No. Are you all right?
Yes, thank you. Why wouldn't I be?
- I was worried about you.
- Why?
The others had been back for over an hour and I thought something had happened.
I see.
That was very kind of you.
- No news, I suppose?
- Nothing.
Vanished.
- Could they have drifted off their course?
- Not possible.
- Scott was reporting to the Control Tower till...
- Till what?
Look here, why do you ask so many infernal questions?
Just wanted to know.
- Do you mind if I ask just one more question?
- Well?
What are you going to do now?
I ought to go to Whitehall and create such a stink with the Air Ministry that Barrett and half the British
Intelligence department are liquidated!
What I'm going to do is to get drunk.
Mind if I join you?
No... l don't mind.
I don't mind who I'm with tonight.
- I'll change and meet you in the car park.
- Right.
Centre 6000.
News editor, please.
Kay Lawrence here.
Hello, Kay. All right, go ahead.
Continuation of plane disappearance story.
Radio cutout as plane attaining maximum speed.
Radio has questioned all ships in vicinity, but plane not sighted.
Factory squadron wide search fruitless.
Last search plane just returned, have questioned Chief Test Pilot McVane.
Won't talk but suspects sabotage.
Missing crew:
Pilot, John Peters...
Observer, J Nicholls...
Navigation, R Mackenzie. Radio, C Scott.
- Peters married. Two children.
- One girl, one boy.
I'm spending the evening with McVane.
Will ring later.
Good. Follow it up for all it's worth and I'll hold space.
OK.
So that's it.
Just a rotten little newspaper woman.
On the contrary, rather a good one.
Just a lying little sneak, playing the sympathetic girlfriend to a bunch of fellows half mad because their pals have cracked up doing a decent job.
I'm trying to do a decent job too.
Spying on people's private lives, so illiterate scribblers can serve up sensational trash with the morning bacon.
The public have a right to know the truth.
Who employs you? Who pays the bill for your smug flying-field superiority?
The public.
Sounds fine and dandy. Noble.
- Go ahead, justify your pay cheque.
- Do you think I like writing about Peters?
I knew them. Do you think they got a square deal? Do you?
Didn't you say you ought to go to the Air Ministry, if you had the nerve?
But you haven't. You'll get drunk, so I'm doing the only thing I can.
If you won't tell the authorities,
I can tell the public.
Their best pilots are sacrificed to obstinacy and somebody's pride.
Griggs, Peters, and maybe you tomorrow.
Yes, you tomorrow - what about that?
At least I wouldn't have to see you again.
Come in.
Just had a code message through from the Viking. They didn't get the plane.
They did - it is even in the newspapers.
They got a plane, but the new supercharger wasn't fitted to it.
- What is your explanation?
- Perhaps Jenkins can explain when he arrives.
Jenkins? You do not think he will walk out?
No... at least, not until he's paid.
Hm.
This is extremely serious, gentlemen.
Now we shall have to wait for another test flight.
To wait may mean the Tower of London.
But to go back without the supercharger would mean...
- Yes'?
- Jenkins.
Bring that chair. And you, let him in.
Sorry I'm late. I had difficulty getting away from the office.
- Everything went marvellously, didn't it?
- Marvellously.
Supposing we talk a bit of business, eh?
Certainly. Sit down.
Now, Jenkins, what exactly is your game?
Game? You got the plane, it's in the papers.
There were no newspapermen aboard the ship.
Salvage costs money.
Our salvage costs a great deal of money.
Besides, it is dangerous.
I do not like to sacrifice good lives on account of wrong information.
Wrong information?
The new supercharger was not on that plane.
What? But I... I don't understand.
No, neither do we.
Well, you don't think that l...?
- No, we don't think.
- We are sure.
Well, naturally,
I'll investigate, I'll make enquiries...
You will do nothing. You have already done enough. You are lying.
- I'm not, I swear.
- Shut up.
- What do you want me to do?
- Put yourself in a safe place, if you can.
Now, get out!
- There he is.
- Let him have it!
- No, no, not here.
- He's going round the corner.
Follow him.
You shouldn't do things like that.
You ought to be careful.
- But...
- Don't take it so much to heart.
A miss is as good as a mile.
But don't you see? They meant to get me.
Look here, let's calm down a bit.
Let's go for a little walk.
Who... Who meant to do what?
I had a row with those men. They followed me round in that car and tried to run me over.
It's my business. Let me go.
That's no way to treat a man who snatched you from the jaws of death.
You're a trifle rattled, but I think
I know a cure for that. Come inside.
Er... two double brandies, please, miss.
There's four beers and two ales in front of you.
- My friend isn't feeling very well.
- Oh... he does look a bit off.
- That should settle your complaint.
- What complaint?
I never saw anyone so petrified with fear in my life.
- Neat?
- Very neat.
Now, drink that down and have another.
You must admit we're doing our best to nurse you back to health.
I don't see why you want to bother about me.
My weakness - can't keep my nose out of other people's business.
- I'd advise you to keep yours out of mine.
- In a jam?
- Supposing I am?
- You were running away from something...
- or was it someone?
- What's your line of business?
I used to do a spot of flying.
Not that you'd know anything about that.
Oh? What are the odds?
Do you work for Barrett & Ward?
- Have you seen me before?
- I've seen a lot of you recently.
Been... following me?
No, I've been waiting for you to come home.
You live at 25 Elder
Street, across the road.
Are you a copper?
No, if I were, you'd be very glad to see me.
Or would you rather see some of those other friends of yours?
What do you mean?
If I were a copper, I'd lock you up for giving away your country's secrets.
As it is, I'm more interested in the people paying you.
They'll bump you off, Jenkins.
Then, of course, you know that, don't you?
What do you want me to do?
I'll do anything.
Supposing we go to your place and have a little chat.
Come along.
You'd never have got a word out of me if it hadn't been...
Come in.
- Sit down.
- Ah, comfortable.
You'd never have got a word out of me if it hadn't been for that dirty lot of rats.
How many rats?
Oh, plenty.
Was one of them... a lady rat?
As a matter of fact, there is a girl.
She's marvellous.
I can't get her out of my mind.
I can't do anything because of her.
I can't eat or sleep or... or think.
Hello, hello.
Daphne, my darling, sorry, I shan't be able to have dinner with you tonight.
But, darling, I'm all ready to go!
I'm sure you look beautiful but I can't make it.
We'll go riding tomorrow.
I'll call for you at eight.
There's something I must tell you.
Tell me tomorrow, I can't stop now.
I'll call for you at eight.
Oh. Ls Mr Jenkins here?
- Yes.
- Can I see him?
He's er... lying down at the moment.
- Oh.
- Are you a pal of his?
- Well, I know him.
- Good show, good show.
Why?
Got an appointment with him?
He asked me to come and see him.
He's a clerk where I work.
Barrett & Ward's. Good show.
You seem to be very well up in everything.
News gets round.
Look here, I want to see Mr Jenkins.
And so you shall.
Stop that. Dial 999.
Hello. Miss? The police, please.
Hello?
Hello, is that the police?
I'm at 25 Elder Street.
A man's been shot and I've got the fellow who did it. Send someone.
- And bring a van.
- And bring a van.
- Why a van?
- We don't want to walk, do we?
I suppose you realise the spot you're in?
I daresay I caught you at rather an awkward moment.
Yes, very. I was just trying to think.
You realise this man was shot by a bullet fired through that window?
Where do you come in?
I'm the bloke looking for the missing planes.
I have an official status but I don't carry a truncheon.
You just carry a gun.
If you'll examine that gun, you'll see it's not been fired.
Oh.
Well, why was he killed?
To account, rendered and fully paid, for one aeroplane and four lives.
You mean Jenkins gave the show away?
Exactly.
And now we know so much about each other, perhaps you'll let me have my gun back.
You know, old boy, to fire this gun, you must release the safety catch.
- Good night, Inspector.
- It's been charming.
Oh, a second!
Thanks.
Come and meet Blenkinsop.
He's a perfect swine.
- Good evening, Blenkinsop.
- Evening, sir.
Rather late, but we have your white tie laid out.
- We can lay it away again.
- Have we forgotten our engagement?
- We've cancelled it.
- We'll lose our young lady if we're not careful.
We'll lose our gentleman's gentleman if we don't mind our own business.
- Some whisky?
- Lots of it.
Pity about Jenkins getting bumped off, poor fellow.
It happened a moment too soon, that's the point.
He was about to talk.
We might have had something to go on.
- It's about time you did.
- Huh?
Look here. Barrett & Ward build the best aeroplanes in the world.
The best fellows in the world drive the guts out of them so we can build better ones, risking their necks for a few pounds a week.
Then eight of our boys and two machines disappear, and a bloke gets murdered.
You Secret Service chaps are waiting for something to go on - not very slick.
Working miracles is pan of our daily job. You're like the press and a lot of other people.
You say, "The Secret Service is lying down on us. Sack the lot of them." The...
- Good evening, miss.
- Major Hammond in?
- Yes, but he's busy at the moment.
- I'll wait.
But...
"Secret Service fooled by foreign agents. British espionage in the pay of foreign powers."
- Excuse me, sir.
- You're excused.
- I know the girl who wrote this trash.
- What?
Got herself taken on as a waitress at our place.
Got on with the fellows, pretending to sympathize, and she was a newspaper reporter ferreting out the inside dope.
- She was at your canteen posing as a waitress?
- Yeah, why not put a stop to that sort of thing?
I will. H! Put a stop to it this very night.
- Sir!
- Sir to you. Go away.
- I've stood enough from this young female.
- And she's not a bad-looking girl.
If she'd been on the level,
I might have fallen for her.
- She wants a darn good spanking!
- Spanking. If I had my way...
You there... Why didn't Blenkinsop tell me?
Yes, sir.
Did I or did I not tell you I wanted everything connected with this Q Plane case kept out of your wretched little news rag?
You did, darling.
Then kindly explain with what precise object you thought fit to go back on our understanding.
I didn't know there was one.
You can hardly call jumping up and down and telling me to be quiet every time I speak an understanding.
If so, I'm afraid it was a misunderstanding - on your pan.
Anything published about the case is a handicap to me in the prosecution of my profession.
And my profession as a journalist?
You can't compare the relative importance of our professions.
How dare you! A job's a job.
Just because I happen to do mine efficiently, and you don't, that's your affair.
Don't expect me to get a new job. You get one. Something you can do - a bartender.
Change my job! This is my sister.
Now, look here, Kay, this is serious.
- This is McVane, one of Barrett & Ward's pilots.
- We've met.
Yes, we've met. Your sister?
We all have our burdens to carry. Now...
I don't mind you entertaining crooks or drunks or people from your club, but I draw the line at ill-mannered prigs!
Yes, well, I'd have done anything to help you, Hammond, old man, but if it means coming into contact with this heartless, two-faced our Miss Fleet Street 1938, you can count me out.
I've met some queer specimens since I took up reporting, but never once...
We know all about them. We've read about their private lives, what they think...
- Stop, please.
- Go on. I'm on your side. I'd like to say...
- You'll find it all over the front page.
- You won't find that on the front page.
But you will find that it takes more than a thin pilot and a fat Secret Service agent to muzzle the press.
And if they lie down on their jobs and planes get pinched from under their noses, we'll see what a two-faced, female reporter can do about it! Good night!
There you are.
There's the modern woman for you.
She's a grand girl, isn't she?
Women. Women - what should we do without them?
I tell you, McVane,
I love everything about them.
Their touching loyalty, their astonishing self-sacrifice.
And their still more astonishing sacrifice of everybody else.
Their modesty, their conceit.
Their preposterous dress, their ridiculous hats.
Their silly little handbags with a pathetic little bunch of things they carry around inside them.
Little purses, mirrors... sticky lipsticks, nonsensical compacts.
Compacts.
- Blenkinsop!
- Sir.
- We're going out. A white tie and tails.
- But I've just laid them away.
- What? You knew I was going out.
- You told me you'd cancelled it.
How could I have cancelled it, when I've only just thought of it?
Excuse me, sir.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, I've called to see Miss Sonia... erm... Miss Sonia...
- Do you mean Miss Sonia Blake, sir?
- Miss Blake, that's it. Miss Blake.
- Is she expecting you?
- Oh, yes.
- And your name is...?
- I'm her friend Mr Jenkins.
- Oh, no. You're not Mr Jenkins.
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, no, sir.
- Oh, yes. Really, look here.
Here's my card.
Well, maybe you are a bit like Mr Jenkins.
- Aha.
- I'll just ring, sir.
- Good show, good show.
- Yes, been running for six months.
- Oh, must be... a good show.
- Oh, it is a jolly good show.
Er... A Mr Jenkins is here.
What's that? Oh, coming right down, sir.
- Mind if I use your mirror?
- Help yourself.
Y'all wanna see me?
Er... Oh, er...
Are you Miss Sonia Blake?
- No. She's a little fat girl.
- Oh. Do you think I could see her?
- Does she wanna see you?
- It's a surprise.
- Miss Blake don't like surprises.
- I still hope she might like me.
Yes, sir. I think she's gonna like you all right. Come with me.
That's her, that's talking.
Miss Sonia's always talking.
A well-educated girl from one of the best families in Kansas.
Setting out in the world, full of lovely ideals and beautiful thoughts.
Working myself to the bone, giving my best to the public and my employers.
Struggling with a lot of dumb managers who are too stupid to recognise the talents of a real artist.
And then... along comes Cupid and steals into my tired heart.
And what happens? The silly dumb guy goes and gets himself bumped off.
It's cruel. It's heartless.
It's inconsiderate.
It's terrible.
Here was me, all lit up with love for the guy.
Why, I'd even decided to sacrifice my an and marry him.
- Why did he get bumped off?
- I don't know.
- I haven't any idea.
- Must've got mixed up in something crooked.
- If he did, he didn't tell me anything about it.
- What was his business?
Oh, he was a gold diver or something.
A gold diver?
He said something about going down and digging up gold from the bottom of the ocean.
What do you mean, digging up gold from the ocean?
- Don't ask me.
- Who do the police think did it?
They don't know.
They've asked me thousands of questions.
I don't know anything about it.
All I know is, I sure did love that guy. I don't know how I'm gonna face life without him.
- Did you see Miss Sonia?
- Yes, I did.
Would you give her that, please?
- Yes, sir. Sure.
- Thank you.
- 19 Dover Square.
- Did you see her?
Yes, I saw her. She's a perfect blank.
Right.
- Less enthusiasm, please. This is Britain.
- Well, a story's a story - and is this a story!
- If it's yours, it's all lies.
- Isn't that what you want?
- Jenkins was in Barrett & Ward's?
- Yes. He sacked me.
- And you murdered him.
- Yes.
- It wouldn't surprise me.
- I can take it across the street, it's a scoop.
Plane disappears. Secret Service man on the premises. Major Hammond baffled.
Scoop? It's a steam shovel!
Hey, hold that front page!
Follow it up. Get to the works.
Find out about Jenkins.
You're onto the biggest thing since that film star was bitten by an oyster.
- And I love you!
- Less enthusiasm, please.
This is Britain.
I cannot congratulate you. Not to get the supercharger was unfortunate.
But to court publicity by killing this little crook, it was criminal.
But I said no guns. Karl, did I not say no guns?
Why did you have to use a gun?
We had no choice.
He was in his flat with Major Hammond.
- Hammond? Who's he?
- Espionage.
- We will shoot Hammond.
- You will not shoot Hammond.
Shoot, shoot. All you say is shoot!
You have properly put the wind up them.
They'll probably cancel the test and we shall have the whole force after us. Unless...
Unless what, Baron?
Unless we can restore confidence.
I think I have a way to restore confidence.
The Baron always has a way.
Lucky for you, my friend.
Now... this is what you shall do...
Good morning, sir.
Have you read the paper?
Blenkinsop, how could I have read the paper?
- Shall I read it to you, sir?
- No, I can read, you fool.
- Miss Kay's been at it again, sir.
- Blah, blah... "Major Hammond baffled."
- Why don't you try corporal punishment?
- She ought to be hanged.
Oh, a message from Mr Barrett, sir.
Call the office immediately.
- Most urgent.
- Barrett... Barrett.
Urgent? What's up?
Why didn't you tell me?
- I have told you, sir.
- Get out of here, you fool. Pour me a cup of tea.
Hello, Daphne, my darling. I'm awfully sorry.
I can't come riding with you this morning.
But, Charles, I'm all ready to go.
I know. You look beautiful.
But I've ordered the horses.
I'm sure you can explain things to them, my dear.
Charles, there's something
I simply must talk to you about.
Can't stop now. We'll dine at Claridge's.
I'll call for you at eight.
- Mr Barrett, Major...
- ..Hammond, to see you.
- Do you mind my pipe?
- No, sit down.
- You want to discuss the Jenkins affair?
- Yes, it's a terrible business.
- It's beginning to make me think.
- Perhaps Jenkins didn't die in vain.
- Who could do such a cold-blooded thing?
- Some cold-blooded people.
- Don't tell me there wasn't a woman in it.
- She wasn't the cause of the crime.
Merely the recipient of the reward of treachery.
Keep it simple.
I can't cope with literary expressions.
Two of your aeroplanes have mysteriously disappeared.
Your confidential secretary has been mysteriously murdered.
Would it be too much to suggest that these three events are linked?
There may be something in what you say.
I believe Jenkins was linked to those responsible for the disappearance of your aircraft.
I believe they killed him because they thought he'd let them down.
- Let them down?
- Double-crossed them.
- When they didn't get the supercharger.
- I never thought I'd follow your way of thinking.
I'm beginning to say there must be...
Now what did I tell you. Foul play indeed.
I never heard such nonsense.
The wreckage of the E97's been found washed up in Cornwall.
Thank heaven it arrived before I made an ass of myself.
I always said it was an accident.
This proves I'm right.
We don't need to continue this interview.
You're going to dismiss the affair?
- It's all explained.
- Jenkins' murder?
The least said about him, the better.
Getting mixed up in a crime de passion.
It's horrible! Good morning.
Mr Barrett, you're wasted here.
With your genius for sitting on either side of the fence, you ought be in the Government, were it not for your resilience which denotes a remarkable career as a tennis ball.
Stroud, the wreckage of the E97's been found washed up in Cornwall.
Prepare the 131 for test tomorrow.
Morning, sir.
Marshal Gosport wishes to see you.
Mr Barrett has... been on the phone this morning.
And Marshal Gosport... has read the morning paper.
Well, Hammond,
I hope now you are satisfied.
- Are you satisfied?
- Not about this.
If I object to this publicity you're getting, you'll say it's part of an ingenious plan.
It is a plan, but not mine.
- Did you ever have a sister?
- Fortunately not.
Hammond, you'll have to check up this aeroplane business.
- It's not pleasant to be proved wrong...
- A man may be proved wrong and yet be right.
- That statement's a sophistry.
- And that's the word I want. Sophistry.
You behaved extremely rashly.
You persisted in your theories on the flimsiest grounds and now this balderdash in the newspapers!
- It's most damaging. It's not like you.
- I agree.
You'd be best out of the country until the ridicule dies down.
There's a nasty business needs investigating in Palestine.
- It's right down your street.
- And Jenkins' murder?
Jenkins was involved with some woman.
You told me so.
She had nothing to do with the case.
I explored that gold mine.
But Jenkins selling plane information?
What about that same plane found in Cornwall?
- What about the first aeroplane that was lost?
- It will be washed up somewhere else.
- So you insist that I am wrong?
- Yes.
What does that remind you of?
West African tribal murders.
Was I right when Blackwell of the
Colonial Office said I was crazy?
You were both right.
When did I send you that?
Yes, yes, you were right in the Burmese amber case... the Chilean nitrates, the Assam tea-poisoners, and The Times crossword last Friday.
All the same, you leave for Palestine on Saturday.
Saturday. Today's Wednesday.
What are my orders in the meantime?
Oh, finish your puzzle!
Yes, perhaps I will.
- Perhaps I will.
- Perhaps you what, sir?
Finish the puzzle.
Sophistry Uh-uh. You're wrong.
No...
I'm right.
I'm absolutely... right.
I couldn't be wrong. I'm right.
I'm absolutely, absolutely, absolutely right.
I'm right.
I'm right. I'm...
You're right.
Yes.
- Quite right.
- OK, guvnor.
Jenkins is murdered, planes vanish.
I know I'm right.
We're right. We're right.
I'm sure we're right.
- Here we are, sir.
- I'm right, Blenkinsop.
- Who said you were wrong, sir?
- Everybody.
- They're wrong.
- You're right.
- Have we any carrots? Parsnips?
- Yes, sir. Yes.
- Cabbages? Sausages?
- Yes. Yes.
- Onions?
- Yes.
- Garlic?
- No!
- McVane, you want to see me?
- No, you wanted to see me.
We'll settle that later.
We're testing the 131 at daybreak.
I was thinking who should pilot the ship.
Do you think you'd be up for it?
Cut the pompous condescension.
I know you're in a spot for a pilot.
I know you hate my guts, and would rather die than admit you need me.
If you want me to take that ship up, ask me decently or else explain to the Air Ministry why pilots won't fly your planes.
You don't believe that mystery nonsense?
Yes. I've shouted it to you for a week.
It's why I wanted to go.
All right! All right!
Will you, as a favour, take that plane up?
Well, of course I will, you pudding-minded myopic deadhead!
- And mind you bring it down again or...
- I know, I'll be off the payroll.
- Hello, sir.
- Major Hammond in?
Yes, he's in. In a stew.
- Something eating you?
- No, something we're going to eat.
- What are you talking about?
- He's got one of those there.
- What? Where?
- In there. See for yourself, sir.
Oh, no, old boy. You're wrong.
Ha-ha! It seems I've been wrong all the time.
- It does?
- Barrett says so.
- He does?
- Gosport says so.
- He does?
- The press say so.
They do? And now I say so.
- Ah, hold that, will you?
- Yes. Ooh! Ooh!
You see, it was obviously an accident.
- If you ask me, it was intentional.
- It was an accident in the first place.
- It was an accident in France.
- Naturellement.
- An accident in the States.
- You said it.
And so I'm wrong.
Completely, utterly, abysmally wrong.
Then... they take me off the case.
- That's wonderful. That's perfect.
- What's up?
They've taken you off the case and I take up the 131 tomorrow.
- You are?
- Yes.
That fool's sending you...
- Oh, la belle France.
- Oui, oui. La belle France.
Very unfunny and very bad French.
But it doesn't matter. I'm not a newspaper spy now. I got the sack.
- Why?
- I was wrong.
Wrong? Come inside, you're one of us.
- You know McVane?
- We've met.
- Have a carrot.
- Thank you.
When you were a little girl, you had a room upstairs, with red curtains.
- I'm already in it.
- No, you're here making a nuisance of yourself.
- Now, run along.
- Have you read the newspapers?
- We have.
- Well, in my opinion... the Cornwall wreckage wasn't washed up.
Kay!
Send Blenkinsop down here.
- You go on your flight tomorrow morning?
- Yes.
- With the new supercharger?
- Yes.
- You know your route yet?
- Not yet.
- Do you know how to cook?
- Not yet.
- You can start now.
- You sent for me?
- Pack a bag, we're going away.
- Where to, sir?
- The sea shore.
- What about the stew?
Post it on to me.
Hey, Kay, come here a moment.
- Why the sudden dash to the sea?
- Why not?
- You've got me there. KAY: Yes?
Be a good girl and stay by the telephone.
I may need you.
- Right.
- Ooh, and Kay?
- Don't let that fella spoil the stew.
- I'll do my best.
- All ready, sir.
- Ah.
Ah. Come on. Quick.
- Seriously, why don't you get a husband?
- Where from?
Oh, anywhere.
- You'd have no difficulty.
- No?
- No, not if you put your mind to it.
- Oh, my mind.
Yes, good women are scarce.
You'd make a grand wife, honestly.
- Because I can cook?
- That is a selling point.
I suppose you don't want a nice plain cook?
Me? No.
Whatever made you think that?
- Pass me the pepper, please.
- Here.
Think of the advantages of marriage.
You wouldn't have to go off tramping round making an ass of yourself just to earn money.
I take that to be a description of newspaper reporting.
All that son of thing.
A married woman doesn't have to descend to vulgarities to keep herself going.
Of all the pompous, conceited snobs I have ever met, you are the most insufferable.
Do you know, for one appalling moment,
I thought you were going to propose to me.
I would have had the great pleasure of telling you that life with you would be my idea of purgatory.
I hope I never set eyes on you again.
Goodbye!
Oh, I erm... forgot. I'm living here.
As I can't bounce out of the house, would you mind removing yourself?
Goodbye, darling.
Any tampering or souvenir-hunting while this was on the beach?
The local copper sat on it until we arrived. That's his trademark.
This wreckage hasn't been in the sea 48 hours. No corrosion.
Look here. Look. Fresh as when it left the works.
She might have crashed on a rock and been dragged off during high tide.
I suppose the sea took a wrench and snapped this off.
And held it in a vice here to do the trick.
- Wonderful! Where's the engine?
- Probably sank when she broke up.
I suppose the sea undid this nut to get the engine off.
And then put the nut back again.
Unfortunately it forgot the split pin, very careless of the sea.
This plane never met with an accident.
She was broken up.
And whoever did it has kept the engine and the accessories.
- Who found the stuff?
- A fisherman named Mattie.
Probably be at the local pub.
Not a moment to lose.
- They open at six. Coming?
- Sorry.
So you went fishing for sand eels and found an aeroplane, eh?
I lost my breakfast, I reckon.
Another pint of breakfast for Mattie.
- Thank you, sir.
- What time of day was it?
Early morning. You have to catch the turn of the tide for sand eels.
And she turned about a quarter before six last Tuesday.
- And being the nips...
- Nips?
- He do mean the neap - low tide, sir.
- I mean the nips.
And not much wind a-blowing inshore, she did run out fast.
Yes, well, the wreckage came inshore.
Maybe she come over the bar and the bar kept her.
- The bar?
- He do mean the whale's back, out yonder.
I mean the bar!
How much water would there be at high tide over the bar during the hips?
On a calm night, not more than four or five feet.
Ah, looks as if that wreckage knew the channel, eh?
- That's right.
- How'd it be if it were towed into the harbour?
I reckon him as towed it would claim salvage.
- Salvage. That's the way to coin money.
- Aye.
Take the Viking out yonder.
There's salvage for you.
Right digging for gold and knowing it's there.
Digging for gold?
Aye. Raising the gold from the Panther.
Digging for gold.
Did a fellow called Jenkins ever come down here from London?
- No, sir.
- Who'll row me out to the Viking?
Be a long row.
She upped anchor the night afore last.
- What?
- Aye. I heard they said they couldn't do no more this season.
- Have you got a telephone here?
- Aye, sir. Right through here.
But you have to go round there.
- Who is that fellow?
- I don't know. I never seen him before.
He talks a lot, don't he?
Hello! Hello!
Hello, I want to speak to London.
Give me Portman 2323.
Hello.
Daphne, my darling, I'm dreadfully sorry, I can't possibly have dinner with you this evening.
But I'm all ready to go.
Oh, I'm sure you look beautiful, but I just can't make it. Look here.
I'll call at your flat on Saturday.
Now, listen, Charles. You must listen. I've something very important to say to you.
Tell me on Saturday, my sweet.
Must dash now.
Charles, will you be here tomorrow definitely?
Oh, definitely, Daphne.
- Hello?
- Hello, hello. Is that you, Kay?
Yes. Are you enjoying yourself?
How's the weather?
This is no time for asking silly questions. Listen.
Go to Lloyd's. You understand?
Lloyd's. Shipping register.
Find out the movements over the last two years of a salvage vessel called the Viking. Viking.
V, V-l, V-l-K... Vik... Viking.
- Ah, salvage vessel.
- That's the one.
February '38, off Toulon.
Off Toulon.
February '38.
April 20th, off Los Angeles.
Off Los Angeles?
April 20th.
July 9th, off Kronstadt.
Off Kronstadt. July 9th.
September 17th, off Cornish coast.
- Left October 10th.
- Where is she now?
- Last reported off the Welsh coast.
- Her destination?
- Bound for Merlin Bay.
- Merlin Bay. Thank you.
Yeah. What... what...
What's the new destination?
- Sailing up the Welsh coast towards Merlin Bay.
- Listen, Kay, this is desperately important.
There's a test flight tomorrow morning from Barrett & Ward's over Merlin Bay.
I'm going there now. Stop that flight.
See Barrett, see Gosport.
I'll have conclusive evidence.
Stop the flight? How?
If they won't listen to you, what can I do?
Stop that flight.
McVane's the pilot. Do everything you can.
McVane? But why didn't you...
I'll do something.
- Did you send for the car, sir?
- Yes, can you take me to Penzance station?
- The last time she did the job, she didn't like it.
- Oh, I wouldn't be surprised.
- Ha, it's a tidy trip.
- Well, step on it tidily.
- Here you are, McVane.
- Oh, thank you.
With this new supercharger, pressure is practically nil under 1,000 revs.
But she goes up in a much sharper curve than the old type.
- Teaching me how to fly a plane?
- You're impossible.
- Go over those stays.
- I've been over them.
Go over them again and do something with that.
Now, miss, what's your business?
- I must see Mr Barrett.
- That's impossible.
Use the house telephone.
Tell him I must see him.
Aren't you the newspaper lady that was in the canteen?
- Is Mr McVane in the hangar?
- You er... a friend of his?
I'm... I'm his fiancee. Don't you see,
I must see him before he goes up.
Well, er... strictly against orders, miss, but erm...
- John, tell Mr McVane his fiancee's here.
- Tell Mr McVane his fancy's here.
Tell Mr McVane his fancy's here.
McVane, let's get the ship out, so you can get off.
- Boys, warm her up and fill her up.
- Look, I'm worried about this.
We don't know how the pistons will take it, so don't give her the gun till you're over the sea.
- Go away. Put your head in a gas mask.
- I don't want to do that.
- McVane. Wanted at the main gate.
- Who by?
- Gentleman's fiancée, sir.
- He hasn't got one.
- Send the young lady away.
- What does she look like?
- Fairly dark. Pretty, pretty.
- I'd better see her.
You have got a fiancée? You never told me.
What's she doing here?
I suppose she's come to say goodbye.
You should have done that.
I'm taking no chances.
You're going up now and you're seeing nobody till you come down.
- Send the young lady away.
- Just a minute.
- Give her that.
- Any message?
- Say that he said, "Goodbye, darling."
- Yes, "Goodbye, darling."
Say he said, "Goodbye, darling."
- Say he said, "Goodbye, darling."
- Thank you.
Thompson, don't you know how to move a plane?
Here's your course. Well, goodbye.
I shan't forget your doing this, particularly in the circumstances.
See what she can do and you won't need to worry about the future while I'm charge.
That won't be for long. Is she loaded?
- Yes.
- Swing her round, boys.
- Isn't that the test plane?
- Well, er... might be.
They're getting ready to go up.
Please let me in.
- Calm yourself. That won't get you in.
- The plane will be wrecked.
He'll be killed. Sergeant, please!
Well, if she doesn't come back,
I'll turn the place into a toy factory.
- They've taken off. They'll be killed. Please!
- Now, miss. Just a minute.
- Here's the watchman, miss.
- Well?
Mr McVane asked me to give you this.
Any message?
He said, "Tell her l said,
'Goodbye, darling."'
Goodbye, darling.
Well, that's what he said.

They're cutting out.
- Tell Control both engines are cutting out.
- This set's dead. The whole thing's fused.
We've cut out our engines, sir.
She's coming down.
She's died on us, fellows.
History repeats itself.
Get ready to bail out.
- Ship below.
- Where?
There.
- We're in luck.
- In luck?
Well, we'll soon see.
Well, we got what we were after this time.
Put her down nice and neat, Mac.
I don't like bathing.
Keep your seats, gentlemen, please.
Here we are, lads. What do you think?
- We'll get on that ship if we're lucky.
- They're not lowering any boats.
I guess they'll take the plane aboard, and put us with Peters and Griggs.
- She's very much like the other one.
- With one exception.
Yes.
- Ah, Mr McVane, I believe.
- Yes.
I congratulate you on your handling of your machine.
- Thank you.
- You made a better landing than Mr Peters.
You have a better head in emergencies.
Yes, I have. Either you send out an SOS for a ship to take us off immediately, or I'll blow up the petrol tanks and we all go up in smoke.
Oh... l see.
- Take them away. Put them with the others.
- Pick him up.
- Full speed ahead.
- Full speed ahead.
How are you feeling?
As if I've been caressing the wrong end of a machine gun.
Same thing happened to you?
Engines cutout, radio shorted.
Yes, and we floated down like a swan, to be rescued by a gallant crew, headed by a sardonic foreign gentleman, complete with eyeglass and moustache.
- Wait till you meet the skipper.
- Yes, I'm looking forward to that.
- Have you found out anything?
- No, we've been confined to quarters.
- On a diet of silence.
- Ah.
They must have a gadget to bring us down.
I wish I could look around.
- What do you expect to find?
- Marconi was working on a ray when he died.
He could cut a car engine at 25 yards.
They must have perfected it for long distance.
- That's an idea.
- Let's lodge a complaint.
- A big one. I don't like it here. Come on.
- Hear, hear.
Make for the home port.
- Peters, up on the quarter deck.
- Right.
Nicholls and Mackenzie with me.
Let's go up to the bridge.
Come on!
Drop those guns!
Peters!
- Prisoners have escaped, sir.
- What?
Bring the machine guns.
Cover that machine gun.
He's yours, Mac.
All right. Come on. Put 'em up.
Lock that door.
- Hello, Marshal.
- I've got your destroyer.
But if you're making a fool of me, heaven help you.
- Commander Mason.
- We've got the Viking's position.
- When can we get off?
- Once you get on.
Sorry to interrupt your fishing but I hope to hook something big.
I hope so.
Up on the bridge!
- By Jove, she's quick off the mark.
- She's no ordinary salvage vessel.
- How about it, Commander?
- Yeoman?
Sir.
- Signal a heave to.
- Aye aye.
Captain!
Destroyer approaching, sir.
She's signalling us to heave to.
- Stop the engines.
- Don't stop, you fool!
Full speed ahead.
Tell the engineer to increase speed.
Any more speed will break up the engines.
Then break up the engines! More speed!
- They're coming round the other side.
- Swing her round. Quick!
So she really doesn't see the signal.
- Fore gun load, common shell.
- Fore gun load, common shell
I'll put a shot across her bows.
- Fore guns, stand by.
- Fore guns, stand by.
- Fire!
- Fire!
The prisoners have taken the ship.
Destroy the ray apparatus.
So you won't talk, eh?
- Now we'll have to put a shot aboard her.
- Hold on a bit. Our chaps are on board.
- And they're still alive.
- Sony, I have to open fire.
Give her one more chance.
Yeoman, signal for the last time to heave to or take the consequences.
Aye aye, sir.
We repeat:
"Heave to or take the consequences."
- Are they going to blow up their own men?
- They won't touch us.
I'm not so sure. Keep firing.
A destroyer is threatening to blow us out of the water if we don't heave to.
Take the gun. Come on, Scott.
- Fore gun load, high explosive.
- Fore gun load, high explosive.
Get over there. Quick!
Signaller. Outside. Outside!
Signal the destroyer not to fire.
Tell them we're heaving to.
They've signalled not to fire.
They're heaving to.
Now signal this.
You...
- They're signalling again.
- Can't make it out. Read it off, Yeoman.
You... were... right... Charles.
Aha!
- I... was... right.
- Good old Tony.
- Kay... was... right_
- What the blazes is all this?
And... the... whole... world... was... wrong.
That's right. Thank you, Commander.
Here they come.
Hammond and McVane - get them.
- Oi, look!
- Oi! Stop those cameras.
Oh, no, no!
Just a minute, if you don't mind.
- Kay, you can get this one.
- Smile, Charles. Wave your umbrella.
- Hammond, bravo.
- Bravo?
- Got it, Kay?
- Yes, darling.
All right, off we go. See you. Goodbye.
Bye, Charles!
- I congratulate you.
- Congratulate them. They're getting married.
- What's the time?
Great Scott!
See you in London.
Here I am, my darling. Dead on time.
Charles, I'm so sorry.
I just can't go out with you today.
- But I'm all ready to go.
- I know, my pet, but I can't make it.
- But you had something to tell me.
- I have. I want you to meet my husband.
- How do you do, old boy, old boy?
- Oh, good show, good show.
Good heavens, darling.
Look at the time. We must fly.
Goodbye, old boy. Goodbye.
Goodbye, darling. I know you wish us all the happiness in the world.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I was wrong.
Gee, Pop, you sure missed a wonderful luncheon.
Contradiction, please.
Not having eaten, have missed nothing.
I had turtle soup, chicken à la king and three cream puffs.
- Then I had some ice cream—
- Please stop.
Mention of food more painful... than surgeon's knife without anesthetic.
Shall I get you medicine, Pop?
- Good dose of land only effective medicine.
- [Chuckles]
The bulletin board says we'll dock at 4:00 this afternoon.
Only sight of dock can renew interest in life.
[ObjectJangling]
Steward! Steward!
Get me out of here!
- Help.! Somebody open this door.!
- [Pounding]
Help! Steward!
Help.! Help.!
Open this door.!
Help.! Steward.!
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah. It sounded like somebody calling for help.
Help! Somebody get me out of here!
- In there.
- Help.! Help.!
- [Pounding]
- Help.! Steward.!
Help.! Get me out ofhere.!
Help—
So sorry to intrude... but etiquette ignored when lady in distress.
I— I guess it must have locked accidentally.
Chair under doorknob indicate purpose... not accident.
Better check your belongings, miss.
It looks like a robbery to me.
Why, I can't imagine why anybody would want to... rob my stateroom.
After all, there's nothing of any value here.
Absolutely nothing.
Maybe you'd better take a look through that trunk anyway.
Something might be stolen.
I haven't lost anything.
I'm quite sure of that.
Evident thief not interested in diamonds.
Note. Jewelry untouched.
Oh, they're phonies.
The real ones are in my bank, I hope.
Well, thank you all for coming to my rescue, more or less.
No trouble at all.
Sorry I couldn't have done more.
Thanks.
Let us know if anything else happens.
We're in the next cabin.
This is my father, Mr. Chan.
My name's Lee.
- Thank you both.
- So happy.
Oh, by the way.
If you don't mind, I'd just as soon you didn't mention this to anyone.
Don't you think, if there's a thief on board, the purser ought to know about it?
I don't want to answer a lot of useless questions.
You see, I've been feeling perfectly miserable during this whole trip.
- But, Pop—
- Am in identical boat with fair lady.
- Will say nothing.
- Thanks a lot.
##[Lee Whistling Tune]
## [Whistling Continues]
Please put muffler on peanut whistle... and explain motive for appropriating towel.
You see, Pop, I've been sorta collecting souvenirs since I left Honolulu.
Some people pick up soap or ashtrays, but I like towels best.
Hmm.
What are you looking for?
Lifeboat... make fine souvenir also.
"Hotel Sheffield."
"Château Paris."
"Rhine Inn."
Too late now to make restitution.
But replace ship's property before detective father... assigned to case of light-fingered son.
Okay.
Say, Pop, speaking of cases, what do you think of that girl in the next cabin?
Very pretty girl.
She hasn't been out of her cabin on the whole trip.
The steward told me when I was asking him for some, uh, fresh towels a while ago.
I'll bet there's something funny going on there.
What's the matter, Pop?
One cabin too small for two detectives.
I'm awfully sorry to bother you... but all that excitement has my head beating like a bass drum in a Harlem band.
- Have you any aspirin?
- Come in.
- I'll get some for you. Please sit down.
- Oh, thanks.
Here you are.
- Thanks a lot.
- Not at all.
Do you intend staying in New York very long?
No, darn it. Pop's in a hurry to get home to Mom.
We leave for San Francisco in the morning.
Well, that's pretty fast traveling.
Too bad you're not gonna stick around and see the big town.
Yeah, but unless Pop takes a nap...
I'll never get past the hotel lobby.
Well, thanks again. Perhaps we'll see each other before we dock.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
[Ship Horn Blowing]
- ## [Up-tempo]
- [Sirens Wailing]
Well, she's dockin' now.
Between murders and suicides,
I ain't got enough to do... so the commissioner says,
"Go down to the dock and meet a detective."
Who's got a cigarette?
Hey, Smitty!
So I said to the commissioner,
"I have already met a detective once."
He says to me,
"You just think you have."
Thanks very much.
"Now go down and meet Charlie Chan."
Look, Smitty, have the band blast out something oriental.
Hey, what is the Chinese national anthem anyway?
I don't know. Why don't you give him
"Chinatown, My Chinatown"?
Okay, we'll play it.
Hiya, Nelson.
I knew there was somethin' fresh around here.
I thought it was the ocean air.
Looks like you got half of headquarters down here.
- What's up?
- I'm lookin' for the other half.
- Expect someone to steal the Atlantic?
- No. The boys are going wading.
Say, have you got a light?
Hmm. Here comes the number one bloodhound of journalism.
Your sarcasm isn't cutting into his salary much.
I guess you're down here to interview Mr. Chan.
- Always the copper, aren't you?
- It's nice work if you can get it.
Well, come on. We'll give you a police escort so you don't fall off the pier.
[Man]
Are you glad to get home again?
- There's the guy! Come on.
- Get to him before the boys crowd in.
Look, Pop.
They're gonna snap our pictures.
Is it true you intend racing Indian King at Saratoga?
- How do your horses win all the races?
- They run fast.
- How many wives have you?
- More than Ali Baba had thieves.
Do you think you're going to like New York?
If it's half as ridiculous as I've heard,
I shall love it.
How long do you expect to remain
in the United States?
Did you bring all of your stable with you?
Look out! Thanks.
Give me that camera!
No one's taking any pictures of me.
- Okay, sue me.
- [Man] Who's that?
Well, if it isn't little Billie.
What are you doin' back in town?
- Mr. Chan?
- That is humble name.
I'm Inspector Nelson, Mr. Chan.
Greetings from New York's finest.
The bigwigs expect you to tear a duck apart with 'em tonight.
So sorry.
Come again, please.
Excuse the inspector's broken English,
Mr. Chan. He's a Brooklyn immigrant.
He's trying to tell you the police department's
giving a banquet tonight in your honor.
Thank you so much.
Am unworthy of so great honor.
Will feel like sparrow perched on limb with peacocks.
- I don't get ya.
- He says he accepts.
- Your interpreter?
- In big city, yes.
Otherwise, number one son, Lee.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- I've gotta mush on, Mr. Chan.
If there's anything you want the bigwigs can't rustle up for you, just toot your whistle.
Speed Patten of the Bulletin.
I wonder if that was a personal crack at me.
New York English too baffling for humble detective.
Oh, yeah. Those pencil pushers sure kick it around, don't they?
Come on, Mr. Chan.
We'll take care of your baggage.
- Is this all your baggage, Mr. Chan?
- All here.
Open luggage for gentleman's inspection.
That won't be necessary, Mr. Chan.
The commissioner has extended you
the freedom of the port.
Oh. Much honored.
Right this way, Mr. Chan.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
You know the little lady—
Miss Bronson?
- Quite casually.
- Why, Inspector?
Ayear ago, that dame was so hot in this town, she had to skip the country.
Grand jury wanted her as a key witness.
She had enough info to blow the lid right off this island.
Some of her boyfriends shipped her abroad till things cooled off.
What did I tell you, Pop?
A lot of funny things happened on the boat.
- Please keep eyes open and mouth shut.
- [Chuckles]
- Oh, porter.
- Yes, miss?
Please have my baggage sent to the Carlton Hotel also.
Certainly, miss.
Your name, please?
[Whistles]

##[Continues]
Carlton Hotel.
Carlton Hotel.
Still the freshest guy on Broadway, aren't you?
Oh, no, Billie.
Just the smartest.
Sometimes you make it hard to tell where your brain ends and your nerve begins.
Maybe, but while every other newspaper guy on that dock follows an Indian maharaja... who can't make anything but the sport page...
I'm ridin' around with Billie Bronson— the gal who can make history.
Look, Speed, just forget you ever saw me.
I'm not here for publicity.
What are you here for, honey?
- I wanna see Grant's Tomb.
- You can get a swell view of it— from the river.
What do you mean by that crack?
I'm not hot anymore, and you know it.
Yeah, but does the D.A. Know it?
I didn't come back to see the D.A.
I've got a date with somebody else.
That wouldn't be a guy by the name of Burke... at the Hottentot Club, would it?
- You get around, don't you?
- Yeah, and it's a big circle.
So you're gonna have a showdown with Burke, huh?
If you print that, you'd better put on your diving suit.
I'll take that chance if it's okay with you.
Here's your hotel.
Listen, Speed, if you can keep quiet for a while...
I may slip you something you'll have to print on asbestos.
- What's the deal?
- Meet me here at midnight.
It's a date.
Drive me to the Bulletin.
- Don't get up, boys. I can make it.
- You just think you can make it.
Better lay off, Joan.
He's vicious.
- I just got tossed out.
- I've got the passkey.
- I want to see Murdock.
- Just a moment, Miss Wendall.
Save me an extra column on Sunday, will ya, chief?
I got a swell human interest yarn on the maharaja of Rodpur today.
Do you think the subscribers can stand the excitement?
[Buzzes]
- Yes?
- Miss Wendall would like to see you, sir.
- I can't see her now.
- You can if you look up.
Hello, Murdock. Hi, Speed.
- What do you want, Miss Wendall?
- A hundred bucks.
I think you'd better see a doctor.
You're delirious.
I'll drop in at the psychopathic ward and hold your hand later, sweetheart.
Okay, have your little joke, but would you like to take a peek... at this beautiful enlargement before I sell it to the Times?
I got a dozen pictures
of Charlie Chan.
Maybe, but if you look close, you'll see a girl, and it isn't Chan's daughter.
Billie Bronson, eh?
I got a dozen pictures ofher too.
And I've got a dozen editors who'd love to know that I took this picture today.
- I'll give you $50.
- It was awfully nice seeing you.
Wait a minute.
Give me that photo.
- [Flips Switch]
- Instruct the cashier to pay Miss Wendall $100.
I want you to forget that you ever took this picture.
My mind's a complete blank.
I suppose you remember the way to the cashier's office.
And how. Thanks, Murdock.
So long, Speed.
See you later.
[Door Closes]
You were down at that pier today, Speed.
Didn't you see Miss Bronson?
I thought I was the only one. I even jumped in her cab and had a little chat with her.
I don't want to pry into the affairs of this newspaper... but would you mind telling me why you kept it a secret?
She didn't spill anything. I'm gonna see her tonight and get the lowdown.
[Rings]
Yes?
Who?
Put her on.
Hello, Miss Bronson.
Yes, I heard you were back in town.
You remember that little deal we discussed about a year ago?
That's right. Well, we may be able to do business now... but it's gonna cost you twice what you offered last time.
That's insane.
How do I know it's on the level?
I haven't even read it. Fine.
I'll be over at your hotel at 11:30 tonight.
Good-bye.
You can call off your date for tonight, Speed.
I'm taking over the Bronson story.
Now look here, chief.
I started this thing.
Yes, and I'll finish it, and I'll make it hotter than the Chicago fire.
Okay, but look out you don't get burned.
- Nice scoop, kid.
- Scooping you is getting monotonous, Mr. Patten.
- Well, how about marrying me?
- And kill a beautiful friendship? Nothing doing.
I tell you what. You take me to the Hottentot Club tonight... and we'll blow some of this hush money.
- Why the Hottentot?
- Why not?
You got me. Anyway, I'd better stick with you, or I'll be scooped on my own love story.
[Knocking]
Be sure you keep your mouth shut.
Don't worry.
It'll cost me my job if I don't.
Pop. Hey, Pop.
Where are you?
Prostrated on floor.
What are you doing, Pop— hiding?
Collar button is one who hides.
[Chuckles]
Am searching for same.
I'd help you, Pop... but you said,
"One room too small for two detectives."
Assistance very welcome on present difficult case.
You'll find it if you go about it scientifically.
Logic very good.
Plainly saw fugitive sitting here.
Turn back on same while searching for trousers.
Number one son pass by trunk...
while parent descend body
into trousers.
Return here, and collar button absconded.
Also number one son.
Thank you so much.
One room still too small for two detectives.
Say, Pop, can I have a couple of weeks' allowance in advance?
I only have one buck to see the town on.
New York like mouth of great river.
Many reefs in channel... to wreck small sightseeing boat from Honolulu.
Oh, boy! Twenty bucks.
Thanks, Pop.
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.
New York's no different from any other town.
It's just a little bigger.
- Sorry, buddy.
- Oh, that's all right.
- Cab, sir?
- Please.
Me too.
Pop! My money's gone.
I know. The man who just bumped into me, he must have taken it.
Save breath for lamentations.
- Your cab, sir.
- Thank you so much.
Suggest you return to room and lock self in... before dinner suit snatched from body.
- But, gee, Pop—
- Good night.
Astor Hotel, please.
Mr. Chan's room, please.
- [Woman] There's no answer.
- Thanks.
- Hello.
- Hello, Miss Bronson.
Well, I'm in trouble again.
I can't unlock my door.
But— But that's our room.
Oh. Well, how do you like that?
I've got the right location, but they let me off at the wrong floor.
- I'm in 413. [Chuckling]
- [Chuckling]
Well, you look like you're all dressed up to do the town tonight.
No, not exactly.
I-I'm waiting for Dad to get back from the banquet so I can show him the town.
Well, I hope you have a good time.
Good night.
Good night.
The Hottentot Club.
The young lady that just left, did you hear her say where she was going?
- She mentioned the Hottentot Club.
- Thanks.
The Hottentot Club.
##[Orchestra: Up-tempo]
Flashlights, bulbs, film.
- Give me a roll of film.
- Yes, sir.
- How much is a flashlight?
- Fifty cents.
Boy, what pictures I've got.
- Hello, Gloria.
- Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Moran.
- You haven't been around for quite a while.
- Oh, I've been around.
Wait a minute.
- When did you get back in town?
- This afternoon.
- Burke send for you?
- Well, what if he did?
I just wanted to know.
Listen, Buzz, I've got a good reason for coming back.
You've got a better reason for staying away.
You get out of town before morning.
I mean that.
Okay. I will.
Sure, you will.
Sorry, boss.
You all can't go in there.
What's the idea?
There's someone inside I've got to see.
The rules of the house say no gentlemen allowed in without a lady friend.
You can't button that one.
It's a freckle.
My mistake, honey.
- Hello, Burke.
- Good evening, Mr. Mack.
Mr. Burke.
This guy signed his check.
- Is it okay?
- He's a phony. Get his dough.
- Hiya, Johnny.
- Hello.
- Evening, Johnny.
- Hiya, Speed.
- Hello, Miss Wendall.
- Hello, Mr. Burke.
- You got a lot of competition around here tonight, kid.
- I can't complain.
Their pictures make the family album.
Mine make the front page.
Did you ever figure on this "camera night" idea of yours causing a lot of beefs?
- About what?
- It's a known fact that somebody's wife... will go out with somebody else's husband.
- Where are they?
- [Chuckles]
I haven't seen you here in months.
Any special reason for tonight's visit?
- No. Just slumming.
- That's right.
You can be the perfect host by supplying me with a nice juicy story.
A murder, for instance.
That always goes good in a nightclub yarn.
- ##[Ends]
- I'll take your picture standing next to the body.
If they're good, I'll buy a dozen.
## [Latin, Up-tempo]
##[Continues, Muted]
[Yelps]
Don't yell like that.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Gosh, I'm sorry I scared you.
- What do you want?
I'm here on something awful important.
Maybe you can help me.
You see, I'm sort of a detective.
That is, my dad is Charlie Chan, and I work with him on big cases.
Charlie Chan?
Why, I know who he is.
- Then will you help me?
- What can I do?
- Get me in the club. I've got to see somebody.
- All right.
As soon as I get more film,
I'll take you down the back stairs.
Swell. Oh, let me help.
## [Latin Continues]
You kinda go for our ballerina, don't you, Mr. Burke?
I like her dancin'.
That dame could appear in a wheelchair, and he'd call it dancing.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hello, Moran.
- What's the idea, Johnny?
- I don't get ya.
I told you to keep
Billie Bronson out of town.
- She's in Europe.
- She's upstairs in your office.
- I didn't know that.
- You know it now.
- She comes back when I say so.
- Sure, sure.
I'll take care of that dame.
- Waiter. Bring me some more milk.
- Yes, Mr. Moran.
## [Ends]
[Applause]
[Applause Continues]
- You do an encore, baby.
- Okay.
- Wait here, Joan.
- You're not holding anything out on me, are you?
Take it easy, honey.
I'll be right back.
##[Latin]
Hello, Johnny.
- What are you doin' in town?
- I got lonesome.
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- Sure, I am, but it's risky.
- You're still hot enough to blister.
- I'll take my chances.
- How's everything with you?
- Not so good.
Yeah, that's what you wrote me... but I saw an awful lot of cover charges when I came in tonight.
What's on your mind, Billie?
Why did you lie to me?
- I don't get you.
- Oh, yes, you do.
- You didn't want me back in New York.
- I told you it wasn't safe.
Oh, skip it. I walked through the whole police force today... and all they did was tip their hats.
No, Johnny.
You fooled me long enough— cutting down my dough so I didn't have enough money to buy a ticket back home... saying the club was failing, lying about everything.
- You talk too much, Billie.
- Yeah? Well, I haven't even started yet.
I don't think I would if I were you.
The boys wouldn't like it.
- You mean Marie wouldn't like it.
- Leave her out of this.
Why should I? You've been giving me the runaround because of her.
That's why I came back.
Things have been too perfect for you.
Okay, Johnny, you're a smart boy... and you bluffed a lot of people.
- ##[Ends]
- But you can't bluff your way out of what I'm gonna spill.
- You double-crosser. I'll slap you—
- Stay away from me!
- Where you goin', Marie?
- Charlie's office.
- He's busy right now. I think you'd better wait.
- Oh, yeah?
- Maybe you can order the busboys around, but not me.
- Now, listen—
Police of New York and Honolulu have one thing in common.
Both live on very small island.
But while we have big volcano... you have biggest shakeup.
[All Laughing]
Uh, someday, hope to greet honorable brothers in Hawaii...
where roar of surf
replace noise of subway...
and, uh, hot rhythm of Broadway...
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- Cooled by strains of"Aloha."
- [Applause Continues]
- There goes my fishin' trip... and I was all set to get away in the morning.
I've just been called on a little case uptown, Charlie.
- I think you'd better come along.
- What's the idea of taking our guest of honor away?
- Can't you handle it alone?
- Maybe not.
Billie Bronson was just murdered at the Hottentot Club... and Mr. Chan's son is being held as a suspect.
We go right away.
- Excuse, please. Excuse.
- Of course, Charlie.
- Where's the trouble?
- Upstairs.
- Have you got a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.
Metropolitan newspaper people more prompt than police and also more numerous.
Oh, those? Those ain't reporters.
They're worse— camera hounds.
This is candid-camera night.
They're all shootin' for prizes.
They've even got a darkroom for 'em... so they can develop and enlarge their pictures right here.
Very interesting.
Camera remember many things human eye forget.
Huh?
[Snaps Fingers] You're right.
Don't let anyone outta here with a camera.
- I want every roll of film in the place.
- Yes, sir.
[Coin Clatters]
I'll carry it.
- Good night, Mr. Moran.
- Good night.
- Hi, Nelson. Hello, Mr. Chan.
- You didn't waste any time getting here, did you?
Somebody has to protect the taxpayers.
All the policemen I know were at a banquet tonight.
When you gotta eat, you gotta eat.
Have you seen the body?
- Seen it? I found it.
- That makes you a suspect.
Flatterer.
Over there, Doc.
I knew I'd be seeing you on business sooner or later.
Pop! Tell him who I am.
What is charge against young man?
We found him hangin' around in the hall outside. He says he's your son.
Reluctantly confess he is portion of posterity.
Oh, yeah? Then what was he doin' peekin' through a keyhole?
Humbly suggest murderer not likely to go outside... and contemplate victim through keyhole.
But please explain embarrassing presence here.
She was trying to get into our room at the hotel, so I followed her.
The kid's okay.
Release him.
- Lay off that phone.
- I got a right to call my lawyer.
What makes you think you'll need one?
He'll need one with you handling the case.
- You and your funny ideas.
- I got an idea now. Believe me, it's far from funny.
- What'd you find, Doc?
- The bullet entered the back just below the left shoulder blade...
passed through the right ventricle...
and was probably stopped by a bone.
- We can't get the bullet until the autopsy.
- Yeah, okay.
Uh, excuse, please.
Can give approximate time of death?
- About half an hour ago.
- Thank you.
Half an hour ago,
I was thinkin'ofbass instead ofbullets.
- Anybody find the gun?
- I did, sir. It's a.25-caliber automatic.
The sergeant sent it down to headquarters to check the number and any fingerprints.
Good. I want this whole room gone over for fingerprints. Have headquarters send a man up.
- Yes, sir.
- May ask question, please?
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Understand you were first to discover body.
That's right. Well, go ahead, Nelson.
Give me the third degree.
But I warn you, if anybody slugs me across the Adam's apple with a rubber hose—
Ah, you talk too much as it is.
Body in same position now as when discovered?
Sure. I didn't touch it.
I had to leave something for him to do.
Thank you so much.
Position of body sometime give solution of murder.
So sorry to intrude, but like number one son... keep forgetting this not my affair.
Gee, Pop. I was only trying to find out what she was doing.
Obviously, she kept appointment with murderer.
- That brings us around to you.
- I ain't sayin' a thing without my lawyer.
Maybe we got different ideas about that.
Billie Bronson come up here to see you, didn't she?
- So do a lot of other people.
- But they don't all get murdered.
Stop me if I'm wrong.
She could come up to visit
Johnny without him killing her, couldn't she?
- You oughta know.
- What do you mean by that crack?
You and Billie were friends until she had to blow town.
Then like a good pal, you move in on her boyfriend to keep him from getting lonesome.
- After a year, he gets fed up with you and sends for Billie.
- Is that on the level?
- No, he's just fishin'.
- I wish I was.
Anyhow, Billie hits town, beats it up to see you, and you bump her off.
- That's a lie! She was all right when we left the room.
- Then you were with her!
- Tell him, Johnny.
- I ain't talkin'.
[Nelson] You see?
He could alibi you ifhe wanted, but he won't.
He'll let you take the rap.
That's what happens to his dames.
- Won't happen to me.
- Shut up.
- You killed her with his gun!
- You're crazy. He put me out of the room.
- Then he killed her.
- No, he didn't. I waited in the hall.
You couldn't drag me away. He only stayed
a minute. I saw her when he came out.
- She was still alive?
- I'll say she was, and mad.
Now wait a minute.
In other words, you both leave the room.
She's all alone. She gets so mad she shoots herself in the back and hides the gun.
- Don't tell me that!
- We ain't telling anything until we get a lawyer.
Interruption, please.
Perhaps keyhole observation made by number one son... can prove if lady speak truth.
No. She was dead when I looked in.
Say, how did you know she was up here?
I didn't. I was just looking in all the keyholes.
[Door Opens]
Say, what's the idea?
I can't get out of this joint.
You can after I've seen your pictures. Give.
I only enlarged one, but it's a honey.
- You see, I came up here and found the body.
- He says he did.
It was my turn to do the scooping, darling.
Well, as Mr. Chan would say,
"One picture worth 10,000 words."
Thank you so much.
Say, Mr. Chan, take a look at this.
That napkin isn't in the picture.
Also interesting to note... telephone jump back on hook since picture taken.
[Nelson, Snaps Fingers]
You're right.
Was that phone on or off the hook when you found the body?
It was off.
I put it back on.
Well, that's just ducky. You know, there might've been some fingerprints on there.
I'm sorry, Nelson.
When I saw it was off the hook...
I thought Billie might've been talking to someone.
When nobody answered,
I went ahead and phoned in my story.
[Nelson]
Do you use a napkin when you phone?
Why? Should I?
Don't evade the issue! When did you pick up that napkin and put it on the tray?
I never touched it.
If it isn't asking too much, can I have my picture so I can get out?
One moment, please.
Observe picture more closely.
- [Nelson] Watch that door!
- Look out, Pop!
[Women Screaming]
Let go of me, you little—
- [Screaming Continues]
- Mac, get that light.!
- I got him, chief!
- You got me, you dummy.!
- Where's Burke?
- I got him, Mr. Nelson.
[Scoffs]
- What happened to you?
- Someone slugged me, but I'm all right now, sir.
I'll have to take your word for it. Get headquarters.
Send out an alarm forJohnny Burke.
- I want him picked up before morning.
- Yes, sir.
I'm gonna get you 10 years for puttin' out those lights.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!
- Did Burke get away clean?
- What do you think?
- Hey, come here!
- Stop yelling, will ya? I gotta phone that story in.
- It puts the finger on Burke.
- If you touch that phone...
I'm gonna put five fingers on you.
Get out of here and use the one downstairs.
And take that dame with you.
- And the picture?
- That's evidence. Beat it.
Come on, honey.
They want to be alone.
Speaking of pictures, Charlie, what were you gonna show me when Burke took a powder?
First must point to fact... that napkin on tray also take powder.
Well, I'll be.
Now why would Burke take that napkin?
Picture may hold answer to same riddle.
Observe carefully.
Contents of unfortunate lady's purse scattered on floor.
Yeah.
Compare articles now on floor with those shown in picture.
Say, wait a minute. There's no key there, but there's one in the picture.
Missing key may fit door to solution.
Looks like a hotel key.
There's a tag on it.
- Perhaps can decipher number?
- Yeah.
It says "Carlton Hotel 313."
Gee, Pop, that's our room!
- Yes.
- What?
Who's got a cigarette?
Never mind.
We'll get some at your hotel.
Come on.
Even if I knew where Burke went,
I wouldn't tell you.
- And you can't hold me.
- Pipe down. You stay out here with her.
Key, please.
Stabbed through the ribs, and not over a couple of minutes ago either.
Get the coroner.
Pop.! It's the man we met
this morning on the boat... when someone tried to rob
Miss Bronson's stateroom.
- You know this guy?
- Encountered him once only on board steamship.
Take him to the bed and search him.
I wonder where he fits in.
Hey, Mac.
Anything out there?
- Nothing, sir.
- Well, that's not good enough.
Climb out and take a look in every window as you go below.
And no matter what you see, remember— it's Burke you're lookin' for.
I wish the fishing season was as open as the one for murder.
Excuse, please.
Would suggest key undergo fingerprint examination.
Right, Charlie. That may be the one from Billie Bronson's purse.
- Anything on him?
- No, sir.
Maybe the steamship company would have his name.
Oh, chances are he'd be listed under a phony title, but we'll check that later.
Take this down to the Bureau of Identification.
Have 'em check any fingerprints againstJohnny Burke's. His are on file.
- Yes, sir.
- This whole thing is getting me a little bit screwy.
What would that mug want in your room?
Mud of bewilderment now beginning to clear from pool of thought.
This man follow
Miss Bronson on boat... to secure unknown object she possess.
To safeguard same... she use my baggage as hiding place.
I remember, Pop.
That's when she came in for the aspirin.
- Huh?
- Have hit tack on cranium.
Tonight Miss Bronson try to regain secret possession here.
But number one son prove stumbling block.
Then Burke gets your key when it drops from Billie's purse.
Comes up here... in time to catch that guy in the room.
The rest is easy. He stabs him and makes a getaway with whatever they were all after.
- Quite possible.
- But what were they after?
- [Policeman] You can't go in there.
- Nelson, let me out of here—
You know this man?
He's— He's my husband.
- Your husband, hey? What's his name?
- Tom Mitchell.
- Now we're getting somewhere.
Were you living with him?
- No.
- You left him for Burke, didn't you?
- I'm not talking.
You don't have to.
I get the whole setup.
- Well, why don't you deny it?
- Please.
Perhaps kinder to question lady later.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, Charlie.
Take her down to headquarters.
Come on, lady.
Keep her in my office.
I'll see her later.
Now what I wanna know,
Char—
What have you got now?
Most interesting reading found on torn paper.
This is something.
So Billie kept a diary too.
Pop, that's what they were after.
No poison more deadly than ink.
I'd give up that fishing trip to see the rest of these pages.
Hey— Hey, Pop.!
Gee, I-I thought you were someone else.
Put that thing away.
Did you find anything?
No, sir, and I went all the way down to the bottom.
- Say, do you think he might have gone up?
- [Nelson] Why?
Well, I just remembered. Miss Bronson said her room was 413, and that's right above us.
- What?
- Regret slow progress of thought... but rejoice at final arrival.
Get out on that fire escape and keep your eye on the window above. Come on.
Hello, Nelson. This is a surprise.
I'll say it is.
What are you doin' here?
What would I be doing here?
I'm waiting for Miss Bronson, of course.
Then you got an awful long wait.
She's not comin' back.
- She's dead?
- Murdered.
I'm not surprised.
Wait a minute.
You've got some explainin' to do.
What about, may I ask?
Billie Bronson was shot an hour ago at the Hottentot Club.
The key to Room 313, which is directly below this one, was stolen from her purse.
We just went in down there and found a man stabbed to death.
- Go on.
- You go on.
That window there is open.
So is the one downstairs.
So, I could've killed that man down there, then come up the fire escape into this room.
- Right.
- Wrong. I didn't.
I had an appointment to meet
Miss Bronson here at 10:30. It's now...
20 minutes of 11:00.
Excuse, please.
Would object to revealing nature of appointment?
Not at all. I came up here to buy her diary.
Diary, eh? What were you gonna do with it?
I'd have to read it first to answer that question.
But no doubt can produce money intended for purchase of diary?
Gee, Pop.
Look at that.
There's enough dough here to buy the city hall.
And cheap at that. Miss Bronson's diary contains enough information... on rackets and politics to blow this whole city higher than a kite.
Well, well.
What's this— the payoff?
- Always a wise guy, aren't you?
- I have to be to keep up with you boys.
Why don't you light someplace where you can be found?
Hey, get a load of this.
- We scooped the others?
- Sure.
You oughta drop in at the office.
You were out when I phoned that story in.
- You knew I was coming here.
- Yeah, but you crossed me up.
You weren't due here till 11:30.
Just a minute.
You told us 10:30.
Please don't attempt any unwieldy deductions, Nelson.
The original appointment
was for 11:30.
- Miss Bronson telephoned and changed it.
- [Charlie] Most unfortunate.
Proof of alibi now locked behind dead lips of murdered girl.
Yeah, and I'm not so sure you didn't get that diary without paying for it.
You wouldn't mind being searched, would you, Murdock?
Am I under arrest?
No.
Then I'm afraid that technically you'll have to keep your hands in your own pockets.
- Am I right?
- [Phone Ringing]
Hello? Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.
Come on. Let's have it.
Swell. Swell!
Now let Marie Collins go and trail her.
She'll lead you to Burke, all right.
The key didn't show anything, Charlie.
The gun we found in Burke's office was sold to Billie a year ago.
There were two sets of fingerprints on it— a woman's and Johnny Burke's.
We'll pick up Burke tonight, and I'll be fishing in the morning.
- Then I presume that my part in this case is closed.
- Perhaps.
But murder case like revolving door—
when one side close,
other side open.
Well, good luck, gentlemen.
Thank you... so much.
I wish you hadn't
moved us up here, Pop.
I bet there's some clue in our old room that would clinch the case.
What are you reading, Pop?
Murder case of Miss Billie Bronson.
Gee, I should think you know enough about it already.
Still much to learn.
Mr. Speed Patten very good reporter.
- Is my name in his write-up?
- As suspect, yes.
Good night.
[Grunts]
The whole case looks
perfectly clear to me, Pop.
They found Burke's fingerprints on the gun, didn't they?
Evidently forget disappearance of napkin.
You know, I've been thinking about that napkin too.
Burke probably stole it because
Marie Collins's fingerprints were on it.
- Have you thought of that angle?
- [Groans]
For the time being, only consider... which angle to arrange self on mattress.
[Sighs]
Now, please... turn out light and extinguish conversation.
[Sighs]
[Rings]
Hello? Hello, Meeker?
Did you get my message?
Yeah, yeah. I'm in a jam. I'll say it's bad.
Get up here quick as you can and see you're not tailed. What?
Yeah, I'm expecting Marie. She oughta be up here right away. Uh-huh.
Step on it.
Hello, hot fingers.
What do ya mean, "hot fingers"?
If you'd kept Billie out of town like I said, we'd have been okay.
Too bad it had to happen in your office, Johnny.
Oh, no, you don't.
They'll never burn me for that.
- I'll say they won't.
- You watch your step, Buzz.
I will.
[Groans]
[Gunshot]
"And though almost 24 hours have elapsed...
"since Billie Bronson and Thomas Mitchell were murdered, the police have discovered...
"nothing tangible enough to justify an arrest.
"All they have is a torn diary page found by Charlie Chan...
"which they consider an excellent clue.
"But in the opinion of this observer, it only indicates the work of a perfect criminal...
"so clever and daring that he has deliberately planted it...
"to obtain free publicity
for a terrific blackmailing scheme.
"This may be a subtle way of warning certain people in New York...
"that he has this dynamite diary
and is ready to light the fuse.
"I wonder ifJohnny Burke is the only racketeer whose blood pressure will remain high... as long as the Bronson diary and its unknown possessor are in circulation."
Well, how's that for a journalistic gem?
- Is that what you call it?
- Why not?
Uh, boy. And wait till you see tomorrow's story.
It'll top this one.
Take that to Mr. Murdock, will you?
Just stick around me, honey, and you'll get the latest lowdown.
You know old Speed never misses.
- Neither does Johnny Burke or Moran.
- Aw!
You're gonna crack wise once too often on that typewriter, and I'll be sending you posies.
- Now stand still and look healthy.
- How's this?
Fine. I wanna shoot you before somebody else does.
You're just sore because I scooped you on that Bronson murder.
I'm warning you right now. I'm gonna scoop you on the rest of the case too.
- Wanna bet?
- Sure. A week's pay.
Make it something worthwhile and you're on.
Here's one time you're both scooped.
Johnny Burke just walked into police headquarters and gave himself up.
Five'll get you 50 he's got a smart mouthpiece with him.
Wait a minute. You haven't a thing on Johnny except the fingerprints on the gun.
Oh, yeah. That's all. And the fact that Mitchell was rubbed out... a couple of minutes after Burke took it on the lam from the Hottentot.
I didn't shoot Billie or Mitchell either.
May I humbly remind
Mr. Mitchell stabbed, not shot.
Don't you try to trickJohnny into admitting one thing by suggesting another.
- I demand the right to—
- Have you got a cigarette?
Uh, yes. Here.
Thanks very much.
Now what were you saying?
- I wanna know what time Mitchell was rubbed out.
- Why don't you askJohnny?
If it was after 10:00, he was with me.
Now try and break that alibi!
Excuse, please. Perhaps paraffin test better alibi if prove negative.
You're right.
How about it, Johnny?
You're not afraid of a little scientific test, are you?
No. Let's go.
Wait. You can't get away with this!
My client is a respectable citizen.
- Let's go.
- Johnny, please, wait a minute.
Hey!
Uh, s-say, just what is this paraffin test?
Uh, new method... to reveal powder marks on hand that fires gun.
Why, that's silly.
He washes his hands, you know.
Undoubtedly. But even most vigorous scrubbing... will not remove powder stains for 72 hours.
Seventy-two hours? Nelson can't get away with this. It's a direct violation of—
Keep your hand under that water.
It's okay now.
The paraffin's hard enough.
Take it easy.
You're pulling the skin off my hand.
Skin isn't all this'll pull off.
If there's any gunpowder,
it'll be on the wax too.
Hey, what's that stuff?
Solution of diphenylamine and sulfuric acid which reacts instantly to nitrates.
Watch those chemicals, Burke.
If they turn blue, your goose is cooked.
It's negative.
- Then you didn't shoot her!
- I told you I didn't.
Get out of here and take that shyster with you!
Okay. Don't get excited.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Chan, for suggesting that test.
- Drop up to the club sometime.
- Thank you so much.
May accept generous invitation as case progress.
[Door Opens, Closes]
- Well, that lets Burke out.
- Maybe.
But this one case where murderer could have clean hands.
- Huh?
- Remember napkin that disappear at nightclub?
- Yeah.
- Possibly used to cover hand that fire murder gun.
- Hey, here they come.
- What happened, fellas?
- Hey, how about it, Burke?
- One at a time.
One at a time, please.
- Johnny, how did you clear yourself?
- By keepin' my hands clean.
- How about a picture, Mr. Burke?
- Why not? Make sure you get that sign.
I wanna prove I'm goin' out instead of comin' in.
- We'll get it in, all right. Thank you.
- Bye, boys.
- Where are you going?
- I want to sell this picture of Burke's release...
- before he's arrested again.
- Let's go see what the inspector's got.
Good idea.
- What happened, Inspector?
- Did you give Burke a clean bill?
- What's your next move?
- Come on, Nelson. Give us the lowdown.
I've got nothin' to say yet.
What about you, Mr. Chan?
Looks like Burke pulled a nifty on you.
Perhaps. But release of Mr. Burke suggest other nifty.
- What have you got up your sleeve?
- Give us the lowdown.
- Yeah!
- Just a minute, boys. If there is a new angle... we'll try it out before you reporters advertise it.
- [Chattering]
- Out! Get out.
Wait a minute, Nelson. I'm entitled to a break.
I've been on this case since it started.
- So long. Out.
- [Muttering]
Say, give us a chance here, will you?
Now what was on your mind, Charlie?
You have candid-camera photos taken last night at Hottentot Club?
Yeah. They're in the department files, but—
Uh, please to send for same right away.
Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Now let's see.
Burke and Miss Collins were standing there.
Pop was right back here.
I'm getting awfully tired, Lee.
We've been going over this for more than an hour.
But doesn't your intuition tell you anything?
Pop says, "One woman's intuition better than 10 scientists."
I don't know anything about intuition... but I've got a feeling we ought to get out of here.
Let's try it once again.
Put yourself in the place of the murderer.
Now, when the lights went out... he grabbed the napkin off the desk here and ran to the door.
- What are you doin' up here?
- Why—Why, nothing.
Beat it.
- Your old man sent you here, didn't he?
- No, sir. It was my own idea.
[Screams]
Throw him out.
Hey, let me go! Hey!
Hey! Hey, let me go!
- We're gettin' out of town, kid.
- What's the idea? You got nothin' to worry about now.
That's what you think. Remember the crack the Chinese dick made about seeing us later?
- Yeah.
- Now we catch his kid here monkeying around.
That's enough for me. We'll hop a plane for Chicago tonight and lay low till the heat's off.
But, Johnny, don't you think that—
There he is.
- Let's go.
- Not so fast, Burke.
- Leave me alone.
- Take it easy, sister.
- What's the idea?
- It ain't my idea. It's Inspector Nelson's.
Come on.
[Clears Throat]
- Special delivery, Mr. Murdock.
- Oh, thanks.
- [Man] Murdock?
- Who are you?
Central Bureau.
Inspector Nelson wants you.
I'm ready.
What do you think of them lettin' Burke go?
Says they couldn't prove anything on him.
Everybody but the cops knows he pulled the job.
That's right, Buzz.
[Door Opens]
Move over.
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- With you. This is a pinch.
Ahh.
- Lee.
- Yes, Pop?
Have already consumed own steak?
No. I-I've got it here on my eye.
Has the swelling gone down any?
Cannot see through gravy.
Puppy detective perhaps now realize snooping very dangerous business.
[Knocking]
- Hello, Mr. Patten.
- Hello.
- Hey, what did you run into?
- Mr. Burke.
That's what I came up to warn you about, Mr. Chan.
There's a rumor around town that certain people are out to get you.
And they wouldn't be as easy on you as they were on your son.
Uh, very good omen.
Prove suspects getting worried.
You got a lot of nerve. But just the same,
I'm stickin' with you tonight.
- Why, anything might happen.
- Swell idea, kid.
Excuse me for not knockin',
Charlie, but the door was open.
Well, Speed, here's your chance for another scoop.
We'll run down to the Hottentot Club.
Then, as you said, anything might happen.
- You mean it's a payoff?
- Maybe.
- Have you got a cigarette?
- Gosh, can I go too, Pop?
Unfortunately, yes.
Only way to save other eye.
Hello, everybody.
Well, Mr. Murdock.
Can I sell you a picture of yourself as a murder suspect?
Don't be ridiculous.
Where's Nelson?
I can't waste all night here.
I've got a newspaper to get out.
It can wait.
[Door Opens]
Now look here, Nelson.
You've gone too far with this.
All right. All right.
Keep quiet.
Now Mr. Chan has a few words to say to all of you, and I advise you to listen closely.
Thank you so much.
Excuse abrupt invitation here tonight.
But all present... seriously involved in death of Miss Billie Bronson and Thomas Mitchell.
Mr. Mitchell follow
Miss Bronson from Europe... to secure diary which contain much scandal.
Plan using same to ruin Mr. Burke...
who stole love of wife, Marie.
That's plain, downright collusion.
I'm a respectable girl.
Pardon, please.
Am not questioning respectability.
Uh, merely offer proof of intimacy.
Candid-camera photo
taken on night of crime.
Triangle very ancient motive
for murder.
But not only angle to present case.
Sudden appearance of late Miss Bronson...
cause perspiration on brow
of another gentleman.
Name— Buzz Moran.
Wait a minute.
I didn't even know she was in town.
Contradiction, please.
All right.
I admit I talked to her.
When I heard she was murdered, I didn't wanna get mixed up in it, so I kept my mouth shut.
Sure. They had Johnny on the spot, so you had nothing to worry about.
Shut up, Marie.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Miss Bronson came to this office last night.
Mr. Burke and then Miss Collins talk with her.
Testimony state both people leave her alone for a few minutes.
In same few minutes,
someone murder her...
with gun wrapped in napkin
to hide fingerprints.
Arrival of, uh,
inquisitive girl photographer... now create interruption.
Murderer hide while girl photograph body
with napkin off tray.
Girl then leave... and murderer return napkin to tray.
After which, Mr. Patten enter...
find body and telephone story
to Mr. Murdock.
By strange coincidence...
Mr. Murdock absent
on trail of diary.
Mr. Chan... may I ask if you have a picture of me in your invaluable collection?
Regret. Distinguished features only ones missing.
Under the circumstances, I believe that exonerates me from having murdered Miss Bronson.
Oh, yeah? How about Mitchell?
Now look here, Nelson.
I've been very tolerant with you.
- But unless I'm released from this room instantly—
- Excuse, please.
Before you remove honorable presence... would request letter received through mail tonight.
What letter?
- My mail is very heavy.
- We're wasting time.
You got a special delivery letter tonight.
We've had your mail watched since yesterday.
Hand it over.
Why, it— it's a page from Billie's diary.
[Murdock] I wouldn't have printed it
without your permission, Nelson.
After all, it just arrived when your man came to pick me up.
I haven't even read it through.
- Who sent it to you?
- How should I know?
- You know what I think, Murdock?
I think you sent it to yourself.
- Why, that's absolute—
You've got that diary! You've always been after it. I charge you with the—
Please.
Perhaps better to read contents of page before making arrest.
Oh, all right.
"May 7. Was up all night on a big partyJohnny swung... for Lieutenant R.
Of the Central Bureau when"—
You officers better wait outside.
[Door Closes]
"He's retiring from the force because the commissioner got wise to him.
"The big dummy showed everybody a diamond watch Buzz Moran gave him... for certain important tip-offs thatJohnny told me about."
Been shooting your mouth off again, huh?
I don't know how she found that out, Buzz.
I never told her anything.
All right. All right.
Take it easy.
"It was sure funny to see everybody kowtow toJohnny and Buzz.
"I guess they don't know that the double-crosser who uses his newspaper job...
"as a cover-up
for the blackmailing he pulls...
is Speed Patten,
the smoothest guy in the rackets"!!
Just a minute.
Let me see that.
- This is a phony.
- Can prove?
Certainly. Why, even the paper it's written on—
- Go ahead.
- Hey, what is this?
You are murderer of Billie Bronson and Thomas Mitchell.
- You're crazy!
- Beg to differ, Mr. Patten.
First suspicion arrive... after reading your newspaper story of Billie Bronson crime.
You state victim shot in back.
Quite true.
Yet photograph show body face upward.
Only murderer could know
location ofhidden wound.
Then, fearing discovery of own fingerprints on napkin... when attention called to it through photo taken by young lady...
you remove same as lights go out
and Mr. Burke escape.
You are indeed clever man.
But not smart enough to avoid ancient trap set tonight.
Inspector Nelson and humble self.'... plant bogus diary page on Mr. Murdock.
- You were the only one who swallowed the bait!
- You'll never convict me.
Contradiction, please.
To know forgery, one must have original.
Well? Come on.
Why don't you deny it?
All right. I did it.
I killed 'em both.
I overheard Billie tell Burke that she was going to the D.A. And blow the lid off this town.
Well, that would've meant me too.
I offered her plenty to keep quiet, but she wouldn't take it.
So I killed her.
You almost caught me, Joan, when you walked in and found Billie dead.
If you had, l—
I guess I'd have killed you too.
Just as I did Mitchell when I caught him in that hotel room.
He already found the diary, and I had to get it.
Well, that's the story.
Nelson wouldn't have caught me
in a million years.
I was sittin'pretty
until you got too smart for me, Mr. Chan.
You're the one I can thank for bein' in this spot... and here's how
I'm gonna show my gratitude!
[Screaming]
All right, boys.
Take him down to headquarters.
- You okay, son?
- I'm all right.
Charlie, Billie's diary is somewhere in Patten's apartment.
And that's all I need to put that guy on ice. Come on.
Well, thanks to you, Charlie, there's the baby... that's gonna sweep Broadway cleaner than it's been since the Indians sold it.
Uh, most happy to have placed new broom in hands of Father Knickerbocker.
Yeah. Say, I'm sorry you're going home, Charlie.
How about staying an extra week as guests of the commissioner and myself?
Gee, Pop. Let's do it.
I never did get to see Broadway.
[Laughing]
Ho-Ho-Holy mackerel! Look. Another mouse.
[Chuckling]
Perhaps better to return to Honolulu.
Evidently,
Broadway very hard on eyes.
I, uh, think you've got something there, Charlie.
[Music]
[Music]

 SABOTAGE
  Destruction of buildingf or machinery
  with the object of alarming
  a group of persons
  inspiring public uneasiness.
 SABOTAGE
  -Sand! 
  -Sabotage!
  -Bring! 
  -Deliberate!
  -What's behind this? 
  -Who did it?
  I know the law.  You have standards, 
  thereby breached the law.
  It happened everywhere. 
  Look at the street.
  -I may be in the dark in my house. 
  -Yes, but is free.
  It is a shame to
  rob the people.
  We want you to return the money.
  But this is the nature of providence, 
  as an earthquake or a thunderbolt.
  -Or a baby. 
  -It would be nice not to interfere?
  -We want our money. 
  -I'm sorry, arrived late.
  I just take my 
  dinner in the dark.
  I am half his ear.
  They want their money back.
  Hopefully, Mr. Verloc back.
  Not even saw the movie!
  -They are getting nasty. 
  -Nasty? Leave them to me.
  -Hey, you?  What's happening?
  Give me a flashlight.
  We blame the lack of light?
  If you hit a cop, the government
  asks that you return the money?
  -I paid for my seat ...
  -And that supported by the feet?
  -Carl, when you returned home? 
  -I haven't been out.
  It was not 20 minutes. 
  I call it low.
  Sleep.  that guides me 
  with that?  Light the lamp.
  -I can not! The light is over!
  -The fuse burned?
  No, it's a blackout. 
  The public wants the money.
  -They are disappointed.
  Good, return.
  -We can not do that.
  -Yes, yes we can.
  We will be without funds.
  When he says that does not cover the expenses.
  It is not worth fighting with the
  public.  I have got some money.
  If you are saying.
  If we were to be generous, be
  properly.  Give them an explanation.
  -No, you are accustomed to.
  Good, but I think you're crazy.
  -I tell you that is the work of God.
  -What do you mean by work of God?
  His face, and not to return
  the money for it.
  If a plane drop a bomb,
  this is the work of an enemy.
  When dry the juice alone,
  this is the work of providence.
  A work is any activity
  performed by a real action.
  Do not miss 
  that is outside the light ...
  It's a very debatable.
  -Discuss então.Que pay!
  - Yes! 
  -What we return the money!
  How?  Applying sanctions? 
  Know the details of the agreement?
  Article 257 line 6 section 24 
  clearly says "No". "
  Did not know? 
  Unable to nothing.
  Come on, if you send. 
  -What are you doing there?
  -Giving a hand. 
  , Who asked not to metesse.
  It was counter-attacking. 
  are withdrawing.
  Because they can come back. 
  Return the money.
  -There is no income.  Fight with you 
  -Keep your apples.
  I spoke with Mr. Verloc. 
  How are you clients and friends ...
  -... will return them the money. 
  -Don't return.
  Make no account.
  -You are crazy.  He had arranged everything.
  -Why is not dealing with their affairs?
  -Of all the people teimosas ...
  -Go or call the police.
  Renee, return the money to customers...
  Come, come.
  -Thank you for the inconvenience.
  -From nothing, I like them.
  -How many? 
  -Two, please.
  -How many? 
  -Three, please.
  Here are the change. 
  How many?
  -How many? 
  -No, thanks.
  The greens are prepared. 
  Tell Mrs. Verloc.
  Gotta go.  My husband 
  is not very well the kidney ...
  ... and I can not leave the 
  alone for long.
  His brother is watching.
  -The kidney? 
  -No, the greens.
 Steve!  What you have done?
  Come on, don't be modest.
  We have not had to return 
  the money, anyway.
  Ms. Jones has always been complicated
  to cook the cabbage ...
  I told you not like that.
  I will make a salad.
  -Va to bring a grocery lettuce.
  Large-or round?
  I like round
  What is more fresh.
  to put in the account.
  We could not buy it if
  had returned the money.
  Did not seem too worried 
  when you said that.
  -by who wanted to return him 
  Non-wanted.
  I just wanted to keep the peace. 
  I do not want that kind of advertising.
  good night, but these magnificent
  copies.  I did not know if wanted ...
  ... a lettuce, square or 
  oblong, so bring some samples.
  - Said round! 
  -Yes?  I thought you said great.
  He said round!
  Good night, Mr. Verloc. 
  He returned in time to see the excitement.
  -I?  I spent the afternoon here. 
  -Swear that I saw him enter.
  If wrong. 
  I do not interfere until they wake up.
  -He was up there, sleeping.
  I'm sorry, my mistake.
  Well ..
  -Believe were killing someone
  -And the killing are in the movie.
  Pull up a chair 
  and closes the vasculhante.
  Do not forget to pay.  good night.
  -Do you mind if I come sooner? 
  -OK, Ted.
  Thank you.
  good night.
  Comes and goes when he wants.
  Allright. someone to 
  working on it.
  Sergeant, saw what happened today?
  examined something?
  Swear I saw the Verloc
  return in the middle of the blackout.
  When commented, said no
  was gone.  His wife confirmed.
  Possibly also is involved.
  You better talk to her.
  Fears that might arise
  a little worse than that of today.
  But what we want?
  Create problems in the country so that
  do not think about what happens outside.
  Like when a man while you&#39;re going
  his accomplice to steal the wallet.
  -Who is behind all this?
  -Someone who never caught.
  They are men who use
  to pursue that.
  THURSDAY
  -Do not know that this is dangerous? 
  -What?
  Leaving the ground remains.
  We could break a leg.

  They had reason to laugh this time.

 One yell from us that Hanley's

               wakes up         
      the president of the joint
     in the middle of the night,
        and they burn the books.
                But our yell was
                for those books.
 If they burn them, we have only
   your unsupported testimony.  
  No.                           
         No.

        The fact that they can't
            produce the books   
       is the fact that supports

               Hello, Hanley.   
            What's on your mind?
Listen, Patterson, you tell that smart reporter of yours, Ross, that he's digging himself into a hole it'll be awfully tough to get out of.                  
    I'll give him the message.  
            That all?           
No. I just wanna warn you against going completely crazy. 
You've given me a million-dollar libel suit if I ever saw one.   
And, Patterson, I know how to use a libel suit.        
If you don't print a retraction of this graft story,            
I'll break you.                 
Make no mistake about it,       
I can do it.                    
Thanks for your interest, Jesse,
     but I'm still running      
         my own paper.          
All right, you asked for it.    
                  I think       
           that's what I needed.
             All right.         
    If it's going to be a fight,
       we'll take off the gloves
          and let him have it.  
Play up the burning of the books. Play it up big.   
Write your version of the affair under your own byline.

             WOMAN:             
          He's burnt.           
                   I seen it!   
                It's your fault!
   You drove on the wrong side  
 of the street and hit that guy!
   Drunk! Look at him,          
     stinking drunk!            
            He's full           
          of that stuff!        
       [CROWD CHATTERING]       
      Come on! Let me in.       
    I'm Ross of The Record.     
                     Yeah,      
               and you're drunk.
          Do you know you killed
               three people?    
   Yes, you.                    
        [ALL CLAMORING]         
You, Frank Ross, having been found guilty of the crime of manslaughter, it is now my duty to pronounce sentence.          
   I must add that the verdict  
           of the jury          
    has the court's heartiest   
           approbation.         
Nor can there be any excuse for leniency in your case, as you should be well aware.    
Since you have, in signed articles for The Record, often denounced drunken driving as the most ghastly of crimes,  
        a view with which       
    the court agrees entirely.  
    And when such drunkenness   
     results in the slaughter   
        of three young,         
innocent citizens, words become inadequate to express our horror.          
I was not drunk, and I was not driving that car.

[GAVEL CRACKING]                
 Nor can we condemn too harshly 
    your vicious assertion      
        that you were---        
Framed. Yes, Your Honor, framed.
 By that eminent public servant,
     District Attorney Hanley   
         and his equally eminent
  and equally crooked assistant,
              Grayce.           
        Your Honor.             
I protest.                      
        Framed because they knew
          I could show them up  
           for the grafting rats
                 they are.      
  Frank, don't make it worse    
        for yourself.           
           All right.           
    You've done a great job.    
     You've discredited me      
         and my paper.          
You're putting me away, but you 
   can't keep me in the pen.    
      You'll never be able      
         to shut me up.         
         I'll get out,          
         and when I do,         
   I'll prove you responsible   
       for these murders.       
[CRACKS GAVEL]

the law provides: imprisonment in the state penitentiary at Rocky Point for one to 20 years, at hard labor.

I'll just die if I don't hear from you.       
             I'll write as often
               as I can, baby,  
        as often as they let me.
      We'll get you out.        
They can't keep you in prison.

Every morning, when you wake up in your cell, just remember that the boys will be working their ears off for you.         
              Don't worry, Bill.
              I'll take it easy.
         And when I get out,    
     I'll have a story to write.
 They're a couple of reporters. 
      You know, smart guys      
    that are always writing     
   about "crooks are yellow"    
     and "crime don't pay."     
     The DA don't like that     
    because he knows better.    
      So he sends this guy      
          to the jug.           
  Won't be long. You'll be out  
      before you know it.       
Hmm. He's going in and out,     
      just like that.           
    Clever boys,                
  these reporters.              
Write a piece about me when you get out, will you?     
 The name is Stacey,            
   life sentence.               
I like to read my name          
    in the papers.              
  If you don't shut up, you may 
 find it in the obituary column.
Oh, my goodness. Hey, deputy,   
  will you change my seat?      
I don't like to play so rough.               
He run over a couple of guys,   
  so he thinks he's tough.      
You know how it is with the first couple of guys.  
       Ha! I don't think        
         he's so tough.         
        No?                     
              No.               
How tough are you, babe?        
                  That's good.  
                  That's good.

 When a man is legally convicted
          and sent here,        
              we must assume him

Why, you flap your ears and wish you was a swallow.     
         When did Limpy come in?
     A month ago.

Murder, second degree.

         Well, Mr. Reporter,    
    how about that plan of yours
         for getting in and out?
        Seems to me, you've been
          in here 30 days now.  
And they turned down            
    your pardon.                
         Yeah.                  
That gives you a year and a half
 before you can even ask again. 
 Well, uh, the paper's working  
        on a new angle.         
 If they can get some evidence, 
    I can get another trial.    
You see what I mean, Ross?      
There I was keeping my nose clean and going straight for the first time in 20 years, and those dirty coppers have to put the pinch on me.    
And even with a bum rap, do I get a break and go to a decent stir like Stillwater or Sing Sing?   
    Oh, no.                     
 I have to fall                 
 in this state.                 
       It might have been worse.
     Suppose you started to run,
       and the cop slugged you. 
  Well, I'd sooner be slugged.  
       I'd sooner be dead       
  than live in this madhouse.   
Break your back working all day.
        Sit in your cell        
       until next morning       
       with nothing to do       
     but stare at the wall.     
   Screws going by, snooping.   
        Rats like Limpy.        
     First thing you know,      
       you're stir-nuts,        
       just marking time        
      till you can get out      
    and kill the first creep    
    that comes in your way.     
            I wonder            
   if the joint's getting me.   
               Don't let it     
          get you down, Meuller.
                  Keep your mind
                   off yourself.

         Hey, you guys.         
Well, I'm collecting today      
      for a change.             
      Lassiter over there       
 claims that whales give milk.  
          Same as a cow.        
        Can you beat that?      
Certainly, numbskull.           
Whales aren't fish,             
 they're mammals.               
They give milk like any other animal.          
     Okay, whales give milk.    
But personally, I think you guys
     are still ribbing me.      
         Hey, Lassiter.         
          Come over here        
 and join the rest of the dopes.
Say, what's Lassiter in for?    
       Why, he just stole       
  a 100-pound sack of walnuts,  
      and he buried them.       
      Now, he sits around       
       worrying for fear        
  the squirrels might find it   
      before he gets out.       
            He worked in a bank.
           He accepted a deposit
                 from a guy     
          after he knew the bank
             was on the rocks.  
           It's what they call  
          a legal technicality. 
     Mm-hmm.                    
                  Hey.          
          What was this you were
                telling Red     
             about sharks giving
                cow highballs?  
             Whales, not sharks.
   And I was trying to tell him 
 that dogs don't have any pores.
Oh, where do you get that stuff?
      Sure they got pores.      
 How are they gonna sweat then  
         if they ain't?         
       Off their tongues.       
  I told you the guy was loco.  
                 [CHUCKLING]    
             Speaking of sharks,
                  watch it.     
     Get up off that dirt!      
     Where do you think you are,
         in some county jail?   
     Lassiter, look at you.     
  Wallowing around like a hog.  
Stand up and come to attention when an officer speaks to you.  
            I didn't know it was
             against the rules  
           to sit on the ground.
     Shut your trap.            
Another crack out of you, and I'll put you in the Hole.   
Any talking's to be done        
      around here,              
I'm the guy that'll do it.      
Fold your arms and salute when an officer speaks to you.  
       Everybody salute!        
          Bunch of cheap,       
          tinhorn crooks.       
      Never knowed nothing      
        and never will.         
        Watch your step,        
        the lot of you,         
       or I'll break you.       
        Show you tramps         
    who's boss around here.     
      Yes, sir, Pete's certainly
             one nice guy.      
          I'd like to meet him  
        on the outside sometime.
         I'll meet him,         
           all right.           
  Or maybe I won't wait until   
      I'm on the outside.       
       Thattaboy, Meuller.      
Let's hear what you'd really do.
    What would I do to Pete?    
 I'd cook him with a steam hose 
     until his hot carcass      
          fell apart.           
     I'd take a blowtorch!      
       I'd take a hammer!       
Shh!                            
                        Stop it.
    Just the thought of him     
  helpless in my hands makes--  
            Come on, pal.       
       Let's go watch the game. 
Got a feeling Meuller will really keep that date with Pete.
    Personally, I'll settle     
           for Limpy.           
Yeah, why?                      
   Maybe I don't like the way   
       he plays a piano.        
          Maybe I just          
       don't like stools.       
        You have to know        
        all the answers?        
 Stacey, I just been ratted on. 
       What about?              
          That can of soda you  
        slipped me this morning,
           they saw me using it.
Whoa, that means the Hole if they ever catch you.         
        Who ratted?             
          Limpy and that new pal
           of his, the Polecat. 
                    Why, those--
    What's wrong with soda?     
              Mix it with salt  
            and tobacco powder. 
                 It makes snuff.
                 It's forbidden.
          You got it?           
                           Yeah.
       Slip it to me.           
                           You? 
     You're going out           
on parole next week, and you can't afford to go      
 out of circulation now.        
I need you on the outside.      
   Slip it to me quick.         
    Mob around. Here.           
              Red, keep the shiv
               till I come out. 
   You other guys take a powder.
     Garsky, you stick with me. 
         Watch yourself, there's
         the captain of the Hole
                talking to Pete.
                Okay.           
There's Pete and Temple crossing to 'em now.            
Sure fixed Stacey's watchdog,   
          didn't I?             
           Nice work. Pipe down.
Well, I think those rats snitched on the wrong party     
        this time.              
              Who's the new rat?
Carlisle, better known          
     as Polecat.                
       He came in               
a couple days ago and started palling around      
  with Limpy right away.        
       Oh, yeah. Five years for 
     manslaughter. Heard of him.
Yeah, for manslaughter,         
      five years.               
    I steal a tire,             
     and I get 20.              
            Smells like he's got
            some pull somewhere.
             Come on, get going,
                   Stacey.      
There's something funny about this!               
You had it, all right.          
        Who, me, sir? No, sir.  
     I ain't that kind of a boy.
Hey, something went wrong.      
Puttin' Stacey away instead.    
      Never mind. I'll take care
       of him when he gets out. 
          Into the Hole he goes.
               Poor sucker.     
Aw, solitary never bothered     
Stacey. He can do it easily.    
       Yeah? Did you ever figure
          why screws like Pete  
               ain't bumped off?
         No, why?               
                This state's got
               no death penalty.
       So if you knock a guy off
                in here,        
        you do life in the Hole.
            And if that still   
         don't tell you nothing,
           take a gander at him.
 In the Hole, you're handcuffed 
        to the cell bars        
       eight hours a day.       
    No light, no furniture.     
          No heat in the winter.
                 Bread and water
                  only at noon. 
      That guy was a great joker
       when he first come here. 
                  He was always 
                ribbing at guys.
        They gave him six months
              in the Hole.      
              Just six months.  
            And look at him now.
      [MACHINERY RATTLING]      
I'm getting fed up with Pete.                      
 I'm getting fed up             
 working here.                  
I don't know if I can stand it any longer.            
        I'm fed up too.         
 Nothing we can do about it...  
            but wait.           
               I wish I'd stayed
                 home in Fargo. 
        Why'd you leave?        
         I was dogcatcher,      
  and they run me out of office.
         I didn't have the heart
         to kill them poor pups.
         I'd turn them loose    
    as fast as they was catched.
                        Oh...   
                Is that a ghost?
Well, we'll soon find out who wins the blood sweep now.   
                       You gonna
                      bet on it?
        I don't bet on one guy  
           killing another.     
                  That ain't it.
Limpy got a message in to Stacey
        that he'd get him       
     before he's out of the Hole
              24 hours.         
              But you gotta call
                   the hour.    
               I'll bet two cans
                   of tobacco   
             one of them gets it
               in seven hours.  
Give her a shot of oil up there, will you?             
                 Yeah.          
How'd they handle you?          
                 Can't kick.    
Need any soap or tobacco        
     or toothpaste?             
            No. Listen, Ross,   
         forget about that shiv.
    What shiv?                  
I don't know the meaning        
      of the word.              
                     This.      
I don't see any shiv.           
                   Okay, Ross.

       They got one of the rats.
                Hooray!         
             Get them all,      
            the dirty finks!    
   That guy Limpy, he chokes    
  and flops out in the aisle.   
Sit down, sit down,             
     you men!

  in your chairs!               
   Get back there.              
                 He was sitting 
               right next to me.
            Then all of a sudden
            he starts coughing. 
      And then, like I told you,
      he flaps out in the aisle.
             All right, men,    
         take him to the morgue.

     What's up?                 
         That paper you work for
           doing you any good?  
   They're trying.              
                You been in here
                  four months.  
Yes, but they've been fighting  
     the administration.        
   That doesn't help.           
                     A bum rap, 
                     wasn't it? 
 What's all this for?           
               Listen, Ross.    
            I didn't kill Limpy.
        All right.              
              Believe it or not,
                   I didn't.    
I meant to, but the screws searched my cell.
            So I passed the shiv
              on to another guy 
             who loved Limpy    
             just like I did.   
              So Limpy collected
               the next morning.
           Okay.                
             But that don't make
                no difference.  
           You thought I did it.
     A word from you, and I'd be
     doing the book in the Hole,
              and you'd probably
                 be pardoned.   
        I'm no rat.             
                I owe you plenty
                    for that.   
You don't owe me a thing.       
              And I'm gonna pay.
    Kid, did you ever figure out
         that if I was out,     
 I could find out who framed you
       and get you sprung?      
         How?                   
              I got connections.
         I can find out anything
             that's happened    
              by putting dough  
            in the right places.
So, uh, all we've gotta do is get you out of here?         
                       Jiggers. 
              Listen, Ross.     
         This is no screwy idea.
        I'm not so nuts I'd risk
          the book in the Hole  
              just to get rid of
                 another rat.   
                    Another guy 
                  beat me to it.
   But it works out the same.   
I'm using it to beat this joint.
Sorry, Stacey, you've gotta     
  start at the beginning.       
      All right. If you're up   
   for killing some guy in here,
                you're tried    
             in the courthouse. 
      I'm doing life, 199 years.
        So no pardon, no parole.
You can't crash over those walls
      in a million years.       
       The only chance is to get
           to the courthouse    
          and try it from there.
An army couldn't get you out of that courthouse.         
A lot of guys have tried it, and they've all been buried.    
            They tried it alone.
            They didn't plan it.
          Listen. Garsky and me,
    we figured this out together
           before he left.      
            I let someone snitch
                to the warden   
           that I sunk that shiv
                 in Limpy.      
                 I get indicted.
 Garsky follows the case through
   the papers or a mouthpiece.  
He knows the day I'm to be tried
       and the courtroom.       
                  He makes      
           all the arrangements.
        Mm-hmm.                 
And where do I come in?         
  You're the only guy I ever met
       that gave me a break     
   without putting the bee on me
             for dough.         
           So now I'm giving you
                  a break.      
   Go to the warden and tell him
     about me having that shiv. 
      No, no. No, Stacey,       
            I can't.            
    I could have saved Limpy    
       from being killed        
      if I'd used my head.      
       I've been thinking       
     of what I'd have done      
   if I were on the outside.    
         I'd have tried         
     to run the murder down     
    and slapped it all over     
        the front page.         
                  But you're not
                 on the outside.
          No, I'm not.          
 I'm in the pen and I'm a con.  
      But Limpy was killed,     
            murdered.           
   That still means something   
             to me.             
        No, Stacey, no.         
I can't help you to use a murder
    to make a break. Sorry.     
     No, no soap.               
     What's the matter with you?
       You going stir-nuts too? 
     This is a sure out for you.
                  Hey, dummy up.
              So there you are. 
            Where you been, huh?
Under the machine, taking a wrap of fiber off.     
         Yeah, that's as may be.
            You got visitors.   
      I ought to park your lazy 
    carcass in the Hole instead.
       Take it. Get out of here,
        before I change my mind.
         Face the wall.         
        Fold your arms.         
                    [DOOR SHUTS]
      Ross, you wanna take      
        a trip to court?        
              No.               
Then cut out that staring into the visitor's room.        
And say "sir" when you address an officer.    
                      Yes, sir. 
            All right, Ross.    
       Don't forget to give this
       to Pete when you go back.
               Sit here.        
         Come in, miss.         
                    [SMOOCH]    
                      [WHISPERS]
                     I miss you.
              It's been so long.
           [WHISPERS]           
  I've missed you so terribly.  
[SOBS]                          
Frank.                          
             Oh, it's all right,
             darling. It's all--
                 It's all right.
We're trying so hard.           
We haven't let up a minute.     
                    Nothing new?
Only what I wrote you.          
      And they haven't been able
                 to get a line  
               on Shake Edwards,
      that man that was in front
     of the building that night?
Not a trace of him.             
             Mm, I'm sure he was
               the finger man.  
                 He was the one.
But we'll find him, Frank.      
A lot of the boys in the A.P.   
    are working with us.        
                             Mm.
Frank, I know you don't want your mother to see you here, but can't you forget that?      
                  No, no.       
But it's too cruel to keep her from visiting you.  
      I...couldn't say no.      
     I've brought her here.     
        Please see her.         
        Please, Frank.          
    You can't send her away.    
           All right, all right.
       All right, madam.        
                You shouldn't   
             have made the trip.
                   It's too far.
           Are you feeling well?
       Yes, I feel fine.        
                    That's good.
Your face is so thin and pale.                       
Are you quite sure you're all right?               
          Oh, yes, I feel great.
They let me bring you           
  something to eat.             
Everything you like.            
I got the ice cream across the street from a little shop.  
You never tell me anything about your work in your letters.
Is it terribly hard?            
                Oh, no.         
         I've got a swell job.  
           All I've gotta do    
           is, uh, take care    
          of the twine stock,   
        and every now and then, 
        write a few articles    
           for the prison paper.
Oh, I'm so glad.                
We must be patient.             
Joyce and the boys at the office are wonderful.    
They're sure they can get you out.           
          Yeah, sure, I know.   
               They'll--        
       They'll take care of me, 
              all right.        
You're not eating your lunch, dear.               
It's everything you like.       
Chicken and nut bread and... chocolate cake.                 
[SOBBING]                       
    Oh, Mom, please, please.    
  Please don't worry, will ya?  
       Well...I've gotta go now.
   Oh, but the time             
       isn't--                  
I think we'd better leave, dear.        
         Just a minute, ladies. 
        He's got to leave first.
            [SMOOCH]            
              Goodbye, Ma.      
       Stacey.                  
                            Yes?
Will there be any shooting      
 down at the courthouse?        
                             No.
I don't want any more blood     
       on my hands.             
   Give me your word?           
             I give you my word.
               And I don't lie. 
    All right, Stacey,          
  I'll put in with you.         
                  Remember this.
     Afterwards, they may figure
          you were in on it     
      and throw you in the Hole.
            You may have to take
            a lot of punishment.
       I don't mind.            
           Now, don't break down
                and confess.    
              Once it's done,   
           keep your mouth shut.
             That's gonna be    
         the tough part of this.
       I know.                  
        You or any of those guys
              on the paper      
                 got any idea   
              on who framed you?
We have only one lead.          
Did you ever hear of Shake Edwards?               
                    Yeah, a rat.
Well, he was outside the building the night it happened. 
    He fingered me,             
    I'm sure of it.             
                  Shake Edwards?
         Mm.                    
               I'll find him,   
           and I'll get you out.
    No matter how tough it looks
        or how long it takes,   
               I'll get you out.
                    And legally.
 All right, Stacey.             
     Good luck.                 
                   So long, kid,
                    and thanks  
                 for everything.
        [BLOWS WHISTLE]         
           Can you get this out?
   Sure.                        
Will the other end              
     pay off?                   
                 Yeah. Watch it,
                  it's dynamite.
You know me, Mr. Ross.          
      So you're the smart fellow
       who didn't know anything 
 about the Limpy Julien killing.
 Answer the warden.             
           You better come clean
                  for once      
                and make it easy
                  for yourself. 
Open that ugly mouth            
      of yours                  
 before I knock you             
 through the wall.              
    There ain't much to say.    
 In other words, you admit it.  
        Come on, Stacey,        
       make a statement.        
   You haven't got a chance.    
                  Why, you--!   
          Here, here, stop that!
           Lang, kick 'em apart.
               Nice work, kid.  
                         Stacey!
                      Hold it.  
                        Hold it.
          I couldn't have wanted
            a nicer confession. 
           Take him to the Hole.
Keep your mouth shut about this around the yard.     
And watch out for yourself.     
Some of the inmates might not like you for turning Stacey in.          
     I had another reason.      
      I'm a newspaper man.      
      I wouldn't cover up       
       a murder outside--       
Get outta here.                 
      Get this, wise guy.       
        We bury the ones        
  that try to get outta here.   
    If you don't believe me,    
            try it.             
     MAN:                       
Here he is now.                 
       [CROWD CHATTERING]       
        Hello, Lockhart.        
     How's the mouthpiece?      
   Hello, Stacey.               
Not worried, are you?           
               Me, worry?       
            Why, we'll beat     
               this rap.        
              By a neck.        
That's Ross, eh?                
                 Yeah.          
I'll talk to him in a minute.                    
Hey, sit down.                  
                  I'm Lockhart, 
                Stacey's lawyer.
          If they wanna know    
     what we were talking about,
            say I was asking you
             if you were going  
          to identify that shiv.
               No, he hasn't got
                   a chance.    
             Open-and-shut case.
               Everything's set.
                After he's gone,
    he'll keep in touch with you
             through me.        
          That's all. Sit tight.
      How are you, deputy?      
How are you?                    
                 What'd he want?
Ah, the dirty fink.             
He wanted to know if I was certain                
I could still identify that shiv.             
                          Oh.   
                Well, don't talk
                 to him anymore.
  We'll send you the original   
    once it's in the paper.     
        You can only talk to him
              for a minute.     
       Thank you, deputy.       
              Ought to be a pip.
Oh, I hoped you wouldn't come, darling.     
This may be a mess.             
                 If it is,      
          I want to be with you.
               Frank, we've got 
              good news for you.
          I think we've located 
         Shake Edwards out west.
      Maybe you'll be home      
   before the month is over.    
That'd be great.                
           Spill it, what do you
              got us here for?  
               Yeah, what gives?
Come across, Frankie.           
It's a long way to come for a trial when The Record's got wire coverage.              
I was lonesome. I wanted        
  you to hold my hand.          
         Nix on the acking-cray,
                 Frankie.       
            Give us the lowdown.
 I can't. But listen.           
There'll be a story, a beat for The Record.          
Jerry, you grab shots           
    of everybody                
  in the courtroom              
  and every thing.              
Above all, keep your eye        
       on Stacey.               
    Don't look now,             
       you saps.                
         Come on, that's enough.
               Break it up.     
             I told you         
   you could only have a minute.
                  Thinking about
                  jumping, Ross?
            All right, go ahead.
      There's a nice stretch    
  of concrete three floors below
           that you can splatter
                yourself on.    
                  [GAVEL CRACKS]
                     BAILIFF:   
                 Everybody rise.
   Superior Court of Hudson,    
           in and for           
     the County of Manton,      
       is now in session.       
 The Honorable James C. Scott,  
       Judge, presiding.        
[GAVEL CRACKS]                  
           Be seated.

        v. Judson Stacey.       
       [CROWD SCREAMING]        
           [GUNSHOTS]           
 Don't worry, darling.          
     Don't worry.               
         No, I'm not worried,   
     but can he possibly escape?
I don't know. But listen,       
I'll probably get a pardon.     
If there's any cross up,        
need any advice, get hold of Stacey's            
 lawyer, Lockhart.              
You hear that? Lockhart.        
                      Mm-hmm.   
Aw, baby, it won't be           
    so long now.                
    He made it. A fine mess.    
       Yeah, he made it.        
Well, maybe Stacey made it, but we won't lose you, you dirty little rat.           
       Stay here and get        
      your story, darling.      
Come on.                        
     I'll write you Sunday.     
      Over there.               
                   Bring him in.
Where did Stacey lam to?        
                 I don't know.  
Don't lie to me, you little rat.                 
I've been handling hooligans like you for 25 years.          
Where is he?                    
         I don't know.          
Listen, Ross.                   
You're gonna talk if we have to bury you in the Hole for the next 20 years.          
With an added stretch for aiding an escape.           
Now, where did he go?           
                     I tell ya, 
                   I don't know.
          Wise-guy reporter, eh?
      Tell us what ya saw.      
It was on a Monday.             
Him and Stacey was behind a breaker, whispering together. 
Then they shook hands.          
And right after that,           
Ross told the warden            
Stacey killed Limpy.            
        You heard that?         
      Now what do you say?      
       He's a liar. I never said
       that Stacey killed Limpy.
          If Stacey had done it,
           he'd have covered up,
              and not sent me in
                to rat on him.  
Well, why did you stool then?   
You never opened your trap before.               
   I thought I might get a break
       from the pardon board.   
Listen, Ross,                   
          you are not           
     dealing with suckers.      
          That getaway          
    was planned months ago,     
 and timed right to the second. 
       You were in on it.       
     And another guy.           
Now, who was the other guy?     
                 I don't know   
              anything about it.
Oh, you don't know anything about it?              
Who filled the back of that truck with mattress padding so Stacey could jump?           
       I don't know, I tell you.
You don't know.                 
Who passed Stacey the signal so he'd know which window to jump from?      
You don't know that either, do ya?             
What kind of a car did they change to after they ditched the hot car down the road?      
You don't know.                 
Well, let me tell you something, you're doing a 20-year stretch.              
And if you don't talk, there'll be no pardon, no parole.           
You'll do that 20 years, every last second of it.        
Now will you spill?             
         I've told you          
       everything I know!       
Work on him.                    
                [BLOWS THUDDING]
     What's going on here?      
         Take him out.          
                  You stay here.
                           Well?
Well, he's guilty, ain't he?                       
How else you gonna make him sing?                  
            I've told you before
     that I will not tolerate   
 brutality in this penitentiary.
                 I've laid down 
                punishment rules
        that are fully adequate.
      And as long as I'm warden,
     those rules will be obeyed.
            And mark this, Lang,
             if there's any more
               of what went on  
         in here this afternoon,
               you'll go...     
       if I have to charge you  
     in criminal court to do it.
FRANK:                          
Let me outta here.              
             Just a minute.     
Let me out of here, do you hear?                    
We'll give you one more chance, Ross.          
If you give me the lowdown on Stacey's escape and tell me who helped him,     
         I'll let you outta here
              and give you      
        your first-grade stripe.
        You haven't got         
         a thing on me,         
      and you're not gonna      
     get a word out of me.      
       I don't know where       
       Stacey lammed to,        
    but I'm glad he made it.    
  I'm in here on a phony rap,   
    and you've got no right     
        to keep me here.        
   So get this, from now on,    
       the rules are off.       
  I'm gonna talk when I please  
      and do what I like.       
      I'm gonna be as mean      
  and dirty and hard to handle  
 as the worst con in the joint, 
      and I'll skull-drag       
        any rat or screw        
 that gets in my way, you hear? 
    Now, let me outta here,     
           you hear?            
   You muddle-headed copper.    
       Let me outta here!       
              Grayce, head      
          of the parole board?  
                    Of all      
              the rotten breaks.
        Why, that dirty         
         crook Hanley.          
    I'd like to get my hands    
          on that guy.          
Well, that certainly fixed it up
      for the kid's parole.     
What about that A.P. guy in Chicago        
that had a line on Shake Edwards?               
The finger man.                 
                 It fizzled out.
   Just like everything else    
          we've tried.          
       Just like Stacey.        
And Lockhart, that lawyer of his
      who promised to help.     
     No word from him, huh?     
                         Mm.    
For 20 years now,               
I've been a newspaperman, but I've never seen a case as shut as this.                
             Bill, we've got    
        to do something for him.
                We can't let him
                  sit up there  
           and rot in that hole.
Honey, I'd get down on my hands and knees and shove my face in the dirt from here to Rocky Point if it'd get the kid out.        
But there's a stone wall smack in front of us.           
We've got to wait until there's some kind of a break.           
      Well, we can't wait.      
  Frank can't wait any longer.  
      Bill, you don't know      
 what it does to him up there.  
We've got to think of some way. 
 We've got to do something now. 
           [SOBBING]            
You've got to let me see Stacey.
     Please, Mr. Lockhart.      
    You must take me to him.    
     Don't you understand?      
         Stacey's our last hope.
             He's got to see me.
        I could get you         
      into heaven easier.       
             However, I'll do   
         whatever I can for you.
Thanks, Mr. Lockhart.           
[KNOCK ON DOOR]                 
          Take the blinders off.
                Well, what's up?
       Stacey, you've got       
       to get Frank out.        
What do you want me to do, send him a pair of wings?       
      What's the matter with his
       friends at the newspaper?
               They're smart,   
                ain't they?     
           They kept him in,    
       they can work in reverse.
          I don't know          
   what you're talking about.   
Ross would.                     
He said he'd keep his trap shut, but he didn't.   
He tipped off his paper so the courtroom was crummy with reporters and photographers all waiting for the break.      
Oh, I never did like reporters.                 
Any one of them would put the finger on you.    
             He had to let      
            his paper know.     
          It was his instinct   
             as a reporter.     
Well, his instinct blew him right into the Hole, and I hope he rots there.       
                 You think      
          he double-crossed you?
I think he's like every other wise guy.           
He had to have a payoff before he'd dummy up.           
                 You don't think
                 there's anyone,
                   man or woman,
           that money won't buy,
                  do you?       
Well, is there?                 
  Look at Garsky.               
Look at Joe, that weasel with the punk cigar.            
  Look at Johnny                
   over there.                  
He gets paid just to look       
    out that window.            
Look at Lockhart.               
   Look at me.                  
      I am looking at you.      
    And it's making me sick.    
              What did you mean 
             by that last crack?
Cut it out.                     
      You can threaten me       
        if you want to,         
   but you can't shut me up.    
    You still make me sick.     
You're a blind, stupid, selfish,
  contemptible tinhorn crook.   
Now, listen--                   
       You listen to me.        
       Frank's been in that hole
            for five months     
       waiting to hear from you.
                     Do ya here?
        Five months of beatings,
       kickings and starvations.
            Trying to twist     
       and torture it out of him
    that you used Julian's death
     as part of an escape plan. 
           But he wouldn't tell.
                 Did you pay him
                  to keep quiet?
                        Did you?
           No.                  
      No, he kept his mouth shut
        because he trusted you. 
                   He thinks    
              you're his friend.
                He doesn't know 
              you never heard of
            that kind of loyalty
              money won't buy.  
                That you're just
                 a cheap hoodlum
                 who never did  
               one decent thing.
     Who ever done              
    anything for me?            
            Frank Ross.         
    He's doing it right now     
     in the Hole in Rocky Point.
You guys wait outside in the other room.              
                      All right.
Okay.                           
Lockhart.                       
                     Uh-huh?    
You stay.                       
Sit down.                       
If I could believe that, there ain't no place            
I wouldn't go for a guy like that.            
Nothing I wouldn't do.          
                 Why don't you  
              do something then?
            Frank is straight,  
         he is honest and loyal.
                 He's everything
                that you're not.
              Yes, I know.      
            Lockhart told me    
          you were a slum kid   
        who never had a chance, 
            but so was Frank.   
           He hates crooked cops
          and rotten politicians
         just as much as you do.
          The only difference is
                you chose crime,
                  the easy way. 
    While he spent his life     
         fighting them,         
   doing something about it.    
     That's why you've got      
        to help him now.        
Maybe you're on the level at that.              
I don't know.                   
Anyway, beat it along home, now.                
But you will--?                 
                How do I know?  
             I'll think it over.
        Put the blinders on her.
       Come on, you guys.       
     Tell her you're sorry      
       for getting tough.       
Who, me?                        
For crying out loud--           
        Go on, tell her.        
All right, I'm sorry.           
       See, he don't know       
           no better.           
             Go on.             
All right, Lockhart,            
      powder.                   
             Wanna sit in, boss?
It's the dame,                  
I guess.                        
They sure pour it on.           
              It's their nature.
             They can't help it.
    Is there anything wrong     
           with that?           
           Is there?            
              Why, no, chief.   
                  I only--      
         Shut up, then.         
           Now, look.           
       Ross may be dumb,        
  but he's on the level, see?   
         A square guy.          
        And I ain't used        
        to square guys.         
  So we gotta pick up the mug   
      that Ross is taking       
          the rap for.          
              How do we do that?
      First we pick up          
       Shake Edwards.           
       We gotta find him        
   and squeeze him a little.    
        Then Lockhart           
  can get Ross a new trial.     
                       But--    
         But what?              
    We'll talk it over first    
 and figure it out from there.  
  Well, what are you guys       
        waiting for?            
        Ya paralyzed?           
   Go on, scram out of here     
    and pick up that fink.      
                   Okay.        
  Like a bunch of tin crooks.   
           Hm.                  
       Imagine Stacey           
   working for the cops.        
   Huh. That's a hot one.       
I'm sorry, Miss Conover,        
I can only repeat what I've told you many times in the last five months.        
When he admits the truth--      
           But Frank had nothing
               to do with it.   
You know better.                
Look, this unusual photographic concentration on Stacey proves that The Record was tipped off beforehand.      
    And that tip would come     
  from only one source: Ross.   
       A former reporter        
        for The Record.         
      But that's just it.       
      He's a newspaperman       
       and naturally he--       
That's practically an admission, isn't it?         
                 You can't prove
                    that he--   
That's true.                    
Because we can't prove it,      
Ross might have been            
    out of the Hole long ago    
     except for his record      
        while in there.         
      Insubordination, violence,
            hunger strikes.     
       He's the most troublesome
           prisoner I've had    
      in 35 years of penal work.
But you can't blame him, warden.              
He never committed any crime    
 and naturally he resents--     
Oh, won't you please let him out
  and give him another chance?  
   We're uncovering new evidence
    of his innocence right now. 
    Yet how can he get a hearing
        if he's in the Hole?    
New evidence?                   
What do you mean?               
               Well, we've--    
            That is, his friends
              are on the trail  
      of the man who framed him.
You're in love with Ross,       
       aren't you?              
I'll trust you.                 
I'm gonna give Ross a break.    
      Have Ross brought into    
 the deputy's office right away.
         Come with me.          
                [FRANK SHOUTING]
Sit down here.                  
             FRANK:             
   You can't get me in there!   
       If I can just get        
  my hooks into your throat--   
Frank, darling, don't!          
                     Let him go.
                   Wait outside.
          What are you          
         starting now?          
    This some of your doing?    
Frank, don't.                   
                   Take it easy.
                    You're not  
                 gonna get hurt.
            But behave yourself.
           Ross, when you first 
          came here, I thought--
          I don't care          
       what you thought.        
When I first came here,         
I believed in justice.          
I believed that some day        
    I'd be released.            
Then I began to figure in weeks, then months.          
    And now I hate everybody    
       in the whole world       
  for letting me in for this.   
 Buried in a black, filthy hole 
 because I was a good citizen.  
Because I worked my head off    
      to expose crime.          
And now I'm a convict.          
I act like a convict, smell like a convict.           
   I think and hate             
   like a convict.              
   But I'll get out.            
I'll get out if I have to kill  
  every screw in the joint.     
                Now, that'll do.
       Yeah. It'll do.          
      You bet it'll do.         
 Go on, kick me, beat me up,    
 throw me back in the Hole.     
       I can take it.           
              You brought a lot 
             of this on yourself
                  by throwing in
                   with Stacey. 
Mm. Starting that again, huh?   
                I'm not guessing
                   this time.   
                         I know.
I told him, Frank.              
               You what?        
Frank, I didn't mean to, but--                  
   Why, you--                   
                You'd better not
                  say it, Ross. 
                 You'd better   
              thank her instead.
     For what?                  
Getting me another 10 years     
       in the Hole?             
        For getting you a break.
       What Miss Conover told me
           is off the record.   
     And I'm giving you a chance
        to measure up to her.   
            Think you can do it?
            I'm sending you back
                to the Hole.    
I knew there was a catch in it.                  
               There's no catch.
         If you behave yourself,
           you'll come out      
     with a good-conduct report,
      all set for a fresh start.
A clean slate?                  
                  In 30 days,   
              if you deserve it.
     The pardon and parole board
             meets again        
         in two months from now.
         And if you'll stay away
           from troublemakers,  
             I'll recommend you 
            to the board myself.
                  But you've got
                    to earn it. 
                What do you say?
        [SOBBING]               
      [MACHINERY RATTLING]      
     Lassiter doesn't look      
            so good.            
   How's he been making out?    
Pete rides him all the time.                   
He's getting weaker and weaker and still the croaker in the hospital keeps sending him back.         
The only thing that pill-pusher 
 can diagnose is rigor mortis.  
                   Sounds bad.  
                 Is it catching?
       Did you tell him?        
I didn't wanna get him down about his parole.               
                      What's up?
     We got it all planned      
          to lam out.           
              You'll all wind up
                in the morgue.  
              Red, you're not   
           putting in with them?
Sure am.                        
  The parole board will probably
       give you your ticket.    
   Yeah, and it's gonna read,   
    "Continued to expiration    
         of sentence."          
 Look, I ain't kidding myself,  
       so why should you?       
       If I miss with the board,
            I've got Stacey.    
Stacey. Yeah, we all thought    
he was a right guy until he lammed out             
   and left you.                
Have you heard from him?        
                       No, but--
Them bigshots is all alike.     
Why should he think of you,     
when he's rolling in that hundred grand?          
        He'll do something soon.
Wait'll he catches those creeps.
     Yeah, yeah.                
       Come on! Come on,        
       get back to work!        
Come on, step on it,            
     all of ya!                 
That goes for you too.          
What's the matter with you?                       
Let go of him.                  
Let go of him,                  
I tell ya!                      
Listen, you ain't gonna get away with no more goldbricking.      
Dragging that dead carcass of yours off to the hospital every time you think you got a little pain.          
          I'm really sick, Pete.
         I feel kind of dizzy,  
       like I'm floating around.
You will be floating around if you don't get back           
  to that machine.              
Hear what I told ya?            
Get back to that machine!       
Get back!                       
   Come on, you lead-slinger.   
        You ain't hurt.         
      Cut it. Cut it, you.      
            Cut it.             
 Don't you butt in, you'll only 
     make it worse for him.     
Come on, get up.                
You ain't--                     
                  Take him      
              to the hospital.  
                   And listen!  
          He fell over a machine
             accidental-like.   
              Don't forget that,
               if you guys know 
             what's good for ya.
                     Now, go on,
      get back to your machines!
                     All of you!
                Or I'll book ya!
     It's a good thing Pete     
     ain't a crystal gazer.     
     If he was, he wouldn't     
       sleep much nights.       
                  Move up, boys.
        [CLOCK TICKING]         
                   All right.   
           Sit down, Ross.      
How are you feeling?            
             I feel pretty well.
So you're the man               
who gets drunk and kills innocent people       
 with his car, are you?         
            I guess you know me.
           You were at my trial.
Oh, feeling a little troublesome this morning, eh?               
After all, we're here to release men who feel properly penitent      
and show a desire to lead a decent life in the future.    
              I've never led    
         any other kind of life.
               You know that.   
Oh, no. All we know is what is a matter of record.  
  Do you still contend          
  that you're innocent?         
                  Yes.          
Well, then, you haven't         
    any use for us.             
We're only interested in men who acknowledge their guilt and wish to atone.              
   What do you want me to do?   
   Do you want me to confess    
 to a crime I never committed?  
I'd stay here the whole 20 years
      before I'd do that.       
    Why did you help Stacey     
           to escape?           
           I didn't.            
 It's all here in your record.  
        You haven't been        
     a very good influence      
  for the rest of the inmates,  
   and it might not be proper   
  to turn you loose on society  
        just at present.        
You've got to realize that you can't get drunk and drive around killing people.                 
It's murder, as your admirable paper once pointed out, just as surely as if you used a loaded gun.    
      I didn't, I didn't.       
        That's not true,        
        and you know it.        
 Then there's your record here. 
      Insolence to a guard      
       on your first day.       
Disobedience and insubordination in the solitary cells.          
Does that record merit any consideration from us?      
         Yes, it does.          
 Well, we don't agree with you. 
    Warden Armstrong reports    
       that your conduct        
     has improved of late.      
But the reason is obvious.      
To curry favor with the board in hope of release.             
           Speak up.            
  Haven't you anything to say?  
  Yes, I'd have plenty to say   
  if I could think of anything  
   scummy enough to call ya,    
       you sanctimonious,       
  mealy-mouthed lot of skunks.  
    I'll meet you on the outside
              someday.          
    It may be 20 years from now,
           but when I do!       
                        [LAUGHS]
           [SOBBING]            
       I'm sorry.               
   I didn't mean what I said.   
          Oh, please,           
    give me another chance.     
   I just couldn't stand it.    
          Couldn't...           
   I can't do any more time.    
  Please, turn me out of here.  
 We'll do what we can for you.  
         Go along now.          
Next man.                       
         I don't know.          
I don't know anything about it. 
  Honest. I didn't have anything
          to do with it.        
       That's the truth.        
 You gotta believe me, fellas.  
                 I'm waiting.   
I don't know.                   
Don't, Stacey, don't.           
All right, I'll tell!           
                 Spill it!      
It was Carlisle,                
Polecat Carlisle.               
Hanley had him do it.           
I didn't have no part in it.    
I just fingered him.            
I didn't know what they was gonna do with him.
You can't blame me.             
                       Polecat. 
Yeah. He's at Rocky Point.      
             I oughta know that.
     Hanley and Grayce got him  
      picked up for an old rat  
            and sent there      
       to get him outta the way 
          because the papers    
           was getting hot.     
It's like having him put in a safe.                  
       Yeah. That's all I know. 
         You can't blame me.    
        In Rocky Point.         
No wonder you couldn't find him.
The old homestead.              
So now what?                    
        So, what do you suppose?
             I promised the girl
             we'd find that fink
       and clear Ross, didn't I?
           Well, we did.        
   Now we gotta get to Carlisle.
                  Is that right?
    Duck soup.                  
You take off the kelly at the front door and say,      
"Please, sir, can I see         
Mr. Polecat Carlisle?"          
It's too hot.                   
And supposin' we do find the guy?             
Where's the payoff?             
               Yeah, the payoff.
        Why don't you forget it,
                 Stacey?        
    What difference does it make
      if you promised the girl? 
    What do you care about Ross?
              We can't help it  
           if Polecat's in stir.
     We'll just fool around     
         at Rocky Point         
        and get paid off        
   with a slug in the belly.    
     And I ain't taking it      
      for Ross or nobody.       
    Okay.                       
If there was only a half a chance, Stacey.        
Listen, don't do nothing foolish.                
If you get picked up now, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in the Hole.       
     Yeah, I thought of that.   
     I don't blame you guys     
     for laying down on me.     
    But do something for me,    
            will ya?            
    Sure.                       
Yeah, what?                     
        Get out of here.        
 I don't like the way ya smell. 
       Go on, all of ya.        
          Come on, beat it.     
           I guess I'm a sucker,
     but I just can't get it out
              of my nut.        
     Ross doing all those months
             in the Hole        
        just to cover up for me.
   But still, he didn't have to,
              did he?           
No, he didn't have to.          
        Remember what Ross' dame
         said that day about...?
   About Ross and me wanting    
 the same thing all our lives,  
  and he was doing something    
          about it--?           
                Yep, I remember.
                 What about it? 
I think she had something there, so--   
                        So what?
So maybe I better do something about it.          
              Don't be a fool.  
           If you're picked up--
Shut up! Where did you ever get the idea I was a fool? 
I broke out of that pen once,   
          didn't I?             
And I can do it again.          
Now, listen, Stacey, you can't--
You heard me, shut up.          
You do the listening,           
I'll do the talking.            
And pay attention.              
Because if there's any slip-up  
on your part of this, you'll answer to the boys       
         for it.                
  Now, here's the gag.          
Get word through to Dale.       
               [CAR APPROACHING]
 It's okay, I didn't print it.  
           [EXHALES]            
             Hey! It's Stacey!  
   Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
            What do I gotta do, 
           fight my way back in?
            Come on!            
And you won't say why you came  
  back and gave yourself up?    
You know what it means.         
                  What is this, 
                a guessing game?
       According to rules,      
 it means the book and the Hole,
                 but not for me.
                I only came back
                for the weekend.
 You made it out once, Stacey,  
 but you'll never do it again.  
                   We'll see    
               how it works out.
  Now, do I get that plush-lined
   cell in solitary, or don't I?
  All right.                    
Everything set for the break?   
            Yeah.               
    You coming in with us       
           or not?              
        I don't love life much, 
      but I don't hate it enough
          to stick my head      
   in front of a screw's bullet.
 Be a wise guy.                 
Stick around here and maybe it won't be           
  a screw's bullet.             
Maybe you'll get what Lassiter got.              
            What about Lassiter?
He's on his way home.           
                     Home?      
Out the back gate in a hearse.  
               When'd it happen?
Four o'clock this morning.      
                   Poor guy.    
           Anybody told Meuller?
    No.                         
None of the guys wanted to break it to him.      
          Wait till he hears it.
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be Pete. 
For the last time, are you coming in with us or not?       
    I told ya no, and I mean no.
     Oh, you're stir-nuts.      
He don't know what he's saying. 
Aw, come on, Frank, get wise to yourself.           
                 Lay off, Red.  
               Will you lay off?
      Stacey's on the outside.  
   I'm sure he's working for me.
   I'll take my chance that way.
 Tough luck, kid.               
      [MACHINERY RATTLING]      
    Jiggers.                    
Meuller, you can't beat this joint!                
You have no chance!             
              Let me go!        
Meuller, why ain't you at work?          
 Get back to your machine.      
                      [SPITS]   
    Get over agin that wall.    
              I'm gonna bury you
                 in the Hole.   
        You hear what I told ya?
        Get over agin that wall.
So you're the guy that wouldn't let Lassiter go to the hospital?
I'll put you where he is, if you don't keep away from me. 
And you're the guy that made him
   fall and busted his back!    
        Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!     
   Stop him! Somebody, stop him!
            He's crazy!         
                  Get him away! 
                 Get the warden!
And you're the dirty screw      
   that killed my pal!

           I don't know what    
            he's wanted for,

          along by Stacey.      
       Come on, get going.      
         [MEN YELLING]

 You're all crazy, men.         
     Don't try it!              
They'll blast you before you get to the gate!     
Don't be suckers.               
 Stay out of it!                
      If I didn't know you were

         Put up those guns, men!
   I'm giving the orders now.   
        You're taking us        
      through them gates!       
            You're digging      
     your own graves, you fools!
        You do what we tell you,
        or you're digging yours.

           [GUNSHOT]            
Listen, bigshot, you saw what Pollard just got, so order them gates to open up and take us to the car, or I'll blow your hair all over the ceiling.           
                 You haven't got
                the nerve, Dale.
                  You can't     
             get away with this.
         You'll spend the rest  
       of your life in the Hole.
You got 10 seconds to find out whether I got the nerve.        
        Ten seconds or 10 years,
          the answer will always
               be the same.     
Listen, you dirty rats in there.
If these gates ain't open in 10 seconds,                  
I'm killing Armstrong just like Pollard!              
     Is that right, warden?     
     Did they kill Pollard?     
        Never mind.             
   Don't open the gates.        
       Get on the phone.        
      Call for extra help.      
        We have, warden.        
     It's on the way, sir.      
This is it, Armstrong.          
   Don't you need the warden    
             to make 'em open up
                the solitary?   
Yeah, yeah, that's right.       
I oughta give it to you now, but I got a date to keep        
with Stacey, and you're opening it up        
        for him.                
You're heading for the Hole.    
                   Not a chance.
         [MEN CHEERING]         
Get them keys, or I give it     
   to Lang on the spot!         
      All right, men, all right!
              All right!

          Step on it!           
             Quiet, boys, quiet!
        Meuller, Johnny, Ross,  
          you come with us.     
           Carr, you stick here.
I told you, I didn't want       
    any part of this.           
         [MEN SHOUTING]         
           Quiet! Oh, we get it.
                   You want     
             the warden to think
          you're too good       
   to stick with your pals, huh?
No, I don't wanna make          
  the Hole for life.            
               Listen, Ross.    
    Get moving or I'll bump you,
        Stacey or no Stacey.

   Come on. Move aside, Ross.   
             They're all screwy.
I'm glad you use your head.     
          I'll make my own break
           when the time comes. 
            So the picnic is on.
    This is it.                 
And there's Polecat,            
  like you asked.               
I'll get to him later.          
 Hello, Frankie. I been waiting 
  to see you for a long time.   
        I got a surprise for ya.
                All right, boys.
                   Right here.  
          [EXPLOSION]           
           [GUNFIRE]            
             Dale!              
            They threw gas bombs
           in through the gates.
           All the guys ran up  
         in the north cell hall.
       Now, the National Guard's
               out there        
               with machine guns
                 and gas masks! 
      Did I say a picnic?       
You two guys get in that cell.  
            Okay.               
    Why don't we give it to them
             right now?         
We may need 'em later.          
           [GUNSHOTS]           
     Any of you guys got a shiv?
           He's got one.        
Swell. Screws with machine guns all over the joint.        
                We'll make out. 
                      Out where?
                  Why, through  
                 the back door. 
We pick the screws off the wall,
           get some rope        
  at the twine mill and lam out!
                       Let's go!
            STACEY:             
  Come on, get going. Come on.  
              You guys go ahead.
What about you?                 
           Don't worry about me.
               I'll make out.   
I got something to take care of.
        Go on, beat it.         
           Put him in that cell.
                 He's done.     
[GUNFIRE]                       
     We all go together, Stacey.
          You got any ideas?    
If you know any prayers,        
   don't say 'em now.           
They won't do you any good.     
Come on, I got some unfinished business to take care of with the warden.                
      Write a note.             
   Tell 'em we'll release       
        you and Lang            
  if they let us out alive.     
Release 'em?                    
Write 'em, we'll knock you both off in 10 minutes if they don't quit firing.      
       My orders in case of riot
          are to keep firing,   
        regardless of the safety
       of any official or guard.
        Those orders will stand.
           [GUNFIRE]            
Stay on the floor, and you won't get hurt.         
       Maybe.                   
           [GUNFIRE]            
 Take that undershirt off.      
We'll show 'em a white flag.    
Here's a chance for you to be a hero.           
Take this note over to the twine mill.         
And if you lose it, tell 'em to stop firing.        
We give up.                     
             I ain't going.     
       I don't wanna get killed.
           What do you wanna do,
               live forever?    
       Here, give it to me.     
  Come on, Dale. Open that door.
           [GUNSHOTS]           
           [GUNFIRE]            
           [GUNFIRE]            
           Looks like           
     they don't wanna play.     
            How bad are you hit?
     Oh, it's just a nick.      
              Anything I can do?
        No, thanks, Frank.      
           [GUNFIRE]            
They'll be blasting it open     
       pretty soon.             
      Stacey, the riot's a bust.
       Get back in your cell    
   while there's still a chance.
No, won't do me no good now, kid.               
I still got that Limpy rap      
hanging over me, even though it was--            
          [EXPLOSION]           
It wasn't my job.               
  I wouldn't appear against you.
    I know it.                  
It's no use, Frank.             
This is the last roundup        
      for Stacey.               
           [GUNSHOTS]           
But there's still that unfinished business of yours to take care of.                
                It's still okay.
Where's Polecat?                
     Over there.                
I wanna talk to him.            
            Didn't I tell ya    
        I had a surprise for ya?
            Come on.            
 I ain't got no time to waste.  
Funny, just an hour ago,        
    I had 199 years.            
And now I ain't got             
  no time at all.               
               I'll get the rat.
           [GUNSHOTS]           
     We got an affidavit        
from Shake Edwards before I came back in here.     
           What about those guys
               who framed me?   
               Did you get them?
             Yeah.              
               Well, rat.       
       So it caught up with you.
   I didn't do nothing.         
I don't know what you're talking about.      
       Stacey, put up that gun  
       and listen. You're sunk. 
    I know it, big boy.         
   I just want you to listen    
 to what this rat's gotta say.  
Remember what happened to Limpy?
     In about two minutes,      
    you're gonna get worse.     
   Honest, Stacey.              
I ain't done a thing.           
   In two minutes, you're gonna 
  get this .38 between the eyes.
   Don't shoot me, Stacey!      
I didn't never snitch on you.   
     I ain't talking about      
      you snitching on me.      
  I'm talking about something   
 I learned from Shake Edwards.  
     No, I don't know nothing.  
 I'm talkin' about you framin'  
     Ross into this joint.      
Honest. We never framed him.    
    [SCREAMS]                   
       Start talking.           
          I can't. I don't know.
          Wait, wait. I'll talk.
 Okay. This is a confession     
     without coaching.          
 And it's gonna spring Ross,    
       so remember it.          
  Okay, canary. Start singing.  
                Who framed Ross?
I did. But I didn't mean nobody to get killed.           
               Quit stalling.   
           Who paid ya to do it?
Hanley and Grayce.              
 How did you frame him?         
              I socked his head.
 Then planted the liquor        
       in the car.              
                           Yeah.
Then started the car and then jumped out.            
Yeah, I did, but I didn't mean  
  to have nobody get killed.    
           [GUNFIRE]            
          Have you heard enough?
Plenty, Stacey. And thanks.     
               Okay, pal.       
       That's just what I hoped.
           [GUNSHOTS]           
          [EXPLOSION]           
           I'm all right, Frank.
Stacey, you can't wash out      
        on me now.              
       I need you.              
I'll get you out of here.       
     I'm going out, pal. My way.
     I wanna tell you something.
           [GUNFIRE]            
   That dame of yours is the one
      that sprung ya, not me.   
           Take care of her.    
            She's worth it.     
         I think I can hold 'em!
  No hurry now, Dale.           
        So long, kid.           
       Now we're even.          
               So long, Stacey. 
  Come on, you. On your feet.   
       Honest, Stacey, honest.  
         It wasn't my fault.    
      I told ya I didn't want   
          anybody killed.       
Get moving.                     
        Where you taking me?    
You didn't think                
I was gonna let you live and welsh on that confession, did ya?                         
           No, no. Let me alone!
               Let me alone!    
         Please, Stacey, please!
           [GUNFIRE]            
             So long, old-timer.
           I guess if you hadn't
          socked me on the chin,
                I'd be laying   
            in the icehouse now,
                 along with Dale
                  and the rest. 
           I-- Gee, I don't know
                what to say.    
     Never mind, Red.           
 You'll be out yourself         
      before long.              
                      Thanks.   
                 So long, Frank.
It oughta make up for what you've gone through in here,    
Ross, to know that it hasn't been in vain.         
The day Stacey came to me and gave himself up,            
I asked him why he was throwing away his freedom.      
I didn't fully understand all he tried to tell me, but it was something about you living the rest of your life for him as he might have lived it himself if he'd had the right breaks when he was a kid.              
        Then he asked me        
  for a photograph of himself.  
          Here it is.           
                   Frank.

Am afraid you overestimate ability of parent.
No, I don't. Now that brother Lee is in the New York art school, I can take his place.
What about me?
I'm as good as you are any day.
Yeah? Well, I've been studying up a lot on crime.
And look, Pop.
I've even had cards printed.
"Bills Also Collected"?
Well, that's just in case
I don't get enough murders.
Bills sometimes more difficult to collect than murder clues.
Yeah, but I know where
I can get a swell office.
Good. Will donate one desk and one hat rack to same.
I'll give you a couple of my old blotters.
I have some nice rubber bands you can have too.
Please, please.
Do not ridicule good intentions of elder brother.
Uh, thanks, Pop.
Now, about that office again.
I don't need a hat rack, but I do need rent money.
As soon as I get a case,
I can start paying you back. And-
Honorable mother-in-law.
Most honorable father-in-law, greetings.
Honorable son-in-law, hello.
- Please partake of humble food?
- No, thank you.
Events of the day have killed all appetite.
I have just taken honorable wife to the maternity hospital.
Oh, my little Ling.
Please, please. Excitement most unnecessary.
Are certain Ling getting best attention?
- Doctor says she reposes most comfortably.
- Why didn't you telephone us?
Doctor says do not clutter hospital with relatives until summoned.
- Telephone will be used as means of signaling family.
- I'm going anyway.
Control self, Mama.
Maybe that's them now.
Hello? Hello?
No! Good-bye!
- What? What?
- Wrong number. They want fish market.
- Get Mama her coat.
- Look, Mama. You have same experience 13 times.
There is no cause to worry.
Then what's worrying you?
You've been a father 13 times too.
Admit same.
But this is first occasion as grandfather.
Uh-
Hello?
Oh.
Boyfriend calling number two daughter.
Wing, I think we go to hospital.
Just as you say, honorable father-in-law.
- Can I go too, Daddy?
- Say, Pop, can we go too?
Hospitals for sick, not playground for healthy.
Please, return to table.
- Aw, gee, Pop, we won't get in the way.
- Come on, Pop.
- Come on. Let's go. Come on, sis.
- Hey, wait till I get my coat.
Hello? Lieutenant Chan?
He just left, but I'll take the message.
This is the Homicide Bureau calling.
Tell him to go aboard the freighter
Susan B. Jennings off Kaena Point.
They just reported a murder.
M-M-Murder?
Yes. Yes, sir.
Jimmy, headquarters just called for Pop to go aboard the freighter Susan B. Jennings!
Somebody was killed by somebody else!
Gee, I'd better hurry and give him the message.
- Wait a minute.
You're lookin' for a case, aren't you?
- Why? What do you mean?
Supposin' we go aboard and handle this ourselves?
Oh, no. It's too risky. Besides, it's Pop's job, and he might get awful sore.
If you solved the case, he couldn't.
Hey, you're throwing over a chance of a lifetime.
Just think. It might be years before you get another murder.
Maybe you're right. Even Pop would have to admit I'm pretty good if I solve a homicide.
Sure! And then he'll have to get you that office.
- By golly, I'll do it.
- Let's go!
Oh, wait a minute.
You're not goin'. You're too young.
What? Say, who told you about this case anyway?
You stay here and answer the phone.
That's what all good assistants do.
I'll see you later.
I still can't believe that man was murdered right before my eyes.
And you're sure you don't know who he is?
I never saw him before he came aboard this ship a half hour ago.
Did you see the boat that brought him alongside, Mr. Randolph?
It was just an ordinary shore boat.
After he got aboard, it headed back to Honolulu.
- Where is the body now?
- I had it taken below, sir.
Well, that's all we can do until the police come aboard.
I don't see why this had to happen on my ship.
Now we may be tied up here for days.
That means we lose cargoes all along the line.
Small boat on the port side signaling to come aboard, sir.
That would be the police.
- All right. Take it easy, buddy.
- We got ya.
- There you are.
- Honolulu Police.
- My name's Chan.
- Not Charlie Chan?
- Well, uh-
- Why, I've heard about you from Singapore to Sweden.
I'm Captain Johnson.
Glad to meet you.
- Thanks. But you see-
- I know. You wanna get right to work, eh?
Funny thing about you.
I thought you'd be older.
- You've had a lot of experience for a young fella.
- Yeah.
Now I want to question the witnesses.
And then I'd like to see the corpus delicti.
- You know, for clues and things.
- Oh, yes, yes.
By the way, how many passengers do you carry?
Just six.
This is a freighter, you know.
There's one of our passengers now.
Dr. Cardigan, Mr. Chan.
A deep pleasure, Mr. Ham.
- Not Ham- Chan.
- Oh, Clam. So sorry.
- The doctor is a little deaf.
- Oh.
- The doctor is a little deaf.
- Oh.
Your pituitary glands are very prominent.
I shall have to talk with you later.
Good day, Mr. Clam.
I think the doc's also a little nuts.
This way.
How long do we have to wait, Pop?
Pop, where do storks find babies?
Mama, please. Be calm like me.
- There's the baby now.
- Let me see, Pop. Is it a boy?
Wrong flavor.
- Shh.
- Excuse please.
Can give approximate time of grandchild arrival?
Well, your guess is as good as mine,
Mr. Chan.
Might be five minutes from now, or it might be five hours.
Oh, uh, where is telephone?
- Down the hall to your right.
- Uh, thank you.
- Any report from Lieutenant Chan?
- No, sir.
But the freighter radioed in he boarded her a half hour ago.
I see.
Honolulu Police, Homicide Bureau.
Oh, hello, Charlie.
Hold on.
Lieutenant Chan now, Inspector.
This is Rawlins, Charlie.
How's everything going?
Very slow.
Will be detained longer than expected.
- Well, have you got any clues yet?
- Am not sure.
But intuition and five dollars say it will be boy.
Boy? What do you mean? Say, are you aboard the freighter Susan B. Jennings?
No, sir.
Am on board maternity hospital.
What, again? Listen, Charlie.
We called you an hour ago.
The ship radioed a murder case just as they rounded Kaena Point.
Have heard nothing of same!
What? Wh-Why, they reported you boarding them 30 minutes ago.
Would appear someone impersonating humble self.
You get out to that ship as soon as you can.
Pick up a couple of men at the harbor.
Yes, sir.
Mama! Mama!
Now, Miss Hayes, Captain Johnson says that you're the only witness to the actual murder.
- Is that true?
- Yes, as far as I know.
At least, I was the closest one.
Please tell me all you know.
Two weeks ago, the attorney I work for in Shanghai called me into his office... and told me I was to sail the following day on this boat for Honolulu.
He also gave me a package I was to deliver to a certain person when I arrived here.
- What was in the package?
Gosh!
I mean, uh, that's a lot of money.
That's the amount all right. Miss Hayes had me keep it in my safe until this afternoon.
What did you do with it then?
I waited on deck until this man came aboard from a small boat.
- I thought you said you didn't know him.
- I didn't.
When he gave me the ring,
I knew he was the man to give the money to.
- Wedding ring?
- Yes. Here it is.
- I was told he would give it to me as a receipt.
- What happened then?
Just as I was about to give him the package, l- I heard a shot.
He looked at me for a moment, you know, kind of surprised-like.
And then he fell to the deck.
I-
I don't know what I did then.
I guess I fainted. And that's all I know.
My chief officer, Mr. Randolph, was the first to reach the body.
I got there a few seconds later.
- Who has the money now?
- I have it. It's locked in my cabin.
- Would you like to see the body, Mr. Chan?
- Yes, please.
- But first take me to the spot where the shooting occurred.
- All right.
Follow me.
- What are you doing here?
- You'll have to talk a little louder.
You evidently had no trouble hearing what was going on in there.
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you, Mrs. Wayne.
But as a fellow passenger,
I feel I must give you a word of warning.
A murder has been committed aboard this ship.
And I should be very careful what I said.
Oh.
I don't know much more about Miss Hayes than you do... but her story sounds fishy to me.
I'll check on her after
I've seen the rest of the passengers.
There he is, cold as a mackerel.
Wh-What was that?
- Oh, nothing. Just Oscar. Nothing to worry about.
- J-J-Just Oscar?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
I wish you'd hurry up. I'd like to get this case washed up as quickly as possible.
I have to unload cargo and clear port before tomorrow.
Say, there's not a bit of identification on this man. Look.
Even the tailor's label's been torn out.
Why, that's funny. Somebody must've gotten in this cabin after he was brought here.
I think we'd better get up on deck.
Hogan, what's the matter with you?
There's a ghost in there scaring my poor animals to death.
- Ghost?
- Have you been hitting that bottle again?
This ghost never came out of a bottle.
Oscar saw it and roared like he was crazy... and I woke up-
- Just in time to see it go by-
- Just like that.
- What did it look like?
- You know.
Just like a- a ghost.
What have you got animals on the ship for?
I'm takin' them to a Frisco zoo.
It will be a great day when I get rid of them and you too.
Go in there now and quiet 'em down.
Not me. Not with a live ghost.
Wait a minute, Captain!
This ghost might be the murderer we're after.
Murderer?
Who-
Who's that?
That's the man who was murdered.
Listen to them poor, dumb beasts.
They can't reason like us. I tell you-
Aw, bilge water!
Let's find out about this thing. Go on.
Yes, sir. I'm goin'.
- Hogan!
- C-C-C-Coming.
Hogan! Now where is this ghost you're talking about?
Over in that vicinity.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- I see nothing wrong here.
- You will.
What's the matter?
Oh, uh, nothing.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
What's the matter?
- D-Did you see him?
- There's a lion loose!
- That's just Oscar.
- Oscar?
Oscar, what are you doing?
What's the matter with you?
Get up there on that bed.
Come on! Get a move on.
That's the stuff. Step on it.
Get a move on there.
Come on. A little pep there.
Get along. Get up on that bed.
That's the idea.
Why don't you put that lion in a cage where he belongs?
- If I do, I'll go in there with him.
- Oh, I've had enough of this.
- You've had enough?
- If you want me, I'll be up on the bridge.
That won't be necessary.
- A-Are you sure you saw a ghost?
- Unmistakably.
Don't you suppose I know-
Look!
Th-There it is n-n-now!
- Come on!
- Oh, no. Not me.
Whoever's in that locker, come out with your hands up.
- Uh, hello.
- Gosh!
I thought it was-
Say, what are you doin' here?
- Well, you see, l-
- Now you get off this ship before something happens to you.
- But, gee, I wanted to-
- Don't you realize there's a murderer at large?
- Sure! And I know who it is!
- Who?
- The guy with the thick glasses.
- Oh, you mean Dr. Cardigan.
- Yeah. He's been chasin' me all over the ship.
- He has?
What was that?
Oh, just Oscar.
He's a lion.
Lion? G-G-Gosh.
I wish Pop was here.
Yeah, so do I. Say, what's the matter?
Don't you think I can handle this case?
- Yes, but just the same, l-
- Chan?
- Hey, get in there quick. I got work to do.
- Can I help?
Of course not.
This is a man's job.
- I've got part of the crew on deck.
- Okay. Fine.
Say, pardon me for giving you any advice, but you better go easy on these boys.
- Why?
- They were off duty, and I had to wake 'em up for you.
They're not in a very good humor, and some of'em are pretty tough eggs.
- But I guess you know your business okay.
- Yeah.
I'll leave you here with the crew while I round up the passengers.
Thanks.
What's your name?
What's your name please?
Stanislaw Wzdkapopocusky.
Stanislaw W-
We'll skip that.
- Were you a witness to the murder this morning?
- Nay.
Oh.
What about you?
Can't any of you speak English?
Yeah, buddy.
/ can.
Swell.
What do you know about the murder?
Nothin'.
Doesn't anybody know anything?
Hey, pipe down, all of you.
This is one of our passengers, Detective Arnold of the San Francisco Police. Mr. Chan.
Glad to know you, Mr. Arnold.
- Yeah? What's your racket?
- Uh, why, uh-
- This guy's a phony.
- Wh-What do you mean?
I've seen plenty of pictures of Charlie Chan... and this chump don't look any more like him than I do.
- How about that?
- I-I-I can explain everything.
I oughta pinch you for impersonating an officer of the law.
- But, uh-
- Beat it before / change my mind.
Say the word, sir. We'll put him ashore.
- Go to it.
- Pop!
Pop! Pop! Pop! Let me down!
- One moment please!
- Hold it, men!
Pop!
Gee, I'm sure glad you came.
Honolulu Police frown on choking bay with bodies.
What in thunder is going on?
Come on, you men. Get down to your quarters.
- Mr. Randolph-
- Come on, men. Break it up.
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Chan, Honolulu Police.
Lieutenant Chan?
Well, then who's this young squirt?
Young squirt merely chip masquerading as block.
Explain presence on board.
Well, headquarters called just after you left.
/ knew you were worried and had a lot on your mind.
So I thought I'd handle the case myself.
I was making headway too!
Hmm.
Making headway towards ship rail.
- Am most sorry for delay in investigation, Captain.
- So am I.
I suppose you want to start at the beginning and see the body too.
I've already examined it, Pop.
There's no identification on it.
Nevertheless, will make own examination.
- Meanwhile, you will question crew.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse please.
How many passengers on ship?
- I asked that question too, Pop. There are six.
- Oh, very clever.
There's one now.
Dr. Cardigan.
But you'll get nowhere questioning him, Pop.
He's deaf as a post.
- Deaf?
- Yes.
Thank you so much.
- When money talk, few are deaf.
- Yeah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
My buck.
- Pop!
- What's going on here?
I caught this youngster climbin' over the cages like a monkey... and scarin' my animals half to death.
- Who is he?
- Number five son.
- What? Another? Are there any more?
- Nine more.
At home, I hope.
Will explain unwelcome presence here?
- Uh, I came with Jimmy.
- Yeah, but l- I didn't know about it.
He stowed away.
Honest, Pop. I told him to stay home.
- Now, if you ask me-
- Nobody's askin' you.
Go below with your monkeys where you belong.
Just as I thought.
"Familiararity" breeds attempt.
You'll have to carry on alone.
- I've listened to enough of this tommyrot.
- Thank you so much.
Holokai.
- You will take fugitive from apron strings ashore.
- Yes, sir.
But I've got good news for you, Pop.
I know who the murderer is.
- Who?
- That man over there.
He's been chasing me all over the ship.
He's dangerous, Pop.
- Oh, don't worry. Will keep watchful eye on same.
- Okay.
Good-bye.
- Take me to murder victim.
- All right, Pop.
This is the man she was supposed to deliver the money to... and there's not a mark of identification on him.
- Except that he was married man.
- How do you figure that out?
Observe, please. Indentation on fourth finger most often indicate wedding ring.
Wedding ring?
Gosh, I almost forgot.
When he came aboard to get the money, he gave this to Miss Hayes as identification.
Engraving say, "E.H. To R.H."
Listen, Pop, I'll check those initials against the names on the passenger list and-
What's that?
Pardon me, gentlemen. I thought this cabin was occupied only by the corpse.
Sorry to disappoint.
One moment, please.
Will explain strange interest in corpse?
I am Dr. Cardigan, a specialist in psychiatry.
Have humble impression psychiatry of no value... when brain cease to function.
But who are we to know the line of separation?
The transition is often gradual and mysterious.
Sometimes the retina of the eye...
may even retain the image last seen before death.
Have already examined eyes of victim.
Really?
Stop!
Please, remove hand from table.
I'm afraid you're overly suspicious of me... since discovering my pretended deafness.
You see, I'm writing a book on psychology... and my little deception gave me an advantage in observing the people around me.
I compliment you on your alertness.
Most unnecessary.
A quality unfortunately not shared by your son.
Of course, he's strictly a glandular case, but an interesting one.
Young man suffer from overdeveloped impulses and underdeveloped control.
A very clear diagnosis.
We must visit again sometime and compare notes.
Regret not being present on your first visit here.
- What do you mean?
- Button found on floor.
Obviously divorced from coat.
Thank you.
Good night, gentlemen.
Say, Pop.
If he's been here before... maybe he's the one who removed everything from the body.
- Quite possible.
- Say, did you really look in the dead man's eyes?
- Yes.
- What did you see?
- Merely twin image of humble self.
- Oh.
And that's all there is, Mr. Chan.
It's just as I told it to your son.
What is name of attorney for whom you deliver money?
- Mr. John Emory of Shanghai.
- And name of client?
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you that.
Don't hold out on anything.
This is serious!
But I really don't know.
I'm just a secretary to Mr. Emory.
My job was only to deliver the money.
Miss Hayes seems rather upset.
Why don't you let her rest for a while?
She told me her whole story before you came aboard... and I think I can answer any further questions.
Dear Officer Randolph is always so interested in Miss Hayes.
It seems this tropical climate affects some people that way.
Of course, /'m not criticizing his romantic tendencies.
What right have you to say that?
Merely that I think your sympathies are misdirected... when they're placed with a woman suspected of murder.
One moment please.
Can explain own presence on ship?
Have I not the right to travel wherever I wish?
Quite true.
But most strange that lady of evident wealth choose humble freighter for same.
Well, if you must know, l- I wanted quiet and rest. I recently became a widow.
So sorry.
- Also regret marriage very unhappy.
- What do you mean?
Absence of wedding ring denote lack of affection for deceased husband.
Well, l- I was suing for divorce.
May I go now?
Can give no further testimony on murder case?
None at all. I was resting in my cabin when I heard the shot fired.
But that isn't true! Why, you were one of the first on deck after the murder.
If you're trying to imply that I know anything more than I've said... you're wasting your time.
You're wasting your time.
Mr. Randolph, you were first on scene of crime?
- Yes, sir.
- Then perhaps can settle present disagreement?
- Why, I, uh-
- Mr. Randolph, you're wanted on the bridge, sir.
- The ship is approaching her berth.
- Excuse me please.
May I be excused too?
For present.
Will continue investigation later.
Pop, these are the last two passengers.
Mr. McCoy and Detective Arnold of the San Francisco Police.
So happy to meet honorable colleague.
Hiya, Mr. Chan. Seems like I know you,
I've seen your picture so many times.
Not in rogue's gallery, I hope.
No, on the front pages.
Incidentally, I'm breaking into print myself.
Here's the baby who did it for me.
The chief sent me over to Shanghai to pick him up.
He broke out ofjail awaitin'sentence on a murder.
We got a tip he was in China, so / hopped over the extradition papers.
Gee, Pop, if this man's an escaped criminal-
Don't get any smart ideas, sonny-boy.
I got nothing to do with this job.
That's right.
Don't worry about him.
We were playing pinochle in our cabin when the guy was shot.
But don't you put handcuffs on him or something?
Listen, brother. I can't swim, and I ain't never tried to fly.
So how am / gonna lam off this tub?
Besides, this flatfoot hangs around me like ivy on a prison wall.
Always cracking jokes.
The boys'll love him back at the big house.
By the way, Charlie, what do you think of this killing?
Opinion like tea leaf in hot water.
Both need time for brewing.
He's terrific!
Yeah.
Mr. Chan! The money, it's gone.
I had it locked in my trunk.
Mr. Chan, it was $300,000.
I've got to get it back! What shall I do?
I hope you're about finished here,
Mr. Chan.
We've just docked, and a gang of stevedores will be on board any minute.
So sorry. Must request no one attempt to board or leave ship.
Now just a minute.
My company can't afford to have a shipload of freight tied up just because some fool was shot.
You take these people ashore and solve your mystery.
- I'm clearing out of this port tomorrow.
- Contradiction please.
After case cleared, ship do likewise.
- You can count on me for any help you need, Charlie.
- Thank you.
- Have officers posted on all gangways.
- Okay, Pop.
Please take me to cabin.
Get outta here.
Now remember. Stop anyone who tries to come aboard and make sure nobody gets off.
Say, what's the matter with you?
Those are Pop's orders, not mine.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- What's the idea, holdin' up work?
- Orders are orders.
Just move it.
- Is it connected now?
- Yes, sir.
Just a moment, Mrs. Wayne.
You can't go ashore.
I've got to get ashore.
I have a very important call to make.
- I'm sorry.
- We've just had a telephone line connected to the ship.
You'll find it in the captain's quarters.
Oh, Mr. Randolph.
- You men go ahead. I'll be right with you.
- Yes, sir.
- I've got to get ashore.
- You'll have to speak to Mr. Chan.
- He gave the orders.
- Yes, I know all about that.
But you can fix it for me.
Now, I'm afraid you're wrong,
Mrs. Wayne.
I can't interfere with the police, and I wouldn't if I could.
Just a moment.
Perhaps I can change your mind for you.
I saw you give a gun toJudy Hayes just before the murder.
You can't prove that.
No, maybe not.
But it'll be very interesting to try.
- Now will you help me get ashore?
- No!
Trunk bears no evidence of forced opening. Lock is intact.
Miss Hayes, you are certain money was in trunk?
Yes, and it was locked, and I had the keys with me. Say, you don't suspect me?
You had reason for not returning same to captain's custody?
Well, I suppose I should have, but after the murder, I thought it would be safer here.
After all, I'm responsible for it.
Oh, Mr. Chan, you must find it!
Also imperative for own reputation to do same.
Come in.
Well, here I am, Charlie.
Got McCoy all tucked away for the night, and I'm at your service.
So happy.
So this is the trunk they lifted the dough out of, eh?
Find any fingerprints?
Many, but all smudged.
Oh. How about her?
You think she's on the up-and-up?
Look here, Mr. Arnold.
/'ve met your kind before. You're not-
I'll bet you have. You wouldn't be the first dame in the world to fall for heavy sugar.
If you don't need me, I'll go on deck.
Have already been most helpful.
Thank you so much.
Attaboy. Just a little further now.
There we are.
Now there's the gangplank.
Now, just turn to the right. That a boy.
That's the stuff.
Just keep on goin', Oscar.
Hey, not so fast.
Where do you think you're goin'?
Stand aside, boys.
Oscar needs fresh air and-
Exercise.
Oscar?
Hey, nobody goes ashore,
Hogan, and that includes you.
Listen, Oscar's gotta have a lit-
Aah!
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss.
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss.
Here, puss.
Here, puss, puss.
Here, puss, puss, puss.
Oscar!
Come on. Come down!
Will you come down?
Come on, you son of a gun!
Oscar, will you come down out of there?
Oh, okay. Okay.
Hey, what's the idea?
Stop that girl! Stop that girl!
Say, what's going on?
Get a move on.
Attaboy.
Really, gentlemen, you'll find nothing more illegal here... than the two bars of soap
I purloined from a Shanghai hotel.
Did we ask you?
- Must search all rooms.
- What's in this thing?
- Let that alone!
- What are you so worried about, Doc?
Don't move it!
You'll ruin everything.
- Oh, yeah?
- I'll open it.
/f your clumsy snooping has disrupted my apparatus, /'ll-
No, it's all right.
It's still alive.
What's alive?
A human brain.
Excuse please.
You say brain now alive?
Yes. After years of work,
I alone have achieved the impossible.
It has lived in that liquid for six months.
Whose brain please?
That of Chang Ho Ping, the famous Chinese murderer.
You see, I experiment only with the criminal brain.
I have some beautiful specimens at home.
You mean to say you got more of'em?
That you live with them things?
Hey, how did you get a living brain?
That, my dear sir, is a secret... which will be fully revealed in the book I am now writing- a work that will revolutionize the entire present treatment of criminals.
The surgeon's knife rather than a prison cell is my solution of crime.
Someday, / shall build a magnificent laboratory... and call it the Crime Clinic, and then-
Excuse please.
Much money required... to make such dream become reality.
- I have already obtained all I need.
- So happy.
- Let's get out of here.
- Thank you so much.
Oh, pardon me.
Your friend, Mr. McCoy-
What sentence is he returning to?
A hundred and 10 years, countin' time off for good behavior.
Oh, what a pity.
I'd hoped for an execution.
That's too bad.
Good night, gentlemen.
Hey, you gonna let this guy run around loose?
Let's lock him up with McCoy.
Most inadvisable for Mr. McCoy's sake.
- Good night.
- Yeah.
- Well, what's next, Charlie?
- Interview Mr. McCoy.
McCoy? Say, you ain't suspicious of him, are ya?
Nah. That's a cold lead, Charlie.
Why, he even bunks with me.
Making bedfellow of serpent no guarantee against snakebite.
Huh?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Say, Doc, do you mind lookin' me over?
I think I cracked my head open, what with one thing and another.
A pleasure.
- Take a seat, won't you?
- Thank you, sir.
- You say you're having trouble with your head?
- Yes, Doc.
Everything seems to be goin' dark all the time.
Not exactly a criminal formation.
- Oh, no, no.
- More the subnormal.
Uh, yes, that's what I thought.
How old are you?
I make it 37.
Yes, just as I thought.
A rare case of arrested development.
Say, Doc... that won't c-c-curl my hair, will it?
No, it's quite harmless.
Just relax.
M-M-Maybe-
Maybe there ain't nothing the matter with me at all.
Maybe all I need is a- a drink.
I'm afraid I have nothing here but pure alcohol... in which I prepare my brains.
You and me both, Doc.
W-W-W-W-What's that?
Oh.
Come here, and I'll show you.
That's my brain.
I can't understand it.
I locked him in just like always.
He must have slid out that porthole.
Contradiction please.
Porthole locked on inside.
Yeah. Wait'll I get my hands on that stir-bug.
I'll teach him he can't pull a sneak-out on me.
Wait.
Trying to take a powder on me, eh?
I was upstairs gettin' a little fresh air.
It's kind of stuffy in here.
Please explain possession of door key.
Why, uh, I lifted it out of Arnold's pocket.
Oh, no, you didn't.
Double-crossing me after the way I've treated ya!
Sorry, Charlie. They don't often get away from me. Now, where did you get that key?
Pop! Pop!
Gee, Pop, I've been lookin' all over for you.
- Judy Hayes is gone.
- You mean escaped?
Yeah. I was keepin' watch just like you said... when Hogan comes along with his lion-
Never mind lion.
How long ago lady escape?
I don't know just how long, Pop,
'cause I was almost unconscious!
Have suspected same since birth.
Say, maybe the dame took the dough ashore with her.
Will soon find out.
Hey, you gotta sock me that hard?
You loosened up my wisdom tooth.
Pull another boner like that,
I'll loosen up that thick skull of yours.
No one's gonna get wise.
You're acting just like a dick.
- Sometimes you got me believing it.
- Listen, this Chan guy is no sap.
And if he ever gets hip that I'm Mike Hannigan, they're gonna start looking for Arnold's body.
That's when I wind up in the hot seat... with you sittin' right in my lap.
- Police headquarters.
- Gosh, Pop, it wasn't my fault.
- I was on the job.
- Inspector Rawlins, please.
- You've gotta believe me, it was Oscar the lion that-
- Quiet. Quiet.
Hello.
Yes, Charlie.
Speaking.
She did?
How did that happen?
Unfortunate combination of Oscar the lion and number two son.
I don't get the connection, but I do know this is putting us on the spot.
The owners of that freighter are on my neck because we're keeping their ship tied up.
And now, you let a suspect get away!
Mr. Chan, I have an urgent call from the hospital. Will you take it?
Thank you.
Hold line, Inspector.
Hello?
Honorable father-in-law?
Yes.
- Say, who is this?
- Your son-in-law.
I haven't got any son-in-law!
Get off this line.
Ling is resting most peacefully, but has great desire for watermelon.
Why call me concerning melon?
You told me to report to you each hour.
I don't want any watermelon.
This is the police department. Hello!
Charlie, somebody's trying to cut in on us.
Now just give me the description and name of that fugitive.
We have chosen several names.
Lotus, Cherry, Lung if it's a boy-
Am hoping for boy, but-
I thought you said it was a girl?
We don't know yet.
Name is Judy Hayes.
Five feet 5 inches tall.
Please get watermelon and get off line.
- What?
- No, not you, Inspector.
Mr. Chan, they've just found Miss Hayes.
They're bringing her in here now.
This officer says you were looking for me, Mr. Chan.
Say, I can't hear anything!
Now, give me that description again.
So sorry.
Description unnecessary, Inspector.
Fugitive now present.
- Honest, Pop, she did leave the ship.
I saw her go.
- He's right.
I did go ashore. And when I came back, this officer picked me up at the gangway.
I guess that settles it. It's obvious to me she sneaked the money ashore with her.
You can think what you wish.
The money's stolen.
- Then why did you go ashore?
- I've got myself to protect.
I wanted to phone my employer,
Mr. Emory in Shanghai.
Did you tell Mr. Chan about the gun
Mr. Randolph gave you this afternoon?
- How did you know?
- Please.
Gosh, Pop! The same caliber gun that the murderer used.
One shell discharged.
- I never fired it.
- The gun's mine, Mr. Chan.
I fired it several days ago at a shark following the ship.
Please explain why young lady carry same.
Miss Hayes told me about an appointment she had...
- with a stranger whom she expected to come aboard.
- I asked for the gun.
That was a lot of money / was handing over, and / was pretty nervous.
Why didn't you tell Mr. Chan about the gun, if it's all so innocent?
It slipped my mind until you reminded me of it... and threatened to tell the police unless I got you ashore.
What was urgency of shore visit please?
That's my business.
So grateful for cooperation.
That is all for present.
But any further attempt to leave ship will cause immediate arrest.
- Oh, Captain?
- Yes.
You offered me a brandy right after lunch today. Might I have it now?
You certainly may.
I need one myself.
Have Ballistics check approximate time gun last fired.
Also, get report from telephone company on Miss Hayes' Shanghai call.
Yes, sir.
Gosh. Things are sure poppin' now.
What's our next move?
For you, towards home.
Oh, gee, Pop, don't be like that.
I've been on this case from the start, and I want to stay on it.
Please let me stay.
I've gotta make a reputation for myself... or I'll never get any clients.
Now, if you'll only let me explain my idea.
Make short and most snappy please.
Well, of course it's okay to check the gun and Miss Hayes' phone call... but we still don't know why
Mrs. Wayne wanted to go ashore.
Maybe she was trying to get away with the money.
Already contemplate search of lady's cabin.
Then I'm going with you, 'cause I thought of it too and a lot of other things.
You won't be sorry you let me stay, Pop.
You know, two heads are better than one?
Come on, Pop.
- Judy.
- Yes?
Why don't you come clean about this whole thing?
I mean, at least to me.
What are you talking about?
After you left the ship,
I searched your cabin because, well... l-I didn't want the police to find anything there that might hurt you.
- What could be there that would hurt me?
- This.
It was hidden in a torn life preserver.
There's $10,000 in it.
Why, that's part of the stolen money.
Where's the rest of it?
- How should I know?
- George.
- You don't think I stole my own money, do you?
- Everybody does.
- What's the use of kidding yourself?
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
If I took the money ashore, you don't think
I'd be stupid enough to leave this behind?
- That's what I couldn't figure out.
- Well, I can.
This money was planted in my cabin after I left the ship.
It was a beautiful little piece of framing, and I think I know who did it.
- Oh.
- This is an unexpected pleasure, Mrs. Wayne.
Well, l- I must have made a mistake.
This is not my cabin.
There are no mistakes.
This is Miss Hayes' cabin, and you know it.
Miss Hayes?
Then what are you doing here?
- The same as you are.
- I don't like your insinuations, Doctor.
- Let me out of here.
- I didn't invite you here.
But since you've come, there are one or two questions you can answer.
We'd better hurry before
Mrs. Wayne walks in on us.
- Did you find anything yet, Pop?
- Much money.
- Huh?
- But all invested in underwear.
Oh.
"R.H. To E.H."
Gee, Pop. The same initials as on the dead man's ring.
Must compliment sparrow with eye of eagle.
- Mrs. Wayne said that-
- But she's not Mrs. Wayne!
This proves she was traveling under an assumed name.
Say, I'll bet she was the murdered man's sweetheart.
- Or wife.
- That's right.
She was getting a divorce.
- No, she said she was a widow.
- Lady was speaking truth.
She became widow today.
Boy, is she gonna have plenty to explain.
Let's go, Pop.
Pop!
It's Mrs. Wayne.
- Is she-
- Strangled by scarf.
Gosh, that's awful.
Now I don't know where we stand.
I figured Mrs. Wayne killed her husband, but now somebody goes and kills her.
- Look for pair scissors.
- Scissors?
- Is she stabbed too?
- No.
Only want to cut scarf from neck.
Say, Pop, this is Judy Hayes' cabin.
I wonder what Mrs. Wayne was doing here?
They didn't act very friendly.
I wonder what Mrs. Wayne was doing here?
They didn't act very friendly.
Gee, but I'd hate to think Miss Hayes killed her.
- What was that? Somebody was listening.
- Wait!
Caution very good life insurance.
I've been over this tub from stem to stern... and there ain't a sign of that dough anyplace.
- Did you find anything, Charlie?
- Yes.
Something concerning Mrs. Wayne.
Mrs. Wayne? I thought there was something phony about that woman.
And that Cardigan guy is another one.
Now, I ask you, Charlie... is it natural for the guy to travel around with a jug full of brains?
Most unusual.
You've had men aboard the Susan B. Jennings all night... and as far as I know, the only thing they've caught is a lion!
There is no time schedule for solving a crime, Mr. Peabody.
But there is for running cargo boats, Inspector.
As representative of the owners,
I'm giving you their final word.
If our ship is held up here another day, we're suing the city.
Get me the Susan B. Jennings.
I'll see what's going on out there.
- Yes?
- I want to speak to Lieutenant Chan.
I can't get him now.
My ship is on fire!
- What?
- What's the matter?
- The ship's on fire!
- It's on fire? Why, it can't be!
Hello. Hello!
Captain Johnson! Hello!
I'm disconnected. Hello! Hello-
Captain Johnson! Hello!
Bring your fire hose forward!
Cover your hatches aft!
Make fast to starboard port!
Stand by your stations, you men!
Get all the passengers on deck.
- Aye.
- And man that number two hose.
- Come on, men!
- Close all the fire doors!
- How bad is it?
- We don't know yet. Stay on deck.
This way, men!
- Where's Pop?
- I don't know. I gotta get McCoy out of here!
Mac!
He's gone!
McCoy! Mac!
- What have you got in here?
- Stay away from this case.
- You'll have to tell me what's in it.
- My living brain.
- Your living brain?
- Yes, and keep your hands off.
Come on, you men, with that hose!
It's down here in one of these starboard cabins. Bring your hose this way.
Come on, men!
Don't go in there, Captain.
It's a raging inferno!
Well, what do you think I'm looking for?
Get out of my way!
Come on, men!
Let her go.
Cut off your hose!
What kind of a gag is this?
- Unlike old adage, much smoke, but no fire.
- Smells like gasoline, sir.
If this is another one of your tricks-
Interruption please. Only connection with blaze was to extinguish same.
Then who did start it?
Have not yet identified culprit.
Well, if you can't find out, I will.
Quiet the passengers, and turn off the alarm.
- I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
- Aye, sir.
Gee, Pop, now who'd wanna start a fire in a bathtub?
I-I must have dropped them.
Please explain reason for arson attempt.
Well, I started it to make the murderer think it was a real fire... so that he'd grab the money and try to leave the ship.
Then I'd nab him.
It was a trick you once tried, Pop.
- Remember?
- Idea excellent.
But bait only good if fish bite on same.
But somebody did.
I saw Dr. Cardigan dragging a big box out of his stateroom.
He said there was a living brain inside, and-
Look out!
Thank you so much.
Gee, Pop!
Let's get out of here!
Hey, what's the idea?
Ship's on fire!
Hey, what are you doin' there?
- Did you hear that shot?
- Shut up, all of you!
- I have enough trouble without all this yammering.
- Excuse please.
- We heard a shot. Sounded like it came from here.
- Captain-
Own ears detect sound of same gunshot.
Come on, come on, before you get hurt!
Go on, get down there.
- What is the meaning of this, Mr. Randolph?
- There's your man.
I caught him trying to go over the side with this.
Gee, Pop!
The stolen money!
Yes, it is, Captain Johnson.
It is my money.
Please explain possession of same.
- I just found it, that's all.
- Saw him take it out of a lifeboat.
He's probably had it hidden there ever since he took it from Miss Hayes' room.
You're all wet!
I just happened to find it.
And I'd like to know who wouldn't try to cop a sneak with his hooks on 300 grand.
There's no doubt about it.
He's our man.
- All right, Mr. Chan, make your arrest.
- You can't touch me.
- I'm in his custody.
- And that's where you're staying from now on!
- May examine key, please?
- Certainly.
- Thank you so much.
- Hey, give me that key. What's the idea?
Idea is both you and confederate are under arrest.
Hey, you can't arrest me.
I'm Detective Arnold!
Contradiction please.
You are Mike Hannigan...
for whom San Francisco Police search most diligently.
What are you talkin' about?
Where do you get that cockeyed dope?
Reward circular with photographic likeness... arrive by clipper plane from San Francisco yesterday.
Body of real Detective Arnold, murdered by these men... recovered from Yangtze River in China 10 days ago.
Pretty smart stuff pretending to have McCoy in your custody... so that the both of you could use my ship to make your getaway to the States.
Captain! Captain! Mr. Chan!
Say, there's somethin' funny going on on board this ship.
As if I hadn't enough trouble with ghosts... somebody drops this cannon down the ventilator.
Please. Gun fired in last five minutes.
Two shells discharged.
- Now you've got your evidence.
- Not so fast there, Captain.
That gun don't belong to me.
Here's mine.
- One moment.
- And that gun hasn't been fired.
Look at it.
Mr. Chan, will you take these men out of here and settle this case ashore?
You have your murderers and your evidence.
Now, I've gotta get this cargo unloaded.
So sorry.
Cargo must wait.
But why?
What more proof do you want?
Proof of fingerprints on discharged gun.
You will in 10 minutes, please... have all passengers assembled at your cabin.
- Well, all right.
- Thank you so much.
Dr. Cardigan.
As student of criminal psychology... would perhaps lend noted talents to final experiment?
I should be very happy to do so.
Please, run thread underneath blotter through hole.
Now, please remain where you are, Mr. Chan.
It would seem that a certain theory of mine was correct.
Detectives as well as murderers invariably make one fatal mistake.
You should not have let this gun remain on the desk behind your back.
Am aware of mistake.
We all make them.
I made one by turning around when you dropped that coin to test my deafness.
I found it annoying, but I feel better now.
Then prepare for relapse.
Took precaution to remove bullets.
So that explains your lack of nervous reaction.
Just another experiment that has produced nothing.
Contradiction please.
Has produced one high-class set of much desired fingerprints.
What's he bringing us up here now for?
- Let's get this over with in a hurry.
- Will do humble best.
- Sit down, Judy.
- Oh, thank you.
Please, will everybody make selves most comfortable?
Miss Hayes, entire amount of fortune intact... when recovered from light-fingered gentleman?
Why-Why, yes.
Are positive $10,000 not missing?
What do you mean?
Paper money band indicate theft.
Very clever questioning, Mr. Chan.
Then provide clever answer.
Found money band in your cabin.
- Explain please.
- I'm sorry. I can't explain that.
Somebody did take $10,000 of that money and hid it in Miss Hayes' cabin.
They were trying to frame her, and / think-
Say, where's Mrs. Wayne?
Sorry.
Must conduct inquiry without her.
What?
She's in it as much as the rest of us.
Let Mr. Chan handle this.
Mrs. Wayne had no connection with this case.
Excuse please.
You experience great friendship for absent lady?
Why, not especially, no.
Then please explain why you permit her to travel under assumed name.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Have reason to believe opposite.
May examine lady's passport?
Surely.
There you are.
I don't want you to misunderstand this... but she told me she was very nervous and very worried...
and she was just getting a divorce, and she wanted to travel quietly.
I saw no reason to refuse her request.
I-
Most understandable.
Passport give lady's real name as Hillman.
Passport give lady's real name as Hillman.
- Hillman? Why, that was-
- Name of murdered man?
Why, uh, yes.
Did not know Mrs. Wayne was wife of same?
No. All I know is I was supposed to bring the money to him.
Please explain complete nature of errand.
I can't.
It was confidential business.
You'd better talk, Miss Hayes.
It's bound to come out sooner or later.
They were getting a divorce.
He wanted the money out of China... to avoid a property settlement.
Leave her alone!
Get Mrs. Wayne or Hillman... whatever her name is, up here and make her explain!
Regret impossibility.
Unfortunate lady murdered.
- Murdered?
- Who killed her?
I told you there was somethin' funny going on.
An unusually interesting case,
Mr. Chan.
Two murders, and not a single witness.
Contradiction please.
Have one silent witness.
Murder gun with fingerprints of criminal reposing on handle...
most likely duplicate of same fingerprints now in this room.
Are you going to fingerprint all of us?
All except Dr. Cardigan... who already kindly donate own fingerprints.
- You have ink pad?
- Sure, Pop.
Hello. Who?
Who? Oh, we're busy.
Call back later.
Hello! What's that?
Wing Foo?
- I never heard of him. I don't know.
- No, please. For me.
- Hello?
- Honorable father-in-law?
- Yes.
- I wish to report that Ling is very restless.
So is prospective grandparent.
Stork evidently fly wrong course to Honolulu.
Ling has lost all desire for watermelon and now demands gumdrops.
- Wing Foo, Doctor says to come quick!
- Excuse me!
I'm about to become a father!
Good-bye!
Tell her to wait for me!
Be there in 15 minutes! Hello!
Hello!
Who-Who-Who did that?
- Turn on those lights!
- Hey, you guys!
- I got him, Pop! I got him!
- You got who?
- Come on! Get in there!
- Mr. Chan, the gun is gone!
Am aware of same.
- What a break for somebody.
- Now you never can prove who the murderer was.
Correction please.
Murderer identified self.
Is now safely imprisoned.
- Imprisoned?
- Where?
Inside camera.
Guilty one took own picture while removing gun from desk.
Dr. Cardigan... be so kind as to develop film with utmost speed?
Certainly.
Jimmy.
Keep watchful eye on doctor.
Okay, Pop.
- Turn that light off, please.
- Y-Yes, sir.
- It's coming up now.
- Good.
Wait a minute!
Pop, here it is!
Here is picture of guilty person,
Captain Johnson.
It's the captain!
Denial is useless.
Photograph does not lie.
Only you and Mrs. Wayne aware
Miss Hayes carry large sum to Honolulu.
Mrs. Wayne wanted to prevent husband from receiving same.
Money being entrusted to your safekeeping... you saw chance to obtain huge fortune for yourself.
Captain Johnson shot
Mrs. Wayne's husband... when he came aboard ship and hid money in lifeboat... where it was discovered by light-fingered gentleman.
He then tried to cover trail... by planting money wrapper on Dr. Cardigan... and portion of money in Miss Hayes' cabin.
Suddenly, Mrs. Wayne become overly suspicious.
So he strangled her with scarf... tied in sailor's knot.
Only positive clue... was gun used in attempt upon life of humble self.
But fingerprints on gun all smudged, and so useless... making necessary trick with camera...
Ioaned by strange but most helpful Dr. Cardigan.
So sorry, Captain Johnson.
- Well, I guess me and McCoy can go, huh?
- Yes, to jail with Captain.
What a wonderful contribution to science your brain would make, Mr. Chan.
Thank you so much, but for present... would prefer to keep same for own use.
What a pity.
Lieutenant Chan speaking.
Please exercise self-control.
It's a boy, Pop!
It's a boy!
- Who's he talking to?
- I get it. He's having a baby.
Can you hear 'im, Pop?
Congratulations, Mr. Chan.
Contradiction please.
In present case, am only innocent bystander.
Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie!

Hoover, 946. Roosevelt, 2288.
President Hoover has just sent a telegram
of congratulations to Governor Roosevelt.
It's all over but the shouting.
This has been the greatest Democratic
landslide in the history of American politics.
Governor Roosevelt has carried
practically every state...
...sweeping all opposition before him.
It certainly marks the end of one era
and the beginning of another.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Well, here's something interesting.
A flash from Milwaukee.
The brewing interests plan
to start immediate production of beer.
And a flash from California.
Governor Rolph announces that
he intends to release all prisoners...
...held for liquor violations
in that state.
Listen to this, from New York State.
Democratic leaders announce that
Roosevelt will use all his influence...
...to have the 18th Amendment repealed
as soon as possible.
[WHISTLES]
It looks as if the Noble Experiment
was on its last legs.
The handwriting on the wall
for Prohibition.
It's taken us 12 years to realize...
Well, it's all over, boys.
We're washed up.
I knew it was coming.
What did I always tell you?
I knew it was too good to last.
Well, it lasted long enough to put us in the dough.
But it ain't no more.
Hey, you mugs, all of you, come here.
Come and get it.
- What are you doing, Bugs?
- This is the payoff.
Might as well cut it up right now and call it quits.
We're through.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Just a minute. Pipe down, will you?
You just heard the bad news.
Our racket can't last much longer.
I'm stepping out of it tonight...
...and if you're smart, you'll all step out of it.
Here you are, Butch.
This is for the vine-covered cottage out in the country somewheres.
You can grow your own vegetables, sweetheart.
Here you are, Al.
Split it up with the kids.
[TALKING INDISTINCTLY]
All right, just a minute.
I ain't kidding now.
And another thing.
From right now on, no more mob, see?
No more organization.
We're all on our own.
Bugs, what are you gonna do?
[SCOFFS]
I'm gonna mingle with the upper classes.
I'm gonna be a gentleman.
Roosevelt elected. Hey, paper here.
Read all about it. Beer in six months.
- Hey, special extra.
MAN 1: Extra.
MAN 2: Read all about it.
MAN 1: Roosevelt promises beer in April.
Why didn't you take your car?
You're just begging some guy to put one in you.
I feel like walking. I'm restless.
Oh, quitting like this,
I hate to see you do it, Bugs.
Stepping out of the picture.
Handing the town right over to Joe Milano.
Well, it suits me.
In six months, he'll be out of business and broke.
I'm going to step out while I've still got mine.
Good evening, Mr. Ahearn.
MAN 2:
Oh, yes, we have. Roosevelt elected.
- How do, Nelson?
- Did you and the boys vote today?
MAN 2: Read all about it. Roosevelt elected.
- Six times apiece.
So Uncle Sam has muscled in on your racket, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
MAN 1:
Beer in six months.
For a leaden nickel,
I'd take a poke at that flatfoot.
- Just one good poke.
- No, no, don't, Bugs.
You're right, Al.
I got a million and a quarter salted away, and all he's got is flat feet.
Let him laugh.
- What's eating the Little Giant tonight?
- He's going out of business.
How do you like that?
Bugs, is this on the level?
Yeah, it's on the level. I'm through.
Why, honey, you could no more quit than you could stop breathing.
- It's your life.
- No?
Hey, you think I like to sweat and worry
20 hours a day?
Scheme, connive, play both ends against the middle...
...live on the edge of a volcano liable to blow up?
You think it's fun to spend your life...
...waiting for some mug to spray you with a machinegun?
I can't go anywheres without a bodyguard.
I'm always tense, coiled up like a spring...
...ready to duck the moment anybody flashes a rod.
Every time I step into my car, get near a window, walk around the block.
Every time somebody opens the door,
I hunch my shoulder waiting for that thunder.
That's how I've lived for the last 10 years.
And believe me, sister, I got a bellyful.
Must be great to have dough to quit on.
By cutting all the corners,
I'll manage to eat...
...and keep the rain off me.
Yessiree.
I'm a young guy that knows all the answers...
...and got my whole life before me.
Yeah, and I'm all washed up with mugs.
I know, I came from the gutter, but I'm stepping right out of it.
I'm gonna meet some real people.
Do something worthwhile, amount to something.
When you meet these people, what are you gonna talk about?
Machine guns and beer?
I'll manage to talk to them, all right, and they'll listen.
I've been reading a lot.
I've been studying.
I ain't been wasting my time.
What do you think I've been reading all them books for? Here.
Greek philosophy.
Pluto.
Yeah,
I bet you thought Pluto was a water.
I'm just crawling with education.
I've been reading all them Greeks.
They do plenty beside shining shoes and running lunchrooms.
Sure, they don't do bad in a dark alley with a stiletto, either.
Yeah, smart guy, ain't you?
What do you think I've been buying all them pictures for?
Here, take a hinge at that one.
You ever seen anything like that before?
Not since I've been off cocaine.
No, you dumb head.
I suppose you think that's a cat having a fit...
...in a bucket of tomato ketchup.
Well, it ain't, see? That's art.
Why, it's one of the finest examples of, uh, fu...
Futurism. Yeah.
Why, that's got, uh, dynamic rhythm.
Yeah, that's what it's got, and tone color.
But it ain't got a nickel's worth of perspective.
You know, pictures without perspective, well, that's the last word in art today.
Go on, point me out some perspective.
I dare you to.
What for?
Do you know how much that set me back?
Twelve hundred smackers.
Why, it's a genuine Kaputzawich.
- Who's he?
- The guy who painted that picture.
Oh.
Yeah, what am I fixing to talk to them about?
See, I'm just crawling with culture.
Ask me anything.
What do you wanna know?
A good reason why I shouldn't get stinking drunk.
What's the matter with me as a picture, darling?
- Looks like you two wanna be alone.
- We could spare you.
BUGS:
Mm?
Oh, no, not tonight, Josephine.
I got a lot of heavy thinking to do.
Me for the hay.
Good night.
[HUMMING
WAGNER'S "PILGRIM'S CHORUS"]
You know, that's the "Pilgrim's Chorus" by Wagner.
Grand opera.
[HUMMING]
[BUGS CHUCKLING]
Yeah.
Phoned you a couple times this morning.
Well, I was down the Civic Auditorium listening to a lecture on technocracy.
What's that?
Well, the guy's pan was all over whiskers.
He kept mumbling in them so I couldn't hear.
Oh, boy.
The pro says I'm getting that left wrist swell. Ha-ha-ha.
- So the skids are under me, huh?
- Well, it's tough.
Oh, us dames always get it sooner or later.
It's like death or the taxes.
I hate to do this, kid.
You been a great pal.
Never mind the song and dance.
Oh, I ain't sore, Bugs.
You say quit, so it's quit.
Here, let me help you.
Why, honey, this is far too much.
I couldn't take it.
Oh, go on, take it. It's yours.
You've been a great gal, honey.
Oh, well.
So long.
Come see us sometime.
All the luck in the world to you, Edith.
Thank you, dear.
Same to you.
- How'd she take it?
- Standing up.
Did you get rid of the trucks?
Yeah, the Ajax Trucking Company was glad.
I sold all the ammunition to the Army and Navy store.
Oh, here.
Here's the checks.
Swell.
Say, did you get rid of the choppers?
Well, there ain't much market for machine guns...
...but I phoned a Mexican I know in El Paso, and he's gonna take all we got.
We're a cinch to get rid of our breweries and warehouses.
- We can sell them to the government.
- The government?
Sure, ain't they muscling in into our business?
[CHUCKLING]
Well, that's swell.
Oh, um...
Oh, Bugs?
Yeah?
I was just kind of thinking.
Now that you've got rid of the boys, trucks, ammunition, and the choppers and Edith...
...I was wondering, well, what you were figuring to do with me.
Well, why don't you take a little trip for yourself?
You mean, us split up?
Oh, don't give me that.
We've been together since we was kids over on Blue Island Avenue.
- I know, but seeing as how...
- You're gonna put no skids under Al.
I started with you,
I'm sticking with you, even if I have to wade to my hips in art.
Look at all the good times we had together.
Remember the time we busted into that loft after them furs?
Yeah, and you went into a panic over that big stuffed polar bear in the corner.
- I gave it to him.
- You sure opened up on him.
The cops on the West Side was swarming that joint...
...like they was bees around a hive.
And in reform school, when we got a hold of that saltpeter.
Hey, boy, will I ever forget that?
We dumped it in the sugar bowl.
[LAUGHING]
Yeah, boy, we certainly did have fun before we went in the big business.
We're gonna keep on having fun, together.
Where Papa goes, Mama goes.
- Okay, you're in.
- Swell.
Yeah, but you gotta keep improving yourself.
I'm serious about this getting-up-in-the-world idea...
...and I don't want no anchor to drag around.
- Understand?
- Uh-huh.
MAN:
Hey, Jim.
Frankie wants to see you.
All right.
Come on, Frankie, drag it in.
Hello, what's on your mind?
Look, Bugs,
I'm up in Joe Milano's joint.
I'm in the bathroom, but I hear them gabbing outside the door.
Joe and the boys are coming up here and give you a good going-over.
Yeah? So they found out who hijacked their trucks last week?
Yeah, Joe says they're gonna beat the can off you.
That greaseball's gonna beat the can off of us, huh?
- He is, huh? I'll get the boys...
- Just a minute.
I'll take care of this.
Thanks for the tip.
Here, scram and buy yourself a cigar.
I'm practically gone, sweetheart.
Much obliged for the sugar.
Let me phone the boys.
We'll put them in the other room.
- When Joe's mob walks in...
- Yeah, we'll start shooting.
Put ourselves on the spot with the coppers, and what for?
That's all we need now.
I told you we were through, and I meant it.
You gonna sit here and let that garlic blossom give you the finger?
- Well, we'll blow out of town, quick.
- Well, where?
Well, let me see.
Say, how's for Europe?
My old man come from there.
He says it ain't bad.
- Nope, you gotta have a passport.
- Okay, we'll get ourselves one.
You can't get a passport unless you have a receipt that you paid your tax.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Old Man Income Tax.
And they call this a free country.
BUGS:
There's our dish.
Golf, polo, the blue Pacific.
Well, that don't sound bad for a starter.
Great climate, plenty of class and far away.
"Santa Barb..."
- Say, I wonder what that "Santa" means.
- That must be Spanish for saint.
Yeah?
[LAUGHING]
- What's eating you?
- I was just thinking.
A couple of hoodlums like us moving in on a saint.
[CHUCKLING]
- What do you want?
- Western Union. Telegram.
Who is it for?
Milano. Joe Milano.
Hello, Bugs. We was just discussing you.
I'm leaving town, Joe.
I didn't wanna overlook saying goodbye to you.
Oh, sure.
Especially since I heard you was gonna call on me.
[JOE GRUNTS]
Seeing as how I'm leaving town...
...I didn't want you guys to get the idea you was running me out.
Come on, Al.
That train won't wait forever.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
So long. Don't take any lead nickels, now.
No, I won't.
You use this to play them pansy games with.
If you get into any trouble out there, you can bean some guy with them.
I'll be using them.
You can depend on that.
- Hey, Bugs?
BUGS: Yeah?
- I got something nifty for you.
- What's it for, Red?
Kind of an outdoor chair.
This is to keep it from going too far in the ground.
This is to keep it under control at the other end.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Well, that's just the thing
I'll need, Red.
Hey, Bugs, here's all the words.
Now you'll know what them dudes out there is talking about.
[ALL LAUGHING]
- Hey, Bugs?
BUGS: Yeah?
Take these while you can still smell them.
[ALL LAUGHING AND CHATTERING]
So long, boys.
Oh, boy, what a view.
Look at that ocean.
And them palm trees, real too.
Best I ever seen before was on picture postcards.
Yeah, and them furnishings.
I don't know whether you know it, Al, but that's real Spanish.
Believe me, those Spaniards certainly knew their onions.
Boy, what a layout.
Well, it ought to be.
Take a squint at that.
"Forty-five dol..." Per day?
Boy, we're traveling in a fast company.
Forty... Seven times 40, that's 280...
- It's over 300 bucks a week.
- Oh, it ain't the money that burns me.
I'll give over 300 a week to the bellhops around here.
I don't want them to get that they got a yap up here.
Nobody ever made no sucker out of me.
"Forty-five do..."
Here goes some of their profit.
Forty-five dollars a day.
The nerve of them guys.
Charging anything like that.
I'll show them where to get off.
Yessiree.
Up here.
Oh, you too.
Yes.
Yeah.
You going screwy?
They ain't gonna make a chump out of me.
Boy, I'm gonna get me money's worth.
Yessiree.
Yeah.
I'll show them they can't get off.
Say, why do we have to put on these monkey suits?
Why couldn't we wear a tux?
I tell you, nobody in this kind of joint wears tuxedos at night but waiters.
Well, if you're wrong, you'd better order yourself an ambulance.
[CHATTERING]
Hey, come here.
I suppose you're gonna tell me all these guys are waiters.
They're all dressed wrong. We're right.
Well, listening to you, it's a wonder
I didn't end up down here in pajamas.
Oh, this is great.
Perfect. Real class.
And what atmosphere.
I get a kick out of this, don't you?
You can have my interest in it free.
I know, you rather be in a cellar shooting crap.
Just lead me to that cellar.
Hmm.
Mr. Stanley will be here in just a minute.
Yes, Miss Cass.
Hey, uh, don't turn around until I give you the office.
What's the matter? How many?
- They got rods?
- No, you ape, it's a skirt.
And is she the McCoy.
Thought some guy had the finger on us.
One quick hinge at her and you can tell she's a lady.
It's painted on her like a billboard.
- You wanna meet her?
- Do you know her?
No, but I can ease over there, break the ice.
Mush-head.
You ain't on North Clark Street.
You're in society now.
Out here, you don't talk to people till you've been introduced.
Oh, dames are alike all over the world.
I bet I could...
Say, you stay put or I'll bend this water bottle over your skull.
Oh, boy, am I hungry.
Am I gonna give a big steak a good home.
- They got me.
- What?
Oh, the score card.
I can't read nothing on it but the date.
Oh, it's in French.
Oh, well, let's order the whole thing.
Maybe there's a steak among it.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
[IN ENGLISH] Yes, sir.
Consommé, chicken and fried potatoes.
[IN ENGLISH]
Talk French, you chump, and talk it loud.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
When did you learn how to talk this monkey jabber?
[IN ENGLISH] I used to have 10 percent of a French dame.
[CHATTERING]
All right, so why?
It's a game.
What for?
Listen, stupid.
The guys in the white shirts are playing against the guys in the red.
Each team is trying to knock the ball through the other team's goal.
Get it?
- Then what?
- Oh, shut up.
Oh, boy, there's that dame again.
Gee, I wish I could find out some way of getting properly introduced.
You've been beefing about that since last night.
Why don't you give up?
Leave it, leave it.
Oh, come on, let's scram.
This game's dead.
There ain't no excitement.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Let's hop into town and pick up a couple of waitresses.
I didn't come out here to hustle any waitresses.
First-class or nothing.
They won't come near you.
They won't even give you a tumble.
Yeah, they walk around us like we have smallpox.
Forty-five bucks a day and they high-hat you.
They wouldn't let you in the golf club, huh?
Who said they wouldn't?
Just so happens that one of the gazebos on membership committee is out of town.
When will he be back?
Well, they ain't so sure about that.
He's in Europe or something.
- Europe, huh?
- Yeah.
You're gonna get in?
Why, sure, I'm gonna get in.
That's a cinch.
We could get up to Frisco and back before that guy comes home from Europe.
Now, there's a great town, that Frisco.
Wide-open.
Good eats, good liquor and just crawling with beautiful, friendly dames.
And little Hymie give me a couple of good addresses.
I wonder how long a guy could stay drunk if he really tried.
Okay, we'll drive up there tomorrow and find out.
Whoopee!
Make out like you don't know me.
Boy, am I glad to screw out of that morgue.
Three days and we don't even get a tumble.
Yeah, you're right.
A lot of half-witted chumps riding around on Shetland ponies, knocking a little ball.
And a lot of high-hat baboons sitting on horses...
...all swelled up with themselves, won't talk to nobody.
Horses.
Before I die,
I'm gonna burn down a livery stable.
[HOOFS BEATING]
Stop. Stop the car.
Hey, where you going?
She must be hurt. I'm going to help her.
Say, you hurt bad?
I seen... I saw your horse run away, and I knew you had an accident, so I...
There wasn't any accident.
We got off and tied up the horses.
No accident?
Of course not.
My horse broke loose and headed for town.
She'll go right back to the stables.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hey, mister.
Did you call me, madam?
Have you got a car?
Why, yes, ma'am.
I've got a luncheon engagement.
I don't wanna wait any longer.
Would you be kind enough to drive me home?
Oh, lady, I'd carry you home.
Oh, let me...
Oh, please.
Well, thanks so much.
If you weren't leaving town,
I'd ask you to drop in for tea.
Oh, I'm not leaving town.
I've decided to stay here all winter.
Well, thanks for the lift.
We'll be at home any time after 4 tomorrow, if you care to drop in.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Back to town, quick.
- What for?
- I thought we're heading for Frisco.
- Never mind.
We're going back.
I've gotta find the best tailor.
A tailor?
You got a suit for every day in the week.
Come on, come on, get going.
[CHUCKLES]
How do you do, sir?
What does a guy wear to an afternoon tea?
Well, it all depends, sir.
The best tailors have agreed that...
Come on, I ain't got all year.
What does a guy wear?
Well, I was about to remark, sir...
...that a cutaway coat, white waistcoat...
...and striped trousers are usually acceptable.
Can I have them by tomorrow afternoon?
That's impossible, sir.
I'll need at least a fortnight...
Look, buddy, I'm on the spears.
I've gotta have it by tomorrow.
I'll pay you double, triple the regular price.
Will you step into the fitting room, Mr...?
J.F. Ahearn.
I'm stopping at the Biltmore.
Call them up.
Follow me, sir.
Oh, Winterbottom, come here.
- Please take Mr. Ahearn's measurements.
- Right-o, Mr. Charteris.
- Excuse me, please.
- Well, let's make it snappy.
- My dinner suit ready?
- It is, Mr. Cass.
- Can I have it tonight?
- If you're prepared to pay something.
Oh, listen, Charteris, old man,
I expect a check any day now.
Now, I'll pay you just as soon as...
I've listened to your excuses for the last time.
When can you pay me, you may have it, and not before.
Excuse me, please.
I'd greatly appreciate it, sir, if you would stand still.
Now, you wouldn't ask an artist to paint your picture...
...while you were fidgeting about.
Oh, wouldn't I?
You don't know me, Winterbottom.
Oh.
Mr. Ahearn's bank references are excellent, eh?
A millionaire? Well, that is gratifying.
And where's the gentleman from?
Oh, I see. Well, that accounts for his strange manner of speaking.
Thanks very much, old boy.
Were you talking about Ahearn, the polo player from Meadowbrook?
Mr. Ahearn is from Chicago.
[CHATTERING]
[PIANO PLAYING]
[CROWD APPLAUDING]
Oh, how do you do, Miss Cass?
- Hello.
- I, uh...
I accepted your kind invitation.
It's nice of you.
Oh, you're the man who drove me home.
Yes, the man from St. Louis.
No, Chicago.
Of course.
Come on in and meet everyone.
This is Sylvia Townsend,
Mrs. Ingram, Dr. Abbott.
- How do you do, doc?
- How do you do, sir?
Oh, uh, what's your name again?
Bug... Mr. Ahearn.
Mrs. Frotingham, may I present Mr. Ahearn?
Mrs. Handley, Miss Ames,
Chauncey Cook, Mr. Ahearn.
How do you, Mr. Cook?
BUGS:
Very distingué, I'm sure.
POLLY:
Dave Winters, Mr. Ahearn.
Miss Cramont, Miss Lovering,
Mrs. Terhune, Mrs. Holman...
...Mr. Sanders, Miss Cartwright.
- I'm very pleased to meet all you folks.
- Just make yourself at home.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Thanks.
Oh, Miss Cass?
- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks.
Just help yourself to anything else you want.
Yes. Oh, thanks.
[PIANO PLAYING]
[CHUCKLES]
Yeah, looks good. Ha-ha-ha.
Just what I wanted too.
Who is that terrible creature, dear?
He's the comic valentine who gave me a lift when my horse ran away.
His name's Ahearn.
Ahearn? From Chicago?
Yes, why?
He's not so stupid. He's a millionaire.
Are you sure?
I heard the tailor call for bank references.
You bad girl.
Why didn't you say something?
I've never even met him.
Probably got a wife and seven kids.
Well, just the same, he's worth investigating.
Let's meet him.
- Mr. Ahearn.
- Oh.
Mother, may I present Mr. Ahearn?
- Charmed.
- How do you do, madam?
Father, Mr. Ahearn.
- It's a very great pleasure, sir.
- Well, same here.
And my brother, Gordon.
- Glad you could drop over.
- You and me both. Ha-ha-ha.
You should have brought
Mrs. Ahearn along.
Well, that would be great, only I'm not married.
- Congratulations.
- Yeah. Ha-ha.
I understand you're from Chicago,
Mr. Ahearn.
- A favorite city of mine.
- That's right.
Dear old Chicago. I love it.
Connected with Continental and Commercial Bank, aren't you?
Well, I'm not in business anymore.
You see, I made mine and quit.
Yeah, all I do now is just play and enjoy myself.
I suppose you're staying at the Biltmore.
Well, I was, but, uh,
I've sort of bought myself an estate.
How thrilling.
Whereabouts is your house?
Well, I, uh...
I haven't been living here very long, so I don't know the names of the streets.
Perhaps it's one of those big hillside places south of town.
- Yeah, that's right. A big hillside place.
- Grand.
Well, Mr. Ahearn, now that you've found the way...
...I hope you'll come and see us very, very often.
Come to dinner sometime, anytime.
Just give us a ring.
Well, I'm much obliged to you.
And you folks have gotta come and have dinner on me...
...just as soon as I get open.
We'd be delighted. That will be splendid.
Now, remember, Mr. Ahearn, this is not one of those indefinite invitations.
Oh, I should say not.
We expect to see a lot of you.
Thank you.
Say, uh, your folks certainly got a lot of culture, Miss Cass.
They make a fella feel right at home.
You made a very good impression on them.
- Honest?
- Cross my heart.
Well, of course, it's...
I like it that they like me and all that...
...but it's a lot more important to me if you...
I mean, if I... If we...
No, thanks.
Hmm?
I got mine already. Thanks.
[LAUGHING]
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Oh, good morning.
Say, have you got a hillside estate?
You know, something big, kind of rich-looking.
Do you want to buy or rent?
Well, I'll rent it for a while, and then if everything's okay,
I'll buy it.
Well, I think I have just the place you're looking for.
If you'd care to drive out,
I'll show it to you.
- Can we do it right away?
- Yes.
All right, let's take a gander at the joint.
You could put the whole Cubs' ballpark in the front yard.
Yeah, no fooling.
- The polo field is over there.
- Yeah.
And the tennis courts and swimming pool and sunken gardens are this way.
Who sunk the garden?
BUGS:
Say, what's that?
RUTH:
Why, it's a sundial.
What's it for?
- You tell time by it like a watch.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Well, imagine lugging that around in your vest pocket.
I want you to see the...
Yeah.
- This is the living room.
BUGS: Hmm.
Nice chandelier.
- The piano is a Steinway.
- Oh, lovely.
Say, who's that?
- That's a famous Siamese Beauty.
- Where's the other one?
- What?
- I always thought they was twins.
Well, there's a guy in good shape.
RUTH: That's a reproduction in bronze of an ancient Greek wrestler.
Oh, yeah, I know. Zbyszko.
Say, I seen him wrestle Strangler Lewis at the old Garden.
Yep, nice place.
Little big, but cozy at that.
How much are you asking?
Well, uh, let's say 1500 a month on a year's lease.
Fifteen hun?
How would 1450 do?
- Well...
- It's a deal, 1450.
- When can I move in?
- Whenever you want, Mr. Ahearn.
I'm in now.
- I'm sure you'll be very happy here.
- Get a load of the carpets.
Yeah, they make me feel like
I was in wading.
Of course you brought your own servants?
Servants?
Oh, no, uh...
No, you see, I gave them up when I closed my townhouse in Chicago.
Oh. Well, you'll need a housekeeper, and a cook, two butlers...
...an upstairs maid, three gardeners and a couple of chauffeurs.
Is that all?
Well, that's the staff that we, uh...
The people who lived here kept.
Oh.
Mr. Ahearn,
I could get you their servants.
Competent, trustworthy, efficient help.
They know exactly how this place should be run.
All right, sister. You take care of that, but don't let's lose no time.
Oh, look here.
- You know this town good, I suppose.
- Yes, I've lived here all my life.
Well, I'm kind of a stranger around here, but I expect to do a lot of entertaining.
Could you stick around here and help me?
You know, tell me who to invite and all that sort of thing.
Why, of course.
Well, would 100 bucks a week interest you?
It certainly would.
Well, then it looks like you go with the house.
Oh, Mr. Ahearn,
I can't thank you enough...
Oh, that's all right, sister, that's all right.
I'll get my money's worth out of you.
They're very kind, but a little eccentric.
So you mustn't be surprised at anything they do or say.
Most important of all,
Mr. Ahearn is not to know...
...that this is my house, or that all of you worked for Father and me.
- You understand that, don't you?
ALL: Yes, ma'am.
If he did find out, it might be very embarrassing for him.
He might even discharge me, and I need my salary just as much as any of you.
It's gonna take every cent of the money
I get to pay my back taxes and interest.
Boy, what a crib. What a crib.
- Kind of gives you ideas.
- You think not.
[PHONE RINGS]
I'll take it.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Miss Cass. Got my message?
Yes, I called you the minute I came in.
Would you like to come over and have lunch with us tomorrow?
Fine.
Oh, Mr. Ahearn, you're getting me all of atwitter.
Oh, I'm not kidding. I mean it.
Well, I'll see you about 1 tomorrow, huh?
Goodbye.
How you doing, pal?
Well, looks like I'm in the bag, headed smack for the society column.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
AL:
Come on in.
- Is your room all right, Mr. Ahearn?
- Oh, perfect.
The butler will be up to help you unpack.
Thanks.
Now, if there's anything you want, why, please just ask me.
Say, now, look here.
You know, I was thinking we might throw some kind of a party tomorrow night.
- A housewarming?
- Yeah, that's it.
- Will you take care of it?
- Of course.
- Uh, whom do you want me to invite?
- Well, the...
The Cass family.
The Donald Hadley Casses?
That's right. Swell people, ain't they?
Ha-ha.
Charming.
I sure hope they'll accept the invitation.
Oh, I'm inclined to think they will.
Now, let me see, now, there's Miss Polly Cass...
...there's Mr. and Mrs. Cass, and there's young Cass.
Well, the Casses.
And anybody else you might think would fit in them with them.
- Well, they may be a little difficult.
- Yeah, that's right.
You can't invite a lot of tramps on the same party with them.
You know, they're very distingué.
Very what?
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
It means, uh, distinguished in French.
Oh, of course, how stupid of me.
- I'll attend to everything, Mr. Ahearn.
- Thank you.
You know, there's a smart little dame.
And plenty pretty too.
Sure, but she's only a servant.
Oh, yeah. Say, I keep forgetting.
Mr. Daniels, you're getting real Scotch, genuine White Horse.
Your horse has got diabetes.
[CHATTERING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Lovely night.
Oh, yeah, it's a gorgeous moon.
You going to the polo matches tomorrow?
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
You know, you ought to take up polo.
I guess I should.
Oh, it's a grand game.
And I've always had a weakness for athletic men.
[CHUCKLING]
- Let's take a walk, shall we?
- Okay.
Gee, Polly, but your hair smells nice.
Like this perfume?
Coming up for air.
Mind if I make myself comfy?
Go on, don't stop.
Heh.
You, uh, engaged or something to that Mr. Stanley?
Of course not, you silly.
- He's just an old friend of the family.
- Oh.
I got a hunch he ain't gonna be with us long.
As a matter of fact,
I'm fed up with these usual people.
I could do with a new, exciting romance.
Life is very dull.
Oh, you can clean up tomorrow, boys.
Go to bed. You've had a tough night.
- Party come off all right, Mr. Ahearn?
- Oh, yeah, perfect.
Thanks for taking care of everything so good.
- Go to bed.
- Good night.
Hey, wait a minute.
Come here.
Sit down.
Say, you're a good, levelheaded kid...
...and you look to me as though you could keep a secret.
I wanna ask you something.
Get the woman's angle.
I'm...
I'm in love with a girl. A lady.
Say, rich, fine family, swell education.
- Everything that I ain't got.
- I see.
Well, anyhow,
I'm a pretty tough mug, myself.
I came from the gutter and I guess you can still smell it on me.
The only school I went to was reform school.
You've done wonderfully to get where you are now.
Oh, yeah, I've done great.
Sure, a real lady ought to jump at the chance of tying up with me.
Say, do you know who I am, sister?
- I'm Bugs Ahearn.
- Bu...
Bugs Ahearn? The beer...
Yeah, that's right. The beer baron.
The guy who pushes them around Chicago.
Sure, I've quit now...
...but bombing, stealing, bribing, slugging, you name it and I done it.
You, the terrible Bugs Ahearn.
Well, she don't know this, see?
And it's a cinch she's gonna get the dope on me sooner or later.
Now, look here, do you think I ought to give her this whole load myself?
You know, tell her I done a stretch in Joliet...
...lay all my cards on the table?
I got a hunch she'd toss me out and get the whole joint fumigated.
Have you known her long?
Well, I only met her a couple of days ago.
Well, I'd keep quiet about my past for a while if I were you.
Build yourself up to her level.
Then when you've proven...
...that you have all the qualities that she admires in a man...
...then tell her everything.
Well, that would take a long time.
Not too long.
A few weeks. A few months, maybe.
But you'll be improving yourself.
Meeting people...
...and making yourself familiar with your surroundings.
Yeah.
Yes.
Say, you're one of the smartest little dames...
...I've ever run across.
That's right.
Why not?
Yeah, build myself up to her...
Say, you're all right, you know that?
[CHUCKLES]
That shouldn't take long.
He's certainly trying hard to learn the game.
You've got to give him credit.
Out here five hours a day, and seven days a week.
He swings just like an old lady beating a carpet.
Come on, quit stalling. Hit it.
The handle is too long.
You'd be more at home with a blackjack.
Scram, will you, before I wrap this mallet around your neck.
[GRUNTING]
You can have them for 1000 apiece.
The finest Argentine ponies.
Oh, I don't need them.
This dog of mine is good enough to stick-and-ball around...
Hey, your stick-and-ball days are over.
You're really gonna play.
- You kidding?
- No.
The boys say it's a miracle the way you've caught onto the game.
They want you on their team.
Me? On the Meadowlarks?
Yeah, they said if you'd get yourself well-mounted...
Well-mounted?
Say, are these the best nags money can buy?
Absolutely.
- Will five be enough to start with?
- Well, you can get a few more later on.
Me, on the Meadowlarks.
Gee, that's the biggest boot
I ever got in my whole life.
- Can I have them right now?
- Sure.
Sold.
[CROWD SHOUTING]
Why does he carry a mallet?
He hasn't used it since the game began.
MAN:
Mike, what are you stopping for?
Leave it.
MAN:
Come on.
Leave it.
MAN:
One more down.
Leave it.
Nuts!
MAN:
Outside.
[CROWD SHOUTING]
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[CAR HORNS TOOTING]
"Noted sportsman." Did you pipe that?
And right smack at the head of the society column.
I suppose you'll buy a plane next.
No, they hit the ground, and then where are you?
If we're going out on that boat tomorrow,
I'll buy a pansy motorman cap.
Say, time for you to play golf.
- Oh, I played yesterday.
- Come on, get moving.
You'll become a gentleman if it kills you.
Oh, all right.
He's just an anchor.
I have to drag him around all the time.
This just came from the jeweler's.
Oh, fine. I've been waiting for it.
Oh, boy. Heh, heh.
Boy.
[CHUCKLES]
Say, do you think Polly would like this?
I mean, Miss Polly Cass?
Polly Cass?
You're engaged to...?
I ain't proposed to her yet, but I'm gonna do it tomorrow on the yacht.
Oh, you can't really be in love with her.
Why, just thinking about her,
I break out in a rash.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
Just think of it, a guy like me.
A guy that's hung around all corners.
A guy hep to everything, falling in love with a dame and on the level too.
Well, I wish you luck.
- Hey, Ruth.
- Hmm?
You don't mind my calling you Ruth, huh?
Well, look here, you know, I'm, uh...
I'm kind of a sucker at this proposal racket.
How do you get started?
How do you get away from the barrier, huh?
Do you mean to say you've never proposed to a girl before?
Well, up to now, I got along all right without even mentioning marriage.
[CHUCKLING]
Well, it's perfectly simple.
Just ask her.
Oh, I'm sure to get all jazzed up.
Could I, uh?
Could I sort of, uh, practice on you, huh?
Why, uh... Why, yes, of course.
Oh, you're a real pal, baby. Ha.
Well, put her down there.
Uh...
Make out like you're her.
Uh...
Well, I, uh...
Well, how do you get going?
Sit down here beside me.
Yeah.
Maybe I better start off with the ring, huh?
No, no, she might not accept you.
You'll have to say something first.
Yeah.
That's where I'm a cinch to get all jazzed up.
Well, just tell her that you love her.
Okay.
Well, here we go, laughing and scratching.
Heh, heh. Yeah...
Well, now, look here, honey.
You know, ever since the first time
I got a gander at you...
...I knew that you and me...
I mean, that we was kind of...
Oh, I'm sunk.
I can think of the words, but they just won't roll out.
Well, just be natural.
Don't try to make a speech.
Now, try it again.
Yeah.
Polly, I...
You know... Now, get a load of this, see?
No, no, no.
You're gonna make a speech again.
Take my hand.
- Put your arm around me.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe I could put it all in a telegram.
Now, tell me that you love me.
I love you.
"And I love you, Jim."
She'll say.
Say, you do this too good.
You must have had plenty of practice.
Now, never mind that.
Ask me to marry you.
Would you? Would you marry me?
Of course I will, darling.
Say, how do you know she'll say that?
Now kiss me.
Good evening, commodore.
What's good about it?
Why don't you suck a lemon?
Suck one yourself, you silly-Looking...
Come on, honey.
Let's go and tell the folks.
I'd better stay here and calm down.
You go tell them, darling.
[PIANO PLAYING]
[CHATTERING]
Hey, folks, say, I got some great news for you.
Kind of a surprise.
Polly and me...
Well, we're engaged.
Oh, Jim, dear. I'm so happy.
[ALL LAUGHING AND CHATTERING]
Isn't that wonderful?
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, old man. Best of luck.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Jim. I thought something like this was in the air.
Thanks, Gordon.
Ain't I the lucky guy, though?
Stop sulking.
I only have to live with him long enough to get alimony.
And what am I going to do while you're on your honeymoon?
[CHUCKLES]
You big baby.
Well, now that I'm getting married...
...I'd like to settle down and go into some good, high-class business.
An admirable idea, my boy.
What line should I go in, you think?
Ordinarily, we might find something for you to do...
...around Cass-Winter and Company.
But things have been so slow lately.
Well, I could put in some money.
You know, sort of buy a partnership.
We don't need it, Jim.
See, we're very old and well-established.
Plenty of capital.
Well, that's just the kind of outfit
I'd like to hook up with.
Mm, I don't think I could get my partners to even consider it.
But we'll take a run down to Los Angeles tomorrow and chat with them.
I may be able to convince them.
I hope so.
I tried to borrow money on these bonds to pay my taxes.
And the bank laughed at me.
Why, these are all I've got.
My life savings.
And the bank says they're worthless.
True, bonds have defaulted their interest.
But I think you're unduly alarmed.
I'm alarmed?
I'll show you how alarmed I am.
You sold me these for 5000.
I'll sell them back to you for 500.
I've been fleeced and victimized and I'm going to the district attorney.
Now, Mr. Burger, don't you realize that any adverse publicity...
...would only depress these bond values further?
But, gentlemen...
...if I have faith enough in this young man's ability...
...to sell him my interests outright...
...I don't see how you gentlemen can object.
I have always gloried in your confidence and enthusiasm.
We have stood shoulder to shoulder...
...in fair weather and foul, at our respective posts.
But there comes a time when young blood must supplant us.
When youth must be served.
Now, here is a man, a young man, with those attributes...
Oh, Mr. Cass, could I see you a moment, please?
Oh, will you pardon me, gentlemen?
It's getting very tough out there.
When you leave, go out the back door.
Now, as I was saying, gentlemen...
...here is a young man possessed of those attributes...
...honesty, energy, integrity...
...that alone can carry on the glorious tradition...
...of Cass-Winter and Company.
Now, gentlemen, all in favor of selling their interests to Mr. Ahearn...
...will signify by saying, "Aye."
ALL:
Aye.
Those opposed? None.
Congratulations, Mr. Ahearn.
Well, thanks. Ha.
Well, I...
I hardly know what to say.
I wanna thank all of you gentlemen for letting me in on this.
I appreciate your sacrifice... but at the same time,
I ain't overlooking that it's a great chance for me.
I wanna thank you for all that you done on my behalf.
- I'll guarantee you plenty of service.
- Yes.
Somebody give me a cocktail.
We're celebrating.
- His checks cleared?
- Yes, my boy.
And I made over $300,000 on the deal.
Oh, Father. It's all too wonderful.
Then I don't have to marry him.
- What a godsend.
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Ahearn is now sole owner of Cass-Winter and Company...
...and he is welcome to it.
Where's Papa's cocktail?
And all I could sell him was a few horses.
Ha. I must be losing my grip.
You've got 15,000 commission for selling him that boat.
Oh, cigarette money.
Go on, call the gentleman up and tell him we've got smallpox.
We don't have to endure him now.
He might get suspicious.
You can endure him one more evening.
What excuse will you give for breaking off your engagement?
I'll just write him I changed my mind.
Don't forget to send him back his ring.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's worth at least $5000.
Polly, I'd be careful about the way you break off your engagement.
- Why? His checks have cleared.
- Yes, I know.
But it might be more convenient if you handled the situation delicately.
- Until we can get away to Europe.
- All right.
I've had a nervous breakdown.
You have to take me away for a year.
That sounds plausible enough.
It's pretty sudden.
What if we told him there was insanity in the family?
JOHN: Hey, everybody.
- Hello, John.
John, I have something to tell you.
- Now, wait a minute. Wait.
- Now, John...
I just happened to pick up a copy of TIME.
- Look at this.
- What is it?
Good heavens.
The notorious Bugs Ahearn.
"Beer, blood and machine guns." Huh.
We're sitting on a keg of dynamite.
- Do you think there will be trouble?
- He's the toughest desperado.
He'd think it was a joke to blow up this house.
- Bugs Ahearn.
GORDON: We should've investigated.
It's too late now. We're in danger.
He's sure to find out we trimmed him.
Probably knows it now.
There's only one thing to do.
Get out of the country, quick.
You're absolutely right.
We'll make plans to leave in the morning.
Ingleby. Oh, this is an outrage.
Ingleby, when Mr. Ahearn comes, say we're not at home.
We're indisposed.
We're not at home to anybody.
Mr. Ahearn is here, madam.
His car just turned into the drive.
Good evening, folks.
- Glad to see you, Mr. Stanley.
- Thanks.
Hi, Gordon.
Well, how goes it, Pop?
And, Ma, you're looking keen tonight.
Well, sweetheart.
What's the matter?
I don't feel very well.
A little dinner will be good for what ails you.
- I'm sorry, but I can't go out tonight.
- See, now, look here.
I got tickets for the dog show, but if you're not feeling well...
...we can all sit here and have a nice, quiet evening at home.
I'm sorry, but I...
You'll have to excuse me.
[SOBBING]
I was...
What is this all about?
What's the matter?
Why, we've just heard something rather disturbing.
Something concerning my family's good name and yourself.
I don't get you.
Uh, Mr. Ahearn...
Did you, um?
Did you happen to read this?
DONALD: Of course, it's all a mistake which you can probably explain.
No.
It's true.
What? You don't deny the truth of that article?
I told you, it's true.
And you had the nerve to force your affections on my sister?
Worming your way into our affections, deceiving us about your past...
...so you could marry my daughter.
Of all the disgraceful abuses of confidence.
DONALD:
It's outrageous.
One of the most disgusting insults perpetrated on a trusting, innocent girl.
You've broken the poor girl's heart.
Ruined us socially.
Made us the laughingstock of this community.
My daughter will be ill from the shock.
We shall have to take her abroad immediately.
Now, look here.
I was gonna tell her about myself before we got married.
Naturally, Mr. Ahearn, the engagement is off.
And you are never to come near our home again.
Nor make any effort to communicate with us.
Well...
Well, I know how dreadful you feel.
But it's one of the luckiest things that ever happened to you.
Baby, you sure give me the wrong steer.
All this'd never happen to me...
...if I told her about myself before we got engaged.
All right, we're a bust out here, so what?
Let's head back to where we belong.
- I can't now.
- The trains are still running.
I bought a business.
I gotta stick around and see what's gonna happen to that now.
Say that again slow.
You bought a what?
I got over 600 G's invested in Cass-Winter and Company.
- Oh!
- What's eating you?
That firm, Cass-Winter and Company.
Why, they're thieves, crooks.
- They're what?
- They swindled my father.
Sold him a lot of South American bonds that were absolutely worthless.
It took every penny he had.
It ruined him.
Killed him.
After he died, there was nothing left except this house, which I couldn't afford to live in.
Why, Ruth, you mean to tell me that this house belongs to you?
Of course, ask anybody.
And they took your old man for...
Do you wanna know all about the Casses?
You wanna know the truth about that cultured, charming family?
Well, the old man is a drunken swine.
The old lady cheats at cards.
The son is a nitwit who owes money to everybody who'd listen to him.
Nobody worthwhile around here will even speak to him anymore.
And Polly, she's been a sister-in-law to the world.
Why, she's been in one scandal after another since she was 16 years old.
Yes, and while you were engaged to her...
...she was running around with Mr. John Stanley.
We used to call him John when he worked in my father's stables as a groom.
Why, Ruth, for the love of...
Why didn't you spill all this before?
Oh, I tried to, several times, but I couldn't.
You were too much in love with her.
Say, you sure about that firm?
They've been on the verge of bankruptcy for a year.
And you sunk 600 G's.
[LAUGHING]
The toughest mug in Chicago comes out here...
...and gets trimmed by fags with handkerchiefs up their sleeves.
Wait till Joe Milano gets a load of that.
One more yelp out of you and you go right out through the window.
So they take me, huh? I'm a chump, huh?
Well, that's swell.
I'm the guy who buys Brooklyn Bridge, ever hear of that?
So they're giving me the runaround.
Me, Bugs Ahearn.
Mr. Ahearn, these gentlemen insisted on seeing you.
What do you want?
Are you Mr. J. Francis Ahearn?
What's the beef?
The district attorney would like to see you...
...in his office tomorrow, around noon.
- What for?
- Ever hear of Cass-Winter and Company?
Sure, I just bought it.
That's why the DA would like to see you.
Your face looks very familiar. I think
I've seen a picture of you somewhere.
Never mind the stall.
What's this all about?
Rather serious trouble, I'm afraid.
Your firm's flooded the community with Republic of Santa Rango bonds.
Not worth the paper they're on.
- How can you hold me responsible?
- I don't see why we can't.
I never sold any bonds. I just bought it.
Present records show you to be the owner and president of the firm.
That makes you responsible.
- So that's the law, huh?
- Exactly.
Hmmph.
Look here, supposing everybody that lost their dough got paid back.
Now, that would satisfy everybody.
Can I use your phone for a long-distance call?
Surely. As long as you can pay for it.
I want Chicago.
Central 7808.
[RINGS]
Hello?
Long-distance calling for you, baby.
Yeah, hello.
Say, look here. Get Mike, Tony, Red, Gus,
Hymie, Butch and the other boys.
Shove them into planes and shoot them out to Santa Barbara, quick.
Well, who do you think this is, you fathead?
Sure, it's Bugs Ahearn.
- Look here...
- Don't worry.
I'll save your taxpayers the cost of a trial.
And if I don't make good, you can still have a trial.
Oh, here's for the phone call, sweetheart.
Hey, what state's California in?
- Texas, you dummy.
- That's right.
BUGS:
It's the same old story.
You take a smart guy, put him in a racket he ain't wised up to...
...and he's the biggest chump on earth.
I ain't denying that they took me and they done it good.
I ain't even burned up at them for taking me. Well, not much burned up anyhow.
Because if ever a guy lead with his chin, begged somebody to hang one on it, I did.
All I'm saying is that
I got in over my head...
...and it's up to you boys to bail me out.
I don't have to tell you how to operate.
You know what I want, you'll give it to me.
But be kind of careful about bumping anybody off.
Now, you got all the dough.
Now, don't forget, boys,
I'm depending on you to see me through.
- Okay, when do we cut loose?
- First thing in the morning.
You boys were the best beer salesmen in the racket...
...now let's see how good you are at selling bonds.
[CHATTERING]
MAN 1: Hello, buddy.
MAN 2: Oh, hi.
INGLEBY:
Gen... What?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Could we speak to Mr. Donald Hadley Cass, please?
The family is leaving for Europe in a few moments.
Mr. Cass is busy upstairs packing and cannot be disturbed.
We wouldn't think of disturbing him.
[GRUNTS]
Come on, step on it.
Why, how did you...?
What do you men want here?
Good morning. I'm Mr. Timothy O'Hara.
- Meet Mr. Pulido.
- Hi.
- And Mr. Zamotoskovich.
- Howdy, gobby.
- You must be in the wrong house.
- We ain't.
We're bond salesmen.
You're gonna buy
Republic of Santa Rango bonds.
Three hundred thousand dollars' worth.
You get out of here before I call the police.
If I were you, I wouldn't argue.
Mr. Zamotoskovich, have you the check handy?
Yes, sure.
Here it is.
All made out. Nothing to do but sign.
This is highway robbery. I refuse.
Looks like we'll have to give the gent a sales call.
Ain't that too bad?
[GRUNTING]
So you won't sign, huh?
Well, you won't sign. Well, how's this?
Stop! Oh, help!
- Stop!
- Maybe this will take a little bit more.
[GROANING]
- Stop!
- You won't talk and you won't sign.
Stop, stop!
I'll sign. I'll sign.
Stop! I'll sign.
- Now you're talking.
- I'll sign it, I'll sign it.
Let me have it.
You'll suffer for this brutality.
This outrage.
You'll regret it. You'll see.
- There.
- Thanks, Cass, old boy.
I'll stroll to the bank and get this cashed.
You boys stay here and entertain our customer.
Sure.
I'm sorry I had to put the heater on you.
But if you sit still, everything's gonna be all right.
It would be too bad to get blood all over this rug.
For a fact.
I want the police, quick.
Hurry up, the police.
We're selling you bonds you sold to chumps.
Operator, I want the police.
They put us in the can for selling them to you, they'll put you in the can.
- You better think it over, buddy.
- Stop squawking, nobody can hear you.
Here, put your moniker on this and be quick about it.
This is an outrage.
Get out of here or I'll call police.
Oh, will you?
Hey, nix, nix.
You don't wanna croak him.
Wait till we get his moniker on this check.
Here you are, kid. Sign here.
Why, this check is for $50,000.
That's all I have in the bank.
Sure, Mr. Ames.
It's bad to have 50 grand just laying in a bank.
Yeah, but it ain't near as bad as getting bumped off, Mr. Ames.
Come on. Put your John Henry on there.
Come on, come on. Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
What's keeping your father? Where is he?
I don't know. I haven't seen him.
If we don't leave in five minutes, we'll miss the train.
But of course, I...
[DOOR OPENS]
MRS. CASS: What do you want?
GORDON: Look here.
- You've got your nerve coming in here.
- Shut up.
Give me that ring. It cost me 7 grand.
Give me that ring.
[SCREAMS]
Now, look here, Ahearn. You can't...
Ingleby, Ingleby. Show these men out.
If you open that puss again,
I'll shove my foot in it.
I wanna slip you a load of good advice.
The next time you go trim a sucker, pick some guy that's a real sucker.
I had smarter people than you doing my laundry in Chicago.
Come on.
Blind, please help the blind.
Help the blind.
Thank you.
How could you pay back all of these losses in such a short time?
A new plan of refinancing.
The Chicago plan.
As long as you put the company on its feet, stay out here and run it.
Oh, no. Out here,
I'm like a mule in a horse race.
Well, look here.
You mustn't judge everybody by the Casses.
They're like poison to everybody in the community.
You telling me?
You haven't met one decent person since you came out here.
Why, sister, that's the first time you've been wrong.
Do you remember rehearsing me in that proposal racket?
Why, of course I remember.
Well, I was thinking it might not be a bad idea if me and you, uh...
...had another rehearsal.
I mean, that is, when you haven't anything else to do.
Well, I'm idle right this minute.
Great.
Put her down there.
MAN:
Fire at once!
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Fore!
Look out!
Bull's-eye! Give the gentleman a cigar.
[ENGLISH SDH]
A stall, please.
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have the honour of presenting to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.
- How remarkable?
- He's sweating.
And can you be surprised at that, gentlemen?
Every day he commits to memory fifty new facts... and remembers every one of them.
Facts from history, from geography, from newspapers... from scientific books, millions and millions of them.
Think of the strain involved by his prodigious feat.
His feet ain't half as big as yours, Curly.
I'm referring to his feats of memory.
Test him please.
Ladies and gentlemen
Ask him your questions... and he will answer you fully and freely.
Mr. Memory.
I also add, ladies and gentlemen before retiring... that Mr Memory has left his brain to the British Museum.

- Sorry.
- I'm a freelance.
Out for adventure, eh?
This way...
Sorry my sitting room's all upset
I've had the decorators in.
- Wait until I find the switch.
- Not yet.
Now.
Mr Hannay would you be so kind and turn that mirror face to the wall?
You'd be happier if there were curtains over those windows.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
Hello, there's the telephone.
Just a minute.
Mr Hannay don't answer the telephone.
Why not?
Because I think it's for me.
Please don't answer.
Just as you say.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you. Would you please kick that footstool over to me?
- You needed that.
- I did. Thank you.
- I owe you an explanation.
- Don't bother about me, I'm nobody.
We cannot talk here.
All right.
Just a minute.
OK?
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- Your friend again.
- Take no notice.
Would you think me very troublesome if I asked for something to eat?
- I've had nothing all day.
- Sure.
- Do you like haddock?
- Yes please.
I suppose your name isn't really Smith.
It depends on where I am.
You may call me Annabella.
Annabella Smith, a clergyman's daughter I'd say.
Hello, nervy.
Upset by those shots tonight?
I fired those shots.
- You what?
- Yes. To create a diversion.
I had to get away from the theatre quickly.
There were two men there who wanted to kill me.
You should be more careful in choosing your friends.
- No you don't understand.
- You don't make it easy.
Beautiful mysterious woman pursued by gunmen... sounds like a spy story.
That's exactly what it is.
Only I prefer the word agent better.
- Agent? For what country?
- Any country that pays me.
- But what is your country.
- I have no country.
Born in a balloon.
Well, we'll let that go.
Now I suppose you're over here to dig up some big state secret.
No I'm here to save a secret from being dug up... a very important secret for this country... not because I love England but because it will pay me better.
You see a very brilliant agent of a certain foreign power... is on the point of obtaining a secret vital to your air defence.
I tracked 2 of his men to that music hall.
Unfortunately they recognised me.
That's why they're after me now.
That was too bad.
Have you ever heard of a thing called persecution mania?
- You don't believe me?
- Frankly, I don't.
Go and look down into the street.
You win.
- Are they there?
- Yes.
I hoped I'd shaken them off.
I'm going to tell you something... which is not very healthy to know, but now that they followed me here...
- you're in it as much as I am.
- What do you mean?
- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps?
- No. What's that, a pub?
Never mind. But what you were laughing at just now is true.
These men will stick at nothing
I'm the only one who can stop them.
If they are not stopped, it's only a matter of days, perhaps hours... before the secret is out of the country.
Why don't you phone the police?
Because they wouldn't believe me any more than you did.
And if they did, how long would it take to get them going?
These men act quickly. You don't know how clever their chief is...
- clever and ruthless.
- Who is he? What's his name?
He has a dozen names and can look like a hundred people.
But one thing he can't disguise.
This part of his finger is missing.
So if ever you should meet a man with no top joint there...
- be very careful my friend.
- Thanks, I'll make a note of it.
- Meanwhile, what are you going to do?
- First, I'll eat my haddock. Then... if you don't turn me out into the street, have a good night's rest.
You're welcome to my bed
I'll get a shakedown on the couch.
Is there anything else
I can get you?
- A map of Scotland.
- Why Scotland?
There's a man in Scotland I must visit next if anything is to be done.
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland by any chance?
Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.
Clear out Hannay.
They'll get you next.
What you were laughing at right now is true.
These men will stop at nothing.
There's a man in Scotland I must visit next if anything is to be done.
It is only a matter of days.
Perhaps hours... before the secret is out of the country.
The police would not believe me any more than you did.
I tell you these men act quickly... quickly... quickly.
Good morning sir. You're up bright and early this morning.
- Could you use a pound note, brother?
- What's the catch?
- I want to borrow your cap and coat.
- What's the big idea?
- I want to make a getaway.
- Do a bunk?
- Yes.
- What have you been up to?
I'll have to trust you. There's been a murder on the first floor.
- By you?
- No. By those 2 men out there.
Now I suppose they're waiting for a copper to come and arrest them.
It's quite true. They're spies.
Foreigners.
They've murdered a woman in my flat and now they're waiting for me.
Come off it. Funny jokes at 5 in the morning.
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
- Are you married?
- Yes, but don't rub it in.
- What's the idea now?
- Well I'm not. I'm a bachelor.
- Are you?
- A married woman lives on 1st floor.
- Does she?
- Yes. I've been paying her a call... and now I want to go home.
- Well what's preventing you?
- One of those men is her husband.
- Now do you see?
- Why didn't you tell me before?
I only wanted to be told.
Trying to kid me with a load of tales about murders and foreigners...
Put this on, put on my little hat.
There you are.
- Take the pound.
- No sir, you're welcome to it...
You'll do the same for me one day.
Leave the pony round the corner.
- So long, old sport.
- Goodbye. Thank you.
The empties.
Papers, magazines, chocolates, cigarettes...
There he is.
For one thing. They're much prettier than they were twenty years ago.
- More free, free and easy.
- You're right there...
I can never understand how people used to put up with the old sort... all bones and no bends.
I will say for the old sort they did last longer.
I dunno, mine last about a year.
Here I'll show you.
Big demand for these now.
- The old fashioned sort.
- My wife.
Now take a look at these.
Our new streamlined model no.1
- What I've been talking about.
- Anything to go with it?
I should say so. This. Put a pretty girl inside those... and she needn't be ashamed anywhere.
- Bring it back to me when it's filled.
- I will.
Hello, what's this? Edinburgh,
Waverly. We're getting on.
I hope you'll pardon us for talking business sir.
Certainly, certainly.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.
- Broadminded old geezer.
- Bet he's very good at charades.
I wonder what won the 2 o'clock at Windsor.
I don't know, let's get a paper.
Say, son, speeka da English?
Dispatch.
- Hello.
- Well, what won it?
There's been another woman murdered in a West End flat.
- What?
- Woman murdered in West End flat.
Oh these sex dramas don't appeal to me. What won?
- Batchelor's Button, 7 to four on.
- Oh, not so good.
Portland Mansions, Portland Place...
By the BBC. That's a nice place to put someone to sleep.
Goodnight everybody, goodnight.
That's a good one. What was she like?
One of the usual?
A well dressed woman of about 35 with a knife in her back...
- The Tenant Richard Hannay is missing.
- You surprise me.
At 7 o'clock this morning, the charwoman Elisabeth Briggs...
- Well if that isn't the blasted limit.
- What's the matter now?
Is there no honesty in this world?
I ask you. The new Bodyline
Rubber Panty Corset... on sale today. McHutchen Brothers,
Princess St... Price 17/9d...
Brassiere to match 4/11 d.
Do you get that?
The bodyline, 1/3d cheaper than our Streamline...
- no use going to Aberdeen now.
- Might I have a look at your paper?
Certainly.
- Thank you.
- That's all right.
There's enough evidence there to hang any man.
What can I do for you sir?
Can you tell me what station the train stops at next?
What do you think I am, a railway porter? Go and find out for yourself.
- I'll tell you a better one presently.
- You couldn't. That was very funny.
Have you heard the one about the young lady of Onga?
I can't remember them all.
There was a young lady of Onga...
- Taking tea, sir?
- Yes. Thank you.
Darling, how lovely to see you.
Someone having a free meal in there.
I'm terribly sorry, I had to do it.
My name's Hannay, they're after me.
I'm innocent. You must help me.
I must keep free for the next 2 days.
Have either of you seen a man passing in the last few minutes?
This is the man you want, I think.
- But when we passed just now...
- He forced me and told me he was.
- Is your name Hannay?
- Are you coming into tea, sir?
I'll be right along.
Pull that cord!
Go on man, down that end.
Get on with it.
- Why did you pull the cord?
- To stop the train you old fool.
It's against regulations to stop the train on the bridge.
- A man jumped off.
- A murderer, we've got to take him.
- Which way did he go?
- He must have jumped off here.
- I can't see him.
- I can't wait here any longer.
There he is getting on the train.
No that's a passenger.
- It's him I tell you.
- Come on then.
Extra, extra!
About 5 foot 10. small moustache.
Last seen wearing a dark suit... but he may have obtained a change of clothing.
- Good day.
- And to you.
- What'll your business be?
- I'm a mechanic looking for a job.
- You'll find no work about here.
- Are there no big houses round here?
Sir Andrews'. He won't want you. He's had the same chauffeur for 40 years.
- I didn't know there'd been cars that long.
- He was coachman when he was a boy.
Oh I see.
What's that?
That's the Manse but the minister hasn't got a motor car.
Are there no newcomers?
- Aye, there's an English professor.
- Professor?
He lives at Alt Na Shallach, the other side of the Loch.
Would that be anywhere near that village?
- It would.
- Thanks. I'll try there.
You won't try tonight, it's 14 miles.
Do you think I could get a lift in that van?
It's bound the other way.
I guess you're right. Could you put me up for the night somehow?
- Free?
- No, I'll pay.
- Aye. Can you eat a herring?
- I could eat half a dozen right now.
- Can you sleep in a box bed?
- I can try.
- Two and six.
- Take it now. Thank you.
Go in with the gentlemen. He'll stay with us until tomorrow morning.
Your daughter?
My wife.
- Will you not come in?
- Thank you.
Here's your bed.
I'll lift these things.
- Could you sleep there do you think?
- You try and stop me.
You'll be tired?
I'll say I am. Out on the tramp looking for a job.
Sit down please, while
I go on with our supper.
Thank you.
- Have you been in these parts long?
- No. I'm from Glasgow.
- Did you ever see it?
- No.
You should see Saughiehall street with all it's fine shops... and Argyle street on a Saturday night with the trams and the lights... and the cinema palaces and the crowds...
- And its Saturday night tonight.
- You don't get those things here.
No.
Do you miss them?
Sometimes.
I've never been to Glasgow, but I've been to Edinburgh, and London...
I'll tell you about
London at supper.
- John wouldn't approve of that.
- Why not?
He says it's best not to think of such places... and the wickedness that goes on there.
Listen now before he comes back.
What do you want to know?
Is it true that all the ladies paint their toenails?
- Some of them.
- Do London ladies look beautiful?
They do. But they wouldn't if you were beside them.
- You ought not to say that.
- What ought he not to say?
I was just telling your wife that
I prefer the town to the country.
God made the country.
Is the supper ready woman?
- May I look at your paper?
- I don't mind.
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Hammond.
Well Mr Hammond, if you'll put down that paper, I'll say a blessing.
Yes, of course.
Sanctify these bounteous mercies to us miserable sinners.
Oh lord make us truely thankful for all thy manifold blessings... and continuously turn our hearts from wickedness... and from worldly things unto thee...
Amen.
I mind I forgot to lock the barn.
There are police cars coming.
You best be going.
- I was so asleep.
- Don't let them catch you.
I'll never forget you for this.
Which way do I go?
I'll show you.
Aye, I might have known...
Making love behind my back...
Get out. And you too.
Get out of my house before I...
- Aye, go go.
- And leave you like this?
- It's your chance of liberty.
- You don't understand...
You're wrong.
She's only trying to help me.
- To bring shame upon the house.
- To help me to escape from the police.
- The police?
- They're after me for murder.
They're here. She came to warn me.
I told her about it last night.
Don't let them in. Say I'm not here.
I'll make it worth your while.
How much? Have you got that much? Give it to me.
After they've gone.
Get back into the bed.
Shut him in. Hide him.
- No not there. I don't trust him.
- But he took the money.
He couldn't resist it, here...
I was right, he's asking if there's a reward if you get catched.
He'll argue a moment before he lets them in. Now's your time.
Your jackets terrible light coloured
I'm afraid they'll see you.
- You best take this one.
- Is this your husband's coat?
His Sunday best one. But never mind. They mustn't see you.
- What about you?
- I'll say I couldn't stop you.
- He'll not ill treat you?
- He'll pray at me. But no more.
What's your name?
I'll never forget you for this.
There he goes.
Spread out in a line.
- Is the master in?
- What name shall I say sir?
He wouldn't know my name but ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith.
- Would you wait here while I enquire?
- Yes all right.
We better make enquiries.
Somebody might have seen him.
There's been a couple of cars here.
Murderers don't pay calls in cars.
- Good day to you.
- Good day to you.
Have you seen any strangers about this morning?
There's a few callers upstairs now but they're not strangers.
You haven't seen any suspicious bodies outside the windows or at the house.
No sir. There hasn't been anybody near here for the last half hour.
- You're from Annabella Smith?
- Yes.
We're having a few drinks to celebrate my daughter Hilary's birthday.
Give me 5 minutes to get rid of these people and then we can talk.
Come along and meet my wife. Louisa, another guest. This is Mr...
- I forgot to ask your name.
- Hammond.
Mr Hammond. He's come to see me on business, all the way from London.
There's a police inspector at the door. He wants to speak to you.
The door?
All right, all right.
I'll deal with this.
- Take him in my dear will you please.
- Come on...
This is Patricia...
Mrs Bailley.
Hilary my dear this is Mr...
Hammond, just arrived from London.
How do you do. Forgive the orgy, we've all been to church... the sermon lasted 45 minutes.
This is Captain and Mrs Ogilvie.
Have a drink Mr Hammond?
This is Derek, Derek Stewart...
And this is Sheriff Watson.
You've got to be polite to him.
He's our Sheriff substitute.
Scotch for a local beat.
Give you 6 months hard as soon as look at you.
It's all right don't worry.
I've sent them away.
Come and look at the view from this window Mr Hammond.
We're rather proud of it.
Sheriff, when are you going to catch that murderer?
- What murderer?
- Haven't you heard?
The man who stuck a knife into that woman in Portland place.
- He's in the district.
- How exciting, where?
Somewhere about. On the moors, bridge of Orchy or somewhere.
Why don't you catch him?
You wouldn't like me to be stuck in the back with a knife.
It's not my business.
You catch him and I'll convict him.
- Is there a reward?
- Gracious, it's nearly 1 o'clock.
We must get out of here.
The Professor wants his lunch.
There's no hurry. But if you must go.
Pat, ring for Captain Ogilvie's car.
Whenever you catch him you'll find me at the court at 10 every morning... so bring him along.
Louisa, forgive us, Mr Hammond and
I want to have a chat before lunch.
Now Mr. Hannay. I suppose it's safe to call you by your real name now.
- What about our friend Annabella?
- She's been murdered.
Murdered?
The Portland Mansion affaire.
What are they looking for you for?
- I didn't do it.
- Of course you didn't.
But why come all this way to Scotland to tell me about it?
I believe she was coming to see you about some Air Ministry secret.
She was killed by a foreign agent who was interested too.
- Did she tell you what he was like?
- There wasn't time.
There was one thing, part of his little finger was missing.
- Which one?
- This one, I think.
Sure it wasn't this one?
- Lunch is ready dear.
- I'm coming right away.
Well, I'm afraid I'm guilty of leading you down the garden path... or should it be up?
I never can remember.
It seems to be the wrong garden all right.
- What are we going to do about it?
- That's just the point.
What are we going to do about it?
You see I live here as a respectable citizen and you must realise... that my whole existence would be jeopardised if it became known... that I am not, what shall we say, not what I seem.
Oh Mr Hannay, why have you come here?
Why have you forced me into this difficult position?
I can't lock you up in a room. I've my wife and daughters to think of...
I don't know what to think, really I don't...
What makes it doubly important that I shouldn't let you go is... that I'm just about to convey some vital information out of the country.
Oh yes, I've got it.
Poor Annabella would've been too late in any case.
- Well, that's that.
- Yes, well what about it?
- What about what?
- About yourself...
- It seems there's only one way out.
- And what's that?
Supposing I left you alone, with this revolver.
Tomorrow's newspapers could announce that the Portland Place murderer...
- had taken his own life.
- I thought you were coming to lunch...
We're all waiting.
Will Mr Hannay be staying?
I don't think so dear.
Well, what do you think Mr Hannay?
Well I'm afraid you leave me no alternative.
I can't find my hymn book.
Where did you leave it?
In the breast pocket of my overcoat it was hanging here.
John, I'm afraid I gave it to that gentleman who stayed here that night.
Cigarette cases yes, but I've never seen it happen to a hymn book.
This bullet stuck among the hymns.
Well I'm not surprised, Mr Hannay... some of these hymns are terribly hard to get through.
I'm not complaining Sheriff.
"Hymns that have helped me".
That's a good one, Mr Hannay.
That's fine.
And to think I was drinking his champagne only half an hour before.
It's a lesson to us all, not to mix with doubtful company on the Sabbath.
- How did you escape?
- Look out the window and you'll see.
They put... They body in the dressing room.
When I came to I borrowed this suit and pinched his car.
Sheriff, I don't want to hurry you, but oughtn't we to be taking steps?
This is serious you know. If not, you don't think I'd come to you...
- with a murder charge hanging over me.
- Never heed the murder Mr Hannay.
You'll convince Scotland Yard of your innocence like you convinced me.
All I'll need is a short statement I can forward to the proper authority.
I've someone coming over from the police station to take it down.
- Are you waiting to see me Sheriff?
- Indeed I am.
Do you think I enjoy playing for time with a murderer?
- Murderer?
- Certainly.
Hannay, you're under arrest for wilful murder... of a woman unknown in Portland
Mansions, London, last Tuesday.
Take him over to the jail.
You must believe my story, it's true every word.
We're not so daft in Scotland as some smart Londoners think.
Do you think I believed your story about the Professor?
He's my best friend.
Get me Professor Jordan.
Where did that bullet come from?
From one of your pursuers on the moor. Isn't that so?
I had a shot at him myself.
Let me phone the High Commissioner for Canada in London.
You better do that from London.
You'll be there soon enough.
It'll save you the cost of a trunk call.
That's the Professor's car all right.
Hannay must be inside spilling the beans.
- Stop him there!
- My God!
How do you do?
We're all waiting for you.
Pamela's gone to meet you at the station. This way, this way.
...From our respected leader and standard bearer himself...
I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you another question vital... to the import of our country at this critical and momentous hour.
But first of all, as a preliminary to this, I shall occupy your time for...
- You've occupied too much already.
- We've had enough of you!
Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now call upon the speaker of the evening...
Speak out!
There's no need for me to tell you who he is or speak of his record... as a soldier and statesman, a son of Scotland...
- Speak out!
- The border and conquered England... one of the foremost figures of the diplomatic world in London.
I'm therefore going to ask him to tell you something...
And about time too!
Important to this constituency that at this crucial by-election... our candidate should be returned by an adequate majority.
I now ask for Captain Fraser.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I apologise for my hesitation in rising... but to tell you the simple truth
I'd entirely failed... while listening to the chairman's flattering description... to realise he was talking about me.
For you, may I say from the bottom of my heart with the upmost sincerely... how delighted and relieved I am to find myself in your presence here.
Delighted because of your friendly reception, relieved because... as long, as I stand on this platform...
I'm delivered from the anxieties... which must always be the lot of a man in my position.
When I journeyed up to Scotland a few days ago on the Highland Express... over that magnificent structure, the Fourth Bridge... that monument to Scottish engineering and Scottish muscle... on that journey I had no idea that in a few days I would find myself... addressing an important political meeting, no idea...
I'd planned a very different programme for myself.
You'd be for the moors to shoot something.
Yes, or somebody,
I'm a rotten shot.
Anyhow I little thought that I should be speaking tonight in support of... that brilliant young statesman, that rising, the gentleman on my right.
Already known as one destined to make his mark in politics.
Your future Member of Parliament, your candidate, Mr...
- McCrocodile.
- He doesn't know the candidate's name.
I know your candidate will forgive my referring to him... by the friendly nickname by which he's already known in anticipation... in anticipation, mark you...
Westminster.
Now ladies and gentlemen, we'll discuss some topic. What shall it be?
- The herring fisheries.
- Unemployment.
- What about the idle rich?
- The idle rich?
That's an old fashioned topic, especially for me. I'm not rich... and I've never been idle.
I've been very busy all my life...
- and expect to be much busier soon.
- Have you ever worked with your hands?
Indeed I have, and I've known what it is to feel lonely and helpless... and to have the whole world against me... and those are things that no man or woman ought to feel.
I ask your candidate and all those who love their fellow men... to set themselves resolutely to make the world a happier place... a world where no nation plots against nation... no neighbour plots against neighbour... where there is no persecution or hunting down... where everyone gets a square deal and a sporting chance... and where people try to help and not to hinder... a world where suspicion and cruelty and fear have been forever banished!
That's the sort of world I want.
Is that the sort of world you want?
That's all I have to say, goodnight.
- I did what I could for you.
- You're a difficult man to follow.
- I guess you think you've been clever.
- Tell your prisoner not to insult me.
- You try and stop me.
- Come along.
Couldn't you realise I was telling the truth in that train?
You must've seen I was genuine.
Whether you believe me or not... put a telephone call through to the High Commissioner for Canada... and tell him that an enormously important secret...
An important secret is being taken out of the country by a foreign agent.
I can't do it myself because of this fool detective. Has that penetrated?
Right to the funny bone, now tell me another one.
Haven't you any sense at all?
Put that call through...
I beg you refer them to me.
Will you do this?
No. Goodnight.
I beg pardon Miss but we should like you to come too.
- Whatever for?
- To identify the prisoner formally.
Will you come to the police station?
It's only for a few minutes.
All right, if it's absolutely necessary, lets get it over.
Now you...
- Must I sit next to this man?
- It's just a moment.
Well, be as quick as you can.
Isn't that the police station?
You past it.
You must've misunderstood me.
We're going somewhere else.
- Where are we going?
- To Inverary.
- Inverary?
- Yes.
This man is to be questioned by the Sheriff Principal.
- We've orders to take him there.
- But not to take me.
I'm afraid you must go. You'll be sent back at the earliest moment.
- How far is it to Inverary?
- Forty miles.
Will you keep quiet?
We'll be there in less than 2 hours.
I'm not going to spend the night with you all.
Looks like it.
Isn't he going the wrong way?
That's the way to Inverary.
There's a bridge down on that road. We have to go round. He knows the way.
- Might I see your warrant?
- You shut your mouth.
You'll see it soon enough when we get to the station.
Like to have a small bet with me Pamela?
All right I'll have it with you
Sherlock. A hundred to one that... your Sheriff Principal has the top joint of his little finger missing.
What about it?
I win.
Hello. What are we stopping for?
Oh it's a whole flock of detectives.
They're all over the road, get out there and clear them away.
- What about him?
- I'll soon fix that.
There miss, now you're a special constable.
- What's the idea? What do you mean?
- As long as you stay, he stays.
Yes, and as long as I go, you go. Come on!
Stop them!
They've got away.
- Come on, we must run for it.
- I won't.
See if they've gone down that way.
Where the devil can they have gone?
Help!
Let me go, let me go!
Shut up or I'll shoot you first and myself after.
There's nobody down here I tell you.
Then come up here, don't waste any more time. Spread out and find them.
They must be a mile away by now.
Don't do that.
Oh do stop whistling.
Why are you doing this?
What chance have you got tied to me?
Keep that question for your husband.
I admit you're a white man's burden.
I know and I can't tell you what comfort that gives me.
What is the use? Those policemen will get you as soon as it's daylight.
- They're not policemen.
- When did you find out?
You did it yourself. I didn't known that was the wrong road to Inverary.
They were taking us to their boss,
God help us if they ever catch us.
I see, you're still sticking to your penny novelette spy story.
Of the 20 million women in this
Island I've got to be chained to you.
Listen, I'm telling you the truth.
I told you on the train... and after that election meeting. I'm telling you now for the third time.
There's a dangerous conspiracy and we're the only people who can stop it.
Think what you've seen happen right here under your very nose.
- The gallant knight to the rescue.
- All right.
Then I'm just a plain common murderer... who stabbed an innocent defenceless woman in the back... how do you come out of that? I don't know how innocent you may be... but you're a woman, defenceless and alone on a desolate moor in the dark.
Manacled to a murderer who'd stop at nothing to get you off his hands.
If that's the situation you prefer, have it my lovely, and welcome.
I'm not afraid of...
For all you know I may murder a woman a week.
So listen to a bit of advice.
From now on, do every single thing
I tell you to do, and do it quick.
- You big bully!
- I like your pluck. Come on.
We're going in there.
That's my business.
Now remember what I said, the civil tongue, or else...
We're going in there and you will back me up in everything I say or do.
- Has that penetrated the ivory dome?
- Only just.
Pull yourself together now.
Put your hand in my pocket... and look as if you're in a hurry.
Come along.
Come in man, come in sir.
Oh the young lady's terribly wet.
Yes, we had an accident with our car a few miles back.
- Oh, you'll be staying the night?
- Yes.
We've just the one room left with the one bed in it. You'll not mind that?
No, quite the reverse.
- You're man and wife I suppose?
- Oh yes.
- Yes.
- Have you any luggage?
No, we left that behind in the car.
Well maybe I could lend the young lady a nightgown.
Will you please register?
James, the book.
I'll away up and light a fire.
Will you be needing your supper?
No, thank you. Just send up a large whisky and soda and a few sandwiches.
Oh, and a glass of milk.
I can't write with my left hand my dear but I can shoot with it.
You can guess what's in this pocket.
You sign, the sooner you get used to writing your new name, the better.
Off we go, Mr and Mrs Henry Hopkinson
The Hollyhocks, Hammersmith.
Now dearie, off with that wet skirt,
I'll have it dried in the kitchen.
Oh don't bother. It'll dry in front of the fire just the same.
No doubt the gentleman will take care of you. Good night sir.
- Good night man.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Is he married to her do you think?
- I don't know and I don't care.
They're so terribly in love with each other.
I'm going to tell them the whole story.
You want to hang me for a murder I didn't commit?
So long as they hang you.
Let me go! I'm not going to spend the night here?
Of course you are, what else can you do?
Can I come in sir?
Come in.
We were just getting warm before the fire.
I can see that. I thought maybe you'd like this in your bed, sir.
Thank you. You'd like a hot water bottle my sweet?
- Say "Yes darling".
- Yes darling.
- Very well.
- Please don't go!
Why not?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not, she wants to tell you something that's all.
We're a runaway couple.
I knew it all the time, and they're after you?
You won't give us away will you?
Please.
Of course we will not give you up.
Good night to you both.
You'll not be disturbed.
Thank God for a bite to eat.
Come along. There you are.
- What's next on the programme?
- Get these things off.
Right. How are we going to set about it?
Anything in that bag of yours? A pair of scissors or hairpin or something?
A nail file if you think that'd help.
It'll take about 10 years but we can try.
Now let's make ourselves as comfortable as possible.
What about that skirt of yours?
It's still pretty damp you know.
Don't want to be tied to a pneumonia case on top of everything else.
- Take it off, I don't mind.
- I'll keep it on, thank you.
And that, is that.
My shoes and stockings are soaked.
I'll take them off.
That's the first sensible thing
I've heard you say.
- Can I be of any assistance?
- No, thank you.
Fine.
- Here hold this.
- Yes.
Half a minute.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Would you like your milk now?
- No thank you. I'll wait a little.
That's better. Now are your feet quite warm again?
- Yes, thanks.
- Well come on.
Will you kindly place yourself on the operating table?
Nobody's going to hurt you.
This is Armistice day.
- Lets get some rest.
- I'm not going to lie on this bed.
You're chained to me, you'll lie wherever I lie...
- we're the Siamese twins.
- Don't gloat!
You think I'm looking forward to waking up and seeing your face?
Unwashed and shiny?
What a sight you'll be.
Give me that nail file.
Lets have a go at this.
Thank you.
I wish I could get that damned tune out of my head...
I wonder where I heard it.
- You sound very sleepy.
- Sleepy! I'll say so.
Do you know when
I last slept in a bed?
Saturday night. Then I only got a couple of hours.
- What made you wake? Dreams?
- What do you mean?
They say murderers have terrible dreams.
Only at first. Got over that a long time ago... when I first took to crime I was quite squeamish about it.
- I was a sensitive child.
- You surprise me.
Used to wake up in night screaming thinking the police were after me... but one gets hardened.
How did you start?
In quite a small way, pilfering from other children at school.
Then a little pocket picking, car pinching, smash and grab... and so on, to plain burglary.
Killed my first man when I was 19...
In years to come you can take your grandchildren to Madame Tussaud's...
- and point me out.
- Which section?
It's early to say, I'm still young.
I'll be in one department or another.
Yes, you'll point me out and say:
"Chicks, if I told you how matey...
I once was with that gentleman, you'd be surprised". What's the matter?
You're pinching my wrist with this handcuff.
Sorry. Talking about Madame
Tussaud's. That's how it all began.
- What began?
- My career of crime... all hereditary,
Great Uncle Penruddock.
Who was he?
Where were you brought up? Never heard of my great uncle Penruddock... the Cornish Bluebeard?
Got it all from him.
I thought your family came from Canada.
No that's where they went after the Penruddock incident.
Murdered 3 wives and got away with it but his third mother-in-law... got the goods on him and tried to have him arrested.
Did she succeed? No.
He was too quick for her.
Took her for a walk to Land's End and shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean.
He's in Madame Tussaud's and there's no doubt about his department.
You must go down to see him sometime.
Can't mistake him...
Third on the left as you go in, red whiskers and a hair lip.
And that lady, is the sad story of my life... poor orphan boy, who never had a chance... are you still set on giving me up to the police?
You're sure everything's going to be quite all right?
Bound to be. He can't have much time.
As soon as I've picked up...
You know what, I'll clear out of the country.
Be careful.
Wire to me.
- Good bye my dear.
- Good bye.
Is that Professor Jordan's house?
Can I speak to Mrs Jordan then?
Is that Mrs Jordan?
Oh, he's gone to London.
I'd like that whiskey hot.
I'll get the hot water.
He dodged down a side street.
The police took the wrong way.
The girl handed him over to us thinking we were detectives.
We had to take her as well because he told her everything.
Very good ma'am, I see.
Yes, ma'am.
- Well?
- The old man's got the wind up.
- He's cleared out already.
- Whatever for?
Thought it too dangerous with Hannay on the loose... he's warning the whole 39 steps.
Has he got the, you know?
Yes. He's picking up our friend at the London Palladium on the way out.
Here's your toddy.
That'll be half a crown.
- And the phone call.
- We'll say a shilling.
- Is this a hotel as well?
- Aye.
- Do you have people staying here?
- Aye.
I suppose you get a few odd people at this time of the year?
Oh, aye.
You didn't happen to have anyone in tonight, did you?
Aye.
They weren't by any chance a young couple, were they?
James!
Mercy me! What kind of a silly creature am I married to?
Want to get us all jailed?
How much did you take for these?
Half a crown.
Out the pair of you. Don't let on that you got a drink here after hours.
You old fool you. You wouldn't have given away a young couple.
Good morning.
What's the idea? How did we get out of these?
You didn't. I slipped out of mine last night... and camped out here.
- Why didn't you run away?
- I did, but as I was going...
I discovered you've been speaking the truth so I decided to stay.
What earthquake caused your brain to work at last?
I overheard those men telephoning.
- What did they say?
- A lot of stuff about the 39 steps.
Go on.
Someone's going to warn them.
How can you warn steps?
Go on.
There was another thing, someone's got scared and is clearing out and...
Oh yes, he's picking up someone at the London Palladium.
The London Palladium?
Is that the Professor? Our friend with the little finger missing.
What does he want to go there for?
I feel such a fool, not having believed you.
Oh that's all right.
We ought to get a move on.
What room are those 2 men in?
No room. They went as soon as they had telephoned.
They what?
- Didn't I tell you?
- You let them go?
- You little idiot!
- Don't talk to me like that.
4 or 5 precious hours wasted.
Why didn't you wake me up?
You should've realised what they said was important.
They've called these men off why not let well alone?
Let well alone? My good girl,
I'm accused of murder.
The only way I can clear myself is to expose these spies.
You still can. He's going to the London Palladium.
First or second house?
I'll get there 5 hours late.
- The show should just about suit you!
- What's that?
Crazy Month!
You're quite right madam.
The Air Ministry has a new thing lots of people are interested in... but they are positive that no papers are missing about it... that would be of any use to a spy.
I'm quite sure. There's a man leaving the country tonight with something.
Since you phoned from Scotland this morning we've made enquiries.
- It's obvious I'm wasting my time.
- Just a moment please.
There's one thing you haven't told us.
Where's Richard Hannay?
I haven't the faintest idea.
- Now look here, you can't...
- You're in the phone book, aren't you?
Well if anything crops up we'll give you a ring. That's all now. Thank you.
Tell Archer and Seagrave to get another taxi and follow that girl.
She'll lead us to Hannay alright.
Cover every exit and on no account let anyone leave the building.
You 2 go in the orchestra pit.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We shall now sing.
No one's allowed to leave the theatre.
Can't a man go out and get a drink?
My seat's in the stalls. I'm looking for someone. May I go through?
She's seen him. She's on her way down to the stalls now sir.
Can I borrow your opera glasses?
Can I take your place please?
What are you doing here?
Listen, he's in that box.
You can't do anything,
I've been to Scotland Yard.
Nothing's been stolen from the Air Ministry.
But you heard those men and there he is.
Shall we take him now sir, or wait until the interval?
What are you going to do?
Nothing's taken and that's the end.
Do you hear that tune? The damned tune I couldn't get out of my head.
Now I know where I heard it before.
That music hall, Annabella Smith.
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have now the honour to present to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.
- The same little man.
- Every day... he commits to memory 50 new facts and remembers every one.
Facts from history, geography, from newspapers and scientific textbooks.
Millions and millions of them, down to the smallest detail.
Test him ladies and gentlemen.
Ask him any question...
I've got it. Of course there are no papers missing.
All the information is inside Memory's head.
Mr Memory.
- But I still don't understand.
- Don't you see?
The details of that Air Ministry secret were borrowed and memorised by... and then replaced before anyone could find out. That's why he's here tonight... to take Memory out of the country after the show.
Some gentlemen here would like to speak to you.
A question please, a question please.
- When did Florence Nightingale die?
- What is the height...
- There's something you must know.
- OK, Hannay. Come quietly.
You don't want to cause trouble and spoil people's entertainment.
What are the 39 Steps?
Come on, answer that.
What are the 39 Steps?
The 39 Steps is an organisation of Spies... collecting information for...
Keep your seats.
Keep your seats, please.
There's no need for alarm.
No cause for alarm.
I don't want a chair.
Let me rest here. I'm alright.
Take it easy.
Get the girls on straight away.
The girl's introduction right away.
What was the secret formula you were taking out of the country?
Will it be alright me telling you?
It was a big job to learn it.
The biggest job I ever tackled and
I don't want to throw it all away.
It will be quite all right.
The first feature of the new engine is its ratio of compression... represented by R minus one over R to the power of Gamma.
Gamma seen in end-elevation, axis of the 2 lines of cylinders... angle of 65 degrees.
Dimensions of cylinders as follows.
This device renders the engine completely silent.
- Am I right, sir?
- Quite right old chap.
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
I'm glad it's off my mind at last.
Records indicate most murders result from violence.
And murder without bloodstains like, uh, Amos without Andy-
Most unusual.
Therefore, study of bloodstain evidence... most helpful in reconstruction of crime.
Will demonstrate with eyedropper.
Number one-
Drop of blood falling in straight line from short distance... make round spot, so.
Number two-
Falling from greater distance... exhibit sunburst effect.
But observe.
Drop of blood thrown forward, as from knife held in hand...
make entirely different mark.
Hey, fellas! I got the inside dope!
Put your shirt on Avalanche's nose.
- Holy mackerel! We forgot the Melbourne Sweepstakes.
- Turn on the radio.
Excuse us, Charlie.
This is more important than murder.
But, gee, Pop.
- Sign on door say, "Please knock."
- Did I interrupt something?
Train of thought now need wrecking crew.
Gee, Pop, I'm sorry.
But this is a hot tip!
Hot tip does not explain mystery of shirt on nose of Avalanche.
Avalanche is a horse running in the sweepstakes.
What the kid means is to plank your dough on the nag's schnozola.
All very clear.
Thank you so much.
Any of you fellows gonna bet? I've got three minutes to get to the bookies.
- I'll take a chance. Ten smackers.
- Count me in for five.
- Hey, Mack, loan me two bits, and I'll owe you a dollar.
- Here.
- Want to get in the gravy, Pop?
- Smart fly keep out of gravy.
Aw, Pop, you ought to bet on Avalanche for old times' sake.
Correction, please.
Horse complete stranger.
But the horse's owner isn't.
He's your friend, Major Kent.
Major Kent?
Will become reckless gambler for sake of old friend.
Will bet tail of shirt-
50 cents on, uh, "schnozalola."
Attaboy, Pop!
Here they are.
Gathered to witness the greatest sporting event of the Australian turf... the Melbourne Cup.
There goes the bugle, calling the aristocracy of turfdom onto the field.
The entry list has never been equaled during all the years...
in which the cup has been this country's greatest race.
Number one, Gunsmith, two, Flying Scotchman, three, Stardust, four, Avalanche...
the great Australian four-year-old with Tip Collins in the saddle...
and owned by Mr. George Chester, the internationally-known sportsman from the U.S.A.
Well, there's justice for you.
Your father gives four of the best years of his life to raising that animal... and I grab all the honor.
Do you regret your generous impulse, Major?
Oh, I wasn't as generous as I was clever.
This way I keep everything in the family.
Truthfully, George, did you marry me for myself alone or for Dad's horse?
- Why for the horse, of course.
- Spoken like a gentleman.
- As a friend, I'd advise you to do something about that.
- What can I do?
- Divorce him. Marry me.
- What? Another racing man? No, thank you.
Dad, I barely got our bets down on time.
Did you get the rest of my money placed, Bruce?
- Yes, sir. Just before the odds fell again.
- Good work.
- Will that be all, sir?
- That'll be all until I collect.
If you collect. You seem pretty confident.
I am confident.
Still think your husband's entry will win, Mrs. Chester?
- I bet you a hundred he will.
- I'll take that bet.
- How about another thousand, Denny?
- I'll take that one too.
The horses are reaching the starting gate. Gunsmith has the rail.
Hello, hello, hello.
One of them's cutting up out there.
- Are they off?
- It's Avalanche.
He's certainly living up to his reputation as a bad actor.
- Hold on there. He nearly threw his rider.
- Hey, Avalanche, cut it out!
- And it looks as if he'll be off to a bad start.
- Good-bye, shirttail.
Now they're getting in line. Avalanche has quieted down, and it looks like a start.
It is a start! And they're off!
It's a beautiful start!
Go, Avalanche!
Come on, Avalanche!
Flying Scotchman takes the lead!
Gunsmith, a close second!
Avalanche coming up as they go into the first turn.
Gunsmith closing behind Scotchman.
Stardust, only a length away!
- Come on, Avalanche!
- Come on, Avalanche!
Ace is telling on Flying
Scotchman, Stardust gaining!
- Come on, Avalanche!
- He's gaining!
Flying Scotchman is failing!
Avalanche is coming up!
Come on, Collins!
Ride him! Ride him!
Avalanche is neck and neck with Stardust!
Avalanche has taken the lead!
He's cutting over on the rail!
- Avalanche fouled him.
- Avalanche fouled him!
- Collins must be insane.
- He deliberately threw that race.
Have that jockey report to the office.
Shirttail now bobtail.
Well, anyway, Pop, we were on the best horse.
The cards were just against us.
That's all.
When player cannot see man who deal cards, much wiser to stay out of game.
When he took the lead he fought for the rail.
Avalanche does it almost every time.
You trained the horse, Bagley.
What about it?
He has a slight pull to the left, but
Collins should've been able to handle him.
It wasn't my fault, I tell you.
Avalanche is good enough to win on his own.
You fouled Stardust, and you did it purposely.
- Why? Who paid you to do it?
- Nobody paid me!
Never mind, Major.
That's enough now.
I didn't throw the race!
I wouldn't do that.
You're suspended from further racing for two years.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
This is no reflection on you, Mr. Chester.
We have no alternative but to disqualify Avalanche.
Well, of all the feather-brained fools
I ever saw, you're it.
A blind man could have seen you pull that foul.
You said to foul him, and I did.
I told you to make it look like an accident.
Here are your tickets on Stardust.
Hey, what is this? I thought my cut was gonna be five grand.
This stuff has to be split too many ways.
That's just fine. For a measly two grand
I get ruled off the track... and you stay here and stuff your own pockets.
I'm only following instructions.
You'll be taken care of.
- I'd better be.
- You will. Now, get out of here and lay low.
There's a gambling ring back of this.
I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
Major, there's nothing we can do about it. I lost. That's all there is to it.
There'll be other races this year.
Avalanche will clean up a fortune.
It's more than a question of money. We're taking our horse to America for the first time.
How do you think this scandal will reflect on us personally?
We've got to clear it up.
- Bruce!
- Yes, sir?
Bruce, cable Charlie Chan.
- Dad, please don't get mixed up in this.
- We're already mixed up in it.
Cable Mr. Chan all the details what's happened.
- Have him meet our boat when we dock at Honolulu.
- Yes, sir.
- Better luck next time, Bagley.
- Oh, thanks.
Of course, you may be right about the gambling ring.
I've been racing horses long enough to know about these things...
and I wouldn't press an investigation if I were you.
Fenton's right. You're playing with dynamite when you start monkeying with those fellows.
I couldn't expect a professional gambler to be in sympathy with my stand.
George, don't let him start anything.
He might make a bad situation worse.
Now, you know your father. Tomorrow we'll all be on the boat sailing for America.
He'll have plenty of time to cool off.
Very odd circumstance.
I don't think there's anything odd about it, Charlie.
It's just unfortunate that your friend met with this accident.
Had cable from Major Kent asking me to investigate gambling ring.
Accident seem most convenient.
Charlie, you've a very suspicious mind.
Suspicion often father of truth.
Well, at any rate, it's in your lap.
The Oceanic will be docking in a few minutes.
You better go down there, see what you can find out.
- Sorry about your friend, Charlie.
- Thank you so much.
- Who is it?
- Steward, sir.
- Were you going ashore, sir?
- No.
You've been cooped up here for 10 days, sir.
- You really should go ashore. It'll tone you up.
- I'm all right.
Maybe you'd like to see the doctor, sir?
I'll get him for you.
I don't want a doctor.
If I do, I'll send for him.
Right you are, sir.
Marks of violence quite evident, Doctor?
The hoof prints are deeply indented in the skull.
The body is still aboard, if you wish to examine it.
All in proper time.
So sorry. Not necessary for ladies to remain.
You and Alice go to the cabin, hmm?
I'll join you later.
Please, can't we get this over with?
- You, uh, major's secretary?
- I was. Yes. I'm with Mr. Chester now.
Excuse, please.
Uh, sometime memory very bad.
Who you say find body?
I said it was
Mr. Fenton's stable boy.
Thank you so much.
You also have horse on boat?
Yes, I'm taking back a new string of horses I bought in Australia.
You intend racing same?
Yes, but I don't see what that has to do with it.
You say you talk with major ten minutes before death?
- Your memory's improving, Mr. Chan.
- Thank you so much.
Can't we end this? Dr. Johnson has made a thorough examination and said it was an accident.
This unnecessary questioning is idiotic.
Easy to criticize, more difficult to be correct.
Will now inspect stall where major meet death.
- Permission, please?
- Certainly, Mr. Chan.
Very strange. Avalanche know major four years...
yet kick him to death.
- Well, he has a bad temper.
- Huh. Friendly now.
You wanted to see my stable boy, didn't you?
Please.
Streamline. Streamline!
Streamline?
Hey, you old Lollipop!
What you all doin'?
Streamline! Where are you?
Here I is, Mr. Fenton.
- Come along here.
- Yes, sir.
Quit that. What's the matter with you?
Now you all stay up there where you belong and mascot with Gallant Lad.
- Yes, sir?
- This gentleman wants to ask you about the accident.
He's a detective.
Is you a cop? My, oh, my!
You remember position of body in stall?
That's just what I'm trying to forget.
This is stall where honorable major meet death?
Oh, no, sir. It happened over yonder.
Yes, after the accident, we moved Avalanche to another stall.
Please.
Where is Mr. Streamline?
Yes, sir?
Here I is.
Where was body?
Body? Back yonder agin the wall lying on his face.
Uh, will, uh, kindly take same position on floor?
I was just-Who? Me?
No, do as he says now.
Would greatly appreciate cooperation.
Me on floor? Could I fix him up a bag of straw or something, Mr. Fenton?
- Do as he tells you!
- Yes, sir.
Somethin' gonna happen to me, I know.
Ain't no good come from playing dead on the floor.
Thank you so much.
Please to stay.
Yes, sir.
Horse in stall always face forward like others?
Yes.
Narrow width make impossible to turn around?
That's rather obvious, isn't it?
Then, Avalanche could only kick backward.
That's the way a horse always kicks.
Thank you.
- Something very strange here.
- You mean me?
Now, what's strange, Mr. Chan?
Animal kick backward, body lie there... yet bloodstains found here.
Observe, please.
Shape like exclamation marks lying down... with pointed ends toward rear of stall.
Is there anything unusual about that?
Yes, very poor attempt at deception.
- May borrow fountain pen?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
Will now demonstrate only manner in which bloodstains could have been made.
Note similarity?
And, uh, what does that get you, Mr. Chan?
Idea that maybe someone stand here... and while major pet Avalanche...
murderer crush skull with heavy weapon... then drag body to back of stall to put blame on noble animal.
This is fantastic and absurd!
There was blood on the horse's hoofs and my examination indicated the man was-
Why, that's Avalanche!
- It's that confounded monkey!
Get him off there! Streamline!
Yes, sir!
Get that monkey down from there before I throw him overboard!
Come here, you Lollipop.
Don't you all know better than to pester with Avalanche?
- Haven't I told you to keep that monkey away from Avalanche?
- It's all right.
I'll give instructions that he be kept tied up for the rest of the voyage.
I'm sorry about this interruption, Mr. Chan...
but you see, Lollipop was brought up with Gallant Lad.
And when I bought the horse, well, I had to take the monkey too.
Perhaps he senses our rivalry, George.
There's your answer.
That's what happened.
Major Kent was in the stall, and the monkey frightened Avalanche... and he kicked the major to death before he could get out.
Very excellent analysis.
Why, the whole thing is preposterous!
I can't have my ship held here for investigation.
That runs into thousands of dollars.
Charlie is usually right when he has a hunch.
Have more than hunch.
- Now, look here, Mr. Chan-
- Excuse, please.
Took liberty of borrowing small piece from boat.
Well, what's that?
Why, it's a part of the clutch control of the winch!
Yes, uh, twin to one missing from cargo deck outside horse stalls.
Observe.
Shape identical with horseshoe blows which crush skull of Major Kent.
Very excellent proof of murder.
That means the investigation will have to continue, Captain.
But can't Mr. Chan go with us, instead of holding the ship here?
What about it, Charlie?
Do you want a sea voyage?
Sea voyage good for health.
Boat sail at 6:00?
Your cabin'll be ready.
I'll pack our bags before you can say, "Jack Robinson," Pop.
Uh, correction, please.
You pack my bag.
- You stay home with Jack Robinson.
- Aw, gee, Pop.
Aloha and good luck.
Thank you so much.
See you later.
Here you are, Mr. Chan.
212. B Deck.
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, Father.
Hello, Mr. Chan.
Well, Mr. Chan, we've been looking for you.
I'm afraid we treated you rather badly this afternoon.
I- I owe you an apology, sir.
All forgotten- like last year's bird's nest.
Does it occur to you the guilty person may have left ship?
Uh, check on passengers at gangplank reveal everyone present.
Well, the idea that the first person we bump into may be the murderer...
sort of gives a fellow the creeps.
What'll be your next move, Mr. Chan?
Make effort to catch murderer.
- For you, sir.
- Well. Will you pardon me?
Listen to this! " Don't enter Avalanche in the Santa Juanita Handicap.
A dead horse can't win a race."
- May I see that?
- Where'd you get this, Bruce?
What? Oh, at the- at the desk.
Time of delivery stamped on back of envelope?
Yes, it seems to be blurred.
Four minutes past 6:00.
That's only 10 minutes ago.
- Uh, may examine, please?
- First they get the major. Now they're trying to scare me.
Look here, George.
Whoever wrote this means business... and Avalanche is too fine a horse to lose through your stubbornness.
I'll give you 20,000 for him and retire him for a year to my breeding farm.
No, this convinces me that the major was right.
I'm going to see it through to the finish.
I'll talk to Captain Blake and insist on an extra guard below.
Most excellent precaution.
Oh. So sorry. May have letter, please?
- Certainly.
- Thank you so much.
Oh, gee, Pop.
How'd you know it was me?
Frequent spanking when young make rear view very familiar.
Why you here?
Well, after you left, Mom decided to take the kids to visit Aunt Ling... at the other end of the island, and I thought-
Uh, you make suggestion about visit?
I- I sort of mentioned it. But, uh-
Cabin boy outfit- disguise?
Oh, no, Pop. This is on the level.
I signed for the trip.
Now look, Pop, if a gambling ring's back of this, it's dangerous... and, well, gee, I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you... and I wasn't along to protect you.
Confucius say, " No man is poor who have worthy son."
Thank you so much.
Then you'll let me help?
Examine, please.
Say!
The top edge is uneven, like it had been cut off with scissors.
Yes.
Writer take precaution to eliminate Oceanic trademark... but forget watermark in paper.
They're the same, all right.
Then whoever wrote this is on the boat.
And look, Pop. The E's are clogged up, and the R's a little above the line.
That means if we can find the machine this was written on, we'll have our man.
Why, it's a cinch!
I can search all the cabins.
One moment, please.
Search only in pursuit of duty as cabin boy.
Must remember obligation to ship.
Okay, Pop. I'll clean every room on the boat if I have to.
One thing more.
As, uh, humble cabin boy, must forget, "Okay, Pop."
Okay, Pop.
I'll never get anywhere as a secretary.
I'm gonna bet every dollar I have on Avalanche.
- Then we'll get married and-
- Bruce, please.
That isn't the kind of marriage I want.
I'd always hoped the man I'd marry would stay away from racing and betting.
- Why, Alice, I never thought that you-
- Don't you see, darling?
That's the sort of thing
I've had all my life.
Dad and I never had a real home.
It was always just one track after another.
But the thrill of racing- the gamble and then winning.
And losing. We never felt sure of anything.
One minute Dad would be on top of the world... and the next, we'd have to borrow money to pay the feed bill.
Bruce, dear, I'd hate to go through that with you.
All right, dear. Santa Juanita will be the last time. I promise.
Beg pardon, sir. The gentleman in 219 wishes to see you.
Oh, uh, thanks. Excuse me, darling.
I'll see you in the lounge.
- Oh! So "solly."
- Hear, hear. Not so fast.
- You're a new boy, aren't you?
- New now. "Velly" soon old.
Ah, smart, eh?
You don't belong up here.
- And what were you doing in that cabin?
- Finish downstair.
Think "velly" smart work hard.
By and by "catchee" more money.
Yeah? You'll catch more than that if I find you up here again. Now, scat!
Scat chop-chop.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh! Oh.
Excuse, please.
Write letter to girlfriend.
Hereafter, write your letters somewhere else.
So "solly" you mad.
Clean up now, chop-chop.
So "solly." So "solly."
So "solly."
- Oh, so "solly."
- Oh, so it's you!
I thought I told you to stay off this deck.
Oh, tell him
I went bottom side, Pop.
I'm awfully sorry, sir.
Did I hurt you?
Stoop to pick up pin.
Bring good luck.
Good luck to that moon-faced cabin boy.
He's a very suspicious character, he is.
And as soon as I get me hands on him, into the brig he goes.
Did you notice which way he went, sir?
Uh, make hasty exit to north.
Right you are, sir. I'll get him.
Psst! Pop!
I found the typewriter all right.
It belongs to Mr. Fenton.
See? The letters are exactly the same.
Most excellent progress.
Well, I guess that's that.
All we've got to do now is arrest him.
Hasty conclusion like toy balloon-
Easy blow up, easy pop.
Don't you think Fenton did it?
You find way to typing machine.
Maybe someone else do same.
Gee, I never thought of that.
Well, what you gonna do now, Pop?
Surprise attack often find enemy unprepared.
That extra guard ought to be on duty by now. I'll step down and check.
- I wish you wouldn't.
- Now, dear, will you please stop worrying?
I've done nothing but worry, George, ever since you received that note.
- I told you not to say anything about it.
- I know. I know.
You stay here with Warren.
I'll be gone only a few minutes.
Can't you persuade him to sell Avalanche to you?
Try and make him do it.
Any progress?
Long road sometime shortest way to end of journey.
- Uh, may borrow cigarette, please?
- Yes, certainly.
This wasn't in my pocket when we left the dining room.
It's another one of those notes.
"A dead horse isn't worth $20,000."
What does it all mean?
It means that someone knows an awful lot about our business.
- May keep?
- Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.
Will make immediate investigation.
Did you notice the way he looked at me?
Do you think he could have put that in your pocket?
No, he wasn't within a yard of me.
The best place for you is in your stateroom.
I'm going down to the stalls and see George right away.
- Left at the post?
- Bruce'll be back in a minute.
- Alone at last.
- Now, Denny, don't tell me I'm the only girl you ever loved.
If Bruce doesn't marry you pretty soon, I will tell you.
- What's holding things up?
- Money. He's so noble. He insists upon waiting... until he can support me in the manner to which I've been accustomed.
- Very foolish young man.
- You mean Bruce?
Foolish to seek fortune when real treasure hiding under nose.
Will you tell him that for me?
Will be most happy.
To show you I'm not the kind to let a pal down... you tell Bruce to consult me hereafter before he bets on a horse.
Oh, won't you sit down, Mr. Chan?
Thank you so much.
The same in these, and make mine Scotch.
- Yes, sir.
- What will you have?
- Uh, sarsaparilla.
- Sarsaparilla, sir?
- Please.
- Very good, sir.
That's dissipation for you.
You are lucky at, uh, horse betting?
I'll say he is.
With all the odds against him... he bet on Stardust at the Melbourne Cup.
- I have good hunches sometimes.
- Play hunch on Stardust?
I suppose you could call it that.
Look, Mr. Chan. Just as I was coming up the stairs, this fell at my feet.
"It's dangerous to know too much about other people's business. "
- Bruce.
- Don't get the jitters.
That sounds like the one George received.
When you see note to Mr. Chester?
Bruce told me about it.
Well, what do you make of it, Mr. Chan?
Make conclusion you talk too much.
- Well, this is for you, Mr. Barton.
- Hmm?
How it came to be on my tray
I don't know.
It was not there when I left the bar.
Well, I got one too.
- They certainly aren't playing any favorites.
"A smart gambler knows a dead horse can't win."
Very interesting.
May keep, please?
Will make immediate investigation.
I'd like to do a little investigating on my own hook, if you don't mind.
Cooperation greatly appreciated.
Excuse, please.
Well, hello, Mr. Chan.
Well, this seems to be for me.
Yes.
"Withdraw Avalanche from the Santa Juanita
Handicap. This is your last warning."
- Your secretary and Mr. Barton also receive mysterious notes.
- What?
Uh, writer seem very generous with threats.
Is that all you've got to say?
Why don't you do something about it?
Rabbit run very fast, but sometime turtle win race.
Well, they're after you too.
What does it say?
Most distressing.
Must give immediate attention.
Excuse, please.
Come back here, you!
Gee, Pop.
That steward nearly grabbed me dropping that last note to Mr. Chester.
Congratulations for most expert delivery of mysterious letters.
Did your scheme work all right?
Did you find anything?
Experiment result in most interesting discovery.
Trouble in the forward hold!
The forwards stalls.
That's where Avalanche is. Come on, Pop.
One moment, please.
You remain here.
Come on. Get these horses out of here.
- What started this, Captain?
- I'm sure I don't know, but it's under control.
It's okay.
It's a lucky thing the fire was discovered in time.
They must be very desperate to endanger an entire ship...
- just to carry out a threat against a horse.
- Contradiction, please.
Person who start fire intend no harm to noble animal.
How do you figure that out?
Fire made directly under automatic apparatus... so heat will set off alarm more quickly before much damage.
Their way of letting me know that they could have killed Avalanche if they'd wanted to.
- Where was the extra guard when this happened?
- He was on duty.
- May, uh, question him?
- Smithers!
- Yes, sir?
- You were where when alarm sounded?
On the cargo deck, sir.
You had instructions to stay in here.
Why did you leave?
One of the booms was squeaking, sir, and made Avalanche nervous.
When Mr. Chester came down, he spoke to Mr. Bagley about it...
- and he told me to fix it.
- That's right.
Smithers.
You also on cargo deck?
No. After Mr. Chester left,
I went to my room.
How long there before alarm?
About 10 minutes, maybe 15.
I don't know exactly.
- Horses alone then?
- Streamline was here.
I told him to keep an eye on them till Smithers got back.
Mr. Streamline?
Yes, sir?
- Yes, sir?
- You were present when alarm sounded?
Yes, sir, but- but I was asleep, sir.
You see, sir, I took me a drink of gin for the misery in my feet...
and, naturally, I go to sleep when I take a drink of gin.
I ought to discharge you!
Next move may be more than warning.
- Extreme precaution now necessary.
- You're absolutely right.
- From now on, you sleep here, Bagley. You understand?
- That's a good idea, I guess.
- You have your gun with you?
- It's in my room.
Well, what good is it doing there?
I thought with this going on, something might happen, so I was cleaning it.
It's on my table, Streamline.
Get it for me, will you?
- It ain't loaded, is it?
- Of course not. And bring the cartridges.
Yes, sir.
Excuse, please.
What did you find, Mr. Chan?
Ghost of matches.
Here are the gun and bullets,
Mr. Chester.
If you ever take another drink on duty, you're-
- What happened?
- Mr. Chan!
- What happened, Captain?
- Get a doctor. Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Chan. I don't know what to say.
Happy bullet in leg rather than heart.
Thank you so much.
I thought you were cleaning the gun.
You said it wasn't loaded.
It wasn't when I left my room.
- Ten minutes so far.
- Hmm.
You got your gun, Pop?
Make excellent bedfellow.
May enter.
Hello.
I hear you ran into a bullet.
Contradiction, please.
Bullet ran into me.
I'm so sorry. Really, I am.
Sympathy reason for visit?
And to return the mysterious little note that you sent me.
Clever idea, Mr. Chan.
My compliments.
Pleasure to return compliment.
Clever deduction.
Good. And now that you've admitted my ability as a detective...
why not let me in on the secret?
- Whom did you expect to catch?
- Maybe you have answer.
I wish I had. I liked the old major a great deal.
If I can be of any service, just, uh, give me a buzz.
Thank you so much.
Do you think he did it, Pop?
Ocean have many fish.
There it goes.
Man who set fire have
12 minutes to cover trail.
That's right. Now look, Pop...
Bagley said he was in his room 10 minutes when he heard the alarm.
He could have done it, and so could Mr. Chester... because he was there while the guard was outside.
But wait a minute! It might have been that secretary of his too.
Because when I dropped his note, he was coming up from the cargo deck.
You know...
I still think that Fenton's the guy we want.
I could have sworn someone was at that window.
Lee, come back.
Gee, Pop, what are you always stopping me for?
Why don't you give me a chance to clean this case up?
Foolish rooster who stick head in lawn mower end in stew.
Look at you, laid up for the rest of the trip with a bullet in your leg.
I'm not gonna let them get away with that.
I'm gonna find the guy that loaded that gun!
Oh, so it's you, eh?
What's he doing here, sir?
Is he annoying you?
- Very desperate character.
- But, gee, Pop.
What did you say?
Confine to brig, please.
Eagle eye for rest of voyage bring reward.
Right you are, sir.
I'll stick to him like Scotch glue.
Thank you so much.
Move in there and get a close-up.
A little closer, Mr. Bagley.
Mind keeping his head up? Thanks a lot.
All right, hold it.
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Chester. Thanks, Mr. Chan.
- Okay.
- Hello, Mr. Chester.
- Hello, boy. How are you?
- Feeling pretty fine, sir. My leg's almost as good as new.
- Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Say, I'm sorry you lost that race in Melbourne.
I'll bet it never would have happened if I'd been riding him.
That's all part of the game, boy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Eddie Brill, the boy that used to ride for me before I left America.
- This is Mr. Chan.
- Oh, I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Chan.
So pleased.
What about these threats you received on the boat, Mr. Chester?
Avalanche will be under guard day and night, and no one else will be allowed near him.
And I promise you that he will run in the handicap, won't you, boy?
- All right. Take him out to the trailer, Bagley.
- How about you, Mr. Fenton?
Any of those new horses you bought over there show any promise?
Yes, Gallant Lad. I plan on entering him in the handicap Saturday.
Well, what do you think of his chances?
Well, until the winner crosses the finish line... it's anybody's money, isn't that right, Chester?
That's what makes horse racing.
Get down from there!
Whoa! Whoa, Gallant Lad!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Here, Lollipop!
Where you all goin'?
- Confound that monkey! Streamline!
- Yes, sir?
Get that monkey down from there before he gets Avalanche crazy too.
Here, Mr. Fenton.
- Hurry up. Get him off of there.
- Yes, sir.
Behave yourself. You're the "fickliest" fool I ever did see.
Why don't you like your friend
Gallant Lad no more?
Come on. Get going.
Get out of here.
Something very strange.
What, Pop?
Before fire, monkey dislike Avalanche.
Now dislike Gallant Lad.
Say, that is funny.
Not if horses switched.
By golly, I bet that's it.
They could get away with it too.
The horses look enough alike, and they're the same build.
What you gonna do?
Go to hotel, take nap.
Hiya, Bagley.
I thought you were in Australia.
- Yeah, I know you did. What's the new racket?
- I don't know what you mean.
That horse you just put in the trailer ain't Avalanche. That's Gallant Lad.
- Aw, you're crazy.
- Yeah?
You can fool Chester.
He's half blind anyway. But I ain't.
That fire was started on the boat to cover the switch.
Not so loud.
What's the idea puttin' an unknown palooka in Avalanche's place?
- I can't answer that here.
- Okay, where?
Come along with me. We couldn't make a dime betting on Avalanche.
He's the favorite.
The best we could get is even money.
Sure, and nobody's seen
Avalanche in America.
On the boat, the switch is made, and now Avalanche, in disguise... goes to the post a horse no one ever heard of.
Comes in a long shot with big odds.
Catch on?
We're plastering the country with bets from coast to coast at 20-to-1, and we'll clean up.
Boy, that's swell.
You guys can figure me in on that dough.
Aw, you're already in. Well, boys, we've got a lot of work to do.
Lefty, take Collins and get him planted somewhere where he can hide out and get a good rest.
Oh, sure. I know just the spot.
- Have a drink?
- Never touch it.
- Need any money?
- Well, yeah, I could use some.
Took almost all I had gettin' away from Melbourne.
Well, here's a couple of hundred for you.
Thanks, Bagley.
I guess I had you figured all wrong.
- That's all right.
- Let's go, Collins.
So long, fellas.
Good-bye, Collins.
Observe anything unusual during night?
Not a thing. There's no one around this track who doesn't belong here.
Avalanche is guarded so closely, no one could get within a mile of him.
Innocent grass may conceal snake.
Not when you go through it with a fine comb.
Avalanche?
No, Mr. Fenton is giving his horse a workout first.
Well, if I can be of any further service, Mr. Chan-
Grateful for all kindness, Captain Wade.
That's all right.
1:38 and four-fifths.
Not bad.
Well, he'll have to do better than that if he's going to beat my horse.
Mr. Chester, they're bringing
Avalanche out now. Can I ride him?
- I wouldn't take a chance, Eddie.
- Aw, but I can handle him, sir.
- Honest, I can. I've been able to ride for months now.
- Some other time.
Whoa, Avalanche! Whoa!
Steady, boy! Steady!
Hold him! Hold him!
What's the matter with that horse?
What's the matter with that boy?
Why doesn't he pull him up?
- Look out. Look out. Be careful there.
- Come on now, boy. Hold him up.
They're gettin' him all excited, Mr. Chester.
I think I'd better go over there.
Dad, our horse made better time than that yesterday. What do you suppose is wrong?
- I told the boy to hold him back.
- What for?
Because I don't want to advertise what we've got.
The odds will go down.
- That's a secret.
- Uh-oh.
Oh.
Interesting contraption, isn't it, Mr. Chan?
Excuse ignorance.
May inquire nature of strange device?
Oh, that's part of the latest system for timing the races.
Uh, may explain, please?
Well, there's a lamp in here.
This directs a beam of light across the track...
to that little box on the other side which contains a photoelectric cell.
The moment a horse passes through this beam, the cell operates... and a picture of the finish of the race is taken up there...
in the camera-eye booth.
Is possible to see, please?
Certainly. Come right along.
- Hello, Al.
- Hello, Barton.
Got a minute? I want you to meet Mr. Chan, Mr. Charlie Chan.
- Oh, uh, glad to know you.
- Thank you so much.
Have you got time to explain the system, Al?
Mr. Chan is interested.
Oh, sure, sure.
Now to begin with, uh... here's the diagram of the track.
At every quarter mile there's a photoelectric cell.
Mr. Barton already explained.
- Shoot beam of light across track to time horses.
- That's right.
- Say, Avalanche is just about to break.
- Good.
I'll turn this on and show you how it works.
Now, this light was automatically turned on when he went through the first beam.
It also started the timer across the track.
He's coming to the first quarter.
Now watch this light.
- Twenty-three flat at the first quarter.
- Avalanche is sure in form.
Now, if you stand there beside the cameras,
Mr. Chan, and look down toward the track... you'll see that they point directly over the finish line ready to take a picture.
This switch turns on the high-speed movie cameras... and we're now ready to take a picture of the finish.
Here he comes.
He's over. And now the film we just took is being developed in this high-speed developer.
In less than two minutes' time,
Mr. Chan... we have taken an actual picture of the finish and sent it down to the judges' stand.
That's all there is to it.
Perfection of mechanical brain make
Charlie Chan very humble. Thank you so much.
Avalanche appears strangely excited.
Excuse, please.
Pop, I've got it. I've got it!
One moment, please. You disobey instructions to remain here in room.
I wasn't helping any by staying here, so-
So you visit racetrack stables.
Gee, Pop, how'd you know?
Hay do not grow in hotel.
Man who flirt with dynamite sometime fly with angels.
Well, I'm not gonna let you take all the chances.
Look, I got in the stable, and when the guard stepped outside for a smoke...
I took some pieces of cotton and some cleaning solution too.
Reveal black dye on forehead of Gallant Lad... and then white dye on forehead of Avalanche?
Yeah, and there's the proof.
But if they've been switched, how did Gallant Lad... come within one second of Avalanche's fastest time this morning?
There's a screw loose somewhere.
Maybe loose screw here in test tube.
Did you find something, Pop?
Managed to secure foam from mouth of excited Avalanche... after practice race this morning.
Observe.
Bubbles prove foam contain very powerful stimulant for heart.
Today make masquerader run very fast to give appearance of champion.
I've got it, Pop. It's Chester and Fenton in cahoot to cheat the public.
Also possible gambling ring cahooting to cheat Chester and Fenton.
Yeah, but Pop, what are we doing chasing gamblers?
I thought we were after
Major Kent's murderer.
Roots of tree lead in many directions.
Aw, gee, Pop, when are we gonna arrest somebody?
Are you all right, Pop?
Quite all right.
Careful, now.
Man with gun like lightning... never strike twice in same place.
It's sure lucky that curtain went haywire.
Correction, please. Use string.
So.
Arranged simple device to give warning.
Observe.
When window raised, string trips shade and releases same.
- Safe now to sleep.
- Sleep? We've got to do something to stop those birds.
- Have idea to trap birds.
- Okay, Pop. Let's have it.
In morning, you rent
Chinese laundry wagon.
Disguise self as Chinese laundry boy.
Good night.
But that Chinese dick is wise to the whole thing.
Oh, don't get excited. I know every move
Chan's made since he left the track this afternoon.
Suppose he phones the cops, tries to pull something tomorrow?
That's been taken care of too.
The line to his room's been tapped, and Joe's listening to every call that goes in or out.
Suppose you let me handle Chan.
Did you get that timing head finished?
Yeah, and, boy, it works like a charm.
Come on. I wanna show you.
Now, just before the handicap, I replace the timing head at the three-quarter pole... with this phony and load it with this.
So if any other horse is ahead of Gallant Lad, we got nothing to worry about.
All right, here we go.
Lefty, you pull him through.
That ought to stop him.
Sure there won't be any slipup?
Nah, this isn't gonna be operated from any camera-eye booth.
I'm gonna handle it myself.
Well, what's happened, Mr. Chester?
Another threat left at my hotel.
Listen.
"This is your last chance. Withdraw
Avalanche before it's too late."
Lansing, they can't intimidate me.
I'm running my horse in this race...
- and I demand protection for him.
- And he'll get it.
The Association has something at stake too- the confidence of 80,000 people out there...
who depend on us to protect them from racketeers.
Wade, get hold of every available man.
Station them around the track and near the stables.
- Detail two to guard Mr. Chester.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Chan been around?
- I haven't seen him.
- Phone him. Tell him to get here fast as he can.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go to the stables.
Have assurance of immediate departure.
Thank you so much.
How do I look, Pop?
What's the matter?
Something happened?
Mr. Chester receive another threatening letter.
I've been thinking this over, Pop, and I'll bet you that Barton guy-
Useless talk like boat without oar.
Get no place.
- Have firecrackers?
- Oh, you'll be surprised.
Correction, please.
Hope someone else get surprise.
Come quick.
Keep moving and not a word out of either one of you. Get going.
Philadelphia can handle two grand on Gallant Lad at 18-to-1.
- Take it.
- Place two grand.
Hello, Chicago.
What are the odds on Gallant Lad?
Let me know when they're 20-to-1.
San Francisco reporting
Gallant Lad at 20-to-1.
- Grab it.
- Place 10 grand.
Hello, Cincinnati, how much can you handle? Five grand.
Oh, so you got him, huh?
- What'll we do with him?
- In there. We'll take care of him later.
Come on.
Better put 'em in there.
I'll take care of'em.
Clever Chinese, huh?
Stuck your snoot in the wrong racket this time, didn't you?
- Hey, what'd he say?
- He say you're right.
Sit down.
Chuck, turn on the radio.
Here's a news flash that has already swept the grandstand... and sent chills and thrills racing through the veins of 80,000 people.
We have just learned that another threat has been made against Avalanche.
But the owner of today's favorite...
in spite of the danger to himself and his horse, refuses to withdraw his entry.
And here's more news, ladies and gentlemen, just received.
The Chesterjockey backs out in the face of danger.
Avalanche is now without a rider.
I'm sorry, Mr. Chester, but I don't want to take the chance.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
- Any of you other boys game?
- Not me.
- No, sir.
- Not me.
- I don't want any part of him.
- Not today.
- Gilroy.
- Yes, sir.
If I put one of the other boys on Gallant Lad, will you ride Avalanche?
- No, thanks.
- That's very decent of you, Warren.
- Oh, forget it.
- I just heard about it on the radio, Mr. Chester.
I'll ride him for you. Please let me.
All right, Eddie.
You win this race for me... you'll find $10,000 in your pocket for that specialist you've been wanting to see.
Oh, gee, Mr. Chester, thanks!
It's the most exciting day this track has ever known.
There's mystery in the air, ladies and gentlemen, real mystery.
And here's some more news.
Eddie Brill-
And who doesn't remember Eddie...
when he won the handicap two years ago?
Eddie is going to ride the favorite.
- Uh, may have makings, please?
- Sure, why not?
Thousands are crowding the betting booths.
The odds on Avalanche are less than even money but no takers.
Golden Fleece is next at 3-to-1. Shrapnel follows at four and so on down the line.
Hold Away at 10-to-1,
Moneymaker at 10-to-1...
Court Jester at 12,
Honey Girl at 15-to-1... and, last but not least,
Gallant Lad at 17-to-1.
But I’ve just received word that the odds...
- are falling.
- Get gun.
It is estimated that over a quarter million dollars...
will change hands over the result of this handicap.
This money has been waiting for the feature race of the day.
If any horse should beat Avalanche, it'll be the biggest turf upset of this meeting.
- But who can tell? There may be a horse that can beat Avalanche.
- Lee.
And many are betting that way.
That's what makes horse racing, ladies and gentlemen. May the best horse win.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's almost time...
for the feature race, the Santa Juanita Handicap.
The entries are arriving at the receiving barn for the final inspection.
With Brill up, Avalanche's odds drop again.
Where are you goin'?
Oh, "bling laundly." So "solly," really late.
Make, uh, hurry up, very quick, please, huh?
Go on, but take it easy.
Need three small minutes at receiving barn alone.
When give signal with hat... laundry boy must become center of attention.
Okay, Pop. Be careful.
Just a moment.
Have most important business with honorable paddock judge.
You couldn't get in there now if you were first cousin to the favorite.
Do not claim relationship with noble animal.
Business most urgent.
Now listen, I just told you-
What's going on here?
- I don't know, sir.
- What's that idiot doing?
Very sorry.
Apologize later.
Hey, you!
Oh. Motor in back.
Maybe machine gun, huh?
Hey, you, come on here!
Come out of here!
The timing head at the three-quarter post isn't working.
I'll phone Al.
Hello.
I'll take care of it right away.
Remove dye from head of each horse.
Avalanche is Avalanche, and Gallant Lad, Gallant Lad.
Both horses now run under true colors.
Why, this will force the head of the gambling ring into the open.
It'll hit him in his most vital spot.
Like bumblebee in pants.
Suggest we go to saddling stall.
Out in front, Eddie, and keep him there.
- Yes, sir. I'll be ridin' him all the way.
- Okay, boy.
Valet, hold this horse.
Plan most successful.
Joe, somebody's double-crossed us.
The horses have been switched back again.
Oh, you're crazy. No one could do it but that Chinese dick, and he's here.
Hey, Frank, see if Chan's still in there.
- All right!
- Just a minute.
All right, boys, take it easy now.
You lose before race start.
Come on.
And, at last, the call to the track.
Terry on Number 1, Gringo.
Healey on Number 2, Wild Bill.
Cross on Number 3, Shrapnel,
Thomas on Number 4, Gallant Lad.
Richardson on Number 5, Golden Fleece.
Beaumont on Number 6, Elsie Lee...
And Eddie Brill on Number 7, Avalanche, the favorite, the mystery horse.
Better bring your party in here, Mr. Chester.
- Stand back, please. Stand back.
- Thank you, Wade.
- Hello, Denny.
- Hello, Alice.
They're almost to the starting gate.
I suppose you're certain
Avalanche is going to win.
Sure, we've got it all figured out.
Haven't we, Denny?
Oh, absolutely. The wrong horse wins, he loses all his money.
I get it, and you marry me.
- Yeah.
- Oh. It looks like a start.
They're off!
Avalanche is steadily moving up.
Elsie Lee is crowding him close to the rail.
Avalanche still keeps coming.
Brill is riding with the patience for which this boy is noted.
Richardson on Golden Fleece is using his whip.
He's set the pace, but the stamina of his horse...
is not equal to the terrific speed that Avalanche shows at the half.
Golden Fleece and Avalanche are out together with Golden Fleece tiring.
Avalanche is holding his own with that reserve for which he's famous.
Avalanche is forging ahead. He's every bit the horse they promised us-a real favorite.
Avalanche moves into the lead.
Nothing can stop him now.
It looks as if he’ll establish a track record for the distance.
We couldn't believe this horse Avalanche was as good as they promised, but he is.
He's better. Avalanche is now a length in front. He's got the race in the bag.
There's no doubt about it, ladies and gentlemen. The favorite is still favored.
At the three-quarter-
Something's happened!
He's lost his stride.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
He's recovered. He's back again.
He passes one horse after another.
He's almost the real defender again.
He's passed Shrapnel.
He's passing Hold Away.
He's taking the measure of Golden Fleece.
He's still got a chance.
You've never seen a race like this before.
This is the wonder horse of the age, the king of the turf. Here he comes.
He's a horse in 10 million.
Avalanche is giving everything he's got.
He's back with the leaders again.
Golden Fleece falters.
Avalanche is at his quarters.
He's even. They're fighting it out neck and neck. Here they come-
two magnificent animals tearing out their hearts in one last terrific struggle.
There's hardly an inch between them as they shoot down the stretch.
This is a finish that's going down in history. I've never seen another like it.
The final 50 yards. Avalanche literally hurls himself across the finish line.
He's over! Avalanche wins!
He's down!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Clear the track, everybody!
Everybody off the track!
Come on, Meers. Cough it up.
Who's the ringleader?
Who's been givin' you orders?
- Nobody's been giving us orders.
- You're lyin'.
Look here, I'll talk to the D.A.
We'll make it easy on you.
That wouldn't do any good.
They'd get me just like they got Tip Collins.
Tip Collins? That's the guy they fished out of the ocean at Santa Monica this morning!
Yes?
- The police are here now, sir.
- You can let them come in.
I'll take 'em down to headquarters, Mr. Lansing.
- Maybe we can get more out of'em there.
- Come on.
Look here, Lansing. I object to being held here like this for no apparent reason.
We were rushed off the track so fast I didn't even have time to collect any of my bets.
Won't you be seated, ladies? I'm sorry, but this is at Mr. Chan's request.
- Then where is Mr. Chan?
- Present.
- Oh, Mr. Chan.
- Thank you.
Uh, happy to report
Avalanche and jockey... as son Lee would say, hunky-dory.
Uh, please to sit down.
Warren, did you know that up to 20 minutes before the race...
Avalanche was in your stall disguised as Gallant Lad?
What? Why, such a thing is impossible.
The switch was first made on the boat by Bagley.
- Then why are we all herded up here like a lot of criminals?
- Mr. Chan will explain.
Have here enlarged picture.
Uh, show finish of race.
Observe, please.
Dart in shoulder of Avalanche.
But where did it come from?
Who could have fired it with so many people around?
Explanation here in timing head.
Also pleased to report... person who fire same now in custody.
But I still don't see what we've got to do with it, Mr. Chan.
Perhaps can help, uh, solving fresh mystery.
Dart very evident here... yet strangely absent one moment later... when doctor examine Avalanche.
All present were first to reach side of noble animal.
Someone use cover of excitement to remove dart.
- A polite way of telling us we're going to be searched?
- Have objection?
Not the slightest.
You won't find it on me, Mr. Chan.
Please. Also.
This is nonsense. Now wait a minute.
Dad, please.
We've nothing to worry about.
Here it is.
- Dad!
- Someone put that in my pocket.
I wasn't within six feet of Avalanche.
It was you. You were one of the first to reach him, because I remember-
Just a minute, Fenton.
I see this all very clearly now.
You wanted to buy Avalanche all along.
When I refused to sell, you stole him and substituted your horse.
- That's not true. Dad only made his offer to protect Avalanche.
- The whole thing's ridiculous.
The whole thing is obvious. You're the only one who would have profited by the exchange.
With Avalanche running for you as a ringer at 20-to-1, you'd have cleaned up a fortune.
I guess that settles it, Mr. Fenton.
You're under arrest.
- How dare you say that about my father!
- I'll say more than that.
Your father murdered Major Kent who raised Avalanche... because he would have seen through the switch at once.
He had to be gotten out of the way, so you struck him down...
with a winch shoe to make it appear that Avalanche kicked him to death.
- That's a lie!
- Alice!
Pardon, please.
How you know winch shoe kill honorable major?
- Why, everyone knew that.
- Contradiction, please.
Only three beside humble self knew name of death weapon.
Honorable chief of police... most honorable captain of boat...
and murderer.
You convict self.
Thank you so much.
It's all very amusing, but I think it's carrying a joke a little too far.
Cold-blooded murder no joke.
You and Major Kent frequently quarreled because of your gambling losses.
- Well, what of it?
- Fearing investigation of same... would reveal self as head of gambling ring... you kill honorable major on board ship.
It isn't true! My husband often quarreled with Dad, but he couldn't have done such a thing.
Truth sometimes like stab of cruel knife.
You very clever but make mistake.
On boat in Honolulu when you receive threatening letter... have no difficulty reading same without glasses... because contents familiar.
But glasses necessary to read very legible... time stamp on envelope.
Suspected hoax then, so get corroboration later... when you need glasses to read fake letter... sent by humble self.
Next mistake.
When Avalanche received cruel dart... you make haste to remove same... fearing evidence point to self.
Anticipating search on sudden call to appear here... you put dart in pocket of Mr. Fenton.
I think you'll have a little difficulty in proving that idiotic story.
Contradiction, please.
Proof already in evidence.
Blood of unfortunate
Avalanche.
Take away, please.
So sorry.
Mr. Chan, I have a confession to make.
Have already arranged for you to make same to honorable stewards of track.
- You knew?
- Too bad you did not expose plot... when you first discover switch of horses.
Temptation to cash in most unfortunate.
Mr. Lansing, I will remove my stable from the track at once.
I think that's very wise.
Wait for me, Dad. I just want to say good-bye to Mr. Chan.
I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Chan.
You've done so much for Dad.
Uh, young man win money on race?
Enough to furnish a four-room flat, I guess.
Good wife best household furniture.
Hey, Pop, I've got another hot clue.
Save for next case, please.
What time does the crime picture start?
Eight fifty-eight, in about three minutes.
Two loges.
This is William Kennedy, bringing you the second of a series of short pictures...
...exposing the rackets of America:
The Syndicate of Crime.
A series of short pictures presented to the American public as a warning.
To arouse them against a growing national menace:
The modern racketeer.
Wait till you see the actor that takes you off.
1935.
The total gold bullion in the United
States Treasury and Mints was $ 9.5 billion.
1935.
The crime combine of the racketeers...
...entrenched in 88 cities of over 100,000 population...
...and reaching into thousands of surrounding towns...
...robbed the American people of $ 15 billion.
Huge sums extorted from the businessman.
A steady flood of pennies, nickels and dimes...
...drained from the purses of the homeowner, the laborer and the housewife.
On the East Coast, perishable foods.
A quarter of a cent levied on every head of lettuce.
A cent on artichokes.
A fraction of a cent on every type of produce.
When wholesalers refuse to pay tribute...
...the racketeers prevent them from moving shipments.
Hundreds of carloads of fresh vegetables rot on sidings.
Across the street from
100,000 American schools...
...attractive games are installed in stores, shops and restaurants.
And in one city alone, the racketeers harvest $80,000 a week.
How many kids are there in that school?
- Thirty-five hundred. - Do you get much of their trade?
- Quite a bit.
- How about building it up?
We'll install a nickel game for you.
So they can go hungry handing you their lunch money. Get out of here.
Well, if that's the way you feel, we'll only install three.
And you'll like it.
- A home run, there it goes.
- Home run, home run.
- I can beat that.
- You better not spend any more.
- Spare me a nickel, will you?
- Out of my way, kids.
The Pacific Coast.
A group of restaurants refuse to buy meat through the racketeers.
They try to buy it direct.
- What's the big idea?
- Where are you taking the load?
- Paris Café.
- All right, Joe.
- Why, you can't get away with...
- Sit down.
Nothing like a good kerosene flavor on a steak.
You're next.
October, 1935.
Al Kruger, a notorious racketeer, comes up for trial.
He has previously been arrested 11 times...
...on charges ranging from grand larceny to felonious assault.
Dismissed each time.
He finally faces a jury.
Be seated.
Have you reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.
- You may state it to the court.
We find the defendant not guilty.
I wish to state that your verdict is one that destroys the confidence...
...of law-abiding people in the integrity and justice of the American court.
You can leave here knowing that you have rendered a blow at law enforcement...
...and encouraged those who violate the law.
They will probably praise you.
I do not.
Jury discharged.
And so Kruger is again given his freedom...
...and returns to collect his share of the $ 200-million plunder...
...taken each year in his city.
So what?
Entrenched and protected...
...the crime combine strikes swiftly at those who oppose it.
Ward Bryant, publisher and leading crusader against the rackets...
...receives a telephone death threat against himself and his family.
He makes a public reply.
I have been ordered to stop making
The Syndicate of Crime pictures.
The gentleman who phoned added, "Or else. "
For his information, I shall continue to make them.
And my papers will continue their present policy of open attack on racketeers...
...and the directors of organized crime...
...who are the really dangerous enemies of society.
His phone call is only further evidence...
...that the racketeers have the
American public pretty well whipped...
...when a citizen has to sacrifice the safety of his family...
...to ask for security and decency.
These same racketeers laugh at your laws.
They make a joke of your courts.
They rule by the fear of their bullets.
They must be smashed by the power of your ballots.
Let's go.
- Who threatened Bryant?
- I don't know.
Somebody told him to pipe down.
He's been doing enough yelling in his papers without making pictures.
He's just racing his motor.
He's racing it so loud the public's liable to wake up one day.
They been played for a sucker so long they'll never wake up.
That's where we think different.
If he keeps on bringing our names out, he can make it plenty hot.
I'm gonna stop him before he stops us.
You stick to your milk-and-produce business and leave Bryant alone.
I'm still running this show, and I say let him yell.
He can't hurt us without any evidence, and he isn't gonna get any.
Pick me up here at the office at 1:00.
- Go get yourself a drink and cool off.
- Okay.
And forget Bryant.
Sure.
Hey, waiter. Some bourbon and ginger ale.
- Hiya, Herman.
- Hello, Eddie.
Hello, Mr. Blake.
Hello, Herman.
- I see you got the bad news.
- Yeah.
- That ought to cause a lot of trouble.
- I shouldn't be surprised.
Probably blow the lid right off the city hall.
Oh, I forgot, Miss
Lee's waiting for me.
- Get a look at the crowd out there?
- I'll say. Boiled shirts all over the place.
- How's your routine, Mary?
- It's in the bag.
- Good. How about your number, Eddie?
- It'll knock Broadway for a loop.
Never mind Broadway, concentrate on the customers out there.
This is the biggest play we've ever had from downtown.
If our show gets over, we'll pack them in.
- Go out there and give them everything.
- We'll have them on the floor.
We're having a tough enough time keeping the seats filled. Go on out there.
Come on, kids...
Hello, girls. Excuse me, will you?
- Hello, Miss Lee.
- Hello, Herman.
- How were the collections?
- Just fine.
You really got something in this numbers game.
Mr. Henrich says it's gonna catch on in the Bronx even better than Harlem.
Form the looks of that money, he's right.
If it keeps rolling in, you can quit the cabaret and move right into Park Avenue.
- I drive a Rolls-Royce swell.
- We'll stick to the cabaret.
All right, but
Rolls-Royces are better.
Let's see. Seems to me I had something else I wanted to tell you.
Never mind. It'll come.
Oh, I remember. I saw
Mr. Blake when I came in.
- Where?
- In the bar.
In the bar? Was he drinking?
- Yes.
- What's happened downtown?
Who, to me? Nothing.
I wasn't even downtown.
No, not you. What's happened on Broadway?
- Any extras out?
- Oh, yes.
That publisher was murdered. The one named...
- That explains it.
- The name...
Never mind, Herman.
Just sit down and rest.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K... Bryant.
Thank you.
- How are things, Lee?
- Fine, thank you.
- How is the show?
- Go in, see for yourself.
I will.
Hello, Johnny. Wanna go in and see the show?
No, sit down a while.
- How have you been?
- Okay.
Why didn't you let me know you were here?
I was busy reading this about Bryant.
- Did you know him?
- Yeah, a little. Swell fella.
He had a swell wife and kid too.
It'll be plenty tough on them.
- Wife and kid?
- Yeah.
You're a funny fella, Johnny.
When you come out of your shell, you're really human.
I don't like to see decent people pushed around.
When something breaks down there in your old stamping ground...
...it gets under your skin, doesn't it?
What makes you think so?
- It's the only time I see you take a drink.
- Oh, no. This is just a celebration.
We found out who stole
Mrs. Blausmeyer's laundry.
- Oh, that must be something.
- It was.
- Are you on the level?
- Why, sure.
Well, that's a fine finish to a great police career.
Looking for laundry in the Bronx.
Well, it's better than being pensioned off with the fire horses.
Say, I'm not kidding myself. I'm no use to them downtown anymore.
When things like this happen, they need you.
You and your whole squad ought to be back there in action.
They don't believe in kicking the rats into line anymore.
Nowadays, you're supposed to kiss them and tuck them in.
- Your friend McLaren thinks so too.
- Well, he's only a captain.
He takes orders too.
And you'll go on being loyal to McLaren and the department.
- Yeah. That's it.
- And looking for laundry.
Nice, clean job.
Well, someday Mac will be back up on top.
Then you won't have to worry about me anymore.
Say, I thought you didn't let mugs come into this place.
I don't when I know them. Who's he?
That's Crail.
I sent him up to Sing
Sing a couple of years ago.
Hello, Blake.
I see the parole board has let you loose on the public again, huh?
Yeah, no thanks to you.
Well, I see where they cut the bigshot detective down to size.
It must be tough not to be able to kick the boys around...
...and make them tip their hats.
Yeah, but they still do.
To a Bronx flatfoot?
Yeah.
And as long as I'm part of the force, they'll keep on tipping their hats.
Remember it next time.
I guess I'll go downtown and see what's going on.
You haven't lost your gentle touch, have you?
I'll see you soon.
Don't hurt your knuckles.
- What's the trouble?
- He's under arrest for destroying property.
Yes, sir.
Come on, on your feet.
You're sure you saw
Fenner go inside the hotel?
Yes, I didn't pull away until after he went in.
- What time did you leave him? - Nine fifty-five.
Could he have had time to get to Bryant's office by 10:15?
- I guess so.
- I'm not paying you to guess.
He could've if he grabbed a fast car right away and got a break with the traffic.
Yes?
Detective Blake to see you.
Send him in.
- That's all. Wait for me.
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Al.
- How are you, Johnny?
- Big night for you, huh?
- How?
- Secretary and chauffeur working overtime.
- Oh, that happens a lot.
- Your rackets must be doing all right.
- About 5000 last week.
Five hundred thousand.
I can't count that high.
- Have a chair, Johnny.
- Thanks.
I thought you were homesteading up in the Bronx.
What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Oh, just poking around the old hangouts.
- Cigar?
- No, thanks, I'll smoke a pipe.
What do you think of Bryant's death?
I was just reading about it.
Yeah.
- It's too bad. He was a nice fella.
- They'll probably try and hang it on you.
A couple of the boys from headquarters were up here half an hour ago.
They were very nice about it, though.
That's the trouble with them. They have to be.
You'd have taken me around the corner and rolled up a newspaper.
Yeah, I suppose I would.
But I didn't get much out of you the last time I gave you a going-over.
You came close to it.
I wish I'd known it then.
You'd have got some more.
I wanted to get you on that rap.
- Good old days, eh, Johnny?
- Yeah.
You've traveled a long way since then.
You'd have gone a long way if you'd thrown in with me...
...the first time I asked you to.
- Yeah, I suppose I would.
You would have been a great help in this business.
You know more about this town than any bird that ever lived in it.
If I'd gone in, I'd have nailed you.
Oh, no, you wouldn't.
You never double-crossed anyone in your life, not even a crook...
...if he told you something in confidence.
Sure, you rode the pants off of all of us.
But you always let us know where you stood.
You've known what I thought of you.
And you're the only fella
I'd take it from, too.
But I'd still like to have you throw in with me, Johnny.
I'll stick with the department.
After all the kicking around they've given you?
- Yeah.
- Well, you're a sucker.
All you'll ever get out of it is a petty-larceny pension.
I could do more for you in a year than you can earn in a lifetime on the force.
Maybe I like to make my money the hard way.
Well, I'll probably still be asking you 10 years from now.
If you live that long.
Blake's the name.
- How about getting out?
- I asked Johnny in.
No Bronx detective's gonna hang around this office.
- Listen, Fenner...
- Never mind, Al.
Fenner can't forget the week he spent at the hospital after he took a swing at me.
I don't think much of him either.
- See you sometime.
- So long, Johnny.
Oh, I forgot to compliment you, Fenner.
Nice, clean job you did on Bryant.
What's he talking about?
You know what's he talking about, you 10-cent thug.
- I told you to leave Bryant alone.
- Yeah? What's the matter with him?
Fenner, someday you're gonna get wise to the fact that...
...that strong-arm gangster stuff went out with Prohibition.
You're not running liquor anymore. You're in big business.
I pulled you up out of the gutter.
And you take a chance on ruining a
$200-million gold mine to satisfy a grudge.
Well, it's a fine way to pay me back for all I've done for you.
Oh, I wouldn't pay you back that way, Al.
Hello.
Yes, Kruger talking.
Yes, sir, right away.
The bosses?
They're liable to knock the props out from under me...
...on account of this Bryant mess.
If they do, it'll be the last thing that'll ever happen to me.
You knew that.
Swell, having to cover you up to save my own neck.
Who are they, Al?
If you knew, you wouldn't sleep much tonight.
How are you, gentlemen?
Who did it, Kruger?
Bryant?
I had an idea that's why you called me.
Yes, but you haven't answered the question.
I wished I knew myself.
- It wasn't anyone in the organization.
- Very interesting.
How did you arrive at that conclusion?
I checked on them.
Driscoll, Vinci, all of them.
- Did you check on Fenner?
- Why, yes. What makes you pick him out?
Just that he's a little inclined to that type of work.
No, not anymore.
He's getting too fat on the profits to want trouble. He was at the hotel.
So you don't suspect him?
Why, certainly not. He's been doing all right, hasn't he?
Getting that extra 2 million for you out of the raise in milk.
And did it occur to you that Bryant's death would cause an investigation?
Sure, but I'm not worrying.
Nothing like a good investigation to make the public happy.
This one won't make you happy.
The mayor had a talk with the governor tonight.
- He's convening an extraordinary grand jury.
- What good will that do him?
Thanks to your letting things get out of control...
...it'll cost us an extra million dollars this time.
I think you're beginning to slip, Kruger.
I suggest that you locate the weak spots in your organization now.
- There aren't any.
- I'd still look around if I were you...
...Mr. Kruger, because if you make just one more mistake, you're through.
What do you mean, through?
There's just one way to interpret it. That's all, Mr. Kruger.
You've been in the police department for 30 years, Captain McLaren.
Thirty-one.
We find that you have an excellent record...
...and a fine reputation for honesty and integrity.
And yet you've been very outspoken against the previous commissions...
...to solve the racket problem. Why is that?
- Are you asking for a frank opinion?
- Yes.
I've had that attitude because half the commissions were political sops...
...thrown to the public to keep them quiet.
The other half did what they were supposed to do.
They investigated, wrote a report...
...took a swing at the police department and went home.
- Their work was of no help?
- No.
We don't need investigations and reports.
Every policeman on the force knows about the rackets.
We know what they are, how they're worked.
And they'll keep on as long as the penalty for running it...
...is no more than for breaking a bottle.
A misdemeanor, 30 to 90 days in jail.
What if stronger laws were passed?
You'll have to go further. You'll have to wipe out the corruption.
Does this corruption reach into the police department?
There have been rumors of its reaching into the other grand juries.
- That's why they went home?
- It's possible.
This one's not going home, McLaren.
Then you'd better make it your job to find out where the racket money goes.
Who the top men are that buy protection.
The governor's taking a crime bill before the legislature next week.
It gives this jury something the others never had:
Complete power to fight the rackets.
To cut off their source of revenue and discharge corrupt officials.
We recommend the appointment of a police commissioner...
...who'll be given the same power.
- Will that help to wipe them out?
- Yes.
Would you accept the post?
- Police commissioner?
- With our complete backing.
- Yes, on one condition.
- What is it?
That I have your full support in all
I do without having to explain it...
...or answer to you for it.
- That's a large condition.
And a necessary one.
Plans are no good when they leak ahead of time...
...and I've seen some leaks in high places.
If those terms are satisfactory, let me know. Thank you for considering me.
We don't care to waste time.
We accept, and we'll recommend your appointment at once.
- Will you be ready to take charge?
- Yes, I will.
Patrolmen Jack Owens,
Raymond Keeler...
...Alfred Quinn...
...Frank Raider, Richard Phillips...
...Edward Lynch...
Police-department cleanup. Read all about it.
Police-department cleanup.
Extra. Paper, mister?
Extra. Paper?
- Hey, Garber.
- Yeah?
Didn't you forget something?
Thanks.
- Hi, boys.
- Hello.
Hello. Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Johnny.
Get these loafers working, Kelly, or McLaren will swing his ax at them.
- Hey, Johnny.
- Yeah?
- What's on your mind?
- I've got some bad news for you.
- What?
- You were washed out this morning.
- What are you doing, framing up on me?
- No, I'm on the level, Johnny.
Fired?
Well, where's the discharge?
They sent it up from headquarters.
"Inefficiency. "
It's a rotten deal for McLaren to give a man with your record.
- I thought he was a friend of yours.
- Yeah.
Good news, Miss Lee.
Mr. Schlosser sold more numbers yesterday than any day.
- How many?
- I forgot to ask him. Why?
Never mind. How much have you got there?
Two thousand one hundred and eighty. No.
- Two thousand eight hundred and...
- Let me see the slip.
- Did Schlosser do this adding?
- No. I did.
That's just what I thought.
How much are seven and four?
Which ones? Ten.
Perfect. Now, suppose you just collect and let Schlosser do the adding.
It would make it a lot easier that way.
- How much did you make in Harlem today?
- I don't know yet. Nellie hasn't come in.
There was something I wanted to tell you about Mr. Blake.
It was important, too.
- So you forgot.
- Oh, I'll remember it.
I got so much on my mind.
Yes, I know. Well, before you forget, put the money in the safe, will you?
I know it was something, and
I know it was about Mr. Blake.
I won't rest till I think what it is.
Come in.
- Hello, Nellie.
- Hello, Miss Lee. That's all.
If this keeps up, you gonna be rich.
Four thousand five hundred dollars yesterday, Miss Lee...
...and the game is spreading all over Harlem.
The boys all around the pool halls are spending their money on the numbers...
...instead of dice, and when a colored boy stops crap shooting, that's something.
Rose, how many times have I told you not to use this on Miss Lee's hair?
You ain't putting the wave in right.
Give me that comb. Get on out of here.
These no-account girls. You can't learn them nothing.
Honestly, Miss Lee, you ought to let me come back and take care of you.
No, Nellie. You've graduated. You keep on managing the Harlem end.
You thought of this game, and you deserve to get rich from it.
Sometimes I wish I hadn't thought of it.
Madame Nellie LaFleur.
Seven...
...and four...
...and 18.
Who is it?
He isn't here.
- Who'd they want?
- McCloskey.
That's you.
Hello?
He hung up.
How many had the winning number yesterday?
- One.
- Who?
Me.
Nellie.
I've been riding my preacher's auto-license number and it showed.
- People will think you're cheating.
- I didn't tell anyone.
Oh, Miss Lee.
- I remember what I had to tell you.
- What?
Mr. Blake got fired from the police force last night.
- Somebody's kidding you.
- No, it's true.
Hello, Johnny.
How are you, Lee?
Say, I never thought you'd get over this way.
What are we gonna do, stand here and swing on the door?
Why, no. Come on in.
Say, what are you in an uproar about?
Herman said you got fired.
Yeah, that's right.
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.
Who did it?
McLaren.
You were always telling me, when McLaren got to the top...
...everything would be just fine and dandy.
Well, I was wrong.
Well, it's time you got wise to yourself.
The only reason friends pat you on the back is to find an easy place to break it.
Yeah.
You're a friend, aren't you?
Well, I guess you're dumb enough to think so.
Oh, no. I'm not dumb.
You like me pretty well.
Well, that goes both ways.
If women and home life had been in my line,
I'd have fallen for you a long time ago.
That would have been kind of nice, wouldn't it?
Yeah.
Until you went crazy being married to a man who was never home.
Sort of wondering if it was an optical illusion.
Yeah.
It isn't in the cards.
And you can't beat the cards, can you?
No.
I suppose you didn't get enough salary to save much, did you?
Oh, I'll get along.
I suppose you'll be looking for another job.
I was wondering if you'd like to come in with me...
...and help me run the numbers game.
- You've got all the help you need.
- I won't have.
It's getting bigger all the time.
Some weeks it takes in from 10 to 12,000.
Twelve thousand?
In that penny-ante game?
Well, last time you told me, you were getting nickels and dimes.
I know. But they're crazy about it in Harlem...
...and now it's going over in the Bronx.
I wish you'd come in and help me run it, Johnny.
You'd make a swell job of building it up.
You'd make a lot of money for both of us.
Say, you're pretty regular, Lee.
- You'll do it?
- Oh, not a chance.
Say, any money I'd make would be coming out of your pocket.
And I don't take any money away from women.
Not me.
Well, I thought I'd tell you about it anyway.
Well, thanks just the same.
I'm sorry you got kicked out, Johnny.
It'll be kind of tough to start a new game after all these years.
Yeah, I suppose so.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take in the fights.
They got a good card on tonight.
Don't hurt your knuckles.
Hello, Johnny.
I just want to thank you for the kick in the teeth.
Will you prefer charges, commissioner?
- No, just throw him out in the street.
- Come on.
- See where Blake goes.
- Okay, boss.
This is it, boss.
Do you mind if I sit down and have a drink?
It's waiting for you.
Oh, you knew I was coming.
I had a good idea from the way your man out there was tagging me.
- You don't miss much, do you?
- It's a habit.
How was the main event?
They should have had you in the ring.
- That was a sweet punch, Johnny.
- Well, he had it coming to him.
- You're finally washed up, eh?
- Yeah, plenty.
A lot of thanks you got from McLaren and the public.
Yeah. Not even that petty-larceny pension you were talking about.
From now on, I'm gonna see what it's like looking out for number one.
Well, that offer is still good.
I'd like to have you in with me.
Doing what?
I got a hunch we're gonna have some trouble...
...with McLaren and that jury on a tear.
If there are weak spots in the organization, I've gotta find them now...
...and you'd be the first one to spot them.
I want you to look over the whole setup...
...and the only one you'll have to answer to is me.
You've got a lot of confidence in me.
Why, I've heard guys that you've sent to prison...
...say that if you ever made a deal...
...you'd see yourself dead before you'd go back on it.
How about it?
All right, Al.
- Oh, where you been?
- I just heard about Blake.
- Yeah. I understand he's moving in on us.
- That's right.
You're having him check up on us, eh?
- Any objections?
- While I'm running the produce end...
...you keep him away from it.
- Why, you got something to cover up?
- No.
Good, because he's gonna check your outfit along with all the rest.
Whether you like it or not.
If he okays it, all the cracking down McLaren can do won't hurt us.
Suppose Mr. Blake double-crosses us.
- You've got him wrong, Nick.
- Yeah, well, he's still a cop to me.
Well, if it makes you happy, you keep right on thinking so.
- Are you coming to the garage tonight?
- No.
I suppose you're gonna take him there too.
That's the idea.
You know, that hat on the bed might be bad luck.
For you or for me?
Blake gone yet?
- Yeah, he just went out with Al.
- He's got room 318 upstairs.
- Get going.
- Okay.
Go to the garage and tail him.
I wanna know every move he makes.
Check all the phone calls, get as much dope as you can.
- Go on, snap to it.
- Right.
Okay.
This place used to store bootleg liquor. I raided it once.
I sat in the building across the street and watched you.
Second-floor window. I saw you.
You'll be surprised at the change.
No, this way.
- Hey.
- Hiya, Blake.
- How are you, Blake?
- Okay.
Threw away your club, eh?
I don't need one working with you fellas, do I?
- Are you through?
Right.
Oh, we don't let the banks handle our records.
Yeah, I noticed that.
All the cash-business money is handled right here.
And most of the business is cash.
Yeah, all except a few of our regular corporations.
How much, Vinci?
Come on.
A hundred and twenty-two thousand three hundred.
What's the matter, aren't they collecting?
Fellas on the East Side didn't do so good this week.
You better give Vinci's loan sharks the once-over.
- Okay. - He won't give my outfit the once-over.
- Keep him away from it.
- What are you afraid of?
I don't like the way your face is fastened on.
I'll be down tomorrow morning and give you a chance to change it.
That's calling him, Blake.
Cut out the squawking, Louie.
He's in here to help us.
How's this for good news?
Three hundred and ten thousand one ninety-six.
Not bad for one week's take on pinball games.
I wouldn't cry about it.
- Thinking of opening a bank account?
- That's right.
What do you think I joined this outfit for?
I've been talking to some of the other fellas about you.
Yeah? Well, what have you decided?
Al's sold on you and wants you in. That's okay with us.
We're glad to have you around, but we'd like proof.
We're expecting some real help from you.
You're gonna get it.
If you failed us, we'd be awfully disappointed.
I can imagine.
- Hello, Wires.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Blake.
- That kind of stuff is out from now on.
- Yeah. I'm sick of it myself.
- Have a cigarette?
- Thanks.
- What are you doing these days?
- I'm working for Fenner. Produce business.
Yeah? Gave up the old wiretapping game, huh?
Oh, sure. There's no money in that.
Well, I'm glad to see you doing so well. See you again.
Thanks, Mr. Blake.
He just came in.
He's whistling. It works great.
- What happened, mister?
- Anything wrong?
It just went off by accident.
What's the matter?
Did you hurt your ears?
All right, out of the way, kids.
Come on, boys. Move them out.
All right, boys, push it in.
First there went my loan-shark racket, and now $200,000 in jewelry.
You ain't getting it worse than the others.
It's phony to me. The cops couldn't have found the hideouts without a tip-off.
Yeah, and it all happened since Blake got in.
Get that truck unloaded and get it out of here.
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Glad you dropped in, Fenner.
- What are you trying to pull?
- We're changing things around...
...so the honest man will have a chance to do business.
I'm running a legal wholesale business here. You can't close this plant.
- Why not?
- You gonna call them off...
...or do I get a restraining order?
Go get your restraining orders, injunctions and anything else you need.
The police used to waste a lot of time getting them, trying to stop you.
From now on, we act first.
We'll let you waste your time getting them. Maybe you can stop us.
And don't forget to tell Kruger.
That flatfoot.
If he wants trouble, I'll give him plenty of it.
Hello. Get Chamberlain on the phone.
I don't care where he is, get him on the phone.
- Better forget the lawyers and locate Al.
- Mr. Blake too.
I wanna ask him a few questions.
Hello, Chamberlain?
- You'll have to move that car.
- I'm waiting.
You've been here over an hour. Move on.
Forget it. This car belongs to Al Kruger.
Hello, Donlin. Say, what's the idea of the ticket?
Afraid McLaren will fire you if you don't get rid of them?
Nope. He's already weeded out all the rats.
Leave him alone, Johnny.
Come on, get up and learn to keep your mouth shut.
Stop it. Stop it.
Call the wagon.
Someday you'll learn that you can't be pulling that stuff.
Well, someday I'll run into you when you haven't got the cavalry around.
Call your lawyer, Al.
- Oh, solitary, huh?
- Yes, sir. Nice and private. All for yourself.
Thanks.
- Hello, Mac.
- How are you, Johnny?
- How's the jaw?
- Okay.
How'd you get here ahead of me?
Oh, Donlin phoned you were on the way over.
- Did he get hurt going off the horse?
- No, but your punches messed him up.
- You ought to learn to pull them.
- They'd look phony.
We've been watching Fenner's men.
They've had you covered every minute.
- Yes, one of them followed me here.
- Yeah?
Here's some more stuff to work on.
- Raids?
- Yeah, the sooner the better.
- You're getting them worried.
- Have you found out who bosses Kruger?
No. All I know is there is somebody higher up, and he controls everything.
If we can nail that bird, the whole works will fold up from the inside.
- Does Fenner know who it is?
- No. Nobody except Kruger.
- Think you'll be able to get it out of him?
- Oh, no.
- Then how...?
- Fenner is Kruger's number one man.
If anything happens to Kruger, and I'm gonna see that it does...
...Fenner moves up. But
I'm not gonna let him...
...because I'm gonna step into Mr. Fenner's shoes.
- How?
- Well, I don't know yet.
- Is that all you got to tell me?
- That's all for now.
Except keep on smashing them as fast as you get my instructions.
When the break comes, I'll know.
In the meantime, you've gotta play the cards the way I deal them, Mac.
Only one thing tough about it.
- What's that?
- Kruger.
He's a rat as much as the rest of them.
He'd knock me off in a minute if he found out. But I'll hate to cross him.
Because you haven't given him an even break.
- Yeah, that's right.
- I haven't given you one, Johnny.
We had another man on the force that tried to smash that mob.
They didn't kill him. They threw acid in his face.
His headlights don't burn anymore.
- I handed you a rotten job, Johnny.
- Oh, forget it, Mac.
I asked for it, didn't I?
Say, all I know is handling mugs.
I'd have taken the job if I had to ride a horse or hand out traffic tickets.
Kruger's lawyer is in the office with a writ for you.
All right.
- Take care of yourself, Johnny.
- Sure.
As soon as I'm set, I'll let you know.
In the meantime, keep hammering, especially Fenner.
- Blake. Nobody else but Blake.
- Nobody touched us...
...till you brought Blake in. Now...
- Do you think I'm a sap?
- We're talking about Blake.
- So am I.
I gave the guy a break.
If he's double-crossing me...
- Yeah?
- Mr. Blake to see you.
Send him in.
Thanks for the fast legal service, Al.
Hello, stool pigeon.
Say, what is this, a wake?
It might be.
Nice picture of McLaren.
The boys think you're working for him.
- I'm wondering.
- I'm not.
I suppose your bird dog told you.
I mean that thing you've had trailing me since I've been in the outfit.
What have you got to say?
Sure, Al. They're right. I just sold you right down the river.
Yeah, the cops said they were sorry they kicked me off the force.
McLaren sent me a basket of flowers for hitting him in the jaw.
He said if I wanted to come back, he'd give me the whole Bronx to wander around in.
I wouldn't clown, Johnny.
Finally got wise to you. You're through.
Oh, no. I'm just starting.
Copper.
I don't like guys who put their hands on me.
- Let's keep this a business meeting.
- Start talking.
I went to work for you,
Al, because you wanted help.
I didn't come to you, you came to me.
So you think I crossed you, huh?
Well, I couldn't get a dime a dozen if I handed this whole mob...
...over to the coppers, and you know it.
I can see now why you needed help.
- And you need lots of it.
- You gonna let him talk his way out?
Shut up. Keep talking.
Well, did any of these masterminds have anything useful to offer?
- Keep on talking.
- I've never seen it fail.
Whenever mugs get into a jam...
...the first thing they do is they start knifing each other.
Hey, I thought you were smart, Al.
Have you got anything to suggest?
Let McLaren have his fun. You can't stop him.
As soon as he's made a showing, the grand jury will fold up...
...and leave him without any backing. They always do.
- Meanwhile, we sit back and wind up broke.
- No, but go to work.
Stop playing cops and robbers.
Quit tapping telephone wires.
Spend your time building up new rackets...
...so when McLaren comes up, he'll find a dozen more going.
Just pull them right out of the hat, eh?
- I suppose you've got one.
- Yes, I've got one.
Numbers.
Just talking about a new racket.
What's the odds against picking the right number out of one to 1000?
- Why, 1000-1.
- That's right.
And the payoff is 600-for-1.
If anybody picks the right number.
Now, here.
A lot of people would pick that every day if 1 dollar would win them 600.
What are you trying to sell?
The penny-ante game
Lee Morgan's running?
It's so penny-ante she's cleaning up 12,000 a week...
...just around a few neighborhood stores...
...and most of the bets are dimes and nickels.
Seven million people in this town, all looking for easy money.
You just offer them 600-for-1, and this thing will spread like a four-alarm fire.
They won't be buying one number, but four or five.
To control the winning number, pay off on racetrack bets...
...and manipulate the totals.
All it needs is organization.
Get a million people in this town buying numbers...
...and this one racket will clean up 300 million a year.
Why, it's a cinch. It's easy.
You boys better beat it.
Mr. Blake and me wanna talk over a little business.
Come on, Al.
Give it a chance, and get this thing set up.
- Tell you all about it at the next meeting.
- Sure.
- See you later, boss.
- Everything is gonna be all right.
- Sit down, Johnny.
- Thanks.
Let's go to work.
- What makes you think we're gonna retire?
- There ain't room for you.
We're organizing numbers games all over the city.
- And that lets you out.
- Lets us out, nothing.
I started this game here and I'm gonna keep it going, and so is Miss Lee.
You and no other gunman's gonna tell us what to do.
You have us wrong, sister.
We're businessmen.
We don't carry guns.
- Oh, you don't?
- No. We're just telling you.
Well, then I'm afraid we'll have to ask Timothy about it.
Yes, ma'am.
Timothy.
Timothy.
Throw those gentlemen out on their ears.
They took the money away. The numbers money, the bag, everything.
- Who did?
- I don't know. Some men.
They told me to keep my face out of there.
They said I couldn't collect anymore.
- They did, did they?
- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna tell Johnny Blake about it. He'll run those mugs off the 93rd Street dock.
Well, I guess I'll go upstairs and turn in.
You did all right tonight, Johnny.
- Hey, has Fenner come in yet?
- He's in the coffee shop.
- Where'd you get that shiner?
- An oversized bouncer up in the Bronx.
- What were you doing there?
- Taking the numbers game for Fenner.
We were doing all right till we tangled with this Morgan dame.
Have a seat.
Where did you get the idea to take over the numbers game?
I have taken it over. By tomorrow it'll be in the bag.
You're gonna keep your hands off.
I'm gonna run that game.
Since when did you get to be a big shot in this outfit?
- Tonight.
- You ain't got a crew to do any organizing.
- Well, I will have, from now on.
- He's working for me, the same as you are.
I didn't give you any orders to take over.
- He's to have it, eh?
- That's right.
I used to be number one man around here, Al.
You're kind of kicking me downgrade, ain't you?
You'll still be number one man if you quit stepping out of line.
So you call this stepping out of line, eh?
This, and a publisher named Bryant.
- Thanks, Al.
- Okay.
There's another thing we might just as well get straight.
Lee Morgan started this game.
She's gonna keep on getting a smalltime rake-off out of it.
When this outfit takes anything over, it takes it all.
If you're gonna run it, you're gonna run it right.
Okay.
Take it easy.
Louie, call it off.
I said, call it off.
I understand John Blake lives here.
- Correct.
- I'd like to see him.
- What's your name, please?
- Lee Morgan.
I'll try his room.
Mr. John Blake, please.
Right. I'm sorry, he doesn't answer.
- Are you looking for Johnny Blake?
- Yes, I am.
My name's Nick Fenner.
Maybe I can help.
Well, I've got to find him.
- You're Lee Morgan?
- Yes.
You run the numbers game up in the Bronx.
So what?
- I hear they started running you out.
- They won't get away with it.
It's a dirty trick. I don't blame you for gunning for Blake.
Gunning for him?
- He's the one that's taking it away.
- That's a lie.
He's grabbing it to put himself in strong with Al Kruger.
Go and ask him.
He's in the coffee shop.
Oh, hello, Lee.
Johnny, are you taking the numbers game?
Yes.
- Why?
- Well, I can't tell you.
And I tried to take you in with me.
It sort of turned out better to toss it to the wolves, didn't it?
I thought they'd let you keep running your end of it.
I guess that wasn't poetry about friends finding an easy place to break your back.
Hey, give me 742.
- I know I'm gonna win today.
- Yeah, sure.
I tell my wife this morning
I got luck today, all right.
- One buck on 777.
- Shooting the works, ain't you?
I just took three blonds to the seventh floor. See you later.
Eight-eleven, 301 and 987.
Ten dollars on each of them.
I'll be around in the morning...
...with a clothes basket to collect.
- Okay.
- Oh, no such luck. Thanks.
- What is it?
- Five-zero-eight won. -
Oh, that's my number. I won.
- Really?
- Now I'll get that fur coat.
That's better than putting it in bank accounts.
If the tax boys find out, they're liable to wonder where it comes from.
It looks like I'll have to hire another box.
Looks like you'll have to hire about
10, the way the numbers keep paying off.
- You wanna send some of it to Canada.
- Is that what you do?
Yeah. It might be convenient sometime.
Well, you and the bosses must have had to hire a vault.
Whatever they do with it, they're not complaining.
- Well, how about meeting them sometime?
- Not a chance.
I'm the only one who knows them, I gather they want it to stay that way.
I guess you can't blame them for that.
Thanks.
Say, what would happen to them if you got lost?
They'd just pick somebody else and keep on going.
- Fenner, I suppose.
- No, I think it'd be you.
- Me?
- They think you're the best I've got.
- They do, huh?
- But you wouldn't want it, Johnny.
It's a top job, all right, but it's the last one a guy ever holds.
There's only one way out.
Yeah, that's the payoff for helping them, huh?
But you don't have to worry about getting it.
- I'm not gonna get lost.
- Better keep your eyes open.
The boys are restless about McLaren still hammering their rackets.
- He'll be washed up pretty soon.
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
How are you, Mr. Hollister?
Oh, Blake. I didn't recognize you.
- Well, I guess it's been about five years.
- All of that.
- Oh, Mr. Kruger, Mr. Hollister.
- Mr. Kruger.
- How do you do?
- I read you left the police.
You seem to be doing all right.
- Well, have you had any more holdups?
- No.
I lost some jewelry a few years ago. It only took Blake about six hours to recover it.
- Nobody was better on that job.
- I wish I'd known when you quit.
- I'd have liked you in the banking business.
- Oh, there isn't enough money in it.
- I'm glad to have seen you again.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kruger.
- Goodbye.
- Swell fella.
- Yeah.
Hello, Mac. I'm ready to go.
Grab Kruger right away.
I can't cover an arrest like that.
You've got him. Put him away.
- What are you gonna do, Johnny?
- I got no time to answer questions.
Wait a minute. That's not all.
Crack down on Fenner's milk outfit. Break it up. Smash it.
This is the last move.
Okay, you'll hear more from me.
- What's up?
- They knocked over your milk outfit.
- Which plant?
- All of them.
They grabbed the trucks in
Brooklyn, all we've got left.
We've gotta do something or be washed up.
- What's Al doing?
- Nothing.
- He'll let it ride like everything else.
- But the numbers pay big.
Sure. It's gonna keep on paying off, as far as he's concerned.
- Where is he?
- Checking with the racetrack boys.
- Get out.
- Listen, I'm going with you.
Get out of that car.
Where's the protection you were supposed to give us?
You're not coasting on the profits from the numbers game, are you...
...letting the rest of us hold the bag?
I'm taking orders just the same as you are.
When the right ones come,
I'll pass them along to you.
- Keep your noses out of this.
- We were just wondering.
- All right. See you a week from Thursday.
- Okay.
Hello, Nick. What's eating you?
I'm starting to take over the numbers game.
- Are you at it again?
- It ain't a very big one.
If Mike catches you back there, he'll crown you.
Yeah, but he isn't here.
Oh, look what happened.
- Hello, Lee.
- Hello.
Pretty soon you'll start coming around here in the mornings.
- Beat it.
- Who, me?
You.
I wouldn't stay.
- He's no good, Miss Lee.
- She knows it.
So do I.
A lot of news there.
- Who did it?
- We're trying to find out.
- I thought he was a friend of yours.
- He was.
You don't seem very upset about it.
There's no use crying if the dice happen to fall that way.
Do you wanna go back in the numbers game?
- What are you trying to do, kid me?
- You started this racket.
You ought to have a share in it.
- I suppose Blake will let me have it.
- He has nothing to say about it.
I'm running things from now on.
If you want the Bronx and
Harlem districts, they're yours.
If you need protection, you'll get it.
You don't trust me.
I don't trust anybody.
Neither do I.
We ought to work fine together.
How about it?
You're gonna take it away from Blake?
Yeah.
Go ahead and take it.
The numbers game.
We'll find out who got
Al sooner or later...
...but we ain't got any time to start worrying about that now.
The question is, do I run this business from now on, or don't I?
All right with us. The bosses may have something to say...
...if we ever hear from them.
- I'll take care of that.
Why wasn't Blake asked in on this meeting?
Because he ain't gonna have so much to say from now on.
He's the one that sold Al on sitting back and waiting for McLaren to run down.
Well, it didn't work out that way.
I'm putting the rackets back in full swing, even if it means trouble with McLaren.
- Hiya, Mike.
- Hi, Johnny.
- Joe. Hello, Lambert.
- Hi.
- Driscoll.
- Hiya, Blake.
I'm sorry I'm late. Say, what is this, an election?
- It's already been held.
- And you're it.
- Any objections?
- A few.
- Yeah, what's the first one?
- Job was given to me.
- When?
- The bosses called me in...
...two hours after the news broke.
- Do you expect us to believe that?
Well, I told them you might have a few doubts...
...but I couldn't persuade them to come down here and prove it.
Who are they?
- Did Kruger tell you?
- No.
So I think I'll keep on sitting in the driver's seat...
...till I hear from them personally.
Sit anywhere you want to, but don't try and stop me from carrying out orders.
Got orders and everything, eh?
Yeah.
I'm to take charge and have their money to them by 10:00 tomorrow night.
Or keep it and no one will know the difference.
Say, the numbers business is doing all right, Lambert.
I don't have to chisel in on yours.
Half the money I take to them will be mine anyway.
Well, what do you say?
Do I take charge of their split or have you some other suggestion?
None that I can think of right now.
All right, then, we meet in the garage tomorrow night at 6.
Okay, Johnny.
Hello. This is John Blake.
The Oceanic Bank, Mr. Blake.
Mr. Hollister is asking if you could drop over...
...and have a little talk with him.
It's about your checking account.
What's the matter? Overdrawn?
I don't know, but Mr. Hollister considered it important.
- He'd appreciate it very much.
- Tell him I'll be right over.
Mr. Blake.
Will you go right in.
Thank you.
Hello, Blake.
- Didn't expect to see you again so soon.
- Neither did I.
Mr. Thorndyke, Mr. Blake.
How do you do?
- How are you?
- Mr. Caldwell.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
Hey, did it take a board meeting and an ex-government official...
...to go over my account?
- Nothing wrong with your account.
We wanna know why you tried to take over Kruger's job.
You're the heads, huh?
Yes.
Well, no wonder the organization has been so well protected.
- Why did you try to take over the job?
- I didn't try and take it over, I took it over.
Did you think we might object?
Well, why should you? I've proven that I can run it better than anyone.
- Fenner isn't any good.
- Yes, you've given us a nice bit of revenue.
I've given you more than any four of them put together.
You'll keep on getting it, just give me a few breaks.
You know, I'm not in this for fun.
- Satisfied?
- Right.
Blake, the job is yours.
Thanks. You're not making any mistake.
Incidentally, Mr. Blake, you are the only one who will know who we are.
I understand that.
And the first thing we want you to do is to collect our royalties...
...in the garage tonight and bring them here.
I've already made arrangements about collecting them.
- Will it be all right if I'm here at 10?
- Yes, yes.
Before we go into detailed instructions,
I suggest we drink to Mr. Blake's success.
- Well, that's a good idea.
- How about it?
Well, it'll taste pretty good.
You're making a mistake not telling the public what you're doing.
- The papers are blasting at you.
- Let them.
You haven't discovered a thing on Kruger's death.
- Not so far.
- What are you doing to investigate it?
- I don't care to say.
- I'll be perfectly frank with you.
The jury is fed up the way you've kept them in the dark.
- Those were the terms when I took the job.
- You were to deliver...
...but you're getting nowhere.
You've broken up a few rackets...
...but you haven't gotten the men we want. If we don't get them, they'll get us.
A lot of pressure is being brought to bear to have us discharged.
If that happens, all our work will have gone for nothing.
- I think you'll have some action soon.
- I hope so.
If something doesn't break within the next two weeks...
...you're going to be let out.
Thanks for telling me.
- Did you want to see me?
- Yes.
Have these 40 men here at 3:00 this afternoon.
Tell them to be ready for 24-hour duty.
- Things are getting warm, eh?
- Plenty.
- Got your figures, Driscoll?
- Yeah, 28,400.
- Say, that's pretty bad.
- I'll say it is.
The first time I was here, it was about 170,000.
- It won't stay this way very long.
- Yeah?
- Aren't you gonna wait for Nick?
- No, I'll get his figures later.
- Right.
- I'll see you at the hotel.
Okay.
- All set to take them the money, eh?
- Yeah.
- Shall I give them your regards?
- That's a lot of dough to go south with.
If I ever find out you don't know them, I'm gonna drop in on you.
Yeah, like you did on Kruger.
I'll be looking for you.
- Raid.
- Coppers!
Hey, you. Throw me that bag.
- Burn those papers.
- Okay.
Let that silver go. Come on, let's get out of here.
Stick them up.
Stick them up. Stick them up.
Outside. Come on, get them outside.
- Yeah. Here it is.
- That's it.
- Everybody get out?
- None of them got away.
You mean Blake told them.
- Blake?
- I saw him signal the cops.
Don't kid yourself he doesn't know the bosses.
He wouldn't have pulled this unless he was ready to clamp down.
He's gonna see them at 10:00, and I can't warn them, I don't know them.
That makes it great for him.
- I've got to get him before he gets to them.
- Yeah, if you can find him.
I've got Wires tailing him. I'll find him.
- Hear from Blake?
- No, and he's five minutes late.
I'd feel a lot better if we'd got Fenner.
- Are the men stationed?
- Yes.
Hello. Johnny? Where are you?
112418th Street. Did you get everyone at the garage?
Except Fenner. Couldn't find him.
Well, that's fine. Well, don't worry about Fenner finding me.
- Did you get the serial numbers?
- Yes, the job's almost washed up, Johnny.
If we grab them with money matching those numbers, it's airtight.
They'll get it at 10 sharp. I'm leaving here at a quarter of.
Don't make a move till I come out. One phony sign and you'll be out of luck.
I won't. But I'm still worried about Fenner.
Oh, forget it, Mac. We'll be having a beer at 10:30.
Yeah.
So he says, "Don't worry, the warden's betrayed you. "
Pardon me. You're wanted on the telephone.
- Excuse me.
- Surely.
- Yes?
- Has Mr. Fenner been there this evening?
This is Mr. Kagel speaking.
When he comes in, will you please tell him Mr. Blake phoned?
He wants to see him.
It's very important.
He's at 1124 East 18th Street.
Yes, I'll tell him. Thanks.
Pardon me, Mr. Fenner wants to see you.
- Where is he?
- In the office.
What's the idea, coming in the back way?
The cops are after me.
Do you know any places that Blake might be using for a hideout?
Yes. He's at 1124 East 18th Street.
He says he wants to see you.
Yeah, how do you know?
Well, someone by the name of Kagel phoned.
- Why? What's happened?
- Nothing.
Blake's done what I said he'd do.
Put the crowd in a spot for McLaren.
- They're under arrest.
- He's working with the police?
Been working with them all the way, and I'm gonna pay him off.
There's no telephone listed at 1124 East 18th.
There's a phone there.
I've got to find the number.
There's no number listed at that address.
It must be a confidential number. I'm sorry.
- Are you all right, Johnny?
- Yeah.
- Has Fenner been here?
- He's in there, on the floor.
Say, drive me over to Wall and 24th.
- Don't you wanna go uptown?
- No, I've got some business.
I was afraid he was gonna kill you.
- Well, how did you know about it?
- I told him where you were.
I didn't know what he was gonna do...
...till he told me you were with the police again.
- You know that, huh?
- Oh, I feel like such a heel, Johnny.
After how I talked to you that night in the hotel.
Well, you didn't know. Forget it.
I tried to be sore, but it seemed so funny not seeing you around.
You're all through with that now, aren't you, Johnny?
Yeah.
I'm so glad. Now you can go back on the force...
...maybe in the Broadway district.
Yeah.
Here's where I get off.
Are you all right, Johnny?
Oh, sure, I'm all right.
Go back that way, Lee.
- I'll wait for you.
- You'll have to wait too long.
Thanks for the lift.
You're aces, Lee.
I'll remember that, Johnny.
- Good night.
- Good night, Johnny.
- Something's happened to him.
- We can't break it up now.
Hello, Blake.
- How are you, gentlemen?
- All right.
Ten o'clock on the dot.
You keep your appointments.
- I wanted to make my first job perfect.
- Good. You can open it, Hunter.
Did you have any trouble with Fenner?
We got along fine.
How does it feel to be head of the organization?
I've been waiting for a night like this for 15 years.
- You deserve it.
- Thank you.
- Will you gentlemen need me any longer?
- No, we'll get in touch with you next week.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Go ahead in, boys.
- What's that?
- Lock the door.
Hold it, Hollister. I think McLaren can use that.
- Get that box, boys.
- Okay, cap.
- Put the bracelets on them.
- Yes, sir.
Have a look in that vault.
Johnny.
Hello, Mac.
- Did you nail them?
- Yes.
- Well, that's that.
- Who got you, Fenner?
- Yeah.
- Where is he?
He's washed up.
You check the bullets he put into me with those...
...that killed Bryant and Kruger.
- They're all from his gun.
- You didn't miss a bet, did you?
One.
I was wrong about that glass of beer. But we've had lots of them.
We'll be having more, Johnny.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
It won't do any good.
- Keep kicking them into line, Mac.
- I will, Johnny.
I'd like to think that when those mugs pass a policeman...
...they'll keep on tipping their hats.
A Woman's Face
Rosenvik Inn
- What did he say then?
- He threatened to tell my husband...
- Just leave it. We'll serve ourselves.
- Of course.
- I can't believe such foul people exist.
- And they're nearly untouchable.
A telephone call - that can't be proved in court!
And they have the letters.
If only I knew how they got them!
Where did you keep them?
Foolishly, I always had them on me.
It was almost like having you close to me.
I have acted shamefully.
Both towards you and...
I'm getting my come-uppance now.
- When did they say you were to be there?
- At five o'clock on the dot.
- He's such a busy man.
- Ha! Yeah...
Blackmailers probably have a lot of work to do.
- Perhaps I should go with you.
- No, he specifically requested no witnesses.
There ought to be a bounty on his ilk!
Well, we'll have to listen to their demands.
What about tonight, Vera?
Will you come?
Won't that only make it harder to say goodbye? I'll come, but not until later.
My husband will be at the Medical
Society, so I won't have to lie.
- Don't you have a mirror here?
- Right over there, Madam.
- We have a lovely party table in here.
- Sorry? Oh, party...er...
- I had actually phoned about a...
- I see!
- The reservation for Director...
- Director Nilsson.
Of course! Right this way, the table is set.
Thank you, my man.
Shall we go in?
- How lovely!
- I'm sure it will be delicious.
This is very strange.
Well, what do you say about this latest idea?
Holmgren & Co.?
The old man is apparently loaded.
You can never be sure of that.
- Did you happen to get her name?
- That's easy enough to find out.
The main point is, she wasn't his wife!
That's true. That's what's important to us!
Nyman! Forget that for now.
Wasn't she to be here at five?
Yes, five o'clock.
But it's only a few minutes past.
When you say five, people should know you mean it! It's your smarmy prattle!
- What?
- They went out for lunch again today.
- It was a nervous affair.
- No doubt!
Smarmy prattle...!
Here she is! Get out!
And it's so smoky in here, too.
- Are you going to answer?
- In a moment!
Go on, hide!
May I come in? The environment out here isn't good for my health.
Come in, madam!
Come in.
- What can I do for you?
- Was it you who rang about some letters?
It doesn't matter who made the call.
As that individual's representative,
I'm aware of the circumstances.
- Won't you sit down?
- No, thank you.
- What do you want for them?
- I'm...sorry?
- This is blackmail, isn't it?
- Blackmail is such an ugly word.
- But not an unfamiliar one, I'll warrant.
- Not at all.
The law is quite clear on the matter.
Chapter 21, paragraph 10.
Shame that paragraph is so seldom observed.
One might wonder who would suffer the most if it were.
The plaintiff or the defendant.
- Where are the letters?
- Not to worry, they're in safe keeping.
- What must I give you to get them?
- I assure you, a trifle!
Let me see, there were three letters if I'm not mistaken.
My client estimates their value at
1,000 kronor each, which is fair, considering the trouble they'd cause if they fell into the wrong hands.
Your husband's, for example.
That would be 3,000 kronor...
...plus 2,000 for my trouble.
A total of 5,000.
- I can't get that much money.
- Oh no?
Do consider it for a moment.
I understand you want to keep your husband out of this.
It would be a small thing for him. But...
Your friend, perhaps?
Have you no conscience at all?
My conscience is perhaps somewhat... modern, I admit. But I do have heart.
A heart that is very understanding of youth and beauty.
But this is a business matter, and 5,000 is nothing to haggle over.
A beloved husband's unshaken faith must be worth more than that?
I'll try to get it.
- Can I ring you when...
- I prefer to be the one who rings.
But because my client is in financial straits at the moment...
- Ring tonight at 9 o'clock.
- With pleasure! I'll show you out.
Well, well.
That was easy.
Easy? Perhaps it looked easy.
But you can't wring 5,000 from a stone if you don't know what you're doing.
- Fool!
- What?!
What's the problem? Isn't 5,000 enough?
She didn't look like she could pay more.
Oh no?
Why should she get off so easy?
Oh no. Then you don't know me!
Doesn't she have everything a woman could want?
Is she not admired? Loved?
Adored?
- Was she not beautiful?
- Oh, she was certainly beautiful.
- She was very pleasing on the eyes.
- Well then!
Shouldn't she pay for that?!
She's on the warpath again.
- Nyman!
- Yes?
I'll take care of this affair.
We'll have 10,000!
- Ten?!
- 25% of that is...
I'm afraid you won't have 25% anymore...
- ...Handsome Herman.
- We agreed to share equally!
- What a question!
- It must be a joke.
Anna is the last person who would break a deal.
- Where is the Count?
- He'll be here at any minute.
- You were joking, right?
- No!
From now on, you, Herman and the Count get only 20%.
- The rest is mine.
- Unacceptable! Twice as much as us?
- Don't I deserve it?
- No! I found the mark. I won't take less!
Use your brain for a moment.
If you have one.
Nyman told her 5,000.
25% of that is 1,250, right?
Yes, that's fair.
- I'll get 10,000.
- We'll see about that.
I'll get 10,000! And 20% of that is 2,000.
- Which deal is best for you?
- When you put it that way...
- Well?
- It's not fair to your partners, but...OK.
Then it's a deal.
It's the Count! Let him in!
Your demands are getting unreasonable.
I want to be rich.
And I don't want to wait.
- I can't enjoy life as others do.
- Oh no?
And I'm not asking for that.
But no one can stop me loving money.
Hello, Herman. How are you?
Handsome as always?
The family is gathered, I see.
My lady, if you'll permit, a small token of my appreciation.
- Hi there, Nyman.
- Hi.
I see you're your usual sunny self.
What news from the underworld?
Nothing at all?
Well, I have a little nibble that may lead to a big catch.
The bait will be at my place tonight at seven.
Handsome Herman, you'll be serving, but make yourself scarce.
It will be a fine dinner, small, but scrumptious.
Simple but elegant.
But you'll have to wear your tux, Nyman.
You're all cordially invited!
Let's see... Quite a selection.
You're a discerning drinker, Torsten.
Cheers!
Cheers, everyone!
Lovely to see you all here.
Now, Torsten, let's hear it.
We're all ears.
And don't be shy - we're not easily shocked.
Nyman! Did you know the cat is named after you? Cognac!
I heard something about an inheritance?
Well, yes...that is...
I really have no reason to hope for anything.
- Unless...
- Unless...something happens.
- Something...embarrassing.
- Something happens? What do you mean?
There's something of an obstacle between you and your inheritance.
- What do you propose?
- Me?
- Nothing really.
- But if something were to happen...
...whatever that might be.
What would we get for our trouble?
I...was thinking...
Then it's no small thing you expect of us.
I beg your pardon.
You have a phone call, Miss Holm.
- For me?
- Yes.
Excuse me.
- Torsten, what do you think of my cigarettes?
- Thanks, they're excellent.
Duty-free. Private import!
- What is it?
- Director Boman's "business card".
- That changes things.
- I thought so. Not some little fish!
- So, Nyman! Enjoying yourself?
- I should say so!
Hennessy Extra, Havana and your music? I'm in heaven.
Excellent. Good, Torsten, have a drink.
Thanks, I thought I would.
Forgive me. Where were we now?
Yes, you were saying something about 50,000.
- What was your name again?
- Boman.
Director Boman. Why do you ask?
Boman...
That's right.
No. We don't have a deal...
..."Director Boman".
I...
But, er... I don't understand.
- I thought...
- No. I can't see how it benefits us.
But I can guess at the risks it implies.
And I won't risk that much for 50,000.
Cheers.
- But...
- For a fortune, however...
...say, a million...
Like, let's say, the Barring millions...
You know, Consul Barring at Forsa Ironworks?
Say you were his nephew.
And his sole heir.
Now that would be another matter.
- But now, no.
- Well, well!
Your family name is Barring!
Isn't that grand.
Me, I'm still Severin.
You're quite the rascal, Torsten.
Or perhaps it's Philip or Pontus?
My name is Barring.
And I'll agree to 75,000.
Pardon my interruption, but what was the little "happening"?
- That will be a later concern.
- Pardon me.
This is obviously a sensitive issue.
But fine, whatever it is.
What do you say to 75,000, plus...
- 25% of your future inheritance?
- That's insane!
But why, dear sir? What's 25% compared with the 75% you get?
- Take the deal!
- Yes, so we can begin planning.
Well, I suppose...we'll say 25% then.
That's more like it!
So, what did you have in mind?
- I haven't got anything in mind!
- You must have some idea.
To begin with, we need to get a person into my uncle's house.
Someone we can trust.
I've just learned he's looking for...
...a nurse, or a governess, for his grandson.
She has to be intelligent and young.
Confidence-inspiring.
- You want us to find that girl.
- Yes.
- You would have been ideal, if not for...
- No, no.
- We'll find someone.
- Good.
- I'll write her a recommendation.
- Fine.
- And then...
- ...something was to happen...
- Not right away!
- No, no.
- She has to get close to the family first.
- Of course.
- But where do we find that gem, Anna?
- It won't be easy.
No.
In addition to the qualities you describe, she probably needs one more.
- Ruthlessness.
- That would make things easier.
Say... - Excuse me.
- It's nine o'clock. I have a call to make.
- Say we'll be there at ten.
- On the dot.
- On the dot.
- I'm sorry, who are you looking for?
- Are you Mrs Wegert?
- Yes.
- I was to come at ten o'clock on the dot.
I don't think I'm late.
Come in.
Don't be afraid. I'm not - quite - as dangerous as I look.
This way.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Where are the letters?
- Where is the money?
I wasn't able to get any.
- That's a shame. For you.
- No, no, wait!
You can have these instead.
They're worth at least 5,000.
- Yes.
My representative must have misunderstood me.
Ten thousand is the sum.
But I'll take this as a 50% down payment.
- You...! You're...
- Businessmen.
Perhaps a bit on the moral periphery.
But businessmen all the same.
We know what our goods are worth.
- Suppose I report you to the police?
- It would do you no good.
You have no proof.
Do you have the letters on you?
10,000 isn't exactly a fortune, but you don't carry it with you.
You do, however, keep it close by.
How do I know I'll get them, if I give you 5,000 more?
Those are three charming letters.
Probably worth more to the addressee than all the riches in the world.
But I'd gladly exchange them for some smaller notes.
I'll try to get the money.
Wait here a moment.
No, no. Just go out to the street and I'll be along.
Yes, Georg.
- I just have to go and get the money.
- I understand.
- But...in the meanwhile...
- Perhaps I can wait here?
If I won't disturb anyone?
- There's no one here, but...
- Oh! You're afraid to leave me alone.
Unnecessary. I don't leave a job half done.
- About these...
- They're yours.
As you wish.
Nyman!
Give me the letters.
- Is it done?
- Soon. Now go.
ALLAN WEGERT
Military Hospital in France
Vera?
Where are you?
Vera?
What is it? Is someone here?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Stop right there!
My wife's!
And more.
Which you found outside?
And you took a shortcut through the window to return them?
Is that right?
Get up!
- I can't.
- Perhaps the police can help you up.
- What is it? Are you hurt?
- Yes.
You're not making it up?
Where does it hurt?
My foot!
I'd like to have a look. Let me help you.
Watch the foot.
- Does this hurt?
- No.
- There?
- No.
- There?
- Ow!
You were lucky you "dropped in" on a doctor's house.
We've a visitor.
- Remove your stocking.
- What is this?
- Bad luck!
Your jewellery was on its way out of the window with this young lady.
I happened to walk in on her.
She was in a bit of a hurry.
And so I ended up with a patient.
- What are you going to do with me?
- Bandage your foot for starters.
- Before you ring the police?
- The police?
I'll consider that later.
I'm a doctor above all.
Is it absolutely necessary to trouble the police?
- I suspect they won't mind.
- It's not necessary. Let her walk away.
- She may not be walking for a while.
- But there's no harm done!
Reporting her won't make things better.
I feel sorry for her as it is.
There. That's done.
As you wish. - You have my wife to thank for your freedom.
Thank you.
Why do you steal? Why don't you work like an honest person?
With this face?
- Were you burnt as a child?
- Yes. I was.
Is it any of your business?
It's my face! What's it to you?
- I know I'm a monster!
- And I hear desperation in your voice.
- Have you been caught before?
- No. This is my first failure.
See this as a lesson, then.
Next time it may be worse.
I don't care!
My life can't be anything other than hell!
- Yes! I'm monstrous - so I must be one!
- That's all in your head.
I have a book of photos here that you could learn from.
- I saw it.
- Well then.
Then you saw what bad shape the war invalids were in.
Before we managed to make them somewhat human again.
But it didn't make them bitter, even if they had more reason to be.
I'd really like to X-ray that foot.
I think it has a fracture.
- Where are you headed now?
- I don't know.
- Do you have a family?
- No.
Friends? Someone who can look after you?
Since I've been saddled with you,
I'll squeeze you in at my clinic.
- You'll have to be still for a few months.
- If I must.
Spending time in a hospital bed often leads to some reflection.
Perhaps you'll leave it with a kinder view of the world.
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
Do you think I have any chance of competing with "honest people"? Hardly!
- No...
- Don't.
No.
But if I were to give you a chance?
- How was your meal?
- Fine, thanks.
- Has the doctor come?
- Yes, he's here.
- And he's removing the bandages today?
- If he said so, then he will.
You've seen cases like mine before.
You must know...
- It usually goes well if you stay calm.
- Calm...!
Perhaps we should close the window.
You have a visitor today.
Me?!
You must be mistaken. No one knows...
- I don't know anyone here.
- It's only me, Miss Holm.
- Who?
- Me.
- I just wanted to pop by. My husband said...
- What did he say?
He didn't say much, but he rarely tells me about his patients.
I asked him about you.
- I have a reason to worry about you too.
- You're thinking of the letters.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
- What if my husband failed?
- Then you think I'll want revenge?
And if he's successful, then we're even?
- Is that what you mean?
- Yes, I...had hoped so.
Dr Wegert has done everything that can be done.
Anyone can fail.
And...and then?
We're here to take you to the doctor, Miss.
All right now, let's do this very gently and carefully.
- Here.
- Put your arms round my neck. There...
And...here we go.
Don't put any weight on the injured foot. There.
And the blanket...
Now you can go, nurse.
- Nurse? May I have my bag?
- Bag?
- It's on the bedside table.
- I'll get it.
- Here you are.
- Thanks. Wait just a moment.
Mrs Wegert?
Thank you, that's all.
- Hello, Miss Holm.
- Hello.
How are you feeling today? Nervous?
Yes.
I understand. Just relax.
My wife mentioned she was going to visit you today.
- She's already been here.
- She's been just as worried as you.
Thank you, Nurse.
Please tell my wife to wait for me.
- I won't be long.
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, Nurse...
I'll call when I need you.
Miss Holm, it's been a long time since I did an operation like this.
Back then it was to help the unfortunate victims of war.
I've made an exception now, because
I understand that you're also unfortunate.
And to give you a chance.
But if I have succeeded in changing your outer shell, don't forget that the inner change must come from you.
I would be very happy if it did.
Well. That's all I had to say.
Don't be so tense!
It will be easier if you relax.
Remove the bandages, Nurse.
Well, that's done.
As it looks now, I think the end result will be quite good.
Oh, may I have a mirror?
Of course.
- Nurse, give Miss Holm a mirror.
But I must warn you, it will be a very long time before you see the end result.
Here you are, Miss Holm.
Oh, Dr Wegert!
Well?
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Good luck, Miss Paulsson.
I'll come up later to see how you're doing.
After my recommendations, my uncle must expect the Eighth Wonder of the World to arrive in Forsa.
Perhaps Miss Holm also exaggerated when she recommended me to you.
I've only met Miss Holm once...
But I have a sense that she always uses the right person for a job.
Perhaps.
But this assignment is fairly murky as yet.
At least, I didn't get any details.
No. I'll provide more details later.
- Once you're settled in.
- All aboard!
Well. Goodbye then.
If you have any problems, ring me.
Oh, hello!
- Are you heading to Forsa?
- No, I've accompanied a lady who...
Perhaps I should introduce
Engineer Berg from Forsa Ironworks.
And Miss...
- And Miss Paulsson.
- All aboard!
- You'll be travelling together. Goodbye!
- Goodbye, Torsten.
May I?
Thank you.
- Was your name Paulsson?
- Yes.
Oh yes, Anna Paulsson, 25.
Good at languages, last employed in a Swedish family in London.
Educated. Determined. Loves children.
Imposter.
- I'm sorry?
- I just made that up!
But you only have yourself to blame.
A governess can't look like that!
- What do you mean?
- I suppose that sounded a bit cliché.
But it was meant as a compliment.
This is how Lars-Erik and I...
...pictured the unknown Miss Paulsson.
That's a conglomerate of the last few versions.
- Lars-Erik, is that...?
- The dictator of Forsa. And future king.
The one who will administer the Barring fortune in the future.
But just now he's six years old and awaiting his new governess.
- Bookings for?
- Please.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
I hope you don't mind eating lunch with me, Miss Paulsson?
And discuss Forsa's 24 notabilities, the vicar, the pharmacist and so on.
I'm grateful for any information that is useful to me.
- But how can you know so much about me?
- Miss Paulsson!
The arrival of a new governess in Forsa is an earth-shaking event.
I wouldn't be surprised if half the factory were there to greet you.
But I know at least three people who'll be eagerly waiting on the platform.
- Let's see if they're on it.
- Yes!
You see? There they are!
If you pass this review, then you're practically in the clear.
Uncle Harald!
- Hi there, Lasse! How are you?
- Fine.
Well?
Well, how about that!
You are getting muscles!
- So, who do you think this is?
- I don't know.
Her.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Emma!
Emma! That's my new teacher.
Hello, Emma. Hello, Ingemar.
- I trust everything is well?
- Oh yes.
May I introduce Miss Paulsson.
- This is our Emma.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- And Wickman.
- Welcome.
- It was kind of you to come and meet me.
- It was only natural.
Come along. The car is waiting.
- Would you like to join us, Engineer?
- If there's space.
An unmitigated success.
Well, like most young boys
Lars-Erik is a bit unruly, and perhaps a bit spoilt by myself and Emma.
I spoil no one.
Oh, yes you do.
Both Lars-Erik and me.
- I treat everyone the same.
- Yes, of course...
As I was saying, Miss Paulsson, he does have his flaws, but I think he'll make a fair pupil, and he grows quite attached to those he cares about.
He needs a young person to look after him, who's cheerful and...
Please forgive a presumptuous question, but I hope you're not always as serious as you are this evening?
Me? No... No, I'm just a bit tired.
Yes, I understand that.
I want him to get plenty of fresh air.
It will do him good. And I'd like you to draw up a work schedule for him.
Use your best judgement.
But not too strenuous, I think.
Children should be allowed to be children.
There's time enough for seriousness.
I'll do my best, Consul Barring.
Excellent! I like you, young lady.
But... Don't look so glum.
We're cheery and exuberant in this household.
Well, there are exceptions, of course...
- Little Lars-Erik wants to say good night.
- Best you run along then.
If you'll excuse me.
- Say, Emma?
- Yes?
Lars-Erik is old enough now that you can stop calling him "Little Lars-Erik".
He'll never be too old in my eyes, so don't count on it.
I don't.
- Consul...
- Yes?
You haven't forgotten what day it is tomorrow?
No, Emma.
I'll never forget that.
I told Wickman to be ready at 10.
And the flowers are ready.
- She seems nice, the girl, doesn't she?
- I suppose...
And it's good that she's young.
We're starting to get on a bit, you and I.
- I've heard that every year.
- And for every year it becomes truer!
- You're only as old as you feel.
- And you feel like 17, of course.
Thereabouts.
And you feel like 100?
You've been in my service for 40 years.
You've been making snide comments all that time. Do you plan to continue?
I hope so - for both our sakes!
Good night, Consul.
Uncle Harold helped me to make these aeroplanes.
- So, you like toys?
- They're not toys! They're important!
- Did you like toys when you were little?
- I never had any.
- No? Why not?
- No one cared enough to give me any.
Then you weren't a good girl!
- Weren't you going to go to bed?
- Yes.
Granddad gives me everything.
Last summer I got a football, and for Christmas I got skis.
And next summer I'm getting a bike!
You're a lucky boy, Lars-Erik.
You get everything you want.
You never have to be hungry.
You're surrounded by kind people.
No one yelling at you, no one saying mean and nasty things.
You can be as naughty as you want, you still get everything!
- All you have to do is point at it!
- I thought you were nice.
I am, Lars-Erik!
Don't cry.
Please don't start crying.
- Can't you just go to sleep?
- I will.
Are you going to be strict with me?
No... I'll help to spoil you too.
If there's anything they won't let you do, just come to me.
I will! We'll have fun together!
Feel here, Miss.
Uncle Harald says I'm strong!
I have muscles! Feel here, Miss.
Don't I have muscles?
I made you laugh, anyway.
I didn't think you could.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Don't I get a good night kiss?
Is that something your governess usually does?
Yes, when I've been good.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Sleep well, Miss!
- Sleep well, Miss!
- Thank you.
Granddad! Come and say good night!
Yes, yes! Granddad is coming!
He's coming!
- Oh, you've already said good night?
- Yes.
- But he's not asleep yet, I hear.
- No, not yet.
I'm just asking because
I'm going to go in to him for a moment.
There's one more thing, Miss.
We have an excursion tomorrow morning,
Lars-Erik and I.
It would be good if he's ready at ten o'clock.
You can come along if you like.
We're going to...well...
It's the fifth anniversary of the death of Lars-Erik's parents.
But of course it's up to you.
Good night.
And don't forget to count the window panes and make a wish before you go to sleep.
- Granddad? Where are you?
- I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Did you have nice dreams, Miss?
She can't tell us, Lars-Erik, because then the dream won't come true.
So, it's no small change for you, trading London for Forsa as you've done!
But we'll do our best to make you happy here.
- That's Uncle Harald's house!
- Yes, the yellow one.
That's good, Lars-Erik.
Show Miss Paulsson what you know.
He's a good boy.
He doesn't have the best of lives, the little fellow.
It may seem as if he has everything, but he lacks the most important thing in life:
A mother and father.
So we must all endeavour to be that for him.
It's a great responsibility for you.
This is when his character is built, and I believe you can guide him in the right direction.
That is the greatest, and at the same time the most challenging compliment
I could possibly give you.
Well! Here we are.
- So, Wickman, where are the flowers?
- I've got them, Granddad!
Do you? Come on, then. Let's go.
- Do you know where it is?
- I can show you the way!
Forgive me for laughing, Mr Barring.
It just struck me as funny.
Did you think for one moment
I thought the cheque was genuine?
Oh no!
The Consul's signature was patently fake.
But that's not a bad thing... from my perspective.
- But it's a bit more awkward for you.
- What are you going to do?
- Well, my patron wants his money.
- You know I can't pay yet!
Well then. Either we must turn to the Consul, or to the police.
But I suspect the Consul prefers not to see the name Barring in police reports, for a mere 30,000.
30,000? Have you stolen ten?
Please, Mr Barring.
We need to eat.
- How much time? I need a month.
- Can you get the money in a month?
- That's my concern!
- Yes, of course.
I'm certainly not going to do it.
However... If I give you more time, this is the last time.
Remember that. The last time!
- My patron is...
- To hell with your patron!
I can't be so nonchalant.
He's funding this, you see.
Although he doesn't want to be seen.
I'm nothing but a front man.
The figurehead people spit upon.
I'm quite pitiable, Mr Barring.
What would you say about borrowing a bit more, for a month?
Hmm, what can I say?
If it's the same fancy name...
- ...and not an excessive sum...
- No. 5,000!
Five?
I'm never unreasonable.
Sign a paper here for 10,000...
...and you'll get the money.
- A 100% fee?
- Yes. That's nothing to argue about.
We must help one another in life.
One good turn deserves another.
10,000... That's it.
And the Consul's name down here in the corner.
His name needs to be on the other side too. On the back.
Yes... That's it.
Are you nervous? I'm not.
You're quite practised at that.
I can't judge how accurate it is, but the signature seems practised.
Heavily practised.
Let me help you with that.
And don't forget to come here next month with 40,000, of which we've stolen 15,000.
Better safe than sorry.
Nice fur.
- Good day.
- Good day, good day!
- Well?
- Soon ripe for the picking!
Yes, that will go as planned.
But it's a shame the big job fell apart when Anna disappeared.
- Who's opening?
- Me.
- Half the pot.
- Half the pot? I'll call.
Don't you think it's strange?
Of course it is.
We've searched high and low for her.
I didn't mean Anna.
Have you noticed that Barring avoids talking about the inheritance?
- Your turn.
- I fold.
Do you mean...
I'll be a monkey's uncle.
He and Anna have gone behind our backs!
Leaving us penniless!
That's something to think about.
- I've called you.
- Full house. Ladies on top.
Full house. Aces and kings.
My pot!
Let's go. Next round.
Don't hold the reins so tight.
I think driving horses is as hard as driving a car.
"As hard"? What's hard about holding a wheel and pushing a pedal?
No, driving a four-in-hand is an art.
- Can I do that soon?
- Oh, hold your horses!
Learn this first!
- No, no, not so hard on the reins.
- No.
- Hello there!
- Uncle Harald!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- So, the master himself is driving!
- Yup!
- He's got a good hand with the horses.
- He has a good teacher.
- So, I hear you're having guests today.
- Guests?
- Torsten Barring is coming.
- Oh?
- You're not expecting him?
- No... The Consul didn't tell me.
- No, don't do that, Lars-Erik.
- But I'm hot!
But the air is cold.
You'll catch your death.
- Don't let me keep you. Goodbye, Lasse.
- Goodbye, Uncle Harald!
Goodbye, Miss Paulsson.
Oh! But I'll see you this evening.
- That's right, it's Saturday.
- Bridge night! I'll see you later.
Well then, cheers!
- We don't often see you up here anymore.
- No, I never have time.
My business in Stockholm takes up all my time.
- Then it must be nice to relax here.
- Yes. Shame it can't be more often.
Well, that's your own fault!
You're always welcome up here.
You know that.
- Won't you have a cigar, Hjalmar?
- No thanks, I have one.
Gentlemen, isn't it time to get started?
Yes, yes, let's get going.
Must we play three-handed tonight?
I'm coming! - They've been gazing longingly at the games table.
Excuse me.
Miss Paulsson, since you're not playing, perhaps you'll keep me company.
I'm sure she will.
- Right, Miss Paulsson?
- Of course.
- Put on the wireless and enjoy yourselves.
I'll close these doors, so you won't bother us.
- Is there something particular you want?
- Not at all.
I just wanted to chat a while.
If you don't mind.
We haven't had the opportunity to talk yet. Congratulations, by the way.
- You've handled stage one very well.
- What do you mean?
You're a big hit with the family.
I'm very pleased so far.
No one suspects anything, nor will they.
- When...
- "When" what?
- I want to know what you expect of me.
- Haven't you worked it out?
No!
I find that hard to believe from a woman of your intelligence...
...Miss Holm.
Yes, that's the gesture that gave you away.
As early as the train ride.
But your secret is safe with me.
Not even your old friends need to know where you are.
This job can be between you and me.
Excellent transformation, by the way.
- What do you want from me?
- Is it so hard to work out?
Only one person stands between me and a quite carefree future.
Say it. What do you want?
I don't want anything specific.
I trust your sense of creativity, which your old friends assure me is brilliant.
Speaking of which, I hear you and Lars-Erik are quite chummy.
- Yes.
- Excellent.
Best to look after him well.
See that he doesn't catch cold.
You know how easily children develop pneumonia.
It's a great risk at that age.
What do you think of the area?
Quite beautiful, isn't it?
Have you been up to the Forsa Falls?
Near the bridge?
- No.
- Pity.
You might find it a worthwhile excursion.
Just be careful on the rocks on the north side - especially if Lars-Erik is with you.
I once saw a daring young boy slip and fall in there...and be swept away.
It was a tragic...accident.
So that's your plan!
You have the right medicine, Pharmacist!
- Are you done already?
- No, I just forgot my cigarettes.
The pharmacist is playing my hand, so I'm in good hands.
- Good night, I'm off to bed.
- So early?
Yes, I've got such a headache.
And I have to look in on Lars-Erik.
- Lars-Erik is the apple of her eye.
- Is that so?
- She's so fond of him already?
- I'll say.
- Berg, we won!
- Bravo!
Miss!
Yes, Lars-Erik? What is it?
I had a terrible dream!
- Oh? What did you dream?
- I don't remember.
Try to go back to sleep now.
Let me tuck you in again.
And switch off the light.
- Don't leave me!
- I'll stay with you if you want.
There. Until you go to sleep.
But you have to try to sleep now.
I'll try.
- Is it Sunday tomorrow?
- Yes, it is.
Go to sleep now.
Maybe you'll have sweet dreams.
- Miss Paulsson!
- Yes?
Director Barring, it's time to leave.
Thank you, I'll be along shortly.
- Is that your final word?
- Yes!
- I won't do anyone's bidding anymore!
- We'll see about that.
- Your friends may change your mind.
- Do what you want - I can take anything!
Is that so? Even the Consul's likely treatment of a blackmailer?
Yes! Probably not unlike his treatment of a forger!
- What do you know?
- Enough!
The Count isn't one of the world's most discreet people.
- Then he won't be silent about you either.
- Probably not.
It depends on what's most sensible in this case. Talking or keeping mum.
We'll just have to see about that.
Shall we go, Miss Paulsson?
The snow is perfect for skiing.
Yes, I'm coming.
A delightful idyll.
As long as it lasts.
- You've never been here before?
- No.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Magnificent.
And somehow terrifying.
- May I ask you a forward question?
- Go ahead.
You've been different the past few days.
Is it because of Torsten Barring's visit?
Sort of.
- I despise him.
- But he recommended you so warmly!
- Yes...
- And still?
To be honest, I'm not too keen on him myself. I don't know why.
But there's something off about him.
Something...shady.
There's nothing worse than people who can't be trusted.
- Can we go on now?
- Of course, Miss Paulsson.
I'm happy - very happy - that you're not interested in Torsten Barring in any other way.
- What do you mean?
- Just what I say.
I like you too much to want him to have even a finger of you.
Yet he may hold my entire future in his hands.
If you're afraid your dislike of him will offend the Consul, don't be.
He is as fond of you as I am... but in a different way.
Like me, he wants you to stay forever.
He for Lars-Erik's sake, and I for my own.
- Does that bother you?
- No.
But who knows what the future holds?
Nothing that will shake our friendship, I hope.
I hope that too.
- Too bad it's winter now.
- Why?
If it had been summer, or even better, spring, the roar of the fall would have drowned out my voice.
And then I might have dared to say all that's in my heart, because some of the silliness would drown in the noise.
Then perhaps you should wait until spring.
It's not far off, anyway.
And you'll promise to listen to me?
Yes, as much as I can...
...in the roar of the fall.
So, that's why you're all here.
Yes! If you think your change of heart will impress us, you're mistaken.
You've cheated us once - out of Wegert's money.
It won't happen a second time.
Try to understand our straits.
We're pressuring Miller, who's pressuring the director, who's pressuring you.
It's a game of cat and mouse.
You've never shied from money.
Why are you hesitating?
With your respected position here, no one would ever think that you...
Shut up! Shut up!
Or I'll report you all to the police.
- For what?
- Your conscience has made you foolish.
We could be quite unpleasant if we wanted. An anonymous letter...
...and I'd be dismissed.
What else can you do?
So you'd leave?
Isn't that the last thing you want?
To abandon such a peaceful, pleasant existence, with the charming company of Engineer Berg?
My, my!
- Is there love in the air? Now I see!
- Guess all you want.
Do what you want. But beware...
I know a bit too much about you to be scared off. You know I'm no coward.
And you...the lowest of us all!
You'll go no further. I'm warning you.
I want the money!
If you don't do it, I will.
- You wouldn't dare!
- I dare!
You'll get nowhere with her.
She's always had character, though not this kind.
Oh no, dear Torsten. You'll have to go to the Consul...and to church.
- Or else prison.
- Never!
Well, Nyman, what do you think of life at a hotel in a small industrial town?
I think it's a bit scary.
I prefer our old business.
Short jobs, small profit.
But safe!
A little something to warm your cockles. Cheers!
- That's strong!
- A horseman needs something with a kick!
And let it not be said the Consul was miserly on his birthday!
- Do you think that's enough, Emma?
- Yes.
I've been here for too many birthdays not to know how much is needed.
- You learn a thing or two in 40 years.
- True enough.
I've attended these little shindigs for nearly 25 years.
- 22. You first came in autumn 1915.
- Yes... Yes, you're right.
Don't ever say that Forsa doesn't have its own walking encyclopaedia!
- Granddad, aren't we leaving soon?
- Yes, as soon as possible.
- May I drive the sledge?
- Oh, no.
It's far too dark outside.
Well, my friends.
Now that we've warmed our bones, there's no reason to wait anymore.
Head out to the sledges!
Say, Harald, isn't Miss Paulsson coming?
Yes - soon, I think.
I'll call her.
Anna!
- Don't miss your chance tonight.
- What...do you mean, sir?
What do I mean?
I proposed during a sledge ride myself!
Don't you think, Harald, that I've seen where things are headed?
Oh, yes!
It's just a pity that the two of us will suffer.
- The sledge is ready, Consul!
- Good. I'm coming.
Ah, there you are, Miss Paulsson.
Hurry now!
- Are you bundled up enough?
- Don't you think it looks that way?
- Emma?
- Come here...
Come now, Lars-Erik!
- You need some warmth inside, too.
- No thank you.
I hope it's not cold outside.
Speaking of cold, I think spring will be late this year. I was at Forsa Falls, and normally the water roars so that you can't hear a word.
Why would anyone talk there?
Perhaps you're right. A bit more, please.
I need a bit of courage.
- Thank you, Emma. - Hurry, they're waiting.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Let's all huddle up now.
There you are! Hurry!
- Where's Lars-Erik?
- He went in Torsten's sledge.
No! Couldn't I have
Lars-Erik with me?
I think you'll be quite busy enough with Engineer Berg.
Hurry, now.
Let's go, Wickman!
- Why so silent?
- I'm just a bit nervous.
About Lars-Erik up there? I can see that.
- May I drive, Uncle Torsten?
- No, this horse is a bit wild.
And we have moonlight, too!
So, Consul, how far are we going?
As far as it takes to work up an appetite for supper!
Not me, I already have one!
What do you say, should I stop?
Lars-Erik!
Go after them! Go after them!
Hold on!
- He's going to kill Lars-Erik!
- It's not that bad.
He will, I know it! It's why he came here!
- What?
- To kill Lars-Erik!
Oh, Harald, I was meant to do it.
I came here to do it.
I'm not who you think I am.
But I don't want to! I don't want to!
Lars-Erik! Lars-Erik!
You must believe me. You must believe me!
Oh, save him! Save him!
Keep going, keep going!
Lars-Erik...
Take these!
No!
Harald!
Harald!
Oh, Lars-Erik! Lars-Erik!
Come.
Harald!
Harald!
No appetite?
This cheese! With a kilogram of dynamite
I might break off a bit.
- Some Pilsner?
- What, class 1? No thanks.
I'd rather rekindle childhood memories.
Here I come with a hot bite for you.
I hope I'm not too late.
Have you heard about the accident?
No! Has the community's nasty little pug bitten the midwife on the leg?
It's no joking matter!
A horse has bolted, and...
...and four milk bottles fell and broke. Tragic.
This is serious! A horse in the consul's sledge party bolted.
Engineer Berg from the ironworks is lying unconscious in the nursing home.
And a relative of the consul, a Director
Barring from Stockholm, was killed!
Wh...when does the train leave?
- The train where?
- Where? Anywhere! Stockholm!
- I'll check...
- Well, hurry up!
Well, that chapter is ended.
I wonder if it's not time for us to retire.
There's nothing more for us here.
- What about Anna?
- I assume she's lost to us. Unfortunately.
- Sir, the train leaves in a half hour.
- Give us the bill.
- But the main course...?
- The bill! And be quick about it!
Of course.
- I'll go and pack.
- Yes, yes!
"Once upon a time there was a pig,"
"a cat and a...hen..."
"...who were out for a walk."
"The little hen found a grain of wheat."
""Who will planet it?' she said."
- No, Lars-Erik. "Who will plant it?"
- "'Who will plant it?' she said."
- That's it.
- ""Not I,' said the pig."
So, hard at work, I see.
- Is it going well?
- It's going very well, Granddad!
According to you, of course!
Miss Paulsson, have you heard anything from the engineer?
- No, I haven't.
- That's very odd.
- I don't understand this.
- What is it, Consul?
He's given notice, with no reason at all.
He does say that he needs to travel.
To get new ideas and impulses and so on.
Hasn't he told you anything?
No, I haven't heard a word from him.
Soon he'll leave the nursing home to travel somewhere and rest up.
As if one can't rest here.
I just don't understand!
Or can you give me a reasonable explanation?
No.
But...I don't think you should be too concerned, Consul.
I'm sure there's a way to get him to come back.
If only we could.
He's a part of us and Forsa in some way.
We need him, and I don't think he'd be as happy anywhere else.
Well, I think I know a way.
Then I'll pin my hopes on you.
Let's continue, Lars-Erik.
- Isn't Uncle Harald coming home soon?
- I think so.
He'll soon be back, you'll see.
Keep reading now.
"And the wheat ripened."
"'Who will harvest the wheat?'"
"said the little...hen."
"'Not I,' said the pig and the cat."
"'Then I shall do it,' said the little hen."
"And she cut the sheaf..."
Oh yes. Yes, I'm ready to leave at any time.
At the end of the month?
That's perfect.
Yes. So there's no ambulance before then?
No, I understand it's too expensive.
Right. Goodbye.
Nurse, the departure date is set.
The 28th. Via Helsinki to Leningrad.
So you have time to change your mind.
- Why would I change my mind?
- I'm only joking.
Would you please tell Engineer Berg that he has a visitor?
Excuse me, Miss Paulsson.
I'm planning a trip.
- You're going away, Dr Wegert?
- Yes, to the Orient.
- With the Red Cross ambulance.
- You're leaving everything?
I don't have much to leave.
Just my practice.
- And your home?
- Fell apart.
Who would have thought we'd meet again, under such different circumstances?
You must agree now that life does have its bright sides?
Yes, when you have the chance to see them.
- You gave me that chance.
- And you took it. Just as I'd hoped.
Yes...
But not right away. It took some time.
I understand.
But if the past is dead and buried, why do you look so concerned?
If you're worried about the patient,
I assure you he'll be home soon.
I knew you'd save him.
That's why we sent him here when the doctors at home couldn't help.
It looked bad at first, but I managed to patch together his skull.
Well, I'm afraid that I... broke something else in him.
Something neither you nor anyone else can fix.
- He knows?
- Yes. Everything.
Well, he's a young man.
It must have been a hard blow for him.
But we must put our faith in time healing all wounds.
- Not his, I fear.
- Well, if not, we must move on.
Even if it seems we have unbearable sorrows.
Come now - be strong. Don't let go.
The engineer is ready for you, Ma'am.
Goodbye, Miss Paulsson. And good luck.
Thank you, Doctor.
Here you are, Miss.
I'll take those.
How do you feel?
All right.
Did you get my letter?
Well?
I've read it ten times, if I've read it once.
And a hundred times I've told myself that what I'm reading isn't true.
It can't be true.
Say it isn't true!
- Yes, it is true.
- I don't believe you!
I wanted to understand.
Tried to understand!
I thought I knew you.
Defend yourself, for God's sake!
There is no defence.
But maybe an explanation...
...if you can forget the world you live in and think that there are others...
...who live in the shadows.
My father was an embezzler.
He was saved from prison by relatives.
And he...started drinking.
He dragged my mother down with him.
They were killed in a fire.
I escaped with my life, but was badly burnt.
I was left alone, with a face that frightened people.
I became hard, bitter;
I hated everyone.
Now I'm glad I was so ugly.
It saved me from...another fate.
Stop.
You know the rest.
It's all in my letter.
There's just one thing you don't know.
It was Dr Wegert who fixed my face.
In a way he gave me a new life.
But what gave that life a meaning... was you.
You and Lars-Erik.
Anna...I've tendered my resignation at Forsa.
I know. That's why I came here.
But you don't have to run away from me.
I'll never go back there.
No, don't misunderstand me.
I want us to go away together.
- To a place where no one knows us.
- Steal away, hide.
- Nothing suits you less.
- We can help each other to forget.
It's not possible.
I could never be sure you'd forgotten, and you'd sense that.
Our unsaid thoughts would gradually kill our love.
It's so unbelievable that you...
Sometimes I tell myself I'm dreaming.
That I haven't woken up from the anaesthesia yet.
If only it were true.
Let it be true...
A bad dream about to turn sweet.
You're burning up.
- Are you tired?
- Yes.
- Goodbye, Harald.
- You're leaving?
Yes...
Anna...
- I'll never forget you.
- I believe you.
We can't forget.
- Here comes the train, Emma!
- Yes, here it comes.
Don't forget to tell Uncle Harald welcome!
Uncle Harald!
Nurse, would you be so kind as to post this as soon as possible?
Yes, Doctor.
- So. Today it seems spring is really here.
- Yes...
How are you?
The worst is over now.
I hardly think it's over.
Well...
Now he's on his way to Forsa, where he'll get back to his old routines.
It will be harder for you, who have given up so much. What will you do?
I don't know.
And I don't dare to think of the future right now.
I'm afraid it will always be like this.
That I'll never escape my past, that it will follow me like a shadow.
Do what I'm doing:
Put away your past and start over.
- Start over again?
- Over and over again, if necessary.
- There's no other option.
- Have you always been such an optimist?
It may be a part of my profession.
And I've seen so much true optimism that it's rubbed off on me.
I've heard terminal patients thank their doctor for giving them the opportunity to live another six months.
Six months - and still they're grateful.
So why shouldn't we be glad, we who have so much more to hope for?
I wish I were in your position.
That I could just leave everything behind.
Are you a fearful person? No.
I know you aren't.
What do you think of the Chinese?
- I don't understand.
- I was just joking.
I have a letter here.
Which I now realise I haven't answered.
But that was just as well.
I have a cousin who is married to an American businessman in Beiping.
She's asked me to find her a Swedish nanny, since her American one left.
Are you interested?
But think carefully. The Heavenly Kingdom isn't very heavenly right now.
It would make me the world's happiest person.
Have you thought it through?
Going once, twice, three times...
Yes.
- Shall we strike while the iron is hot?
- Yes.
Telegraph office, please.
Four cheers for the Red Cross Ambulance!
HURRAH! HURRAH! HURRAH! HURRAH!
Miss Paulsson.
Shall we agree on something?
Nothing before this very moment has ever existed.
The future starts now.
Yes.
THE END
- Quel nom, s'il vous plaît?
- Monsieur et Madame de Chavigny.
Monsieur et Madame...
de Chavigny.
- Merci.
- Merci.
- Quel nom, s'il vous plaît?
- Mr. Chan and son.
Monsieur Chan...
et fils.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, monsieur.
- Commandant.
- Bonsoir, Commandant.
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir, MonsieurJoubert.
Bonsoir.
- Oh! Excusez-moi.
- So sorry.
Ah, Monsieur Charlie Chan!
Jules EtienneJoubert, chef de police de Monaco.
- I am honored.
- Honor most mutual.
Humbly introduce number one son, Lee.
- Oh, that is French, no?
- Why, yes.
I am charmed.
Oh. Please.
- Excuse, please.
- You see? He is "insult. "
A million pardon, monsieur, but i did not know.
My compliment.
You are my guests.
- No, but-
- i insist. And in Monte Carlo, Joubert's word is law.
Already you offend by not announcing your arrival in Monaco to me.
Humble presence of no more importance... than one drop of rain in, uh, cloudburst.
Oh, come, come, come.
All the world, it knows of Charlie Chan, eh?
- No?
- Well-
Aha. You see?
Today i hear you arrive in Monte Carlo.
Naturellement, i am very anxious you should make my acquaintance.
So i follow you from hotel to casino.
Me voici. Here i am.
Regard with admiration the masterpiece of all casinos.
Perhaps you would like to play a little roulette or chemin de fer, no?
- No.
- Yes. Listen, Pop. I've got a great hunch.
Our room in the hotel at Nice is 125.
I'm 25 years old.
This is the 25th of August.
And by the Chinese calendar, this is the year 9,325.
Twenty-five also amount you borrow from me last week.
I'll pay you back just as soon as i win, Pop.
I can't lose at roulette if I play number 25.
- Perhaps you break the bank with such a system.
- Gosh. Do you think so?
I wonder which table
I'd better play on.
To avoid panic in house, suggest you start attack on smallest bank.
Okay. I'll see you later, Pop.
Allons. You-You and i.
We watch this table where fortunes change hands at- oh, how you say- the flip of the card.
50,000 francs.
Banco.
Please, may i have a thousand of that?
- I- i feel lucky.
- I hope you're right.
- Make your bet, mademoiselle.
- Ah, thank you.
Now you will witness the most bitter of playing.
The man with the bank is Paul Savarin.
Very clever and very rich.
The other one is Victor Karnoff, the great financier.
They are the enemies in the Bourse as well as in the casino.
- Card, monsieur?
- No.
Monsieur has great confidence.
In my own judgment, yes.
You're not afraid to draw to a five, are you?
You misinterpret caution for fright,
Monsieur Karnoff.
I judge the wiles of my opponent as well as the value of my hand.
- Ahh!
- Baccara.
I'm afraid you're a bit too reckless, Savarin.
I find it more exciting than conservatism.
It is ever so.
The money, it is nothing. They play only to give the insult to each other.
Contradiction of old saying that talk is cheap.
Aha. You have said it with a mouthful.
Pardon, Madame Karnoff.
Your brother would like to see you in the bar.
Thank you.
- Hello, Gordon.
- Did Victor see you come in here?
Why, no. He's playing chemin de fer with Savarin.
What's wrong?
I- i've been checking over his securities tonight.
25,000 dollars' worth of the Metallurgic bonds are missing.
Oh.
- Joan, did you take them?
- Why, no! No, i- i don't know anything about them.
Listen, i want you to be truthful with me.
I know you're in trouble, and the bonds might've helped you out.
- Do you think you can get them back tonight?
- Tonight?
There's a bank messenger from Paris waiting at the house right now.
Victor's selling a million dollars' worth of Metallurgics.
This time, he's out to wreck Savarin.
- How much time have i?
- About an hour.
Bring them directly to me at the house.
I'll handle them from then on.
Come on.
Keep your chin up.
- Card?
- No. Merci.
- Everything's ready, Victor.
- What? Oh, fine, fine.
Hello, darling.
I'll be with you in a moment.
- I'm cashing in.
- Hello, Gordon.
Oh, look at all the money the woman has.
It's downright indecent.
So my wealth is now the attraction, hmm?
Still the girl herself.
I, uh- i'll be a little later than i expected tonight.
Will you wait for me here?
- Mmm. Of course.
- Right.
Merci. i just took Savarin for five straight hands of chemin de fer.
Don't gloat, dear.
He'll win it back tomorrow.
Tomorrow he'll lose a lot more to me than he ever staked at a casino table.
- Get your wraps, dear.
- Do you mind going on without me?
I'm winning tonight, too, for a change, and i shouldn't walk out on my luck.
Of course not, darling.
See you later.
Come on, Gordon.
Garçon. My wraps, please.
Oui, Madame Karnoff.
Oh, Pop, i haven't got a cent in my pocket.
Rejoice that you still have honorable pants.
So, you are now a shareholder in the casino.
Chip off ancient block.
Venerable grandparent once have large holdings... in fan-tan house.
Oh! Mais oui.
I am frustrate that you must leave so soon.
Well, you see, i'm exhibiting a painting at the Paris Exposition... and we've got to be there for the showing.
- Ah, monsieur is an artiste.
- Pop says i am.
But i'm not so sure. Gosh, i like detective work better than painting.
If paintings as full of imagination as detective work... he will be Chinese Rembrandt.
- Hotel imperial. Tres vite.
- Oui, madame.
Haut taxi.
It is arranged.
If he does not get you to the train at Nice on time, you will let me know.
- Then i kill him myself, personally.
- Thank you so much.
- Good-bye, Monsieur Chan.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, MonsieurJoubert.
- Good-bye.
Imbécile!
Voila!
Au revoir, MonsieurJoubert!
Thanks a lot!
Bonne chance.
Bon voyage. Au revoir!
Oui. Oui.
Non! Non!
Bonne chance!
Bon voyage!
Au revoir!
Merci bien, madame.
Benedictine, please.
Hello, honey.
What's on your mind?
Al, i need those bonds.
- So do i. It's the reason you gave them to me.
- I'm serious.
Victor's sending a large shipment of his Metallurgic bonds to Paris tonight.
I've got to get them back before they're missed.
Sorry, kid, but i don't believe you.
You've got to believe me. Don't you realize what it would mean if he finds out?
Sure. He'd forget about it because you're his wife.
Nothing doing, baby.
You better drink that.
You look as though you need it.
Here. I'll give you this bracelet.
It's worth more than the bonds.
I never touch jewelry, but i would consider cash.
Where would i get $25,000 tonight?
Forget it then.
- Good evening, Monsieur Savarin.
- Have there been any calls for me?
One moment.
I'll inquire of the operator.
- Merci. There were no calls, monsieur.
- Thank you.
If i have the cash tomorrow, will you give me back the bonds?
I thought you needed them tonight.
I'll figure out some way to cover up till i see you tomorrow.
Okay. I'll be here.
Series "G."
18407 to 17.
Right.
'J"...
2264 to 74.
Correct.
Hello, dear!
You're back early.
- How did your luck hold out?
- I should have left with you. I lost everything.
You see? You needed my moral support.
And financial.
But you're busy. I'm going up to bed.
- That roulette wheel gave me a bit of a headache.
- All right, darling.
Get some sleep.
I'll be along later.
- Sorry your luck went sour, Joan.
- It could've been worse.
K-2755 to-
Oh, Monsieur Karnoff, there's a break in the series.
You're right. How about this, Gordon?
Three of these bonds are missing.
That's funny. I'll look among the extra Metallurgics we have in the safe.
Perhaps they're among these we haven't checked, Renault.
Perhaps.
R- 9183 to 93.
Correct.
- How about it, Gordon? Did you find them?
- Yes, here they are.
Guess i put them with the others by mistake the last time i checked up.
- That finishes our work. Doesn't it?
- Oui, monsieur.
I'll tell Ludwig to bring the car around.
Voila. Your receipt.
Oui, monsieur.
He is sending the bonds to Paris tonight.
Oui. By plane, from Nice.
You can bring the car around now, Ludwig.
Bien, monsieur. Tout de suite.
Tell Ramboulette i'll keep in constant touch with him by telephone.
- Very well.
- I don't want any slipups, understand?
- Good-bye and good luck.
- Merci.
I'd like to see Savarin's face when he gets the first market reports in the morning.
Eh? Oh, yes, so would i.
Well, that's that. Think i'll get a breath of fresh air before turning in.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Ingrate!
Ingrate!
It's no use, Pop.
We'd better start walking back.
Illustrious ancestor once say...
"Destination never reached by turning back on same. "
Eh, correction, please.
Instruct loquacious driver, uh, to follow... if successful in assembling jigsaw puzzle.
Comment? Que dites-vous?
When you get the car fixed, follow us!
Oh!
Je ne comprends pas.
Please.
Actions speak louder than French.
Oh!
They don't seem to understand.
Uh, French very difficult language.
There's another car down there, Pop.
Must've been an accident.
Uh, perhaps like own taxi- on sit-down strike.
There's nobody here!
Contradiction, please. Look.
That other car- they must have gone for a doctor.
- Maybe we can help.
- No.
Touch nothing.
Too late for doctor.
This man shot to death.
Shot? Gee, Pop.
I'll bet the chauffeur did it and escaped in that other car!
Is possible.
Note careful attempt to destroy footprints.
But why would the chauffeur bother to do that? They'll suspect him anyway.
Perhaps not worried about own footprints.
Rhinestone suggest presence of lady.
Gee, Pop, it's what the French newspapers call a crime passionnel.
The woman was probably this man's wife or his sweetheart.
She had the chauffeur drive him out here to a lonely spot.
Between them, they murdered him and got away together.
Please, stop deductions-
Also, approaching automobile.
Hey! Stop! Stop!
Vous dites?
Never mind. Come on. There's trouble.
There's been a murder!
Over there.
We just found it.
Uh, this is my father, Charlie Chan.
We were on our way to catch the train to Paris... when we found this car and a man in the backseat.
Now, we've been investigating-
Uh-
It's okay, Pop. I fixed everything.
Why should those officers arrest us?
I told them who we are.
Fortunately, assassination of French language... not serious crime.
- Monsieur Chan!
- So sorry.
But find Monte Carlo hospitality difficult to escape.
Monsieur Lee, what did you tell the officer?
Well, i said, uh-
Oh!
Monsieur Lee has made the slight mistake.
You tell him you discover the auto...
and you murder the man.
In future, remember... tongue often hang man quicker than rope.
I am so sorry.
Say, Pop, the train for Paris- we've got to hurry.
Train depart from Nice
20 minutes ago.
- Then you must stay in Monte Carlo for tonight.
- No- i insist!
I will send to Nice for your baggage.
You will be my guests at the imperial Hotel in the finest room... with the hot and cold waters that runs.
But first we go to my office.
Also, one thing more.
There is no trace of missing chauffeur... but in soft earth near car, discover this.
A woman. Aha!
Now we have some life in the case!
Cherchez la femme.
Always at the bottom of trouble is a woman.
That's just what i told you, Pop.
We have identified the car.
Donnez-moi Monsieur Victor Karnoff.
Oui.
- Same gentleman noticed at casino?
- Unfortunately, yes.
Quel catastrophe.
Écoutez, Monsieur Chan.
Mademoiselle Fifi Zaza reports the loss of puppy dog. Bien.
A doctor has the watch stolen.
Bien.
A bartender attempts the sale of some bonds...
and the bank lift the eyebrows. Bien!
But it has to be the great Karnoff in whose automobile is found a man murdered to death.
Oh, he will be most unreasonable.
Allô.
Bonsoir, Monsieur Karnoff.
One thousand apologies.
No, i hadn't retired.
Go on.
What? My car? Where?
Now, the chauffeur- his name and description, please.
Ah, yes. Oui.
And now, the murdered man in the rear seat-who was he?
That was Renault, the bank messenger.
Why? Why? Robbery, of course. He was carrying a million dollars' worth of my bonds!
A million in bonds?
Sacre bleu.
Why, robbery, of course.
As plain as the nose on your face.
Pardon, monsieur.
On my face.
Well, what issue were they?
Metallurgiques.
Oui. Oui, monsieur.
Je comprends.
Monsieur Karnoff, deeply as I regret to ask it-
No, don't bother to apologize.
Of course i'll come down, as soon as i telephone my bankers in Paris.
This is the most confounded outrage i ever heard of!
Allô. Allô?
Good night, monsieur.
What did he say?
He was most unhappy.
I've given the alarm for the arrest of the chauffeur.
- Can ask question, please?
- Of course.
Mr. Karnoff lose Metallurgic bonds?
Why, yes.
Observe, please.
Report by bank mention bonds of same name.
- Gee, Pop!
- Please.
Permit MonsieurJoubert to interpret same.
It is incredible.
Metallurgic bonds,
$25,000 of them... were offered for sale at the bank by Monsieur Albert Rogers... bartender at the imperial Hotel.
- Bank purchase same?
- They make the report to us.
Should a bartender be so wealthy? No.
So they say to him,
"Come back tomorrow. "
I am slowly confusing.
Present case like too many cocktails.
Make very bad headache.
Perhaps, uh, bartender provide remedy for same.
Bon. We shall see.
Allons.
One moment, please.
Recognize same?
That's the car we saw at the scene of the murder!
Oui, monsieur. Mademoiselle Evelyn Grey.
Aha! The woman in the case!
Oui, Commandant.
Allons!
Mademoiselle Evelyn Grey- she is in?
I will find out, MonsieurJoubert.
There is some trouble, monsieur?
I shall also wish to speak with privacy... to your bartender, Monsieur Rogers.
But he's not here.
He's off duty.
He will not get far.
Mademoiselle Grey does not answer, monsieur.
The key to her room, if you please.
But, monsieur, i assure you mademoiselle is quite respectable.
Who am i to doubt?
I suspect her only of murder.
- Apartment 319, monsieur.
- Merci.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Monsieur Savarin!
A thousand pardons.
I should have answered the door more promptly.
I did not know you were so impatient.
- We were looking for the suite of Mademoiselle Grey.
- This is it.
Evelyn, you have guests.
Monsieur le chef de police... and friends.
How nice.
Won't you come in?
Merci, mademoiselle.
I am so sorry to make this intrusion on you.
I call you on the telephone.
There is no answer.
- Did it not ring?
- It did.
It... did?
Does a desire for privacy usually result in a police investigation?
I quite understand. Mademoiselle, the white roadster in front of the hotel-
- it is yours?
- Why, yes, it is, but-
Explain, please, the reason for which you drive on the Nice road two hours ago.
The road to Nice?
You must be mistaken.
MonsieurJoubert, is this an official investigation?
Oui, monsieur, of a murder.
A bank messenger was killed while carrying bonds of great value.
On the road to Nice?
Where Mademoiselle Grey's car was observed by Monsieur Chan at the scene of the crime.
- I'm afraid you were mistaken.
- It's the same car, all right, Miss Grey-
That's ridiculous. Miss Grey's is not the only car of that model on the Rivera.
- But i'm sure that the-
- Uh, so sorry.
Number one son possibly make error in identity of car.
Excuse, please.
- You are owner of walking stick?
- Yes.
Don't tell me that was also noticed on the scene of the crime.
Newly born scratches indicate... stick might have been present and used...
to scrape away footprints.
I'm sorry to disillusion you...
but you evidently don't know that one of the pleasures of carrying a stick... is to occasionally poke it in hedges and gravel paths.
Habit very delightful, but damaging.
Monsieur Savarin speaks the truth.
I, myself, always dig the walking stick into the flower bed.
Forgive ignorance.
But, uh, ladies on Riviera... also indulge in similar pastime?
I don't understand.
Heels on beautiful slippers... denote recent burial in soft earth.
Please note left heel.
One rhinestone abscond from same.
Superb, Monsieur Chan!
I think perhaps we can repair the slipper of mademoiselle... with the so little rhinestone at my office.
Voila. The fit, it is perfect.
Uh, perhaps memory of whereabouts now refreshed?
Quite. It was my car you saw.
See, Pop? I told you there was a woman in it!
If you please, will you explain?
I left the casino about 10:00... to take an hour's drive before returning for an engagement i had.
On the road to Nice, i saw what i thought was an accident and stopped.
There was a dead man in the car.
Just then two men came along the road.
L- I was frightened.
I thought they'd killed the man, so i drove away before they reached me.
Excuse, please.
If you thought men approaching on road murderers... why stop to rub out own footprints?
The missing chauffeur could have done that.
You were not in car with young lady?
No.
When you drive away, did you not return to the casino?
I- No, i came directly to the hotel... where i happened to meet
Monsieur Savarin.
Ah? And why did you not make the report to the police?
I advised her not to become involved,
MonsieurJoubert.
- Has my chauffeur Ludwig been found yet?
- No, Monsieur Karnoff.
What are you doing here?
Trying to convince MonsieurJoubert...
that neither mademoiselle nor myself is a criminal.
What is their connection in this?
Mademoiselle was on the Nice road when the crime takes place.
- And Savarin was with her.
- He does not admit same.
Of course not, but he had the best motive in the world for being there.
Your imagination is magnificent, Karnoff.
If you are through questioning Miss Grey, i suggest that you allow us to leave.
One moment, please.
Engagement you did not keep at casino was with whom?
- With Mr. Chase.
- That's right.
I was still waiting for her when Mr. Karnoff phoned and told me to meet him here.
I heard them make the appointment earlier in the evening.
But aside from that, what bearing has all this on the case?
To begin at the commencement, you have the description of the stolen bonds, yes?
Right here.
That's the messenger's receipt.
- It contains a list of every bond in the shipment.
- Merci.
Who, beside honorable self, knew of bond shipment?
Gordon, my secretary here, my wife and the bank messenger.
And naturally, the chauffeur Ludwig.
Ludwig, of course!
He might have given you suspicion in some way?
No, i can't think of anything.
Wait. He was telephoning someone just before he left for Nice with the bank messenger.
Aha! Now we arrive in the vicinity of somewhere.
- With whom did he have the talk?
- I don't know.
We will trace the call.
I can save you the trouble.
Ludwig telephoned me.
- You?
- That explains everything.
This man would go to any lengths to prevent my bonds from reaching Paris.
Their sale on the Bourse would have wiped him out.
Ludwig was your spy and accomplice in the murder of Renault, the messenger!
- Be careful what you say.
- Monsieur Savarin-
- i admit buying information, but i don't deal in murder.
- You confess to bribing Ludwig!
- I bought information.
- It's the same thing!
Will you stop mumbling and do something?
He kills a man, ruins me by stealing a million dollars in bonds...
- and you don't even arrest him!
- Karnoff, i warn you-
Messieurs!
I am the police.
I will make the accusation.
- Now-
- interruption, please.
Stolen bonds were insured against theft?
Naturally.
If bonds insured, please explain how ruin possible... because of robbery.
Merci, monsieur.
It is obvious that Karnoff has his own reasons for directing suspicion... on others than himself.
- Do you mean you're accusing me?
- You can't do this to me!
I'm an American citizen!
Hey, what's the big idea?
Who's in charge here anyhow?
I am in charge, and the large idea is you are wanted for questioning.
About what?
This afternoon, you attempt to sell to the bank... three Metallurgic bonds.
We have the report here.
Tonight the messenger of Monsieur Karnoff is assassinated... and bonds of the same issue stolen by theft.
Well, what's that got to do with me?
May i see the report on this man?
For what reason you try to sell these bonds today?
- I needed the money.
- Ah? Perhaps you go on a little trip?
No, i like it here.
Possibly gentleman would tell...
how he acquire bonds.
- That's my business.
- The man is right.
After all, he tried to sell his bonds hours before mine were stolen.
They couldn't possibly have been part of my shipment.
Comparison of numbers on bank report and messenger's receipt... might prove interesting.
- Ah.
- i'm on fire!
Next time, must buy asbestos pants.
Messieurs.
If you must throw the matches, aim for the ashtray!
Now, at what have we arrived?
Checking of bond numbers.
Ah, yes.
The receipt! It is gone!
- Gone?
- Well, who has it?
- You can search me.
- I will search everybody!
One moment, please.
Useless to search for bank receipt.
Obviously, fire started to destroy same.
Well? Who is going to admit the guilt?
You're wasting time.
No one here will admit anything.
Find my chauffeur Ludwig.
Let him do the talking.
Allô.
Ah, bon.
Bien. Merci.
- Ludwig has been found.
- Good. Bring him here and question him.
That, Monsieur Karnoff, is impossible.
Ludwig was found in a small marsh near the scene of the crime.
He is dead.
Hello. Oh.
Yes, i'm alone.
That was a nice little trick you pulled on me.
Al, i'm sorry.
I had- i had to take them.
You know i was in a jam.
But that's impossible.
I haven't that much money here.
Listen, you little double-crosser.
I want that dough, see?
I don't care how you get it.
Only you make it by noon, or I'm talking.
What do you want?
Just a little talk- about those bonds of yours.
- I told the police all i know.
- You didn't tell 'em anything.
The bonds you tried to sell were among those i gave the messenger.
I remembered the numbers the minute i saw that report.
Aw, you're crazy. Besides, why didn't you tell that cop about it if you're so sure?
I have my own way of handling this.
When i first checked my list, those bonds were missing.
In a few minutes, they turned up- very conveniently for someone.
- Where did you get them?
- I bought 'em.
You're lying.
Who gave them to you?
- Nobody, i tell ya. I bought 'em.
- Then you still have them.
I'll buy them from you and pay you double what they're worth.
Well, i- i haven't got 'em right here.
That's the first time you've told the truth.
And i'd advise you to stick to it, Rogers... or you'll find yourself in a nasty situation.
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe i wouldn't be alone.
I might say a lot you wouldn't want to hear.
You might, but i don't think you will.
Good night.
It is the great honor for the hotel that you stay here, Monsieur Chan.
The imperial is the home of all the famous who visit Monte Carlo.
Thank you so much.
Mr. Savarin, he live here long time?
Oui, monsieur. Many years.
He is a fine gentleman.
Yes. Very sad he is suspected by police as criminal.
Monsieur Savarin- the criminel?
Oh, it is not possible.
Share same belief.
- Perhaps would help clear honorable gentleman's name?
- I am at your service.
Would like record of his telephone calls this evening.
- Ah! It is what you call "the alibi. "
- Yes.
One moment, monsieur.
Here are the calls.
There were two of them.
The first one is made by me at 8:00 for Monsieur Savarin.
He directed me to charter a plane at Nice for Paris.
What is time of departure?
He change his mind.
The second call is to Nice Airport at 9:30 when he cancels the plane.
Thank you so much.
Good night.
Bonsoir, monsieur.
What? Oh.
Oh, it's you, Pop.
What time is it?
Where are we?
- Are we following a clue?
- Yes.
Directly to pajamas and bed.
Monsieur a décidé?
One moment, please.
Can assist in negotiating one order of waffles... without danger of arrest?
Uh, why don't you have strawberries and cream and ham and eggs, Pop?
- That's what i'm having.
- Please. Prefer waffles.
J'aurais fraises a la creme... oeufs au jambon.
Et il aura... waffles.
S'il vous plaît, monsieur?
- "Waff-el. "
- Je ne comprends pas.
Please.
One picture still worth
10,000 words.
Waffle, please.
You know, waffle.
Ah. Waff-el.
- Thank you so much.
- Waff-el.
Gee, i'm glad he understood.
I'm certainly hungry.
Excitement of last night... also have no effect on appetite of young lady.
You know, Pop, she never did explain about those footprints.
I've got a theory that she and the bartender, Al Rogers-
- Good morning, messieurs.
- Good morning.
Good morning, MonsieurJoubert.
I didn't recognize you out of uniform.
Oh, the uniform. I only wear him on the most state occasion...
like the visit of your papa.
- Ah. Merci.
- Have had own breakfast?
Yes, but i do not enjoy it.
The eyes, all night long, they have not shut up.
I am very depressing.
Perhaps, uh, bright sunshine bring forth solution.
Note. Young lady keep appointment 10 hours late.
For once, even the search for the woman is not the pleasure.
The head, it is filled with the bumble bee.
Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Have remedy in luggage- prescription of ancient Chinese doctor.
- Please obtain same.
- Sure, Pop.
It'll fix you up, all right.
Voila. Waffle.
Very appetizing.
Thank you so much.
Well, Pop, i hope you enjoy the breakfast you drew for yourself.
Am humbly eating own words.
Cream, please.
Really, darling, you're not very good company this morning.
After all, last night wasn't very pleasant for me, you know.
You still haven't explained about Savarin.
I told you what happened.
I met him in the lobby quite by accident.
Oh, now, Gordon, what's wrong with you?
It isn't me.
It's- it's Victor.
He's pretty badly upset about Ludwig selling information to Savarin.
Hmm. Yes, i can imagine.
- Now he doesn't seem to trust anyone.
- Even you?
Well, he knows about you and me, but-
When he saw you with Savarin last night, well-
- How ridiculous.
- Yes. I tried to tell him that.
Evelyn, promise me you won't see Savarin anymore.
Of course, silly.
He means nothing to me.
There. Does that make you feel better?
I'm sorry, but... it just seems that i resent anyone else being near you.
Oh, darling.
Sometimes you sound like a little boy.
Well, let's not talk about it anymore, huh?
All right. Meet me here for cocktails at 5:00?
Mm-hmm. It's a date.
Well, i must be running along.
It's gonna be a busy morning for me.
Victor's pounding the devil out of Savarin in the stock market today.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, darling.
All right. Sell them in 10,000-share lots.
And offer 5,000 Burma Timber at the market.
Hold the line a moment.
Oh, come in, Evelyn.
Oh, never mind.
I know i can't afford to take any further losses, so do as i tell you.
Good. Keep in touch with me... and go to any extreme to hold the market up.
Au revoir.
You saw Gordon?
- Yes.
- And?
I'm afraid that source of information is closed from now on.
What do you mean?
Karnoff is suspicious of me.
Gordon's jealous of you.
We should never have been seen together in public.
- How's the market going?
- Badly.
The surety company gave Karnoff immediate coverage on his stolen bonds.
Their theft didn't cripple him at all.
I've got to do something- anything- to stop him.
You've already done everything possible.
Wait a minute.
Last night, i saw Madame Karnoff... in the bar downstairs, alone.
She was having a very confidential talk with Rogers, the bartender- the same chap the police dragged into the inquiry.
You think that, uh-
Perhaps.
I could be sure... if i only knew what they were talking about.
Maybe i could find that out.
Fine.
Rogers is probably on duty right now.
Hello. What'll it be?
Oh, something strong.
I'm all in after that session with the police last night.
Aw, don't let 'em get you down, lady.
You certainly weren't afraid of them.
I think it's terrible the way they tried to drag you into it.
Heh! They got nothin' on me.
But there's a lot i could say...
If i wanted to.
Excuse me, lady.
Hello. Oh, it's you.
Yeah, I've been waitin'for your call.
Yeah. Yeah.
The sooner, the better.
Yeah, okay.
Number one son evidently sail to Honolulu for ancient headache remedy.
Oh, do not worry.
He probably forgets to come back, eh?
Ah! When i was so young, i often forget... particularly when i meet with a girl.
Ah, bon. Merci.
These are the reports i sent for last night.
The first refers to Mademoiselle Evelyn Grey.
Ah, so sorry, but cannot solve mystery of French language.
Pardon. i make the translation.
Uh, age: 24.
Born in London.
Unmarried.
Occupation: Mannequin.
Left position in April.
Since then, living expensively in Monte Carlo... with invisible income.
Perhaps stolen bonds help pay hotel bill.
You have said something.
Ah, here we have Monsieur Rogers, the bartender.
Age: 35.
Born in Chicago.
Arrested twice for petty larceny.
No conviction.
Occupation: Vaudeville dancer.
Appeared in French music halls in 1936.
Since employed as bartender in Vichy and Monte Carlo.
Very doubtful petty larceny mouse attack millionaire lion.
Ah, but perhaps the mouse drink too heavily of his own cocktails...
and then become not afraid of the lion.
Possible.
Anyway, we make the investigation.
Aha. Listen to this.
At 8:00 this morning, Madame Karnoff bring jewelry to the pawnshop in Nice... and borrow 750,000 francs.
In American money- how much, please?
Uh, 25,000 dollar.
Very strange.
Same amount bartender ask for bonds.
- Ah, you think there is a connection?
- Perhaps.
I cannot make the tail and head of it.
The lady has a rich husband, but no money.
The bartender has no money, but has rich bonds.
Now, what is the answer?
Questions are keys to door of truth.
Eh? Ah! Mais oui!
We speak first with the bartender.
Hey, you. Come here.
Where is Monsieur Rogers?
He left about 10 minutes ago right after he got a phone call.
Give me the telephone.
I will trace the call.
You perhaps hear Monsieur Rogers say where he goes?
Yes. His hotel.
Other people present when telephone call arrive?
Why, yes, but i didn't know any of them except Miss Grey.
- She's a guest here.
- Thank you so much.
Ah! Bon. Merci.
The telephone call, it came from-
- House of Mr. Karnoff?
- Oui, Monsieur Chan.
And they meet at the hotel of Monsieur Rogers. Yes, no?
Perhaps now we catch lion in mousetrap. Or lioness.
We shall see. Allons.
Oui, madame. Oui.
Yes, sir.
I mean, oui.
Eh?
Gosh, Officer, i'm sort of a detective, and there's a man here i'm following.
Silence!
- Gee, you've got me all wrong. I can explain everything.
- Silence!
The mousetrap.
He is dead.
Bullet enter near base of brain.
Body still warm.
I will search the room.
Aha! He was packing the clothes.
For the escape perhaps.
Monsieur Chan.
The bonds Metallurgic.
The stolen shipment.
One million dollars.
Everything is now clear.
The bartender steal the bonds and commit the murders.
Then he become full of fright.
He knows he cannot escape the police chain i draw so tight around Monte Carlo.
So what does he do?
He takes the pistol... point him here, makes the suicide.
- Voila. The case, it is now finished.
- Contradiction, please.
Only Rogers finished.
Case still open.
- Comment?
- Note bullet enter head behind left ear.
Oui?
Also, gun found in left hand.
Oui.
Yet, position of coffee cup and pot... indicate victim right-handed.
It is too true.
Obviously the left hand does not make the suicide for the right-handed man.
But the bonds. Monsieur Chan, do they not prove he is the thief?
Prove only that thief was here.
And plant the bonds and the gun-
On dead man who cannot defend self.
Regard. Chair overturned... in struggle to avoid murderer.
Why could this not happen to someone else?
For 25 years, there is no murder in Monte Carlo.
And then three people are killed- piff, paff, poof- like that.
I am humiliating.
Would be interesting to learn... identity of person who telephone Mr. Rogers.
I will have my men take the photograph of this room... and remove the body.
Then we go to the Karnoff villa and make the questions.
Uh, humbly suggest
Mr. Savarin and Miss Grey also present.
I hope they are not also dead.
Soon we have no suspects left.
Uh, one moment. Look.
My men told you to come here, mademoiselle?
Your men? No.
I drove out with Monsieur Savarin.
- Savarin? Where is he?
- In the house with Monsieur Karnoff.
C'est terrible!
Come. We have not a moment to lose.
That's enough, Savarin! Apologize for your remarks concerning my wife, or i-
- You are all right, Monsieur Karnoff?
- Of course i'm all right.
- What do you want?
- A small talk, monsieur, with your wife.
You can ask me any questions you have in mind.
My wife knows nothing whatever about last night.
Unfortunately, necessary to question fair lady about today.
Pardon, madame.
But why did you this morning... make the appointment to meet
Monsieur Albert Rogers at his hotel?
I warn you, Joubert.
Your insinuation is an insult.
Truth cannot be insult.
Unfortunately, we have traced telephone call.
- But- - Also, we have the report from a certain pawnshop.
- The denial is useless.
- Yes, i suppose it is.
I went to that pawnshop to raise money for Al Rogers.
He- He was blackmailing me.
Has been for months.
Explain, please, nature of club held over head.
I- i married Al Rogers seven years ago.
It was a horrible mistake, and we separated.
Then i lost track of him, but several years later i heard he had divorced me.
I never knew that was untrue until he found me here and started his threats.
Don't worry, dear.
My wife has nothing further to say.
No, Victor, i want to go on.
Last week, Rogers demanded more money than i had... so i- i took three of my husband's
Metallurgic bonds from the safe.
Then Gordon, my brother, told me... that these were the bonds they were sending to Paris.
I was afraid Victor might find out what I had done.
I tried to get them back from Rogers last night, but he refused.
So i... stole them from his room.
He found out immediately, of course, and gave me until noon today to make good.
You give Mr. Rogers money this morning?
No. I- i went to his hotel, but he-
Pop! Pop!
I found the murderer!
It's Rogers, the bartender. I followed him.
I saw him packing his luggage.
He's gonna leave town.
If you hurry, you can still catch him.
Unfortunately, Mr. Rogers already depart on long journey.
- He got away?
- He is collapsed with death.
Dead?
Rogers is-
Oh, Victor.
All of you, don't look at me like that.
I didn't kill him!
I didn't kill him!
He was dead when i got there.
He'd fought with someone.
The furniture was upset.
It's possible, madame, for a woman to have done that.
You pay him the blackmail, yet you fear this is not the end.
He will demand more and more, but there is one way to stop his talking forever.
You blundering idiot.
She couldn't have committed that murder.
Why are you so certain?
Unless you commit the crime yourself.
If you discover the scandal, you also have the motive.
You're insane. I never saw Rogers but once, and that was last night in your office.
Contradiction, please.
Caretaker at hotel of unfortunate bartender...
testify you visit Rogers last night... after inquiry at police office.
All right. All right, i'll admit that.
But today, i haven't been out of this house.
Ask Gordon, my secretary.
He'll verify that.
That's right. Mr. Karnoff and i had breakfast together.
I was with him until 10:00 when i left for the bank in town.
And Rogers was killed between 10:00 and 11:00.
At which time,
Monsieur Savarin and myself... were having a most interesting conversation in this room.
Which cause me to remind myself-
For what reason do you make the visit here today?
I don't believe i have to answer that.
There is much you must answer to.
I have given you a complete account of my actions.
Correction, please.
Explain why, last night at 8:00... you telephone Nice for private aeroplane to Paris.
And why, at 9:30, soon after the murders... you make the second telephone call and cancel the order for the plane.
Very well.
After Ludwig phoned, i made arrangements to fly to Paris... to defeat Monsieur Karnoff's plans.
I was on the way to Nice Airport... when i saw his automobile with a dead man in it.
I thought I might be suspected of the crime if I left Monte Carlo.
So i returned and canceled the plane.
Why did you not tell the truth last night?
If i had admitted being on the Nice road... you would probably have arrested me.
Excuse, please.
You drive to Nice alone?
No. Mademoiselle Grey drove me in her car.
It is very fast, and I was in a hurry.
- Then you didn't meet him by accident after all.
- Please, Gordon, i can explain.
Enough! We have no time for the lovers' quarrel.
Your automobile, mademoiselle, it intrigues me.
Six months ago, you are a poor mannequin in a London dress shop.
Yet today, you possess the fast automobile worth a small fortune.
What are you trying to insinuate?
You do not have the income, yet you have the jewelry, the furs, the automobile.
May i remind you, mademoiselle, there are no Christmas trees in Monte Carlo.
It would seem that the cost of mademoiselle's furs... is more important to the police and Monsieur Chan... than the capture of a murderer... and the recovery of Monsieur Karnoff's bonds.
So sorry for poor memory.
Lee, please obtain evidence from honorable policeman in car outside.
Okay, Pop.
I hope your evidence will be of more importance than Joubert's ridiculous questions.
Monsieur, i demand your apology.
And i demand that you send to Paris for someone capable of handling this case.
Here it is, Pop.
Why, that's my bag- the one the bonds were in.
- The ones they are still in.
- Where did you find it?
In room of murdered bartender.
- Lee, you lock bag?
- No. It was locked when i got it.
So sorry.
Can unlock same?
Why, yes.
Gordon, give me the key.
- They're all here.
- Excuse, please.
Original shipment contain one million dollars?
- Why, yes.
- So sorry to disappoint.
But we check bonds while driving here.
200,000 still missing.
Well, i can't understand that.
You'd better check them, Gordon.
Perhaps you made a mistake.
Is possible, but if secretary's search unsuccessful... suggest you look in own safe.
Just what are you driving at?
Missing bonds possibly placed in safe by murderer...
who also plant bag in room of unfortunate Rogers... to convict him and end case.
Come, come, monsieur.
The safe, if you please.
I have more Metallurgic bonds in my safe... but how could you possibly identify them as the missing ones?
By numbers on bank messenger's receipt.
Why, nonsense. You know that was destroyed in your office.
Contradiction, please.
You place receipt in pocket, then start fire to avoid search for same.
Now, please, restore to hands of police.
Merci for this.
And now... an explanation.
That receipt proved that Rogers's bonds are really mine.
Finding that out would naturally have led you to my wife.
For the moment, i will accept that.
And now, monsieur, the safe.
You will check these numbers with those bonds.
He's right, Victor.
These are part of the stolen bonds.
Who, beside honorable secretary, possess key to bag?
I do. Well, that is, I did.
I gave mine to Renault, the messenger.
Beyond a doubt, the small key discovered in his purse.
Then only you and messenger possess keys?
Why, yes, i guess so.
Then you are murderer.
Why, you're crazy.
Ordinary thief would break lock on bag... or cut leather to open same.
You made one mistake when you leave bag in Mr. Rogers's room.
You open it with key.
That doesn't prove anything. Why, anyone could open that lock with a hairpin.
Impossible, also, to open safe with hairpin... and replace bonds.
Why would i do that? If i had taken the bonds, i'd have sold them, wouldn't i?
Not ifbonds stolen to prevent discovery... of previous theft.
Mystery of young lady's expensive luxuries now explained.
Months ago, you steal bonds from employer's safe... to buy affection of former mannequin.
Last night, when danger of exposure arises, you commit murders... then replace in safe enough bonds to conceal former robberies.
Today, you go to Hotel Regale... plant evidence in Mr. Rogers's room... then murder him when he returns to unexpectedly find you.
I didn't, i tell ya.
- I didn't do it! I didn't!
- The same gun was used in each crime.
- That isn't true. Rogers was shot with a different gun.
- Thank you so much.
Only police and murderer could know same.
Gordon, you didn't do it.
You couldn't have.
Yes, i did it, all right, for a lying little cheat.
I stole for you.
I gave you presents because I liked to see you look more beautiful than anyone else.
You let me think you were in love with me.
Savarin- that's who you were really in love with.
You were just using me- using me to get information for him- and laughing at me behind my back.
Someday there's gonna be a payoff... and it's gonna be my turn to laugh.
- Unfortunate young man perhaps better off.
- Oui.
Mademoiselle Grey... the principality of Monaco makes no accusation against you... but, due to your connection with this case... i must insist you leave Monte Carlo within 24 hours.
- I understand.
- Evelyn, is there something i can do?
Ah, yes, Monsieur Savarin, there is.
I make the suggestion you perhaps accompany mademoiselle as she leaves Monte Carlo.
The trip will be more pleasant if you make it together.
Well, now that your papa wins the honors at Monte Carlo... i suppose you will win the grand prize at the Paris Exposition.
Will be facing greatest mystery... if award given to offspring's painting.
Aw, gee, Pop, it isn't that bad.
Say, that's the same cab we had last night.
Imbécile!
He says he has the new spark plug.
Uh, car with new spark plug like flea on puppy dog.
Make both most active.
For his sake, i hope so.
It is with the lead in the heart i say au revoir, my good friend.
Merci so much.
Good-bye.
- Merci, monsieur.
- Au revoir, MonsieurJoubert.
Good-bye, Monsieur Lee.
Bonne chance!
Bon voyage! Au revoir!
Newspaper.
- Is it true? 
- Look yourself, sir.
"Following the success of our U-boats it has been decided ..."
So now we know, sir.
Reception!
- ... I want a room 
- A room for my wife and myself.
Sorry, we are full.
- But we just got married. 
- He has to join the ship tomorrow!
29, but I might turn you out.
Register first!
¿Captain Hardt?
You'll need a diving suit. He is still at sea.
- The U29 moored an hour ago, sir. 
- Who would be a U-boat captain?
- A letter arrives, send it to my room. 
- Very good.
- Capt Rigg wants another manicure, room 46. 
- I know...
Well?
Captain Hardt is to report to headquarters immediately.
- He hasn't arrived yet. 
- What's his room number?
- Have you seen him?
Not for 16 days.
- You know him by sight?
- No.
Well, try the Turkish baths at Koernische.
Koernische Strasse ...
- Hullo; kept my room? 
- 54, Captain Hardt.
- Cigarettes? 
- Sorry, Capt. We're sold out.
- Again? 
- Got yet tobacco.
And a beautiful pipe. Only six marks.
Nothing doing it. I never smoke a pipe.
- C'mon, lets bath and shape the body. 
- Did you sink any food ships?
- Four. 
- Makes me hungry just to think of it.
16 days without a smoke.
- This is absolutely ... 
- Perfect!
Food first. A cigar is best after dinner.
You're always right, sir.
Back again, Captain. Congratulations.
- A table for two? 
- And a meal for ten.
I put in the out booth. They've just gone.
- Felix, darling! 
- After dinner, Schatzchen.
Listen Hans: We've been 16 days in a submarine.
It makes 48 tins of sardines, 768 beastly little fishes.
- I could eat a horse.
- He probably did.
Sorry, it's a meatless day.
We'll have roast goose with foie gras,
- Apple pie, plum pudding. 
- Big as a depth charge.
Gentlemen... please!
- Here is the menu. 
- Thank you.
- Is it a joke? 
- Boiled fish!
- Carrots, beets, potatoes. 
- No potatoes, sir!
- Bring a pail of bread and butter. 
- No butter. Margarine tomorrow perhaps.
We sank the finest food in the world
Then turn to port and you give us ...
- Boiled fish and carrots! 
- I agree...
Fifth floor.
Captain Hardt? Message from headquarters. Report immediately.
- Carry on as she goes, quartermaster. 
- As she goes, sir.
What an idea, putting a motorbike in a submarine!
- Can at least open the kit pack?
What it says about the motorbike, sir?
- What you got there? 
- A chart of the mine defences.
And a photograph of the Old Man of Hoy; it seems to be a rendez-vous.
3* 25'. It's off my chart.
- It's in mine. 
- Here.
Gentlemen, we are on a special mission.
Our orders are to proceed to
Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands.
It's a big job and a dangerous one. 
I know I can count on you.
That's all. Thank you.
Hartman, full speed ahead.
- 3-2-0, sir.
- Schuster? 
- Yes, sir.
"Your" motorbike, it'll take me to Longhope, in the island of Hoy, base of the British Grand Fleet.
"Once across the minefield, spend the night at the Man of Hoy."
Lt. Schuster will take over and wait for your return.
You will proceed to the Longhope School where you will report to our agent... 
Fraulein Thiel. "
A woman? How is she?
- Tall, dark, 21... 
- My type, sir!
- Have a shave, sir. 
- See what's in the kit pack.
- I still do not see why a motorcycle. 
- Schuster ...
A man landed from a submarine would not travel by motorbike.
- Ah, camouflage! 
- Ah, camouflage.
A well-worn tweed, the thing for Scotland.
Too big for me; fits you all right.
This suit's mine! I bought it in Berlin.
"Temple & Conway, Saville Row, London"
"Ernest H-A-R-T"
Your name, sir, spelled in the English way.
Clever. Stole my own suit. 
Trying to make a spy of me.
This Fraulein Thiel; is there a photograph of her?
- How would they get her into the school? 
- That's their business.
Miss Anne, dear, it is nearly four.
- The carrier will be here. 
- Coming!
Look out!
- My poor paint... 
- The handle broke.
Oh, there's nothing hurt.
Nanny dear, I've loved my holiday, every minute.
How couldn't I know to look after your? 
I have plenty of practice.
Don't stand there smiling, fix a label.
I thought you might like to have this.
You dropped your passport, Miss Butter Fingers.
- It's a photo of John and me. 
- And you give it to me?
- I have lots more. They printed thousands. 
- Beautiful!
"Rvd. John Harris, vicar of St. Swithin's,"
"and his fiancee, Miss Anne Burnett,"
"who was appointed to the school at Orkney Islands..."
- You'll miss him, deary. 
- Oh, he's going come see me when he got a leave.
A car has stopped at the gate!
Would it be too much to ask for some tea?
It suits me, but you'll have to wait until this lady is under way. Maggie, the bag.
- We're waiting for the carrier. 
- To take the train to Thurston. Excuse me a minute.
- Are you going up north? 
- To the Orkney Islands.
- Where the fleet is, right? 
- Got a job there. I'm a teacher.
- It's four o'clock! 
- My train leaves at five!
How strange Sandy Ross being late. 
- Sandy Ross?
- Have you seen him?
We saw an old car with his name. 
He seemed to be broken down.
- Where? 
- About 8 km.
- God! 
- Can't catch another train?
Missing the boat would mean losing a whole day!
Tell Mr. McLeod! We'll take the hearse.
No. Wait.
- I can run you to the station. 
- It would be lovely.
- What about your tea? 
- It doesn't matter.
- The Providence sent you. 
- Come along.
Maggie, put her things in the car!
We're taking her to Dingwall.
Be sure to keep warm. She's easy to catch a cold!
You're a blessing in disguise.
Hold your dear passport. Don't forget your woolies.
- It's terribly cold out there. 
- I'll take care.
- Never thought you were a teacher. 
- But I am.
- I got my degree from Bristol U. 
- Then again...
Had to do something after my father died. No money.
- What was your father? 
- He was an architect, but not very lucky.
He only had a good job; a tavern in Chester.
And he didn't like it because he was a teetotaler.
- You lived in Chester? 
- Yes, on Putnam Street.
- The Orkney Islands; do you have friends there? 
- None.
- But John will come to see me. 
- Who is John?
My fiance. Want to see a photograph?
Very much.
He is quite good looking.
Orkney Islands; I thought it was impossible for civilians to go there.
It is. It was a fuzz getting my passport.
- But you got it? 
- Yes, here it is.
Complete with photograph. Isn't it terrible?
- Passport photographs are never flattering. 
- Haven't you taken the wrong road?
- ¿Is this the route to Dingwall, Edwards?
- Yes, madam.
It probably is a shortcut.
- Are you sure you aren't cold? 
- No, I love it.
Remember what your nanny said. 
Give Miss Burnett the shetland scarf.
- Really I don't want it. 
- No, you mustn't catch cold.
- Done? 
- All is in order.
Well, hold on tight.
Put on these clothes.
- Did you see a light? 
- Where? No.
- I think I heard a splash. 
- Take over.
A seagull.
Right, madam. We know you.
- ¿Miss Anne Burnett? 
- Yes.
- Schoolteacher?
- Yes.
- This picture, it doesn't really do you justice. 
- I tought it as good as my other passport photos.
- Destination?
- Longhope.
- Age?
- Married or single? 
- Engaged.
- Pass... 
- Thank you.
- What about tea, Miss? 
- Yes, please.
- What time we get to Longhope?
 - In about an hour, Miss.
- You're only passenger 'cept for a telephone linesman.
- Thank you.
Fix your pass there.
- Are you in the wire patrol? 
- What do you think?
- Six? 
- Six.
I'll pass you.
- Fine passage, James? 
- You think so, Walter?
For you. All you do is stand on the bridge, but me?
It is a miracle that I keep this old tub coming.
When will we be in port to see them?
- I'll see about that.
- I hope so.
- You're the new teacher?
- Yes.
It'll be a nice change from the last one. 
She was called "Wall Eyed Maggie".
- You got a pass?
- Yes.
I'm a special constable, you understand?
See that? "Orkney Constabulary", for the duration.
No one's up or down without me knowing.
- Miss Anne Burnett?
- Yes.
I'll pass you.
Bob Bratt. Come; there's a minister and his wife who want to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I'll take it.
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!
This is Rvd. Hector Matthews. My wife.
- How kind to meet me.
- Welcome to Longhope.
We were thinking, you may prefer a room with us
- To living up at the school house.
- That's very kind, but ...
We thought it'd be highly improper for so young a girl to be on her own.
- I'm accustomed to look after myself.
- Mrs Matthews is a pretty housekeeper.
- You'll find the charge is very reasonable.
- I'm sure of that.
Shall we discuss it some other time?
Good bye.
- Good bye.
- I'll put you on your road, Miss Burnett.
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!
- 50 feet.
- Pump up 4 auxiliary.
Pump up 4 auxiliary!
- Dead slow.
- Dead slow, sir.
Stop the pump. Shut 4 auxiliary.
Stop the pump, shut 4 auxiliary!
- 80 feet!
- Flood fives.
Flood fives!
Hold at 80 feet.
Hot? Funny how cold makes you steam.
- We have scraped something, have you heard?
- You would have heard if we had.
Well, gentlemen, I think we are through.
Whoever got the chart of the mine field deserves the Iron Cross.
Yes, we shouldn't have even a wood one without it.
Stop motors.
Stopped boat, sir!
Can you hear anything?
No, sir. Nothing.
- Good. I'm going up. 30 feet.
- 30 feet, sir!
Up periscope.
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface!
- Main vents shut, sir!
- Blow ones.
- Blow twos and threes.
- Blow twos and threes!
- Stop blowing. Exit stations!
- We review the details?
- Do you think I'll forget?
To be sure. Ready? On top of the cliff?
- Northeast, surrounding rocks.
- Then?
Follow telegraph poles. Rough road.
- 3 miles?
- Right.
At the fork, turn left.
- In the cairn?
- Stop and look for the sign W-NW.
- The woman?
- Fraulein Thiel.
- Motorcycle is asshore, sir.
- Password?
I do not know what spell makes me so sad...
- What are you smiling at?
- You sir, saying that in the dark to a woman.
If you are so funny, keep it. Come on.
Come up at same time next 3 nights.
Yes, sir.
- Got everything you want?
- Yes.
- Glasses? ¿Gun?
- All.
Good luck.
Who goes there?
- Constable Bob Bratt.
- Pass.
Quiet tonight.
Hi there!
Put that light out!
- Is somebody calling?
- What you think you're doing showing a naked light?
- I'm very sorry.
- Put it out!
Yes.
- Haven't you read the regulations?
- No.
- All the worse. And you're a teacher!
- It's you, Mr. Bratt? I'm very sorry.
Well, that's all right, Miss.
I'm single handed and the fleet here, I have to keep an eye.
A spy would give his head to get here, but he won't get by Bob Bratt.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I do not know what spell makes me so sad.
An ancient legend duped me and not let me.
- What was the patrol doing?
- They saw the light.
- You're alone?
- Of course.
- Where this door leads?
- To the kitchen.
- Does the ladder?
- A room.
Butter!
You gave me a fright.
So you are Fraulein Thiel.
Yes, captain Hardt.
- From now on please speak in English.
- And eat in English?
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- How did you get here?
- A demure look and a fake passport.
You speak English like a native.
I shouldn't go very far. I am the teacher.
- Teacher!
- My name is Anne Burnett.
- Please call me that.
- Anne Burnett.
Are you mad? Wearing an uniform here?
If I'm shot, it will be as an officer, not a spy.
Being a civilian I have no such defenses.
I beg your pardon.
A whole ham, white bread... and butter.
- Butter!
- Butter.
These English are not feeling the pinch.
I had no idea secret agent's was such a comfortable profession.
It has its uncomfortable moments.
Talking about it, school opens the day after tomorrow.
- I wonder how I should get on.
- So do I.
In Germany girls no longer wear silk stockings.
I'll show you your room. It's upstairs.
- I haven't yet been told what I'm to do here.
- You'll be told tomorrow.
Not tomorrow. Now!
What are your orders?
- I beg your pardon?
- Your orders, Captain Hardt!
To report for duty to Fraulein Thiel and obey her orders.
Exactly! Pick up your motorbike and go to bed.
- Do I take it to bed with me?
- Suit yourself. There's a parking space at the wash den.
Sorry.
Good night.
Hey, hey! Why are you locking me in?
- A woman comes to clean in the morning.
- I can lock my own door.
I think this is safer.
- May I come in?
- Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Your breakfast is in my room. 
There's a beautiful view from my window.
I didn't come here for holidays. I have more important things to do than admire the view.
All right!
Well... ¿The plan?
To sink 15 of these ships.
How?
He will tell you.
Who is he?
A British officer with a grudge. 
He was in command of a destroyer.
- He lost it in a collision.
- How?
A wrong order. He'd been drinking.
Traitor and drunkard, an honor for the British navy.
- Where did this happen?
- Off Cyprus.
- HMS Connaught. February 16.
- Then you knew?
- Of course. Commander Ashington.
- Lieutenant. He was dismissed of the ship.
- Where did you meet him?
 - At Leith, a month ago.
- And found he had a price.
- Rather a high one.
- Paid by whom? 
- Germany.
Only by Germany?
And me.
I suppose we should have to meet.
Come down in a minute.
Captain Hardt.
Suppose we'll sit down and get acquainted.
- Give him a drink; loosen him up a bit.
- I'd rather get to business.
Drink when you can in this job. That's my motto.
May we confine on what rests before us.
All alike, you Germans, one tech mind.
Draw the curtains, get the charts. Let's go.
Here we are. Three years we've been sitting on our bottoms in Keith.
- Met in Jutland.
- That's why you haven't put it out a notice since.
- You mean ... 
- All right, we both won.
Point is: with the fleet around the corner, and that the large fleet in Scapa watching,
- You couldn't get to the Irish Channel...
- I know that. What's your plan?
Two cruisers squadrons will sweep southward.
I know that too. It is routine.
But wouldn't you give an eye to know when, where & how?
- Do you know?
- Everything except the actual time, and I'll get it.
- Which squads? 
- The 1st and 5th.
And the course?
Here it is, pencil line. East of Swona.
If we got submarines to rendez-vous...
- In Sandwick Bay.
- In Sandwick Bay,
- We could bag the lot,
- Exactly.
They may alter the course, but I'll find out.
- From whom?
- My brother. He is flag captain.
- He too...? 
- No. It's a case of brotherly trust.
When will this movement take place?
Tomorrow. Next day. Anytime. 
But you'll get plenty of notice.
We can't take submarines off blockade duty on suppositions.
Supposition nothing! Those squadrons are going to sail.
- The date? 
- I'll get it.
It would be the biggest smash of the war.
Then, we understand each other?
I hope so.
- To our next meeting.
- To our next meeting.
Mind you, behave yourself.
- Mr Ashington, what is your ship?
- The old Warspite.
She won't be going out with the squad?
- She's laid out for repairs, as usual.
- Pity.
You see, children. When look at this little island of ours, you realize it is...
... the protector of much larger countries and continents.
I know you don't like it but this isn't for a German audience.
- You've almost persuade me to become British.
- What would I say next?
There's the bit about the empire where the sun never sets.
But it needs explain.
Which way it goes? West-East or East-West?
It worries me. I bet children will know.
I shouldn't worry. You can teach them more important things.
How to get to an island guarded like Gibraltar.
How to twist British and German officers round your little finger.
Lots of things never taught in school.
Doesn't all that belong to evening school for grown-ups?
It is evening, and I am a grown-up.
But you're not one of my pupils.
Tell me: what became of the real Miss Burnett?
- You know "Red Riding Hood"?
- It had a happy ending...
That's why this story is different.
- She met with an accident?
- Yes, an accident.
- Were you present?
- I obey orders in my service.
What a service!
Have you ever fire a torpedo on an unarmed ship?
- That's different!
- It's certainly more of the same.
Why do you look down on me?
I obey orders, as you obey yours.
We don't choose the jobs we do.
We are parts of a machine of destruction. Like it or not.
Where is the key?
Here.
Good night.
Thank you, children. That's very nice.
Now you may dismiss.
- Thank you very much. Good day.
- Good day.
- Any news? 
- I got it. They sail tomorrow.
- What time? 
- 7:00 a.m.
- No changes?
- No changes.
- You get in touch with your ship tonight.
- Be ready to leave at ten o'clock.
- Tonight?
- Of course. Good work.
- What is all this?
- Fraulein Thiel leaves with me.
- This is the Reverend Hector Mathews.
- Is it? I mean, how'd you do?
I'm sorry I can't shake hands. My name's
John Harris. I'm looking for the school.
- To what purpose, may I ask?
- See my fiancee, Ms. Burnett.
Ms Burnett didn't tell me she had any connection with an English character.
No; but she soon will have.
If you are going to stay on the island you may have a room at my house.
- Far cheaper than lodging at the post office.
- Would it? I mean, that's very kind.
- May bring your fiancee to dinner tonight.
- Well...
If you give me your meat coupons, we will make a roast.
- They're in my inside pocket and I rather...
- Allow me.
At 7:30 sharp.
- You wanted her to remain... 
-  Who cares what I want? Don't you see...
- I only see one thing: my orders.
- Where are they?
- Here.
- What do you mean here?
What were the actual orders?
On completion of the mission you'll be taken on board.
- On completion?
- Yes, on completion.
And, is it completed?
Until your submarines come up with our squadrons the job hasn't even began.
- I think he's right.
- No other way of looking at it.
I shall leave with a message. And tell Schuster to depart tomorrow night for both of us.
Now you're talking sense.
- Who's that?
- Turn off the light.
I'm awfully sorry. There must be another room.
Come on in.
Thank you. Not expect to see officers staying here.
- It is difficult to find accomodation.
- Right.
- We were just gonna have tea.
- Join us.
Oh no really; I came to find my fiancee, Miss Burnett.
- Is she here?
- Milk and sugar?
- Very kind.
- Let me take it.
More than kind of you. It's rather heavy.
- How'd you do?
- Sit down.
Thank you.
Wasn't strange of me not letting her know that I'd arrive?
- Your tea.
- Thank you.
Well, I should give her a shout.
I'm averse to shouting. All of us here.
Well, in that case...
She'll be surprised to find me here, won't she?
- Cake?
- No, thank you.
I brought this gramophone, and heaps of new records.
Have you heard "The Soldier's March"?
It's rather large, but it has a beautiful tune.
I don't recognize that metal ribbon.
- What is it?
- The Iron Cross, second class.
Second class... Then you must be a prisoner of war.
No. You are.
Oh dear!
Oh, they haven't arrived yet!
During a war, lateness for a meal is not only incivility but criminal waste.
- I'm scare the meat will burn. 
- I bring it nonetheless.
I will not wait longer.
I'm greatly disappointed on Rev. Harris.
For what we are to receive may the
Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
- Don't bite these, are macaroni.
- I should have some expla...
- Better wait here for them to come.
- Why?
- 'Stay here!
- Hurry.
- Who is it?
- Rev. Matthews and his wife.
Excuse me.
- Good evening my dear.
- You chose a high night to play calls.
Obligations to society take precedence over nature.
- That's rather a compliment.
- A compliment was not my intention. We waited an hour.
- Outside?
- At table.
- At table?
- Precisely.
- He's upset about the meat.
- Our concern has nothing to do with material.
If you and Rev. could not come, courtesy demands a message.
- Then were you expecting us?
- You must have received our invitation.
- I'm afraid not. I had no idea.
- I find hard to believe he failed to convey it.
- I'm afraid he did.
- That's odd.
If I were your fiance, to see you after so long,
- ... I would forget everything else.
- Perhaps you would explain...
- The minute he arrived, he had a nasty attack.
- Attack?
Yes, sort of a suffocation. He wasn't able to say anything.
Oh, he is ill? I'm greatly relieved.
I put a room at his disposal. I couldn't understand his not coming.
He's gone to bed an hour ago.
- It is the most sensible.
- An embarrassing situation.
Ms. Matthews should stay tonight.
- Shall I?
- There's no need for that.
As a Minister, I say that your position ...
- As a future wife? 
- People might talk.
In wartime? Do not worry about me.
My conscience calls me talk to Rvd. Harris.
I will not disturb him to satisfy anybody's conscience.
Good night.
Then...  You choose to defy me?
Not at all. But this is my house I please myself.
We'll see what the Education Committee thinks of it.
- Good night. 
- Good night.
I understand, but he'll be fighting his conscience all night.
- Good night. 
- Good night.
Sandwick Bay? What a hole!
- Should take 2 hs to rendez vous.
- I hope so.
We are 15 submarines. Our orders are not to waste a single torpedo.
- Good.
- We could sink a few.
Tomorrow at same time come and pick us up.
Yes, sir. Bad luck missing a fight like this
- for a woman.
- Mind your own business.
- Good luck!
- Thank you, sir.
- Schuster!
- Sir?
I nearly forgot.
- What is it?
- Butter.
- Sorry...
- Come on.
- What happened? Did the message go? 
- On its way.
Never been so cold. Must be out of shape.
Damn fellow left me sitting in the hail.
Is not our costume to entertain enemy officers however useful they may have been.
- How does it feel to make history?
- I'll make some coffee to keep us warm.
Don't you keep him up; it's been a strenous evening, time he went to bed.
Still you have some way to go, suppose you set us an example?
Come on, have a bit of tact: can't you see we want to be together?
It's only two hours to dawn. Somebody may wonder what has become of you.
- I think I'll have another drink.
- Yes, do.
After all you'll have the whole day tomorrow to bid you adieu.
Good night.
- Persuasive fellow, aren't you?
- Sleep well.
That's better.
- You didn't give him much choice.
- Oh, he's quite happy.
He has his whiskey and he is swinging down the lane, convinced you're in love with him.
In a minute I'll be swinging up to bed.
No, no. I want to talk to you. And want that coffee.
It's 4:00. Let's talk tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Can't you see this chance will never come again?
Our job is done.
In one hour the submarines will be meeting and in two they should strike.
And in a week, you and I will be in Kiel,
How we'll celebrate!
Then on to Berlin. I can see us lunching at the Hotel Adlon.
You'll have the Iron Cross in your bag and you'll be the only girl in Berlin... in silk stockings.
Silk stockings I might take to bed.
I have served under many commanders but none I admired more than you.
- What will you do when you're home again?
- You just told me.
- Trip to Berlin, the Adlon Hotel. 
- And after Berlin?
Another job. Another island. Another Ashington.
And another captain Hardt?
Perhaps. Please let me go.
Commander Thiel, don't forget that you won a victory.
A good commander must celebrate with his men.
If I'm in command, I order you to let me go.
David.
Jill.
- These have been the worst 10 minutes I ever spent.
- Me too.
- It's all over now.
- Yes, darling.
Little fool, what you mean coming out here without a coat?
Running risks like that?
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, locked in his room.
You are a marvel.
Sir!
Special Constable Bob Pratt, sir.
- Know who I am?
- You're Commander Blacklock, sir.
When the patrol arrives tell them to stand by. Nobody goes in or out.
- Where is your armlet?
- When I heard German spies are about 
I put it in my pocket, to be close and not recognized.
- Keep your eyes skinned.
- Aye, Aye, sir.
David, you won't have him arrested until I leave the house, will you?
Give us credit for a little imagination.
Besides, he's safe enough in here.
Couldn't you let him go back to his ship and at least give him a fighting chance?
Too risky. He might find someone who knew the real Thiel and Ashington.
- You hear that?
- What is it?
The destroyer's flotilla.
They've been loading extra depth charges all night. The result of our midnight labours.
In a few hours, there won't be any U-boats in Sandwick Bay, just a few spots of grease, drifting out to the North Sea.
- I think I'm rather sick.
- Here.
Give it a pull a bit.
Woman: you're going into history!
I know.
Buzz upstairs and get your things.
I'm taking you straight to the St. Magnus, she sails in an hour.
I haven't got anything of my own.
Everything is Anne Burnett's.
Then, here we go.
- I'll be back in half an hour to get him. Stand by.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Sir; you wouldn't like us to save you the trouble?
No. I have personal reasons for doing this job myself.
You'll look after her?
I'll be on the bridge. So my cabin is for the lady to use.
- Very kind of yours. 
- It's a wee bit little, but it's warm,
- and you can have it all for yourself.
- Thank you.
Well ...
Walter, hear, Walter. I warn you:
Unless I got a day in port to work on the bottom, it won't last one week.
- We'll see about it, James.
- I hope so.
Excuse me.
The Pastor! I left him tied up in school.
- Poor Mr Harris.
- To the rescue! Good bye.
- You will take care, won't you?
- Indeed.
- All present and correct.
- Thanks.
- Two around the back.
- You two,
... keep an eye on the window, but keep out of sight. I don't want any casualties.
Two on the road. The rest, you got the front of the house.
Keep close to the wall. The rest follow me.
- You think he's gonna shoot us?
- Would you?
You'll find a pastor in school. 
Cut him loose and calm him till I come.
He'll be rather annoyed. Stay here.
Captain Hardt, this is Commander
Blacklock, of the Royal Navy.
If you throw your gun out the window and surrender, you'll be treated as a POW.
Otherwise, you'll be shot.
- Nobody at school, sir.
- What?
Untie the poor devil!
Cast off!
- Hold on. A passenger's coming.
- Aye, sir.
Mr. Harris, commander Blacklock asked for you. I'll tell him that you caught the boat.
I asked myself: if all is as it should be,
Why I am prevented from seeing Rev. Harris?
I can tell you: Harris was tied in school because he was a nuisance.
You were lucky not to suffer the same fate.
- Under Blacklock you would have.
- I cannot pretend to understand.
I'll help you. And attempt was made by German spies to kill Anne Burnett and put an agent in her place.
Fortunately, it failed.
They drop her off a cliff, but by a 100 to 1 chance a patrol boat fished her out.
She said enough so we grabbed the spy in Thurso.
Then we had the idea of replacing her with a counter-spy.
In short notice we found a brave volunteer, the girl you know as Anne Burnett.
The Anne Burnett at school is not the teacher,
Nor the Anne Burnett the Germans intended.
- She's not Miss Burnett at all.
- Substantially correct.
- Then who is she?
- That's an official secret.
- What's the matter, Blacklock?
- Hardt, sir, he got away.
- The German?
- Locked Harris, and he wears his clothes.
Excuse me, sir.
Signals? Send a call to all patrols in the island.
He won't get away, sir. He can't do any harm.
All aboard for mainland!
Stop!
All, in single file.
One by one. Look.
Put them aboard there.
Here we are, sir. All present.
- Eight German prisoners.
- Look starved to me.
Are they off a U-boat?
It blew. On one of their own mines.
One of their...?
- You think they'll see the joke?
- Guess not.
Here, by the right!
You're the right man!
I do not understand.
It's like talking to stuffed dummies.
Well, stand easy; you're depressing.
- What do I do with them?
- Split them up. Forr'ard and aft.
Steward!
- Aye, aye, sir. 
- Give them some coffee.
Poor devils.
- Walter!
- Well, James?
I am not superstitious, but I do not like this.
Mind the engines and I'll mind the ship.
No mind my mentioning.
Six weeks I've been trying to fix a new lining to the bottom of this.
I do not like those Germans. Bad luck.
They could go in the St. Ninian with the other prisoners.
They were crowded. They will not give us problems.
4 in the forecastle and 4 in the saloon, a sentry for four. No one can reach them.
Well... Maybe.
Too young.
- Father, they only speak German.
- Shut up or die.
Captain Hardt. Taking command of the ship.
Take care of the crew. Come on!
Your replacement, he's overdue.
No sausages. It's what you eat, right?
- The Germans!
- Stop!
Below there!
Doddie!
Doddie!
Give me the rocket launcher.
- Get off my bridge whoever you are!
- Drop that pistol.
- You're my prisoner.
- Get out of here or I'll shoot!
Do not move.
- Your ship is in my hands.
- And who might you be?
- I'm a German officer.
- On those clothes?
They do for the present. Where is your wireless kept?
- There is none.
- No wireless?
No German went out of the house while I was at duty, Admiral.
I handed over to the patrol; there were nine of them and one of me.
You didn't suspect that passenger on the pier?
Where were your eyes, man?
He jumped aboard when she was casting off.
I did deliver your message, commander.
- Yes, you told us that before.
- That will do, Bob.
- You got to give credit to Hardt ...
- I give to him for causing this infernal cheek!
He can't get away, sir.
Signals: Wire Scrabster and Thurso.
"Arrest German officer masquerading as a passenger. Stop".
To all the patrols.
"Order St. Magnus to heave to and await destroyer." Repeat that back.
Go below! Go!
Attention.
- I need two men. 
- Very well.
Keep an eye on the crew and passengers.
To monitor crew and passengers! Come with me.
Stay calm. Let's take a look.
Out.
- How did you escape?
- That I must thank you for.
Sentiment made you stop being Fraulein Thiel 
- Or Miss Burnett...
- Mrs. Blacklock!
That's one secret you kept well. How considerate.
Now you captured the ship what will you do?
Lay a course for the submarines at Sandwick.
- You can't do that!
- I'm not under your orders!
- But it is full of mines!
- We shall both take our chance.
- This doesn't mean you and me.
- Right: It means the life of hundreds of my comrades!
- But the children and women here aren't people?
- That will be at your door, not mine.
The war broke. You forget, as I did before.
- You are English, I'm German. We are enemies!
- I like that better.
And I. It simplifies everything!
Come on.
- Lay a course, East.
- East, captain.
Now what, sir?
Listen. You're held as prisoners of war.
I do not want any noise and panic.
Whoever disobeys orders will be shot.
With one exception.
- Be quiet!
- Easy.
A19, A24, A7... St. Magnus spotted by 3 patrols. Still on the right course.
There are eight German prisoners on that ship.
- What are you doing, you can go home.
- Thank you.
If they join forces with a desperate man like Hardt...
- Message from A17.
- No sighting. She's overdue.
She set a different course between A7 and A17.
Sandwick Bay.
My wife is on that ship.
- Orderly.
- Yes, sir.
I want to see the commander of the flotilla.
I'm sorry. You'll have to forget personal affairs.
Sir?
We believe St. Magnus was captured by German prisoners who are making a rush for Sandwick.
Cmdr Blacklock will advise you on the course to be taken.
Go out to Switha Sound and cut her off.
- She's to be sunk?
- If they won't surrender...
Skipper!
Skipper!
- Are you there, Walter? 
- Huh?
We can't keep at this speed much longer.
It's murdering my bearings.
Fearful pressure on engines. 
I don't know how the ship'll put up with.
- Where are we going?
- Due east.
Soon we will leave the patrolled area.
- We're in the hands of the providence.
- No we are not; we are in the hands of a man who cares nothing for his life or yours.
It's all my fault, cause I forgot that we were at war, that the war kills any decent human feeling.
- Can you shake it up a bit?
- No, it's flat out now.
The old man is deaf or dumb. 
Or is a U-boat he's after.
Out.
Out!
Funny; there's no sign of the old tub yet.
- Perhaps they altered course again.
- Not likely.
Have a look, Felix. 
Is not the St. Magnus?
It's her all right. What's she doing so off course?
- Looks suspicious.
- What a cinch!
We gotta save all the torpedoes!
Nothing in the orders to stop us sending a couple of shells...
Stand by to surface!
Guns trough, action stations.
Objective: steamship. Steer right.
Remove the British flag.
The U29!
Schuster! Schuster!
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!
It's me, Hardt!
There's someone semaphoring from the bridge!
H - A - R
There's firing down the haven.
Better take a look. Hold the course, Number One.
Wear the lifevests. Get to the lifeboats.
Stay calm.
To the lifeboat!
Keep calm and put on the floats.
Donald, stop what you're doing and come up to the deck. Hurry up.
There she is!
Stand by. Guns out.
- Don't fire!. She's sinking by the stern.
- They're taking to the boats, sir.
Captain, look, destroyer!
Crash dive!
She's being shelled by a U-boat.
We'll have a crack at it, Number One!
Objective: submarine.
Depth charge... ready!
- You may leave.
- Not without you.
That's an order!
It's time to go, miss. Take it to the boat, James.
It's my old ship that sank us.
Come on now Missi, come on. Hurry.
What are you doing here? 
You should get into a boat.
If you don't mind, I'd rather stay.
Suit yourself. It's your business.
Captain, have you got a cigarette?
Never smoke them, but got a pipe if you want it.
- Never smoke a pipe.
- A little late to learn.
She's there. I can see her!
Who's there?
What are you doing there?
- What you doing?
- Looking for something.
A lot of nonsense.
- Haven't seen anything, have you?
- What you mean, seen anything?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.
- Mysterious, aren't you?
Oh it's you, you've taken your time, haven't you?
Your cat is been screaming her head off for you.
Oh, what's she wants now?
- It's trouble for you me girl.
- Why? What's that?
She found two broken cup and saucers... from the Best Crown Derby tea set buried in the rose bed.
Oh, what ever she say?
Said it didn't matter, now said kiss you... and tell you she loved you all the better for it, what do you think?
- Oh, what do I going to do?
- When did you break them?
Yesterday when you was out.
I do not know what come over me.
I do not know what's come over you all this week.
Ever since bank holiday you've going about looking two penny's worth of heaven help us.
- Losing things and dropping things.
- Has Dora come back? Dora.
- What am I going to do?
- Do? Make a clean breath of it.
Tell her if she don't like it, she can do the other thing, I would.
Dora, I want you.
- Dora.
- Oh dear.
- Auntie, leave the poor girl alone.
- Leave her alone, a little sneak thief?
Oh, there you are?
- Did you want me?
- I called you, didn't I?
I suppose you think the china here came from the penny bazaar.
Of course, if you splattered them at the rose bed I shouldn't be... well enough ever to see them, I suppose. Well, I have seen.
Oh, Oh, that's hurt, don't be so clumsy.
You want to break my arm?
- Come, come Dora, isn't as bad as all that.
- Not as bad as all that? It's worse.
What about that chicken you stole on Monday?
- I never stole.
- Whatever would else you call it?
Borrowed it perhaps?
But Auntie dear, we've been through all that already.
You keep out of this.
I don't know what's come over you, I really don't.
Clumsy, thieving, deceitful.
You can leave, you're sacked my dear.
Oh and stop that sniveling and squeaking.
You bring my heart on again, go into the kitchen.
Oh Ma'am please, don't send me away.
I haven't got a penny only what I earn, if I lose my job.
You should've thought about that before you broke my china.
I'm sorry, I've not been meself all this week.
So I've noticed.
Is anything that matters Dora?
You're not in any trouble, are you?
Yes Miss, I am, in manner of speaking.
Oh, a man, eh? So that's the game.
- Men too.
- Not men, just my friend.
He promised to marry me but he keeps making excuses, now I know he isn't keen.
Who is he?
A boy I know, a pageboy at Tall Boys.
- Good for nothing, scoundrel.
- Oh no, he isn't.
- He's nice really, if you know what I mean.
- No, I don't, where he come from?
Sort of Irish I think, he's been to sea too.
He's funny of course, ever so open.
- Baby Face they call him.
- Baby Face?
I'd like to give him Baby Face.
- Oh Ma'am?
- Well what?
- You wouldn't see him, would you?
- See him?
Not to tell him off
I don't mean but perhaps... if you to speak to him might think things differently.
He will when I've done with him.
A matter of facts he said he might be popping in this morning to see me.
Oh, that's right, nothing like visitors to brighten up your morning, eh?
Well, send him in when he comes, I'll deal with him.
Yes.
And Ma'am...
And I spelled that crown down be out of your wages.
What you'd going to say?
Well, I was going to say that I do not know how to thank you for your kindness.
- There, done. How it feel?
- Not much better, I know it's neuritis.
You know what you really need isn't massage, is exercise.
- Your body would take care of...
- Don't you dictate me me about my body.
Nobody here understands my body or anything else about me.
As for sympathy, I've forgotten the meaning of the word.
Too bad. Well, I'll be getting along.
Mind you calling on Wednesday, in case my neuritis sets in again
I'll do that and if neuritis pops up let me know toodle-oo.
Oh, nice way to talk to an invalid.
- What do you want?
- There's a policeman at the back door.
Policeman?
Said he was a policeman, he isn't in his uniform though.
- Said he wants to see you very particular.
- What about?
Don't know, better ask him.
I know my conscience is clear, don't know about other peoples, I am sure.
Probably come about Dora.
Why? What she's done is not against the law, human nature.
- Where is he?
- Coming down to the front door now.
- You come in.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Bramson?
- Yes.
I'm sorry to break in on you like this.
My card.
- Criminal Investigation Department?
- Oh, purely informal visit I assure.
I don't like having people in my house that I don't know.
Well, I'm afraid the law sometimes makes it necessary.
Oh, thank you.
- You can go.
- I don't want to go.
- I want to be and what's up.
- As a matter of fact, I'd like you to stay.
You might be useful, any of you may be useful.
- You live here?
- Catch me.
Now, it is a lonely spot, isn't it?
Long way for you to walk every day.
- I don't walk, I ride a bike.
- But what's the matter?
Well I just thought that if she walked, you see... she might've used some of the paths around here.
- She might've seen something.
- Something of what?
Well, now I'll tell you, I...
Oh, perhaps I better introduce myself.
I'm Mrs. Bramson's niece, I work for her.
- Or pretends to.
- I see, thank you.
Well now...
I wonder if any of you've seen anything in the least... a bit out of the ordinary around here lately.
Anybody called? Anybody strange wandering about in the woods.
The only visitors been the doctor and the district nurse.
It's been ever so gay.
Oh Miss Grayne is always moving about the woods.
She maybe be able to tell you something.
- Yes?
- No, I haven't seen anything I'm afraid.
Oh yes, I did see some men beating the undergrowth.
Oh yes, yes, I am coming to that.
What's all this fuss about?
Has there been a robbery or something?
- No, there's a lady missing.
- Oh?
From the Tall Boys.
- A Mrs. Shellbrook.
- Shellbrook?
Yes, dyed platinum blonde, widow of a colonel, so she says.
Living alone, so she says. Always wearing them fladelaldy openwork stockings.
- Fond of a drop too, that's her.
- Would you know her?
Never set eyes on her, but you know how people talk.
- Regular red hot mama from what I'm told.
- And what's a red hot mama?
Don't you ever go to the pictures?
Well anyway she hasn't been seen since last Monday.
That was Bank holiday.
She was given to walk in the woods a great deal, in this direction.
She's probably so drunk she fell flat and never come to.
No, we've had the woods pretty well thrashed.
Those were the men you saw.
She was a very flashy... now she is a flashy type of woman, I should say.
- At least I hope I should say.
- What you mean, why you hope?
- Well...
- You don't mean to say she might...
- not be alive?
- It's possible.
- You'll be saying she'd be murdered next.
- Well, that's been known.
Lot a stuff of nonsense, from a policeman too.
Wanted to be brought up on detective stories.
Well, I'd be very grateful to you if all of you keep... your eyes and your ears open just in case, good morning Mrs. Bramson.
Good bye.
Good morning Miss...
Oh I am so sorry.
Why, what's the matter, did you thought of something?
Oh, no, no...
What was it? You were looking strange, if you just thought of something.
No, is nothing really, I was only thinking...
What?
Well...
I often wondered on a very fine morning what it would be like for night to come.
But I never can.
It will have to.
- Silly.
- I should think it was.
No, go on.
Well, here we all are, perfectly ordinary English people.
We woke up this morning thinking, is another day.
Got up, looked at the weather, talked and here we are still talking.
- And all the time...
- What?
All the time there may be something lying in the woods, hidden under a bush.
There two feet showing.
Perhaps a high heel, catching the sunlight, with a bird perched on the end of it.
And the other, the other stocking foot... with blood that dried in the stocking.
Somewhere... somewhere there's a man walking about and talking just like us.
He got up this morning, he looked at the weather... and he killed her.
- Well.
- Miss Grayne, you gave me the creeps.
I don't think the lady can quite describe herself as ordinary... after that little flight of fancy.
I hope she's wrong anyway but it'd be a nice little job of work for us.
Well now, if anything funny happens, just call the lot at Shepperley police station.
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.
- No, don't bother, good morning.
- Lost of nonsense.
I wonder.
Of course you wonder, anything for a bit of excitement I suppose.
- If you please Ma'am.
- What, what is it?
- If you please, he is here.
- Who's here?
My boy, gentleman friend from Tall Boys.
Bring him in, I am ready for him.
I am going to make that young man realize what his duties is.
That's what I am going to do.
Well?
Morning all.
- So you're Baby Face.
- That's me.
Silly name, isn't it?
I must apologize to all and sundry for my fancy dress but is my working tags.
I've been on duty this morning and I, my hands isn't very clean.
- I did not know it was going to be a party.
- Party?
- Well, it's ladies, isn't it?
- Are you shy with ladies?
Oh yes.
You don't seem to be very shy with Dora there.
- Well I...
- You go away.
Yes.
- You smoke I see.
- Yes I...
I am sorry.
I forget my manners in company, clumsy in the other people's houses, I am sorry.
Now then, you know what I set to see you about?
- Yes I think so.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
- But I am.
- Well then?
- What time is it?
- Past eleven thirty I think.
- Olivia.
- Yes Auntie?
- You forgotten again.
- What?
- My medicine, half an hour late.
- I'm so sorry.
You know it doesn't do me any good unless I take it regularly.
Unless I see to every single thing myself in this house, nothing gets done.
What filthy stuff, get me a chocolate.
What a good you're to look after an invalid.
- You work at Tall Boys, don't you?
- Yes Miss, twenty four hours a day Miss.
Can you tell us anything about the woman who's been murdered?
You know of course there's a
Mrs. Shellbrook missing, don't you?
I thought you said something about a murder.
- Oh, what a nonsense.
- We don't know, of course but...
- It might've been a murder, mightn't it?
- Oh yes, it might've been a murder.
- Yes.
- Have you ever seen her?
Yes, I've seen her, I've taken drinks and cigarettes her up to her.
- What's she like?
- What's she like?
She's on the tall side, thin ankles with one of them bracelets around on one of them.
- Fair hair...
- Well, go on.
Her eyebrows, thin.
With a white mark above them where it has been pulled out to be in a fashion, you know.
Her mouth, thin as well.
With the red stuff painted around it to make it look more.
You can rub it off, I suppose.
Her neck... rather thick.
She laughs a bit loud... then stops.
She's very lively.
You can't say I don't keep my eyes skin, can you?
- Are you always so observant?
- With the ladies, yeah.
If you weren't so observant that Dora would not find herself in the plummet she's now.
- That's right.
- You don't sound very repentant.
But I am, what's done is done that's my motto with it?
How was is that mean?
She's a fine bit of ice for hot weather, isn't she?
Now say young man about Dora.
How long have you known her?
Not very long.
- The butcher wants paid.
- Dotty.
He says there's men ferreting at the bottom... of the garden looking for that Mrs Shellbrook.
- Do you know about it?
- Well, they won't ferrit long.
Not in my Cabot grass, Olivia...
She's never there when
I want her, no, no, no.
Leave me alone, I don't want to be pushed into the nettles today, thank you,
You're the clumsiest woman I ever had in my service. Never looked, how to look after me.
Don't let me pay the butcher so I won't know where she keeps her purse.
But I do know, so protecting the needles in me quick.
They say at the Tall Boy she's got enough inside of her purse too.
Well, nobody is seen it open.
If you had a peep inside you could done in her straight, so you'll do.
- What are you saying?
- I loathe her.
She's an invalid, isn't she?
If she's invalid I'm Mickey Mouse.
Hear, I must get back to my little pork.
Say, what are you doing in my garden? Get out there.
You're ruining my planted lawn.
Who gave you permission to come in here?
- Did Mrs. Bramson called me, do you know?
- I'm sorry Miss, I don't know your name.
Come here.
That's enough of that, of you.
There's not much doing around here for a girl, is there?
It isn't a very entertaining quarter of the world for young lady, is it?
Danny, what's she say?
Oh I beg you pardon.
I am not a snarl but in case you have a call here again...
I'd like to point out that though I'm employed by my aunt...
I'm not quite in Dora's position.
Oh, I hope not.
I am going to marry her though.
- And I...
- I don't believe you.
- You don't like me, do you?
- No.
Everybody else does.
Your eyes are set quite a far apart and... your hands are quite good.
I don't really know what's wrong with you.
You know, I've been looking at you too.
- You know, if...
- I'm sorry.
But it's a waste of time wasting doing your stuff with me.
- Are you playing up to Mrs. Bramson?
- Playing up?
It just crossed my mind for a minute.
You stand a very poor chance there, you know.
What you bet?
They say they got permits to look for that silly woman and more than they like to know.
Is there anything I hated these men is they think they got authority.
But I don't think they are quite as bad as men who thinks they have charm.
What she mean by that?
Well, there's no use thinking she has that either.
- Now, look here young man, about Dora...
- Wait a minute.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable with a pillow behind your back there?
- No, no, no. I don't mind,
- I'll get wait...
Please don't interfere, I don't like anybody interfering with my chair.
Feel better, isn't it?
You are looking pale too.
- Pale? Did you say pale?
- Washed out.
I said to myself when I saw you for the first time.
I said there's a lady who has lot to contend with.
Well I have, nobody knows that better than I do.
I'm sure.
Oh, it must be terrible to see everybody striding back and forth... and enjoying everything and seeing them tasting the fruits...
Oh, I shouldn't said that.
- I'm sorry.
- But it's true.
As true as you're my witness, so nobody else ever seems to realize.
- Now tell me young man, about Dora...
- Excuse me Ma'am, is that your cat?
Yes.
I haven't seen him before.
May I take him up?
- You like cats?
- I like all animals.
Especially cats.
Ah, he's a beauty.
I bet he's a good companion to you, isn't he?
- Probably the only one in this house who is.
- I'm sure.
Would you mind if I asked you what your ailments are?
Well...
- but haven't you better sit down?
- Thank you Ma'am.
Well I, I have the most terrible palpitations.
- And...
- Palpitations?
And the way you get about.
They're very bad thing to have, you know.
Do you realize that nine women out of ten in your condition... would be lying down and given way.
- Would they?
- Indeed they would.
I knew somebody once who had palpitations and... somebody very near to me.
But dead now.
My mother, as a matter of fact.
- Oh.
- I can just remember her.
- As a matter of fact...
- Yes?
- On no, it's daft thing.
- Come, come out with it.
Is just my fancy, I suppose but you remind me a bit of her.
Of your mother?
Don't like to talk about my mother, makes me feel sort of sad.
She had the same kind look as you have.
The same eyes, very wide apart.
And the same very good hands.
- And the same palpitations?
- And the same palpitations.
You don't mind my talking about your health, do you?
No.
You know, you ought to get used to letting other people do things for you.
- Yes.
- You ought to be very careful.
Yes.
You're a strange sort of boy to be a pageboy.
Am I?
You seem so much too sensitive and understanding.
Well, I've never had any advantages, you know but...
- I've always tried to do the right thing.
- Well, I think you deserve better.
Talking of the right thing, what about Dora?
- I'm going to marry her.
- You are?
Sure I'd, I'd marry her now but for the job I got I can hardly keep myself.
But if you got a job with a bit more money, I'd, I'd marry her like a shark.
How would you like to work for me?
- For you?
- Would you like to?
Indeed I would?
I can't imagine anything
I'd like better than... to live in a beautiful house like this, with a kind lady...
- taking care of her.
- Well, well, we'll see.
- Have you got to go back?
- No, not just yet I, it's my half day.
- Stay to lunch.
- Well I...
- In the kitchen of course.
- Oh yes, I know.
- There's plenty of food, stay to lunch.
- It's very kind of you, I...
Isn't there anything I can do to help a bit?
Take you for a walk, for a ride in the sun shine is ever so nice out.
Well all right,
- You know, I've taken a liking to you.
- Is very kind of you Mrs. Bramson.
It's the way you've talked about your mother, that what it was.
- Was it?
- Yes, a very nice thought of yours.
You'd go out like this every day and there's no one who'd sooner for you than...
- Good Morning.
- Morning Ma'am.
What can I do for you?
I want a shawl, a shawl for an old lady.
Something like you know, keep the draft out.
Yes I think I know. About what price?
Well, I don't want a very expensive one but I want a nice one.
Now, here is a very pretty shawl, this is an Angora.
And the price is 15 shillings.
That's a little bit more than I ought to spend, I thought about 5 shillings.
Here's a very pretty little shawl at 5 and 6, this is Shettland.
It's nice. Would you mind put it on so I can see how it looks?
Certainly.
That's nice, I'll take that one.
Well, I think that's the lot Mrs. Bramson.
Remind him not to too easy with these people.
If they haven't paid by Monday you slap them a writ and don't take any excuses.
Very well Ma'am, you just sign the receipt for the money
I'll count it first.
It's a great deal of money for you to keep lose in the house.
- Are 86 pounds there.
- Quiet, I'm trying to count.
You put me out, what you say?
I only said that it's a lot of money for you to keep lose in the house.
I keep more than that.
Put not your trust and banks is my motto.
Aren't you ever afraid of being robbed or burgled?
No, I am not.
Wasn't there something in the paper about a woman having... disappeared around here and foul play being suspected?
Lot of nonsense, they put anything in the newspapers.
All the same I don't all together like... the idea of you and
Olivia being here all by yourselves.
That's very considerate of you I must say... but you can put your mind at rest, there's a man coming to live here.
So we should be quite all right, thank you.
- A servant you mean?
- Yes, a servant.
- So there's no need to be jealous.
- Jealous?
Don't think I don't know, it's
Olivia you are thinking of and not me.
That reminds me, there's something else I want to talk to you about.
- Olivia?
- Yes, how much do I left her?
- Left her?
- In my will.
You change the will so often I really cant say offhand.
Right I can, two hundred pounds.
I've been thinking it over and I've come to the conclusion it's too much.
- I want to cut it in half.
- Mrs. Bramson?
- What's the matter?
- Well, she hasn't any money of her own.
Now look here Mr. Laurie...
Are you going to take my instructions and do as you are told?
- Or I got to get another lawyer?
- Not of course if you insists.
I do insist.
Now if you stop talking I'd finish counting this money and you can get back to town.
- Oh, it's you.
- I've come to take up my residence.
- Is the old lady in?
- She's always in.
Danny, did she say anything to you?
- Say anything?
- Yes, about us, you and me.
Oh, she said she approved, she gave her blessing.
- Well, then when?
- Soon Dora, soon. There.
- Now you can show me in.
- Well, I like that.
- Good afternoon Ma'am.
- Oh, it's you Danny.
- All ready to move in.
- You brought your luggage?
- Yes Ma'am, it's in the hall.
- Well Dora will show you your room.
Right you are Ma'am, might give me a hand.
- Is that the new servant?
- -Yes, a very nice boy, very superior.
Hello, I'm afraid I'll miss seeing you.
- Good afternoon Miss, just moving in.
- Good afternoon.
Looks like if we're going on our holiday, doesn't it?
- Well, you all finish your business,
- Yes, I'm just going.
- Would you walk to the car with me?
- Oh, I'd be glad to.
- Goodbye Mrs. Bramson.
- Goodbye and you do what I told you.
Who's this chap is moving in?
Oh, he's a boy from the hotel she's taken a fancy to.
- The maid's young man.
- Seems a nice friendly sort of chap.
- You think so?
- Yes, why, don't you do?
No, no I don't
I think he's common and insolent and conceited and completely double faced.
Say, that's a bit strong, isn't it?
What's he done to you?
- He hasn't done anything to me.
- You're on edge, that's what it is.
And do you wonder?
Living in that house with her.
- Has she been awful?
- No worse than usual, I'd expect.
Darling, why do you put up with it?
- What else can I do? I've no money and I...
- You know what else you can do.
- Why not?
- Oh Justin, really not again.
Yes, again and again and again. Olivia, why not?
- Why won't you marry me?
- Because...
I told you before, I didn't love you that way.
I know, even if you don't.
Wouldn't I be better than the old lady?
I wouldn't bully you and treat you like a servant.
You wouldn't have to live here in the middle of the woods where nothing ever happens.
Still there's a chance that something might happen.
- What?
- Oh, I don't know but something.
Oh, I know I'm a fool Justin and you're dear and sweet and you're good.
But I, I just want to wait a little longer.
I know you going to tell me that storybook romance doesn't happen anymore.
Oh no. I won't. I know it does happen, it happened to me, with you only.
- Only what?
- Well...
Isn't always dressed up quite as you imagine it, I mean why shouldn't Romeo wear... tweeds and come along in a car instead of leaping over the balcony.
I found my Juliet wearing glasses, sewing and waiting hand and foot on an old lady.
I recognized almost immediately the imprisoned princess I had to rescue.
Won't you let me rescue you?
No, not yet Justin, .I'm sorry but not yet.
Alright, I shan't give up hope.
- Goodbye for present then.
- Goodbye.
This is Shepperley's Advertiser.
Is this your cap?
- Yes.
- I found it hanging in the hall.
I think perhaps you better keep it in here.
Can you imagine me doing a thing like that?
Hanging it up just like as I was a visitor I am sorry.
Are you all right in here? It used to be our box room, I think we moved everything out.
Oh, it's very nice, thank you I hope
I haven't put you in too much trouble.
I, I've been hanging up a couple of pictures to make it seem more like home.
You ever go to the movies?
- Sometimes.
- Real life is better though.
- Oh, Napoleon?
- He did things.
- Is that your chap?
- What? Who?
- Fellow who was here just now.
- Oh, that's Mrs. Bramson's lawyer.
- What she got a lawyer about?
- Well, he manages her affairs.
Oh, I see.
I thought from the way he looked at you, he was a bit be gone on you.
It's rather stuffy in here, why don't you open the window?
Here, here.
You know you wouldn't be bad looking without them glasses.
Thank you but doesn't interest me very much what I look like.
Don't you believe it.
- Why do you say that?
- I just think so.
I understand you all right.
Don't you think young man you rather forgetting your place?
I'm sorry Miss, I'm sure,
Well, when you finished unpacking perhaps you'd better come and... see if there's anything you can do for Mrs. Bramson.
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.
Is there anything in the paper?
A lot of sensational rubbish about that Shellbrook woman, I can't read it.
Well, it's a bit of a thrill for a small place like this.
Did you find any clues?
Keeper in Shepperley Wood reported on the night in question about...
2 in the morning he heard someone moving mysteriously in... the wood and whistling Mighty Lak' a Rose. Inquiries are being pursued.
That shows how hard up they are for something to print.
Mighty Lak' a Rose indeed, never heard such rubbish in all me life.
All set and uniform, can I be of service lady?
Silly boy, what's that you hiding?
- Oh, it's nothing.
- But what's it?
- Just a silly idea.
- Come, come, what's it?
Well it's just something I brought along and I thought you might like.
It's a shawl, was my mother's as a matter of fact.
I thought I'd like to see you wear it if you didn't mind.
Danny, that's a very sweet thought.
- Can I put it on for you?
- Yes.
I've always kept it.
It's the only thing of my mother's I've got left.
Now that I see you wearing it like that, it's almost as was herself sitting there.
- Wait a minute.
- What's it?
- It's not quite straight.
- Straight?
There.
Wheel me over to the mirror and let me see it.
Right you are.
- There you are, how do you like it?
- Thanks, very pretty.
Thank you Danny, you're a good boy.
Now I think it's time for my nap.
- Shall I take you in?
- It's all right Miss, I'll do it myself.
- Thank you dear.
- Where do we go now?
In there.
You know this chair works very stiff.
Must be very hard for you pushing yourself about in it.
I can fix it in a jiffy if I have some oil, have you got any?
- There's some in the kitchen.
- Good, now, where do you want to go?
Well now, do you think you can you help me out to the bed?
Sure I can.
- You will be very careful of me?
- I'll treat you like you was made of glass.
Yes, yes that's better.
Ah, that's fine.
Now, just while you're getting your spot of shut-eye.
I'll take that chair in the other room and have it right in half a minute.
- Thank you.
- Is that all right?
Yes, it's very nice, very nice.
What you looking at?
I was looking at your room, I haven't seen it before.
- Very pretty room.
- Yes, everything.
What a beautiful picture.
Beautiful...
Well, pleasant dreams and sweet repose, half the bed and all the clothes.
Silly boy.
- Good night.
- Silly boy.
You agree with me, don't you?
You don't like my being here, do you?
It doesn't make the least difference whether I like it or not.
As I told you before,
I'm really a servant to her myself.
Not a very ordinary servant, are you?
No, I suppose not.
Neither am I.
Go on Danny, tell us some more.
Well, that was when I rode the hounds and had me own pack.
Before you went up in the world and become a page boy I suppose.
You know how that happened? Danny told us about his uncle dying leaving him a fortune.
- How much was it Danny?
- Ten thousand quid.
- It's five when I last heard it.
- And you got through it all in 3 months?
- What you spend it on?
- Champagne, jewels, a villa on the Riviera.
And then you went to sea?
Sailed twice around the Cape of Good Hope before the mast.
Well, I must take these...
Madame Olga's Dream Book?
To dream of spiders means danger is approaching.
Daft.
I did dream of spiders last night, hundreds of them.
I should say danger is approaching too, if you're going on like that.
Has he said any more about marrying you?
Not since the day he moved in here, that's a whole week now.
She hasn't brought it up again either.
Seems like it slipped their memory.
Well then, you did not let him kiss you, not in front of me anyway.
I never let my husband kiss me in front of other people till after we were married.
Then he didn't want to.
Hark at that? He's turned the whole place into a regular circus, that's what he's done.
He'll have the old girl doing a rumba before we know where we are.
I shouldn't have coming in here with my overalls on, I'm sorry.
It's alright, I got the trousers on.
- I'm sorry, is my cigarette annoying you?
- Oh not at all, I like it.
Oh sorry pussy. Here, come here puss, come to Danny.
It won't come out.
Look, right there, over here.
I saw that, leave me alone and don't interfere.
Here, here, look.
That and that and that.
Oh yes of course, thank you dear, thanks.
- Cigarette bother you?
- No, dear, not a bit at, of course not.
I think it's coming out.
Oh Danny, you never forget.
Very different from other people, never remember.
Here, how do you like that for a steady hand?
Oh yes Danny.
There you are, nice chocolate to take the taste off your mouth.
The grocer said there were two gallons of kerosene delivered and not paid for.
And they won't be paid for either, not that I have to go to law about it.
The amount of kerosene that man pretends we use here, would think we drank it.
Oh, I wish you take your papers into the other room.
A sonnet, the flame of passion... is not red but white.
- Not quick but slow...
- Give me that please.
What's it?
- It's a poem.
- Let me see it.
It's only nonsense auntie, really.
Sure from the sounds of it but I can see, can't I?
Writing poetry indeed, that's a hobby in a half I must say.
What do you know about passion anyway?
- Not very much.
- Purse the thing.
I like a bit of poetry myself I do.
But I don't think how you think of those things, I really don't.
She's a dark horse, isn't she?
Writing poetry, did you ever hear such nonsense?
Oh, I dare say she's a bit, a bit repressed.
- Come on now, it's time for your walk.
- Oh Danny dear.
- I got you hat and shawl in the hall.
- Have you got the pills?
- In my pocket.
- And the chocolate?
And the chocolate.
Here you are Madame? Every wish anticipated.
- Is my hat there in the hall?
- Your hat is in the hall.
Yes.
Well, is it cold out?
- There you are.
- Have me shawl.
- And your shawl and my hat, here we go.
- Put it on.
There, isn't it beautiful?
Look at the flowers grown like mad and the tree showing up look like peacock.
And the birds singing their hearts out.
Look at that, mother and child back doing well.
- What do you think of him?
- Danny?
- Oh, he's a all right, a bit of a mystery.
- You think that too?
A terrible liar of course, then a lot of us are.
- Now more than that, eh?
- What you mean?
It's something more that matters him, something he's hiding.
- What?
- I don't know for sure.
- Is Dora about? Oh Dora...
- No, she won't know anything.
She's as a half witted as she's lazy.
She'd cut off her nose off to stop the dustbin...
- smelling sooner than empty it, she would.
- Did anyone say Dora?
Oh Dora, what do you know about Danny, his past I mean?
Only what's he told me
Miss, it's ever so romantic.
Yes, yes, I'm sure.
- Do you trust him Dora?
- I don't quite know Miss.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Oh he's all right.
He cracks himself up you know, pretends he don't care a tuppence... but all the time he's got an eye what you're thinking of him, if you know what I mean.
Yes. Yes, I do.
An incredible vanity.
- They always have it, always.
- Who?
- Murderers.
- Miss Grayne...
You mean this woman they're looking for? Oh Miss, you can't.
Doesn't seem possible, does it? Yet murder a thing doesn't seem impossible either.
Just something you read about in the papers.
Can't touch us, it can.
It's here, all about us, in that forest, in this house, we're living with it, we...
I'm going to look through his things, will you help me?
Me? Alright.
- They're all empty.
- Perhaps he hasn't unpacked.
- But he's been here almost a week.
- Where he keep his luggage?
Now here we are, open it up.
See? He hasn't unpacked.
- That's extraordinary to begin with.
- A dirty shirt.
Those socks, three handkerchiefs, some razor blades...
Here is a pocket book.
- Got a a letter in it.
- Oh, we can't read his letters.
Why not? Don't be silly, his wife will do it to him hundreds of times.
Oh, what a niff.
- Dear Baby Face, my only, signed Lil.
- Awful writing.
Next time you strike
New Castle, Ok by me Baby.
Another servant girl I expect, I'm sorry Dora.
- Bus tickets, snapshots.
- Oh, look at that.
The impudence, being taken in a bathing suit.
What a group?
- Look, look, there she's.
- Who?
The woman who's missing, don't you remember that photograph in the paper?
- It's awful to think she maybe dead.
- Awful.
Looks ever so, don't she?
- There was another bag, wasn't it?
- Yes.
This.
- And this.
- Old fashioned, isn't it?
Got it from a box room at the Tall Boys I should think.
- Too heavy for a hat.
- Looks extraordinary, doesn't it?
What's it Miss?
I was just thinking.
Supposing there's something inside of it?
I left the old lady's pills in the pocket of my other coat.
Silly of me, wasn't it?
May I have it back please? It's the only one I got.
- How did you like the letter?
- Letter?
You got it in your hand.
Means well Lil does but we had a row.
She would spy on me.
It's anything I hate it's a spy.
Don't you agree?
I'd sooner have anything than a spy.
- Part a murderer of course.
- What did you say?
I said part of a murderer, of course.
Talking of murder, do you know anything of Mrs. Shellbrook's... whereabouts at the present moment?
Mrs. who?
You not going to pretend you've never even heard of her?
Oh Mrs. Shellbrook's whereabouts.
I thought you said Mrs Chalkbrook's where,
I'm sorry, silly of me I couldn't think.
Well?
I have nothing to go on but I think she's been murdered.
- Oh...
- Who by?
Danny Danny...
The old lady is getting impatient, excuse me.
Wish you can't think that.
I'd sooner suspect my unborn child.
You don't really think he did it, do you?
Do you?
I don't know.
So I closed the door very quickly and said, I'm sorry sir.
So that she wouldn't think I knew there was a woman in there.
Oh Danny, you've been the death of me.
The things you say.
Well now, I think dear, it's time
I went in and had my 40 winks.
40 winks Ma'am or 50 if you like.
You oughtn't me laugh here, there's always my heart.
You've lost your heart, you know you have and to the little fellow who pushes your pram.
Pram?
Stop that noise, I want to go to sleep.
Did you do it?
I told you you'd be better looking without them glasses?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't you?
Ah, clumsy.
I am sorry.
You're very conceited, aren't you?
Yes.
And you are acting all the time too, aren't you?
Acting? Acting what?
Look how I can look into the eyes, I can stare you down.
Have a theory it' the criminals who can look you in the eye.
- And the honest one who blush and look away.
- Oh?
- It's a very blank look though, isn't it?
- Is it?
You are acting all the time, aren't you?
- Yes.
- Do you happen to stop acting?
- I don't know it's so long since I stopped.
- But when are you alone?
- Then I'm acting more than ever I do.
- Why?
I don't know, because I like it acting.
Just for change, suppose you let me ask you a question or two.
Just for the change.
Why can't you take a bit of interest in some other body but me?
But I ain't got interested in you.
Only, when you don't talk that's bound to make people wonder.
- Wonder what?
- What you thinking.
You'd be surprised.
I wonder if I would,
I think I can diagnose you all right.
Carry on.
You haven't any feelings at all.
You live in a world of your own, of your own imagination.
I don't know whether I understand you very well.
- Not being so very literary.
- You understand me perfectly.
You still think there's been a bit of dirty work?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Disappointed?
What on earth do you mean, why shall I be disappointed?
Oh, a bit of excitement in a place like this where nothing ever happen, wouldn't it?
But if there has been a murder, it won't go undiscovered long.
- What makes you say that?
- They never do.
They always make one mistake.
That's what you'd think.
What about those you don't know about?
What about the ones who do it and get away with it?
Those are the clever ones, fool the police and everybody.
You take this woman, she's been missing now for two weeks, hasn't she?
They haven't found her yet, have they?
- What was that?
- It's Dora, she's fainted.
I think...
I think they've found something.
Excuse me Miss, might
I use your phone? It's urgent.
Certainly.
- It's right here.
- Thank you Miss.
Shepperley 13.
What's it? What's happened?
I'd rather not saying this, till I've got to, if you don't mind.
Shepperley Police Station?
Who's that? This is Fred Gaston.
We found it. Yes. Right across some rose briars.
Well, not all of it.
Well sir, the head is missing.
Right you are sir.
Thank you Miss, sorry to have troubled you.
You hear that?
- Where you going?
- Going to have a look.
Coming?
I want Keystone 2348.
Yes please.
- What you found over there?
- You better come over here and have a look.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hello, is Justin Laurie there please?
Oh, is that you
Mrs. Laurie, this is Olivia Grayne.
Yes, is Justin in please?
Oh? Do you know where he is?
I see, no, thank you very much.
It's all right, it's quite all right, thank you.
- Olivia, what you doing here?
- I've got to see you, I got to talk to you.
Is anything that matter?
You look so strange, where is your hat?
Can't we go somewhere, somewhere we can talk?
Here, come on here.
Hi there Laurie, good show.
Olivia, what's it?
Darling tell me.
My dear, your hands are like ice.
- Justin, they found her.
- Found whom?
The missing woman, she's been murdered.
They found the body in the woods near our house.
Olivia.
It's not all, there's more to it than that, her head...
- But who...?
- I don't know...
I don't know, I just came running here to you.
My poor darling, how horrible for you?
- Have they no idea?
- I don't think so, none.
- Well, you can't go back there.
- Oh no, no I can't.
They're drawing stumps in half an hour.
I'll take to town to mother's, you may stay with us.
- Oh, may I?
- Of course you may, as long as you like.
Forever if you want to.
Oh, Justin, you're very good to me.
I'm only sorry it's a thing like this that give me a chance to be.
I do love you so Olivia.
You know, I'd never seen you without your glasses before.
You're very beautiful.
But suppose I'll give mother a call and tell her to expect you.
- No, no don't.
- Why not?
I can't come, I must go back.
But why?
Well I, I can't leave
Mrs. Bramson there alone.
Well she's got, what's his name, that boy hasn't she?
- He is all right, isn't he?
- Oh, yes, yes he's all right, he, well...
I mean, you know, running away like this they may think I did it.
You can't Olivia darling, that be ridiculous, it couldn't been anyone in your house.
No, no, that's right, couldn't have been, could it?
Hey, there's something more behind all this, what's it?
Oh, nothing really, I...
Oh Justin, I shouldn't have come running off to you like this I lost my head, that's all.
I'll be all right now.
Oh, Justin, take no notice of me.
Tell me all about the match.
That was a good boundary you hit, how many was that?
- Six.
- Oh, that's fine, fine.
Now young man, you came over here the day after I saw you at the Tall Boys, is that right?
That's right sir.
You never told me you thinking of making a change.
I didn't know it myself sir that was the first day I call here and Mrs.
Bramson asked me to come and work for her.
- Ma'am, did you know him before?
- No.
- You take up any references?
- I didn't need any references.
I talked him, that's enough for me.
- What you trying to suggest?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.
- Only it seems an odd coincidence...
- Nothing odd about it.
The boy came to see my maid, they going to be married.
- First I've heard of that.
- That's good news anyhow.
Oh, it's awful, awful asking all those questions.
I am not going to stay here any more.
If you run away now they'll think you did it.
I never thought of that.
They'll set the bloodhounds on you, that's what they'll do.
Oh, dear, I never thought I'd get mixed up in anything like this.
You see sir, this is a lot nicer place for me than the hotel.
But for Dora being her and Mrs.
Bramson being like a mother to me.
Yes, yes, I see.
Well, all right then, at least you didn't make any mystery about your movements.
Oh, there you are. Where have you been all the afternoon?
Oh, good afternoon Miss Grayne, we were wondering what had happened to you.
We was getting quite worried, we was.
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.
I'll have to ask the same questions Miss.Grayne.
Oh, I'm sorry Inspector but I...
I've been to see a friend of mine.
You know what's been happening around here, don't you?
Yes.
You were here when it happened, so Danny tells me.
Then you rushed out to see a friend of yours.
It's true Inspector, I was here when it happened but I...
I lost my head,
I couldn't stay here, I just ran.
Who is this friend of yours?
- Mr. Laurie Mrs. Bramson's lawyer.
- Oh, a lawyer?
Yes, if I can't go to see him as a lawyer, he's a friend of mine.
The only friend I've got, so I went to see him because I was frightened.
- I didn't intend to come back here anymore.
- And he persuaded you to.
- No, no, he told me not to.
- Well then, why did you come back?
I realized that I was being foolish and hysterical.
That I shouldn't leave Mrs. Bramson alone because that would look as thought I...
I don't know, I was so silly to be frightened... so also I came back.
A likely story.
But it's true Inspector, you got to believe that, it is true.
Yes, I believe you.
I know it doesn't sound very sensible but fear makes people do silly things sometimes.
Well, I think that'll be all for the present.
I'm sorry to put you through all this Mrs Bramson but...
- I'm afraid it's only the beginning.
- I can stand it.
Good. Well, I'll be around again and don't you worry Mrs. Bramson, we'll get him.
You've been missing a lot of excitement.
Journalists and photographers.
Mrs. Bramson had her picture taken three times.
I want you to get all the papers in the morning, all of them.
And it wouldn't even be a bad idea to get a book to stick them in.
What you staring at me like that for?
I honestly believe you're enjoying it.
How could you?
Oh, oh, it's you.
What you want?
- What do you want?
- I heard a noise.
- What you doing?
- Making some tea, I couldn't sleep.
Just waiting for the kettle.
Cigarette?
Thank you.
What did you tell that chap this afternoon?
That they found that woman.
Is that all?
Yes of course, that's all.
- What else was there to tell?
- Nothing?
Nothing.
So you just told him that and, and then you come back.
Why?
- What do you mean why?
- Why did you come back?
I told you.
I realized I was being silly to be frightened and I thought...
- Why do you shake your head?
- That isn't why you came back.
- You like that chap?
- What you mean? Of course I like him.
Why aren't you married then?
I don't know what right you have to ask me a thing like that.
Don't be angry, only asked you a civil question.
Why aren't you married?
Hasn't he asked you yet?
- Oh yes, he's asked me but I...
- There you are, you see? You don't like him.
And you're right, you know.
He's not the sort of a chap for you.
You want adventure, don't you?
And it's here, here in this house, here and now in this kitchen.
The two of us alone here.
At this time of night, it's exciting, isn't it?
Something that's never happened to you before.
Being alone at this time of night with a chap like me.
You're not frightened, you're excited.
I can tell you how, your eyes are shining, you got color in your cheeks... and you're beautiful a way he's never seen you.
No, 'I'm frightened of you.
And you feel light as air.
Te same as anybody else for the first time without their overcoat.
We hadn't had a drink but you feel as you have.
You never knew there was such a secret part inside of you.
That's why you come back this afternoon, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
Danny...
Danny.
Now ladies and gentlemen, I want you first of all of to note the beauty... the calm, the solitude of these surroundings.
And then realize that immediately in front of us lies the spot... where this grisly spectacle was uncovered.
Not one hundred yards... from the rose clad, unsuspecting peaceful residence behind us.
Not for one moment did Mrs. Bramson's think.
Mrs. Bramson is the proprietress of the residence.
- Are you talking about me?
- Ah, good morning Ma'am.
I brought another party, remarkable, isn't it?
The interest shown in this lugubrious occurrence.
This ladies and gentlemen, this is
Mrs. Bramson, of whom I was telling you.
- How do you you?
- Pleased to meet you Ma'am.
Nasty thing to hear turn up almost on your own doorstep, ain't it?
Would you mind if I was to take a picture of you Ma'am?
Not at all, is my hat on straight?
Oh and this young gentleman, now employed by Mrs. Bramson... as personal attendant and bodyguard, was... formally a page boy at the Tall Boys hotel... at the very moment the unfortunate victim of this outrage disappeared.
- And now ladies and gentlemen...
- Can you give me your autograph?
If you draw a little closer... you will perceive the exact spot where the body was uncovered.
Ladies and gentlemen, the exact spot.
Here, who you shoving?
A little orderliness is it what we want.
They say it was horrible how they found that body though.
The moment I heard she was missing I said, search the forest.
She's been murdered, that's what I said.
They could knock me down with a feather, grisly, that what it was, grisly.
There's only one word for it, grisly.
I told my poor mother all about it when I got home at night and that's what she said...
How grisly Emily, how grisly.
- Goodbye.
- Bye. Bye.
Dear, oh dear, oh dear, I feel dead.
Don't be a silly old woman.
You don't look a day over forty.
And after I made you a nice cup of tea... you'll be 25 in the sun and 18 with your back to the light, so consider yourself lucky.
Danny, you're a terror.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, what an afternoon?
I noticed a slight falling off in attendance today.
- Sunday I guess.
- Danny, you mustn't talk like that.
- Oh dear, oh dear.
- Well now, there you are.
- Will you take my hat dear.
- Right you are Mum.
And my cape and don't you call me Mum.
If I can't I call you Mum, what can I call you?
Well, if you are very good
I might let you call me mother.
Ok mother of mine.
Oh Danny, you are a terror, he's been acting like this all the afternoon.
- Has he?
- I'll go make some tea.
Mrs. Terrence will get it.
Mrs. Terrence is entertaining visitors at the scene of the crime.
Besides Mrs Terrence can't make tea the way I can.
- I'm an old sailor Miss. Grayne.
- I'm afraid I'm not much interested.
I'll go and see and put the kettle on.
Now hear Olivia, you're downright rude to that boy.
- What do you got against him?
- His manners.
His familiarity.
His manners are great deal more cheerful than yours is.
He's been in rare spirits all the afternoon.
Whiskey, if my sense of smell doesn't deceive me.
Whiskey? It's a libel.
- The boy is a teetotaler.
- Auntie, how do you know that?
He told me so.
And of course you believe everything he tells you.
You're jealous of him my dear, that's what you are.
I know human nature. I know that boy got a beautiful character.
Look at the way the cat is taking to him.
Animals and young children know about people.
Here you are.
Nice cup of tea with two lumps and some of the little cake you like.
Thank you dear.
Danny, let me smell your breath.
Clean as a whistle, smells of pepper mint.
Yeah, there's some in the kitchen.
The murderer committed the crime in the forest.
Probably under cover of night.
The body was nude.
Attempts had been made to, turn to for the next column.
Attempts have been made to era, eradicate fingerprints... with a knife, possibly a butcher's knife... which was...
- What's the matter?
- I forgot it was Sunday.
They're going to church down in the villages.
All got up in their Sunday best.
The organ is playing and the windows is shining, shining on holy things.
Because holy things isn't afraid of the daylight.
But Danny..
But all the time the daylight moving across the floor... and by the end the sermon the air in the church is turning Grey.
And the people isn't able to think of holy things so much anymore.
But only in the horrible things that's going on outside.
Because they know it's still daylight.
And everything is ordinary and quiet.
And today is the same as all the other days.
And it will come to an end.
And it will be night.
Why Danny, you ought to be a preacher.
Now I think I'm going to have my nap, before supper.
Olivia, take this.
Will you wheel me in?
Anything you say, mother of mine, anything you say
I never knew you have so many words in your head.
I speechify like anything when I'm roused.
I used to go to Sunday school and the words come popping into my head.
Hear now, put your arm under little Danny.
There you are, now what am I going to do with this bundle of rubbish.
There you are, lie down now.
Let your feet up and I'll get your pillow.
- Thank you.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Alright.
- I undo your bib and tucker.
- Thank you Danny.
- There you are.
- My, you're so thoughtful Danny.
What is that your wear around your neck? A locket?
It's a key.
The key to your heart? I ought to have that.
Ah, don't be silly.
It's the safe key, I always wear it around my neck.
And you're quite right too, you never know.
Here, let me take your shoes off.
- Thank you Danny.
- Here's one, here's two.
Now, this little pig went to market, this little pig stayed home...
- Don't be silly.
- This little had roast beef... this little pig had none and this little pig wee, wee ran home.
- I wish I can give you tickles.
- You'll be the death to me.
Come on, I cover you all up.
Now, quiet, quiet, you want to sleep now.
Quiet, that's fine, no noise.
That's enough, good night, good night.
- Can I have a read of that?
- If you like.
It's interesting, all this, isn't it?
You have been drinking, haven't you?
- You don't miss much, do you?
- No.
I had a drink and I feel fine.
- You want me to read it to you?
- I'd rather talk.
- Carry on.
- I'd rather ask you a few questions.
Carry on.
Are you sure you were ever a sailor?
Are you sure you weren't a butcher?
Ah, talking daft, doing is the thing.
- But you can talk too.
- Yes, I can.
Did you hear me just now? She's right you know, I should've been a preacher.
I can remember when I was a kid, sitting in Sunday school.
With my mother along side with me and her pointing at the pulpit... and then at me, as if to say, that's the place for you.
I never forgot that,
And I don't believe a word of it.
Neither do I but it sounds wonderful, doesn't it?
I can't remember my mother and I never had a father.
And the first thing I remember is the docks.
And you're the first woman I ever told that to.
So, you can compliment yourself or the drink.
I think it's the drink.
You do live in your own imagination, don't you?
Yes, it's the only way to bear with the awful things you have to do.
- What awful things?
- Well...
I haven't had as much to drink as that.
This is not sort of life for you.
What's it there to it? Tell me that.
What there's to it?
Getting up every morning at seven, washing my stockings... mending them, having breakfast with a bad tempered old woman.
Spend the rest of the day in this... dreary house with her, going to bed at night at half past ten.
- Don't you like the old lady?
- I could kill her.
No, you couldn't. No, not many people has it in them to kill people.
- Oh, no.
- Tell me about your life at the Tall Boys.
My life?
Well, the day didn't start off so good.
With a lot of stuck boots to clean.
And a lot of dirty spoons to polish that is been in the mouths of gaping fools... that looks through me as if I were a dirty window.
Orders orders orders, go here, go there, do this, do that, page, page...
I'm not a page, I'm a millionaire.
And everybody is under to me.
And just when I think I got a bit of peace, there's somebody nagging, nagging, nagging... at me, at me, at me, calls me everything and screams and screams till nothing will shut that mouth only...
Go on.
I'm too smart for you, you'd like to know, wouldn't you?
Why would you like to know?
Why you so interested?
I told you there the other night in that kitchen, didn't I?
- Why were you lying awake that night?
- You were awake too.
Tell me why, you can't sleep, can you?
You can't sleep. There's something in the back of your mind that keeps you awake.
Something you've pushed in the back of your mind that... you can't do anything about and never will.
A little thing, isn't it? A box.
Only a box and it's rather heavy.
The way you was going through my letters the other day... and I had to to laugh.
But the only thing that keeps me awake.
I don't know what to do.
Nothing in the world worries me, nothing worries me.
Only I can't stand a pair of eyes staring at me, with no looking them.
And I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.
I live by myself, you see, inside here.
And all the rest of you can go hang, after I made use of you though.
Nothing is going to stop me, nothing.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Anybody that's there, I'll deal with them.
You watch me.
- Oh hello Dan, how's things?
- How you sir?
- Good afternoon Miss. Grayne.
- Good afternoon.
Now, we haven't scared you out of the house yet I see.
- Not a chance sir.
- No more news for me I suppose
- I afraid not Sir.
- Too bad too bad.
- How's the old girl bearing up?
- Well, it's been a bit of shock for her sir.
Finding the remains of the lady, almost in her garden if you might say.
The remains of the lady? I wish you wouldn't talk like that, I've seen them.
- Well, you see sir, I haven't.
- No thank you.
You know Dan, I don't mind telling you that they reckon the... fellow did this job was a pretty clever chap.
- You don't say so.
- Yes, regular film star.
Got in all the papers, made his name.
If you can make your name without anybody knowing what it is, of course.
Oh yes, yes, of course.
But any really clever murderer... would've taken the trouble to make sure that the body couldn't be recognized.
But here we come and identify first girl, you call that clever?
What do you think?
Well sir, I'm, I'm a slow thinker.
But if it was clever to leave the lady un, un...
- Unidentifiable.-
- Thank you sir.
To leave the lady unidentified... and not be caught has it been more clever... to leave the lady identified and still not be caught?
Why didn't you sleep in your bed on the night of the 10th?
What's that sir?
Why didn't you sleep in your bed on the night of the murder?
- I did sir.
- Oh no, you didn't.
Ah yes sir that's right, except for about half an hour I couldn't sleep for... toffee and I went up the fire escape onto the roof.
- What time was it?
- I don't know, you know how it is.
You wake up in the middle of the night you don't know what time it is.
I couldn't sleep when I was at sea either.
Why didn't you tell us about your relations with the deceased woman?
- What's that sir?
- Now come along old chap.
You were seen by two maids talking to her in the shrubbery.
Well?
Oh sir, it's been in my conscious ever since.
- Oh, then you and she were...
- No, it was nothing like that sir.
I avoided her ever after the first day she stopped me.
But you know how it is, a lady staying at the hotel... where I was working and for all I knew married.
You are only human, aren't you sir?
I mean when you asked me all about it at the hotel I was... frightened to tell about her stopping me.
And now that I've told you, it's a weight off my mind, you wouldn't believe sir.
You see sir, it was the disgust like of... almost getting mixed up with her that was keeping me awake nights.
I see.
- You're bit of milksop, aren't you?
- Am I, Sir?
Yes, well, that'll be all now, I'll let you off this time
I'm that relieved.
But don't try and keep anything from the police another time.
I won't sir.
Oh, by the way, just one thing, just a matter of form.
But if you don't mind, I just have a quick look through your things.
- Just a matter of form, that's all.
- Yes sir.
Well, where you hang out?
In there, first door on the left.
- You can't miss it.
- Alright, I'll find it.
You can't miss it.
This box is locked, have you got the key?
- It isn't mine.
- Not yours?
- No sir.
- Whose is it then?
I don't know, it isn't mine.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that you...
Inspector.
What are you doing with my box?
- Your box?
- Yes, it has all my letters in it.
- But I found it in Dan's room.
- Oh, that used to be the box room.
Oh, I see.
I think I'll keep it in my wardrobe, it'll be safer there.
Oh, I am very sorry Miss, I am sure I am.
- I hope I haven't offended the young lady.
- She'll be alright sir.
Well young fellow, I must be off. You might tell Mrs Bramson I popped in, will you?
I will sir.
- Tell her I hope she'll soon be better.
- I will say, thank you sir.
- Good day.
- Good day sir.
Good...
Danny Danny, take this.
I'm better.
Makes you feel fine.
It's a silly thing to do.
Proper girl's trick, fainting like that.
Do something, it'll do something.
First thing I do, I'll relieve you of that hat box, if you do not mind.
You mind if I go in there?
I don't know what's the matter with you?
You haven't eaten anything either of you.
- Oh, I'm sorry Auntie, I'm not hungry.
- Neither am I.
Must be them peppermints I ate before dinner, sort of took my appetite away.
They didn't take your tongue away, did they?
You haven't uttered a word ever since we sat down the table.
I am sorry, I've a sort of headache.
Headache? Rubbish, at your age? It's imagination.
Oh, what are we doing sitting here in the half light?
Enough to give anyone the fidgets, turn up the lamp.
- And draw the curtains.
- No, no, don't.
Why not?
I don't know why why not, just bring the night nearer, that's all.
What on earth you mean, draw the curtains Danny.
Auntie, will you excuse me I want to go to my room.
- What for?
- I can't sit here any longer.
- You haven't had your pudding yet.
- I don't care for any, thank you.
Well, you can sit and watch us have it then.
I'm sorry, I can't, I just can't sit here any longer.
Oh, it's getting quite chilly.
Get me the little shawl from my room dear, will you?
The shawl dear.
Oh, I'm sorry Mum, in a land of Nod I was.
- Now, what was it Her Highness wanted?
- A shawl.
A shawl. No sooner said than done. Watch me, one, two, three.
Silly boy. Silly boy.
Where you off to?
- I want Keystone 2348.
- Who you telephoning?
Who are you telephoning? Olivia, answer me.
- Hello, is Mr. Justin Laurie there?
- Oh, so that's what it is.
Hello, Justin?
Yes, I've changed my mind, I'm coming up to town, will your mother put me up?
My dear of course.
What's the matter? Anything happened?
Yes but I can't tell you about it now.
I'm coming right up, I'll be there in an hour. Good bye Justin.
Olivia, what is the meaning of this?
Listen to me, I thought I was frightened the other day.
Today, when I saw the light beginning to fail and night coming nearer and nearer...
I felt my fingertips getting cold and I knew for the first time what real terror was.
I'm not a fool and I'm not hysterical... but I can't tell anymore what are things and what aren't.
Day is over and forest is all about us.
Anything can happen. Auntie, you shouldn't stay in this house tonight either.
Very silly of you, trying to scare an old woman with a weak heart.
What have you got to be frightened of?
It's been a murder, you know and the murderer is still about.
Well, nobody is going to murder you.
Besides, we got Danny to look after us.
He is strong as a ox, no silly nerves on him.
- Where is he?
- He's getting my shawl.
It's been a long time.
- Danny.
- Coming Mum, coming.
How you going to get to town?
Not too frightened to walk through the forest, eh?
I'd rather spend the night in the forest than in this house.
That sounds very convincing, I must say.
Well, you can go.
But I'll give you a fair warning... when you come back I'm not so sure that I shall answer the door.
Think that over in the morning.
Morning?
- Whose that at the door?
- My Niece, gone for the night if you please.
Gone? For the night?
Would you believe it? So she's frightened.
Come along with that shawl dear, I'm freezing.
- I don't know what's up with me tonight.
- Then have a chocolate.
Come on, they don't catch me staying here after dark these days.
- Dear, wait for me.
- Oh, I'll be back.
Well, the only way rejoicing.
Everybody seems to be going, what's the matter with you all?
- What we'll have for lunch tomorrow?
- Lunch tomorrow? Let's me see.
How about a nice little steak, with some baked potatoes...
And some of that nice roly poly pudding, with jam on it, the way you like it?
Yes, I think so, yes.
I see, something light, Ok. Good night Ma'am.
- The wood is damp.
- Better get some kerosene.
Danny, do you think Olivia is a thief?
- I shouldn't be a bit surprised.
- What?
- Well, her eyes isn't very wide apart.
- My Goodness, my jewel case.
What a fool I was to let her go and my purse is on the table.
If she's taken anything, I'll have the police after her.
I don't care if she's my niece whether she isn't.
I always hated her mother, as for her father, he was a fool.
Oh, it's you. Slightest thing makes me jump these days.
- Are you going now?
- Yes and you couldn't bribe us to stay?
Oh, It'll be pitch dark in half an hour... and I'm not going to ride through the forest like that, while the murderer maybe lurking.
- I'll go with you, on the other way.
- You going out?
Yes, I feel funny, I have all evening.
- You can't leave her here by herself.
- She'll scream the place down.
I asked this very minute and she said she wouldn't mind.
Says it'll do me good, she won't hear of me staying.
- There's no good arguing with her.
- You telling me.
You have a nice long walk while you get the chance.
We wait on her too much.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night Dora, see you in the morning.
It's nothing missing.
The lock is broken, there marks all around.
Talking to my self.
Where is that boy?
Getting kerosene I suppose.
Wish people wouldn't walk out like that, leave me high and dry,
Where are my chocolates?
Oh, there they are.
What was that?
Danny?
Danny...
Clock.
Danny.
What's that boy doing in that kitchen?
I think have the jitters.
I've got the jitters
I've got the jitters Danny...
Danny.
Danny.
He's gone.
They've all gone.
They've left me here alone.
Heavens help me a poor old woman.
Oh Danny.
Danny.
Danny Danny. Danny. Danny.
Danny...
Be quiet.
What shall I do? Danny. Danny.
Danny, where are you?
Where are you? Danny Danny...
There's something outside.
Oh, Heaven help me.
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them...
Danny. Oh...
It's all right, it's all right.
No, no, no, it's alright, it's alright.
I will never forgive you..
- No, it's all right, no, no please please.
- I will never forgive you Danny.
Alright, wait a minute...
Here you are.
- I don't want any, I don't want any.
- Come on.
Take a little bit, take a little bit.
That's fine, take a little, I'm so sorry.
Dora and Mrs Terrence wanted me to take them down Main road because they was frightened.
I'm sorry now, that's better, isn't it?
- Not yet, give me some more.
- Yes, here you are..
All alone, all alone I was in the world.
Just an old woman crying for help and no answer.
- No answer.
- A poor old woman crying for Danny.
That's better...
There...
Oh Danny, the relief when I saw your face.
I'll bet you wasn't half glad.
You're the only one that understands me, that's what you are.
I don't have to tell you what I've been through.
I don't have to tell you about my husband now, how unkind he was.
Yes I know...
- No, you don't.
- Yes I know Mum.
That's better, that's better.
Oh Danny, Oh Danny...
Danny dear, you, you remember that time.
You spoke to me about my reminding you of your mother
I remember.
They can say what they like but that was a beautiful thought.
When I think you're just an ignorant boy, it's startling.
I'll never forget it, not as long as ever I live.
That's better, isn't it? That's better.
- I want some chocolate now.
- A chocolate, a chocolate.
One of the little ones, with the violet on top here.
Here you are.
No, no, open your mouth and close your eyes and see what the Queen is got for you.
Silly boy.
You're the only one who understands me Danny.
The only one that understands but what you doing?
- Just playing, just playing.
- Oh no, this is silly.
Great strong hands they are.
You're a pet, my little chubby face.
My little Baby Face, my little Danny.
- Am I in a draft?
- Just a minute.
- I got to take care of myself.
- You have?
- Come now.
- You have?
- I'd like to go into my chair now.
- I'll get you the chair.
There you are, easy does it, easy does it. That's fine, there you are.
Time for bye-byes, time for bed with you.
You're a sleepy girl tonight.
Sandman is coming for you.
Sandman is coming for you.
Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top.
When the wind blows the cradle will rock.
- Danny...
- The cradle will fall.
And down will come Baby, cradle and all.
Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top.
When the wind blows the cradle will rock.
Well, now breaks, the cradle will fall... and down will come Baby, cradle and all.
What a funny look on your face dear, smiling like that.
You look so kind.
So kind.
What you going to do with that?
You killed her, you killed her.
I've never seen a dead body before.
You killed her...
Didn't you?
Didn't you?
Oh, why don't you say something?
Why did you come back?
- Find you out.
- No, that isn't why you come back.
Isn't why you came back the other day either.
Yes, it was, it was. I had to find you out.
Now I have.
You come back here to be alone with me.
The same as you was there in the kitchen the other night.
Didn't you?
Didn't you?
Yes I did, I thought I wanted to.
I never knew before what murder was like.
I thought there was something, something about you that I...
Even after that, when I saw you were frightened, I was sorry for you.
Must been out of my head.
You're loathsome.
Loathsome.
- You sit there looking happy.
- Why not?
Look.
But this is my chance, my big chance.
You're the one I can tell about myself.
- They'll catch you, they'll find you out.
- Oh no, they won't.
There's one big difference between me and the others fellas that tries this game.
I'll never be found out, see?
Because I don't care that.
You don't know me, do you?
I'm sick and tired of hearing how clever everybody else is.
I want to tell them how clever I am for a change.
Money I'm going to have and people doing what they are told and me telling them to do it.
There was a woman at the Tall Boy, wasn't there? And she wouldn't be told, would she?
And that old lady, treating me like a son and a servant at the same time.
She's been more use to me tonight... than she's ever been to any other body as long as she lived.
The world is got to to hear from me.
You wait.
You can't wait, can you?
What do you mean?
Well, when I say I will never will be found out...
I mean that no living soul will ever be able to tell any other living soul about me,
Can you think of anybody who might go tomorrow and tell the police?
- I can.
- No, you can't.
Why can't I?
Well, I'm up against a very serious problem I am.
But the answer to it is simple as pie to a fella like me.
Simple as pie, there's no use looking at that telephone.
The wire is been cut.
The old lady isn't going to be found tomorrow morning.
And maybe she won't be the only one missing.
Perhaps the house will be going too.
The house and both of you gone, gone.
Aren't you frightened?
Don't you think I'll do it?
Yes, yes, I know you will.
But I'm not frightened,
I don't know why but I'm not.
I suppose it's because I'm seeing you for the first time...
- and realizing what an escape I've had.
- Escape?
You can kill me, daresay you would anyway.
At least now I know what you are.
I know what you're like, mad, mad and horrible.
And to think that I was...
Oh, I'm glad that I came back, I'm glad.
You know I made up my mind about you just now when I was telling you about myself.
That's the kind of a fella I am, I make up my mind about something and then I do it.
Remember the first day I come here?
I said to myself when I first saw you... there's a young lady who's got her wits about her.
There's a girl who knows a thing or two... she's not like the others, she's got...
What's that light?
It's somebody out holding a flashlight.
Somebody is watching, they've got no call to watch, I'm the one that watches.
I'll tell them, I'm the one that's watching.
Eyes, hundreds of eyes back of each tree. Thousand of eyes.
What happened?
Like the sound of a big wall falling over into the sea.
Everything is slipping on from under me, can't you feel it?
Starting slow and then hundreds of miles an hour.
There's a wind in my ears, a terrible rushing wind.
Everything is going pass me, like telephone poles, everything going backwards.
Everything I ever seen faster and faster back to the day I was born.
I can see it coming the day I was born.
I'm going to die.
Good evening Miss. Grayne.
- Good evening.
- Olivia.
- Oh hello Dan.
- Hello sir.
- Second time today, eh?
- That's right sir.
What's going on here?
Oh, we were just having a bit of talk before went to bed, that's all sir.
How's the old lady?
- Oh, she's fine sir, fine she's gone to bed.
- Gone to bed?
That's right sir, she didn't want to be disturbed.
- Smell of kerosene?
- Inspector.
It's in there.
You know how she's.
She's a bit nervy these days sir.
Yes sir, she. I haven't got round the corner before she begun calling me.
Danny, Danny, Danny, she screamed
Danny that's the pet name for Dan she has.
Yes sir, she. I told her it was dangerous keeping that much kerosene in the house.
I told her it...
I'm sorry to bring you back at this time of night sir.
Oh, that's all right, it's no trouble.
Let's have a look at your hands old chap, will you?
That's better, you better come along quietly.
I'll leave these two men in charge, they'll see that nothing is disturbed.
This is the real thing my boy.
Acting, that's what she said, wasn't it?
And she was right, you know?
I've playing up to you.
I showed you a thing or two, didn't I?
This is the real thing.
You got a cigarette?
Taste funny.
I want something now I've never wanted before in my whole life.
A long walk.
All by myself.
- It's contrary, isn't it?
- Come on.
Will I hang in the end?
But they'll get their money's worth at the trial.
You wait.
Justin, how?
I tried to get you on the phone again, was no answer.
I was afraid something was wrong so
I called the Shepperley police station.
You don't say thank you to someone who saved your life, do you?
Besides it's more than my life you saved tonight.
- My reason.
- My darling.
THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN
For Sale or Would be Let
Help!
Are you hurt?
Where is that candle?
Take, drink a little.
- Huh?
Yes, yes.  Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
That's is enough.
I already feel better.
I freaked out and ve fallen rolling.
What about that? Up there...
Let me go!
Let me go, sir.  I have not been...
What were you doing up there?
The house is uninhabited.
I have to sleep somewhere, right?
I have not stolen anything.
Only, I just wanted to sleep, I swear.
I did not kill, sir.
No, I am not, I am not a murderer.
We'll see that.
Come on up.
-No.
I do not want, I do not want to climb.
I have a terrible fear.
Not go back to those damned climb stairs.
I do not want, for nothing in the world!
Oh. Yes, you are. Come on.
Hey, boss, is it a cop?
What is proposed?  Tell me.
I am going to take a look at the body. Then I will decide.
If not police, ...
... What are you looking for?
-Up.
Hey, ...
... I can think of an idea.
- What?
You go first.
- Come on!
What are you doing down there?
I was looking for you, captain.
Where am I?
Yes, right, yes.
-Come.
One moment.
-Top.
I feel bad, very bad.
Help me, please.
I have not been, I swear.
He had been beaten on the head with an iron, I guess.
Who beat him?  I have not seen anyone in the house.
Who beat him?
Head, Wait.
Wait, do not go.
You sure you do not know anything about this?
Of course not.
Man, if it had, would know, right?
A murder is not easily forgotten, I say.
Okay, I guess.
- Yes?
Well, it was about time.
What do you have in your pockets?
Hole.
- What else?
Look, a handkerchief.
I used to gag.
And this is a string.
I used to tie.
A sausage.
As she bumped her head.
Never mind about that.
I said Never mind about that.
A girl!
Yours?
-Yes.
-Jolly little thing.
Yes.
She was.
Look, here is something more, head, medium cigarette.
I had forgotten, I will take a good bit of smoke.
And what about your pockets, eh?
Okay, okay.  I am not curious, I do not care.
Here.
Take the candle.
Hey, Where are you going?
Swear to be moved.
Let's take a look at your pockets.
Oops!
What the hell he is doing with these bracelets?
A gun!
And it is loaded.
The trigger is sticking.
Got something more worthwhile?
Have you found anything out there?
No, only a little candle.
What is this?
Where do these come from?
I found it on the body, boss.
I do not know what it is.
Have you ever seen a pair of handcuffs before?
No, sir.
Never in my life.  I come from a good family.
We better take a look at this chap.
Hey.
Thank you.
If you are really innocent, you have to play clean.
Hey, it clear that I am innocent.
And why not say that fair play?
The same thing that makes the cop, tangle, entangle, ...
... embarullarlo one to fall ...
... but it is wrong, I have not done anything.
I have not done anything.
It is for up there.  Listen.
Eh, is a girl!
Still, not moving, young lady.  Still, the devil.
Turn the sail, soon.
Have you beaten?
Well ...
Take that.
Very nice, huh, boss?
Let me go.
Where is my father?  Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
What have you done with my father?
What?
What are you doing here?  We seek to help...
... if we count all.
That is.
Now they want to help me after having beaten ...
... as they have done.
-So sorry, lady.
Really.
- Who are you?
My name is Ford Raid and this is...
Hey, what's your name?
-Ben.
-Ben, What?
Clearly, something more, my name is Ben Bold.
I have not done much damage with their hitting, but I am stunning.
But that's not my fault, miss, but the cognac ...
... that has given it to revive.
Thank you.
Tell me, did your father is in this house?
Wait, why not climb onto the roof to see if there is anyone?
Yes.  Ben, you go up.
Why me?
Could you raise, has good legs, right?
You see, my father and I lived in the house next door, ...
... in the number fifteen.  This afternoon ...
... my father went up to his room.
Soon after came a telegram for him and I went to take him.
But I found the door locked.
I called and I answered.
It seemed to me strange and I got scared a lot.
Do you see anything?
Yes.
What?
- What?
Roofs.
- What an idiot!
Are you better?
Yes, I'm alright. Thanks.
Well ...
... I looked for a key that opened the door ...
... and when at last I found it, I entered the room ...
... and there was nobody.
Yes...
I couldn't make it out.
Then, I saw that the window was open and, look, ...
... I found this in the antepecho.
I thought dad would have dropped it.
I went out onto the roof through the window, ...
... gate above the floor, ...
... until I fell for the skylight.
You spend half his life in the soil, Ben.
Have you done wrong?
- Who, me? No.
I was in the war, you know?
A mine took me through the air and got off singing.
And the telegram arrived for your father?
Oh!  We forgot.
Have traced Suffolk necklace to Sheldrake.
Expect him to make getaway tonight. Watch number 17.
Arriving later. Barton.
It is strange, very strange.  I fail to decrypt.
Do you know who this is Barton?
Oh!  The card.
Number-17?
What does it mean, captain?
That surely is going to happen tonight something ...
... at number 17.
How strange!  If nothing ever happens here.
It would be better if you get back to your house.
No, I'm not going.
- You do not want to help?
It is a great help, lady.  I served much.
When coming down the stairs by stumbling around, ...
... do not know how much has helped me.
It was fortunate that he was so close to me.
Otherwise I would have killed him.
We have to go from here, it is too late.
What do you think will happen?
I long now.
Are yielding 12.
No, the 11 and a half.
They are calling, are knocking at the door.
It can be the police.
Damn it, the police.
You better return this.
That gun, whose is it?
Of the corpse.
Corpse?
A corpse!
My father!
I have already got the leg.  Not excite, please, miss.
Not excite, nothing happens.
It was gone!
- Huh?
It was gone!
The salesman said we could visit the house.
Ah, yes!
Yes.
Sure, I understand that it is late.
But ...
... I thought I did not mind.
With your permission.
May I come in too, uncle?
Would not it be better to see upstairs first, uncle?
Yes.
Perhaps it would be better.
By the way, ...
- What?
... we do not know your name.
Were not you told the agent?
Oh yes, ...
... but I am afraid I've forgotten.
Do not be forgotten the name of the seller?
Yes, extraordinary.
In fact, I forgot, my friend.
Well, now that they have seen the stairwells, ...
... Do you want to see the rooms?
Who is that?
Does not it seem a little strange question for someone ...
... who only want to rent a house?
He is right.
Excuse me.
-Excuse me.
It is my servant, in case you want to know, Ben.
Yes?
And the lady is a friend of the family.
It is still not in your house, my friend.
I insist that I would like to see the upstairs.
Insist?
That's what he said, he insists.
Eh!  Eh!  Enough of insolence. 驴Insolence?
Yes, sir, insolence.
Yes, let them go if they want it, boss, ...
... although some meddler.
Come on, look, look up to them to jump the eyes.
What a man so much fun.
Very funny.
Both as a clown.  Come on, get it now.
You're an idiot.
Everything is in order, boss, you will not find the bloody corpse.
It has been a while long ago.
Here there is nothing abnormal, man.
No, of course not.
What were expecting?
Will they find all this full of skeletons, Coffin?
They can remain calm in this beautiful home, gentlemen.
They can keep it forever.
I long now.
One-time, not having such a hurry.
What do you say?  What has not hurry?
You tell me who he is for what I have to do?
I will like lightning.  I am ready to leave ...
... this goddamn house whatever.
You do not know who he is Ben Bold.
Beware!  Beware!
... Take care!
Where do they drew that?
We took off the corpse, boss.
And if anyone tries to stop me, there will be more cold cuts ...
... in this damn house.
- Have you hidden yourself?
Huh?
- Have you been yourself?
What if I have hidden ...?  Me?
Already suspicious of me again.
Why he had to hide it?
In my life I have seen in a mess like this.
I'm scared to death.  I just want to get away from here.
I want to go before they kill me, ...
... as in this poor devil who was lying on the landing ...
... and that is no longer.
Walking dead, girls who fall through the roof, ...
... is too much for me.
Put that down.
Hell, has a gun.
Let me go, let me go!  Let me go!
Oh, my God, did not want to do it, believe me!
I did not even know it was loaded, did not know, no.
Come upstairs.
You too, young lady.
I think I Can manage.
Thank you.
Dude, you are wasting your time.
The lady does not hear.
Neither spoke.
Do you mind?
Hands up!
Recorded in this gentleman.
I guess you do not mind.
Not at all.
One with nine.
What little pasta.
Okay, now you, Ben.
Hey, who has given him permission to call me Ben?
How can I call you?
- Do you like George?
You are a kind nice, I like you.
"I will remember this, Governor.
I will give him a post in my cabinet in the next elections.
What job?
-It will be my secretary.
A sausage?
- Eh, eh, hear!
A bit of careful!
It's wonderful.
I will save it in the pantry for Christmas.
Now the lady.
Remove these hands!
If my father were here, it was going to win.
Let's see what that is.
Of Detective Barton?
Why has the telegram?
-A what you care about.
Miss Ackroyd?
Get Involved in their affairs.
Hey, lady, you better answer to what I ask him.
Are you the daughter of the inspector Ackroyd?
Answer, Miss Ackroyd.
Will save you a lot of problems.
Do you know his father this telegram?
No, came shortly after they left him.
What do you know about a diamond necklace?
Not a word, I assure you.
Did not your father told you about this necklace?
If it makes me more questions, I'm going to spit in the eye.
What are you looking for here?
A-Train.
Who the hell are you?
-His nephew ...
... who was waiting at the door.
Tell me, what has?
Traveling tourism?
Well, something like that.
Now I hope a freight train ....
... it must take to the mainland this evening.
Happens next to this house, right?
Here is my ticket.  Where is yours?
Are you sure that is your ticket?
We left without light.  Let me go, go!
I have not been!  I swear that I have not been me!
Let me go!
- Care, which does not escape!
I want to get away from here!
Damn it!
But why have taken me?
Yeah, yeah, okay, I am guilty.
I killed a man with a sausage ...
... and then I've done away with the corpse.
Yes, yes, I have been me who has done everything.
I am a dangerous murderer.  Ya know.
I wish I could do the same with you all.
I would do it, I swear that I would do it, if I die them up.
Where did you get?
In the bathroom.
Well, yes, I'm neat.
Today is not my lucky day.
I am a murderer, a apagavelas ...
... and now they want to become a cod.
Now let's talk about the Suffolk necklace.
Do you know where he is?
- How do I know?
Sheldrake only knows what he is the one who has hidden.
Probably in this house.
Yes, and according to the telegram, ...
... it seems that Detective Barton ...
... also know the hiding place.
If such comes through here, we are lost.
Yes.
Well, as it arrives Sheldrake, ...
... forced him to speak clearly. 驴Obligations?
According to my references, Sheldrake is a man very difficult.
Bah!  I do not know him, but I think you exaggerate a lot.
A kind of legend.
He may be dead.
That body ...
I do not think that is easy to kill Sheldrake.
Street.
You are right, it is not easy to kill me.
Are you Sheldrake?
Do you expect the two trains?
And the lady, too.
What about that other partner?
Husmeando were when we arrived.
There is another locked in the bathroom.  Will have been asleep, I guess.
We have to go sooner, the train will pass soon.
Hey, but ...
... And these two?
I do not think we should leave them well.
That would have tied at least, not you think?
Is it necessary?
If you do not want to go running to alert the police.
I hope that no cares, I do not like to do these things, but ...
I love that I care.
Hands behind.
Someone has to monitor the house ...
... when papa铆to goes on a journey.
Sure, there are many thieves, right?
That's it.
Come on down.
A wait.
At last I find you.
- Are you OK?
Is your father?
Yes.
Is it you who was lying on the landing?
Yes, I order to monitor the house.
Is police?
Inspector-Ackroyd.
I know who you are.
-Hurry, we must help Ben.
Who is Ben?
-Run, is in the bathroom.
For you learn to get in no matter what.
Damn, I got screwed.
Now I'll see you.
Quiet.  Where are you going, mate?
Back, come on.
You are a perfect litter.
I'll have to get rid of you as possible.
Hurry, turn to tie it.
Well tied.
Where is the guy who locked us?
I've gotten into the bathroom.  Believed it was me, huh?
I hope no mistakes this time.
Are you Mr Sheldrake?
You are very smart, you know?
What do you think you have done to my father?
Nothing, do not worry.
What's wrong with you?  Do they not know about?
Leave her alone, she is deaf and dumb.
Well, so what are you waiting for?
-Come on.
Down here?
Yes, it's better.
We wait in the cellar.
Do you mind going first?
I will come back.
She spoke!
It was a tale of a deaf mute.
But, in what order?
It's very funny, huh?
Yes, for me too.
Pronto!
Thank you.
Cool...I fainted.
What do you do with those crooks?
Do you think I keep him in my will?
Will he return to his side?
What else can I do?  Has compelled me to accompany him.
Think I know where is the necklace.
I'm very scared.
Why is pretending to be deaf and dumb?
It feels more secure.
Hurry!
May again rise.
Well...
Are you alright?
Let us not waste time.
His father and Ben!
Now you see what is good, thief!
Why did you hit?  Asshole!
-Damn, ...
... I have to get up.  I did not know it was you.
Could you be a little better!
You are well spent.
What a pair of cake!
Hit his head with the bathtub.
Is bleeding, we have to take you to a doctor.
Is not serious, I take care of him. Pers铆galos.
Agreed.
Come with me, take the candle!
- Again?
My Mother.
What does he want to return to shake off?
What are you going now?
A blow to the head, chief.
The coup will follow us here.
Who would send me to come and sleep in this house?
Damn the time it occurred to me!
I am not going.
Not so dumb, after all?
-What's the idea?
-I am not going.
What do you mean?
I am not going...Thats all.
We must seize the opportunity.
Does not always come out freight trains to the continent.
I have decided to stay and I am staying.
I you are proving very strange.
What is your game?
Why posed as a deaf mute?
Who are you really?  What are you doing here?
Why did not you ask your accomplice?
Okay, it is clarified in the train.  Come on.
Hey, leave them, boss.  I have something to say. 驴Leave?  And that takes women?
No, they will not if I can avoid it.
Ferry with a goods train towards the continent.
The stores we have seen, we&#39;re going to make a visit.
Good night.
-Look at you ...
We do not want to cause inconvenience, but ...
You can not travel on this train, I'm going to stop it.
I suggest you do so, friend, because ...
Come on, let's tie him up, put him in there.
What are you doing here?  How has escaped?
But if you're drunk!
Thank you.
Well, come on, what about it?
What about what?
-The diamonds.
It should be spread, huh?
These cars are like convicts.
Yes, too.
Enough is enough, do not you think?
Keep the hands quiet.
-Come on, Sheldrake, ...
... we know that diamonds are in his possession.
Do you know much then.
-Of course.
Come on, entr茅guenoslos, is a good boy.
Do you think that wearing beneath the hat?
No, but let us see their pockets.
Keep that gun.  Can not see that it is a cop?
Sheldrake may be right.
When you came through the door of that house, ...
... That was the first thing that occurred to me to think.
What stupidity!
-Stupidity, huh?
M茅tal early in the cabin.  Can not see anything that is less ...
... that Detective Barton?
Very smart, Sheldrake, but you will not escape with that necklace.
I have already escaped!
Dirty cheat!
Give me back the collar!
- Me?  If you do not have.
So what has that fake deaf and dumb ...
... that you came.
-No.
Hello.
Give me the necklace right now, charm.
What I am talking about?
Let&#39;s leave of comedies.
Ya, now is going to tell me what you've been suspecting all night.
Yes, I'm a cop.
- What?
Well, now you know what?
I do not have.
For something you have been with us.
I know the necklace as well as Ben.
If I came because I have had been forced.
Hey, listen ...
I have no choice but ...
... to register them.
-Come on, boss, is not well ...
... do that with a lady.
Hey, leave it, what do I have the necklace.  Look, here it is.
Stop, we're going to crash.
So we're going to crash.
- Stop!
Where did you have gotten to know if you can?
Good.
Joe, look at that.
What are you doing?  Out of there!
-Come on, shoot at once!
-I'm going to blow the whistle.
Salta.
Come on, keep on going!
That's it.
We must stop the train.
How will it be?
That valve.
What does it mean?
"I have discovered.
Do you know and who I am?
-No.
Who is it?
It is a detective.
Yes, actually, I'm Barton.
Are you sure?  Does the famous Barton?
Yes, I have been following the trail to Sheldrake ...
... and the collar Suffolk for weeks.
And it has found?
No, but ...
... I have the lady who is almost the same.
The lady, ...
Mr Barton ... ...
... does not have anything to do with that.  Did you know?
On the very police that is, I will say that is exceeding.
Let it settle in my way.
Okay, but let's ...
... that you will not be called Barton, but Doyle.
What about Doyle?
Ladronzuelo is a smart, Doyle, but he has committed two errors.
The former believe that the police would just go behind the necklace.
They also went behind you.
- From me?
Yes, they knew the same way that the necklace would attract Sheldrake, ...
Sheldrake ... it would attract you, Henry Doyle.
You are mistaken.
- Really?
And the second, more serious, ...
... has been done through detective ...
... and just by Detective Barton.
The funny thing of all is that I am Barton.
Bad luck, Henry.
Good evening, ma'am.
What a pint!
Good night.
-Goodbye, Henry.
Hey, so you're a detective really ...
... and I know without a word.
Well?
Well?
What are you going do about it?
What are you going do about it?
You better come along with me.
But ...
... Where?
Perhaps a breakfast.
Do I leave in freedom, captain, ..
... in exchange for a nice wedding gift, eh?
Hold it!
Now, take this. Get this in here.
- Now, watch it.
- Easy now.
That's it.
Hold it. Hold it!
Right.
- Easy now.
- Careful.
- That's it.
- All right, take it to the laboratory.
Let me take it a while,
Professor Arnold.
No, stand back.
Stand back.
Come on.
Let's bring it out.
That's it.
Okay, move.
Come on, up. Come on.
Take it away, old boys.
Ali.!
Ali, what is it?
Dead.
Stand back, everybody. Stand back.
Edfu Ahmad, a light.

Nay! I am the best son of my father.
I supply all things for this noble gentleman.
I am first-rate service.
Contradiction, please.
For past two hours, have not supplied drink.
Drink? You want a drink?
I'll give you a drink.
- Kind of a strong one, though.
- Pardon, please.
For water to soothe dry throat.
- Would happily give much baksheesh.
- Ah! Baksheesh! Two.
You mean you'd give two bits for just some plain water?
Drop of plain water on thirsty tongue... more precious than gold in purse.
Mr. Tom and them got plenty of water in their tent down yonder.
- Here, I'll go get it for...
- Ah! Baksheesh!

I don't know. This fortune-teller down in Mississippi... says this here country where all my folks come from.
- Yes?
- And then Mr. Tom... he done won me in a crap game.
I come along to kind of look 'em up.
Reverence of ancestors most commendable.
Sir, there's Mr. Tom and them over here.
Mr. Tom, this gentleman, he wanted to know...
So sorry to intrude, but would much appreciate glass of water.
Oh, of course.
Snowshoes, water.

Oh.

But Father...
He isn't here.
If you're looking for mysteries, you've come to the right place, Mr. Chan.
Miss Arnold has one all ready for you.
Dad went away over a month ago.
We've heard from him only once since he left.
I know it must sound foolish, but I have the strangest feeling something's happened to him.
He hasn't been himself since he opened Ameti's tomb.
She's just making a mountain out of a molehill.
Insignificant molehill... sometime more important than conspicuous mountain.
Professor Thurston, your uncle, he is here, perhaps?
No, he's in Luxor.
We'll wait till the sun drops, then we'll all drive in together.
Thank you so much.
- Right through the garden.
- Thank you so much.
- Stick around, Snowshoes.
- Yes.
My brother Barry.
Beauty of Egyptian night captured in simple melody.
Those native things are all right for a while... but one of these days,
I'm gonna send home for some jazz.
The old maestro stuff.
Yowzer!
Good evening, Edfu Ahmad.
Has Uncle John returned?
He's in the laboratory, but he heard your arrival in the car... and will be up in a moment.
- Oh, Edfu?
- Yes, Miss Arnold?
- Will you ask Nayda to bring some cigarettes from my room?
- Certainly.
- Here, have one of mine.
- No, thanks. I prefer my own.
We'll go into the study,
Mr. Chan.
- Smoke?
- Do not indulge.
Confound it.!
I've lost my glasses again.!
Edfu Ahmad.!
You mustn't mind if Uncle John seems a bit angry, Mr. Chan.
He'll be all right when he gets his glasses.
Ah. I thought I heard that old rattle-trap of yours drive up, Tom.
It's enough to wake the dead.
When archaeology pays bigger and better dividends, I'll get a new one.
Uncle John, this is Mr. Chan.
- Professor Thurston.
- How do you do?
- So pleased.
- Mr. Chan wanted to see Dad.
- I've explained he's away.
- Oh, yes.
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.
- Was it on a matter of importance, Mr. Chan?
- Most important.
Business with
French Archaeological Society.
Oh, then perhaps
I can help you.
- I'm in charge during my brother-in-law's absence.
- Oh.
Then will come to point quickly.
Matter concerns valuable items...
taken from tomb of high priest Ameti.
In, uh, just what way,
Mr. Chan?
Archaeological Society... financed Professor Arnold's researches...
with understanding that all objects taken from tomb... with exception of those claimed by Egyptian government...
become property of Society Museum.
That's quite correct.
Everything taken from the Ameti tomb... is now in course of cataloging in preparation for shipment.
Correction, please.
Valuable items taken from tomb... discovered six months ago... now in possession of private collectors... and rival museums in Europe.
That's impossible.
Pardon, please.
Here are photographs.
This necklace with identifying seal of Ameti.
This ring of Ameti...
now in Berlin museum.
Then they're imitations.
Why, we have a native craftsman,
Edfu Ahmad...
who can duplicate things like those so closely... that even an expert can't tell the difference.
Pardon, effendi.
Your glasses.
Is that all for tonight?
Yes, you may go.
I'm sure they're imitations, Mr. Chan.
Experts have identified necklace and ring as genuine.
Do you mean that the Society is accusing my father?
So sorry, but Society demands explanation.
On what grounds? They withdrew their financial support before the tomb was located.
I-I-I question their right to investigate anything.
Contract very plain.
Items from Ameti tomb property of French museum.
Must locate Professor Arnold.
Well, I'd be glad to try again, Mr. Chan.
Our last communication came from Napata on the Upper Nile... saying he wished to be undisturbed in his present work.
- He ignores our letters.
- Which isn't like Daddy at all.
Articles from Ameti tomb are here?
Yes, in the laboratory.
Would you care to see them?
Much interested.
Carol, perhaps you'd better go to your room, dear.
- She doesn't like our work, Mr. Chan.
- I hate it!
It's taken my father away from me.
- Something's happened to him, I know it!
- Please, dear.
Can't you help me find him,
Mr. Chan?
You must. You've got to.
If possible, will be most happy.
There, there, there, there.
Let Nayda take you to your room, my dear, hmm?
I'm-I'm sorry.
Good night.
And thank you, Mr. Chan.
She's quite upset, Tom.
- Perhaps you'd better phone for Dr. Racine.
- I think so too.
The laboratory's below,
Mr. Chan.
Thank you so much.
A few of the more important items are here, Mr. Chan.
The rest are in the storeroom.
I'd be glad to check them with you at your convenience.
That would be most helpful.
X-ray machine?
We have the most completely equipped laboratory in Luxor.
This is a radiograph of Ameti.
Very interesting.
Hands crossed in final sleep.
Yes.
Egyptian goddess?
That is Sekhmet, goddess of vengeance.
The ancients endowed her with many supernatural powers, Mr. Chan.
Mmm.
Cannot believe, uh, piece of carved stone contain evil... unless dropped on foot.
- Strange you should say that.
- May I ask why?
That's how Miss Arnold's brother nearly met his death 10 years ago.
Oh. Ameti?
This case holds all that remains of one of the most powerful priests... of the 21st Dynasty.
- Case has not been opened?
- No.
You see it just as we found it.
- Very strange.
- What do you mean?
Varnish on 3,000-year-old mummy case... not completely dry.
I don't understand this.
Perhaps case has been opened.
That's hardly possible, and yet...
You're right, Mr. Chan.
It has been tampered with.
Would be most interesting to see inside.
- You mean open it?
- No, I wouldn't dare, not without Professor Arnold's permission.
He'd never forgive me.
X-ray machine most useful for seeing where eye cannot reach.
I'll get Snowshoes to give us a hand.
See, I could carry you back to Mississippi with me.
And you don't have to worry about no jobs there...
'cause I know a lot of white folks who could keep you workin'.
- Hey, Snowshoes?
- Sir?
- Come on in here. Make it snappy.
- Yes, sir.
You go on now, kitten.
I'll be seein' you maybe tomorrow night.
It's all right with me.
I'll be seeing you anyhow.
Want somethin' outside with me, Mr. Tom?
- Now, give us a hand here.
- I know, but...
- Do as you're told.
- But I don't know much on touchin' dead things.
Now, slide it this way.
Now the feet toward the fluoroscope.
Good. Now, lift.
Lift. Lift.
Slowly.
Now, lower the feet.
Lower them.
Be careful.
Down. Now, raise it.
Raise it.
Mind the frame.
Turn it.
- All set?
- Wait till I put the lights out.
Can't we see better with the lights on?
Quiet, and don't touch anything.
No, sir,
I ain't touchin' nothin'.
Here we go, Professor.
That's Ameti, all right.
See? There's the identifying cartouche suspended around his neck.
Very interesting.
Please.
May display ignorance of Egyptian history by asking question?
Certainly.
Did high priest die natural death?
The Ameti records indicate... that he kicked off peacefully at the ripe old age of 78.
Contradiction, please.
Ameti die very violent death.
How do you figure that?
Observe.
Modern bullet clearly revealed near heart.
- Say, that does look like a bullet.
- That settles it!
- What are you gonna do?
- Open this case.
Can I go now?
No. Get busy.
Haul it down.
But I don't feel so good.
All right now. Come here.
Lift the lid off.
- I'm not prepared for nothin' like this.
- Put it over there.
Let's get it on the table.
All right now.
Professor Arnold!
Look here, Professor, you're not gonna say anything to Carol about this, are you?
Confound it!
The current's off again.
- Hey, Mr. Tom, lookee yonder!
- Look at what?
Miss Sekhmet see us.
That was Carol!
Hey, Mr. Tom, wait a minute!
Nayda!
- I'm all right now.
- Mistress will take medicine?
No! Take them away!
They don't help me.
They never make me sleep.
Dr. Racine says they are helping you.
What happened, Carol?
I was writing a letter to Colonel Bailey at Napata... asking him if he wouldn't try again to locate Father.
- Mm-hmm.
- And suddenly, my hands became icy cold.
My cigarette dropped to the floor.
As I stooped to pick it up, everything seemed to stand still.
I was frightened.
I tried to cry out, but I couldn't.
It seemed as though
I were drifting into space.
I got to my feet.
I must have...
for the next thing I knew,
I was standing in the middle of the room.
And then I saw it, its horrible head coming toward me out of the darkness...
the head of Sekhmet.!
But, Carol, dear, it could only have been your imagination.
Of course, Carol, dear.
It was only your imagination.
I suppose it was only my imagination when the wall of Sarkari's tomb gave way... and crushed me beneath it!
- Be quiet, will you?
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
I'd forgotten. You are the courageous type who doesn't recognize fear.
- Well, I'm not, and neither is Carol!
- Be silent!
A dozen others have died from opening the tombs. Why shouldn't we?
Barry, please!
You know what
I'm talking about, don't you?
It's all our father's fault.
He is the one who brought us into this land of decay and death!
- We hate him for it.
- It isn't true.
Why pretend?
You know you hate him as much as I do.
Barry, come with me.
Why doesn't Father take us away from this dreadful place?
Try to rest, dear.
A good night's sleep will do you a lot of good.
Oh, Tom?
Would you mind staying with Barry for a little while?
- Certainly not.
- Thanks.
Oh, Doctor, come in.
Come in.
- How's Carol?
- She's... She's had a terrible shock.
- A repetition of last week's experience.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, Dr. Racine, this is Mr. Chan.
- How do you do?
- So pleased.
- A most tragic thing happened tonight, Anton.
- We found the...
- Excuse, please.
Suggest Miss Arnold now more important.
You're right, of course.
She's in her room.
Pardon me.
Mr. Chan,
Professor Arnold's death... throws an entirely different light on the matter of your business in Luxor.
Yes?
I did dispose of those items of the Ameti tomb.
You see, after the Society withdrew its support...
Professor Arnold needed funds to carry on the work.
He borrowed heavily from Dr. Racine... who, after the tomb was finally located... quite naturally felt he was entitled to a share of the finds.
Arnold was an archaeologist, not a businessman.
And with the existing complications of his contract with the Society... the only solution seemed to be that I dispose of a few of the less valuable items... enough to pay part of his obligation to the doctor.
A decision had to be made, so I assumed responsibility.
Why did Professor go away?
He was furious when
I told him what I'd done.
Meanwhile, having found evidence of a royal burial ground at Napata... he decided to attempt locating the tombs... feeling that if he turned over their contents to the Society... they would be amply compensated for what they'd lost from the Ameti finds.
Most commendable.
I'm frightfully worried about Barry.
Now, you're not to worry about anything except getting a little sleep.
There.
That's better.
If Miss Arnold isn't asleep within the hour, give her another of those powders.
- Yes, effendi.
- Good night, my dear.
Good night.
You say obligation to Dr. Racine not fully paid?
When Professor Arnold went away,
Dr. Racine kindly consented...
to extend his note another 90 days.
May I inquire what right this gentleman has to ask questions... regarding a purely personal matter?
Mr. Chan represents the
French Archaeological Society.
And how does that concern me?
Every detail most important where murder concerned.
- Murder?
- Professor Arnold is dead.
- I don't understand.
- Circumstances very mysterious.
Body found in Ameti mummy case with bullet near heart.
That bullet was not the cause of his death, Mr. Chan.
No? Please explain.
There was trouble with the natives a few days after the Ameti tomb was opened.
Professor Arnold was wounded.
- And the bullet not removed?
- No.
Why not?
Examination disclosed it was too near the heart to risk an operation.
- Perhaps I'd better...
- Please.
- Must touch nothing until after autopsy.
- Very well.
Why should anyone have committed such a fantastic crime?
Very strange.
Were it not for bullet in body...
might almost believe in power of ancient goddess.
It's my father.
He's dead, isn't he?
- Yes, Barry.
- I knew it.
I've known it ever since he went away.
He discovered the secret of Ameti's tomb... and the dark waters of the forbidden places... carried him to his death.
Barry, what nonsense is this?
He ignored the warning, and it destroyed him... just as it will destroy us all!
Here, here.
This won't do.
Pardon. Must go.
But first, may have letter of Professor Arnold from Napata?
Why, yes.
I...
I have it here.
Thank you so much.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Chan.
- Am so sorry.
- I'll drive you into Luxor.
- Oh, thank you so much, sir.
- See you in the morning, Professor.
Why not put up with me while you're here?
I have plenty of room.
Have, uh, got extra pajamas?
You bet I have.
Then will be most grateful for hospitality.
- Well, here we are.
- Thank you so much.
Yes.
Egyptian night now most peaceful.
Make yourself at home while I round up those pajamas for you.
- Size 52, please.
- You'll take what I've got and like 'em.
Thank you so much.
- May make notes on writing machine?
- Sure, help yourself.
You'll find some paper in that left-hand drawer.
Thank you.
How are these?
Make Charlie Chan look like zebra.
This is your bunk next to the wall.
With back to wall, can fight off demon of sleeplessness.
What's the matter?
Can't you read your own writing?
- Something here very strange.
- What?
Professor Arnold go to Napata four weeks ago?
Yes.
According to date, this letter written two weeks ago.
- That's right.
- But Professor dead before letter written.
Huh?
Still more strange.
Letter written here on your machine.
Now, wait a minute.
After all...
Observe, please, similarity of type.
Say, they do look the same.
Man who write that letter kill Professor Arnold.
It looks kind of bad for me, doesn't it, Mr. Chan?
Reports of Society indicate you were discharged by Professor Arnold.
Yes, we did have a little argument about the Ameti hieroglyphics.
But Professor Thurston took me back again a few days later.
Who, beside you, use writing machine?
Well, Thurston, Barry,
Edfu Ahmad, even Snowshoes.
- We all do.
- Edfu Ahmad. He is Egyptian?
According to him, a direct descendant of Ameti.
Young Mr. Arnold mention secret of Ameti tomb.
- Tomb has secret?
- Not that I know of.
You see, the records indicate that Ameti was supposed... to have collected the mummies and the royal paraphernalia... of the 20th Dynasty pharaohs for safekeeping.
Professor Arnold thought that he had discovered the treasure when he opened the tomb.
But it didn't pan out that way.
He was still looking for it at the time he disappeared.
- Would much like to see Ameti tomb.
- Tonight?
- Waiting for tomorrow waste of today.
- Let's go.
As usual, the battery's dead.
Hey, Snowshoes?
- Huh?
- Bring your flashlight. We're going to the tomb.
Now? Tonight?
Yes. Make it snappy.
All them hants.
Why don't you let 'em sleep nights?
Gettin' 'em all stirred up.
No wonder they get so mad and kills folks.
Somebody looking for you, you wouldn't be there to calls yourself.
- Come on, Snowshoes.
- Yes'm.
- There your light, Mr. Tom.
- All right, give us some of it down the steps.
What do you want me...
There.
- After y'all, gentlemen.
- Go on!
But y'all comin' too, ain't ya?
- Yes. Go ahead.
- Okay.
Hold that light still so I can see the lock.
- Yes'm. I'm just so cold-like.
- Yeah, you act like it.
All right. Turn on the power.
Ameti tomb equipped with modern convenience.
Nothing too good for old Ameti.
This is the anteroom where we found a few important pieces.
But it was in there we made our real discoveries.
The mummy case was in this stone sarcophagus.
Very interesting.
From here, an image of Sekhmet kept watchful eye over old Ameti.
All the good it did him.
- Yes. And that?
- Oh, that's the storage room.
In here, we found Ameti's chariot... and his bed, and a whole raft of personal effects.
Even an alabaster jar that still carried the odor of the perfume it had contained.
Also very interesting.
Uh, another room?
No, that's just an unfinished passage.
Ameti probably died before his tomb was completed.
- Now what?
- I wonder!
- Snowshoes, snap on your flashlight!
- Yes'm.
- But something done knocked it out of my hand.
- Well, find it.!
Yes'm.
Oh, Lordy, there's something in here with us. Look.
Oh, she got me.! Oh, she got me.!
She got me.! Oh, Lordy,
I'm here with this ghost.! Oh, Lord...
- Excuse me, Mr. Tom.
- Get away with that thing!
- See where it went?
- Came in here.
Well, it's a cinch it isn't in here now.
Very strange.
Sekhmet disappear like, uh, Cheshire Cat... of Alice in Land of Wonder.
Stumps me.
Looks like somebody's gunning for us.
As son Lee would say, you telling me.
The powder is a harmless sedative, effendi... prescribed quite regularly by Dr. Anton Racine.
Dr. Racine perhaps buy mapouchari here?
No, no. I do not sell the drug at all.
- No?
- No.
Thank you so much.
Ah.!
Effendi Snowshoes.
Oh, mister, I ain't feelin' so good this morning, ya hear?
Tonight, we go to burial ground... and steal the mummy of your sacred ancestors.
I don't know. But after last night, graveyards, hants and me... gonna be strangers, total and complete.
Hey!
I am first-class servant!
I am best dragoman in Luxor!
- Good evening, effendi.
- Good evening. Professor Thurston in?
He's in the laboratory with Dr. Racine... and the other learned gentleman from Luxor.
The anatomical investigation to determine the cause... of Professor Arnold's death is in progress.
- Other learned gentlemen are police?
- The police, effendi.
Huh.
Thank you so much.
Oh, pardon.
May ask question, please?
Certainly, effendi.
Ancient Egyptians familiar with effects of, uh, mapouchari?
The ancients had knowledge of many things.
Of, uh, mapouchari?
Perhaps so.
I could not say.
No?
Thank you so much.
- Oh, good evening, Mr. Chan.
- Good evening.
- That will be all.
- Your Excellency, may I present Mr. Chan?
His Excellency Fouad Soueida of the police department in Luxor.
- So pleased.
- Pleasure indeed, Mr. Chan... but under unfortunate and most perplexing circumstances.
Cannot read printing in new book until pages cut.
Oh, yes. Professor Thurston has explained... that you have been good enough to interest yourself in the case.
We will be most grateful for the benefit of such assistance... as you may be able to offer.
Very pleased to cooperate.
Am certain matter now in most efficient hands.
Oh, thank you.
I believe that is all for now.
I will make my report at once.
- Good night, Doctor.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr. Chan.
- Good night.
Oh, you have list of articles from Ameti tomb?
Oh, yes. I had Edfu Ahmad prepare it for you today.
If you'll excuse me.
- You have determined cause of death?
- Yes.
There's evidence that a heavy blow at the base of the brain... induced a cerebral hemorrhage.
- Also find small incision at jugular vein?
- Yes.
Made for purpose of draining blood to mummify body.
That seems rather an obvious conclusion.
Conclusion also obvious.
Operation performed by hands of expert.
A sharp knife in the hands of any intelligent person... could accomplish the same thing.
Many intelligent persons afraid even to touch sharp knife.
Bullet near heart removed?
Of course not. Professor Thurston explained last night... that it had nothing to do with Arnold's death.
So sorry.
Memory very bad sometimes.
You have a theory about this, of course.
Theory like mist on eyeglasses... obscures facts.
Our local authorities have very clear vision, Mr. Chan.
- You'll find them most helpful.
- Yes.
Thank you so much.
- Tom?
- Yes, dear?
There's no reason for our staying in Egypt now.
Now, don't you worry.
It's just a matter of a little while until we can get things settled here...
then we'll all be going home.
- Shall I ask him to stop?
- No, please don't.
It seems to take his thoughts off all that's happened.
Tom, I'm worried about Barry.
This superstition of the tomb, it's-it's beginning to affect his mind.
Oh, Carol, I didn't know that you and Tom had returned.
We only took a short walk.
- You won't mind if I go in now, dear, will you?
- Of course not.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- How's she feeling, Tom?
- She's worried over Barry.
He's letting that foolishness about Sekhmet scare the life out of him.
With all that's happened, you can hardly blame the boy.
So sorry to intrude.
Did you find the list of items correct, Mr. Chan?
- Thank you so much.
- Then if there's nothing else this evening...
Uh, please, time now to discuss matter of great importance.
- Yes?
- May ask question, please?
- Certainly.
- Can explain perhaps, uh... effects of drug mapouchari?
Well, the effects depend largely on the individual.
- Yes?
- In general... the victim loses all sense of time and reality.
He suffers from false convictions, hallucinations.
If the doses are sufficiently powerful, death ensues.
That is perhaps explanation.
Explanation of what,
Mr. Chan?
Strange mental condition of Miss Arnold last night.
You mean she was drugged?
Analysis of cigarettes today disclose mapouchari.
- What?
- Surprised...
you did not recognize the symptoms...
which you described so clearly, Doctor.
This is incredible.
Why should anyone do such a thing?
Problem still to be solved.
- Perhaps Mr. Barry has answer.
- What do you mean?
Remarks made last night suggest he know... where father was searching for secret treasure.
That knowledge most dangerous.
Important we speak with Mr. Barry at once.
Very well.
Barry, what is it?
Let's get him to bed, quickly.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
Apparently a violent reaction of the heart... which may be occasioned by sudden shock or terrific fright.
But what could've caused it?
We were all on the patio.
- We saw nothing.
- The gods of Egypt are powerful gods.
Their vengeance has taken
Professor Arnold, and now his son.
What do you know of the death of Professor Arnold and Barry?
Sekhmet's warning was not heeded.
Excuse, please.
Avenging goddess not responsible... for mapouchari in cigarettes.
I know nothing of that.
Well, who supplies cigarettes for Miss Arnold?
Why, you.
You buy those cigarettes.
Tom, call the police.
Don't move, effendi!
The police cannot help you now.
This household is marked for death.
Stay where you are, effendis.
You knew there was danger.
Then you must've suspected this madman.
Why didn't you warn us?
Your carelessness is responsible for that boy's death.
Most regretful.
Impossible to prepare defense until direction of attack is known.
- Shall I call the police?
- Yes.
One moment, please.
May call police if you so desire... but shall continue investigation in own way.
Extend deepest sympathy.
Good night.
I'll be back later.
- Mr. Chan?
- Yes?
What are you gonna do now?
Have curiosity to visit tomb... where goddess Sekhmet mysteriously disappeared last night.
- Let's go.
- Yes.
Hey, Snowshoes, come on with that light.
Yes'm, but I was just seein' if anything was behind us...
'fore it get in there ahead of us.
Go ahead.
Have made search for secret way out?
We've checked every inch of the place a dozen times.
This was the storage room?
Yes.
Hieroglyphics and symbols different from other rooms.
- You know meaning?
- That upper border is Ameti's prayer... to the goddess Sekhmet for protection.
- And, uh, these?
- Merely ornamentation.
The design alternates with the symbols expressing life... and death, and so on across.
Story of man very short.
Life, death.
Life, death.
Am reminded of ancient sage
Confucius who writes, uh...
"From life to death is reach of man."
- Observe?
- That's good logic, all right... but it doesn't get us anywhere.
Most peculiar.
Ghost of Sekhmet disappear in room of mystic symbols.
Try both together.
Mr. Tom, you stirrin' up them hants again.
Is that a grave?
Secret waters which Mr. Barry mention last night.
- Snowshoes, bring the light.
- Yes'm, but...
Say, do you think Barry really knew about this?
Hasty conclusion easy to make like hole in water.
I wonder who that was masquerading as Sekhmet.
Murderer of Professor Arnold who tried to frighten us from tomb.
Observe.
Direction of current indicate...
water flow under rock.
If there's a current, that means this water comes from the Nile.
It's a cinch there's something on the other side.
Good swimmer could maybe dive under, find out?
- Nothing like trying.
- But, Mr. Tom... you oughtn't dive in them hants' swimmin' hole.
- Quiet, Snowshoes.
- Would recommend extreme caution.
Now, don't worry about me.
- Waterproof.
- Thanks.
And you're gonna have to hold your breath you don't know how long.
Well, here goes.
Hey, Mr. Tom, you forgot to take off your wristwatch!
Somethin' must've done happened.
He ain't said nothin' yet.
Professor Arnold.
Why... What do you...
Look, Mr. Chang.
He must've made it all right.
Mr. Tom, that you?
- Mr. Tom?
- Come, please.
Yes'm, but we oughta wait before we know where we goin'.
- Look!
- Mr. Tom?
Tom?
- Is he hurt bad?
- Help, please.
- Must get Mr. Evans to doctor at once.
- Yeah.
Come on, come on.
More.
Oh, excuse, please.
Professor Thurston gone long?
- He went into Luxor to see the police.
- Oh.
- Mr. Chan?
- Yes?
I hope Effendi Evans will get well.
Kind thoughts add favorable weight... in balance of life and death.
Professor Thurston has returned?
No, effendi.
Inform, please, will be in laboratory.
Is he going to be all right,
Doctor?
He has a very good chance.
I hardly know what to suggest, Your Excellency.
Would you care to start your investigation in Barry's room?
All in good time, Professor.
I shall take care of everything.
Pardon, effendi. Mr. Chan is waiting for you in the laboratory.
- Mr. Chan?
- I thought you told him to go.
Will you please come with us,
Your Excellency?
What are you doing here,
Mr. Chan?
Pardon intrusion of unwelcome presence... but have learned something of great interest.
His Excellency will be judge of that.
Most happy to have Excellency's distinguished opinion.
Also of Miss Arnold, if you would be so kind.
Very well, Mr. Chan.
Your prying into our affairs has brought us nothing but misfortune.
First it was Barry, and now it's Tom.
- What's happened to Tom?
- Attempt made on life tonight... in Ameti tomb.
- Two bullets in chest.
- Where is he?
Oh, wait, please.
He's still unconscious.
Dr. Jaipur is with him now in the guest room.
You had no right to expose Tom to such danger.
We looked to you for protection, which you haven't given us.
- I'll have to ask you to leave, Mr. Chan.
- That is already arranged.
- His Excellency is taking charge.
- Thank you.
Regret humble efforts have been unsuccessful.
Admitting failure like drinking bitter tea.
One last request.
Permission, please, to perform simple demonstration?
Thank you so much.
Sealed tube like this could contain enough gas to cause death?
That would depend upon the kind of gas used... also the amount inhaled by the victim.
At time of death,
Mr. Barry playing violin.
Observe hole through which murderer... insert tube of deadly gas into sound box.
All very interesting,
Mr. Chan.
But how could your murderer have broken the tube while Barry was playing?
Murderer very ingenious.
He knew scientific fact... that very thin glass vibrate to certain sound.
Will demonstrate.
While playing, Mr. Barry's face directly over sound vent.
Inhale deadly gas.
Die almost instantly.
You have established motive,
Mr. Chan?
Motive for murders of professor and son very clear.
Of course.
What is it?
Discover hidden room in tomb tonight... also clothing of Professor Arnold.
- Then he did find the Ameti treasure?
- Yes.
And someone else having same knowledge... kill professor to keep treasure for self.
Then when murderer believe... son Barry also know secret, kill him too.
Edfu Ahmad! That explains the ravings about the vengeance of Sekhmet.
Head mask of goddess also found.
Mask used by murderer to frighten intruders away from tomb.
When device fail, murderer resort... to more practical methods... bullets... as in case of Mr. Tom Evans tonight.
Did Mr. Evans see who fired the shots?
Bullet mark on flashlamp prove light focused on guilty man.
- Then I must talk to him at once.
- Excuse, please.
Must not disturb at present.
When conscious,
Mr. Evans will name murderer.
Case now in your hands,
Excellency.
Good-bye, gentlemen.
Thank you so much.
Well, Your Excellency?
It is really a very simple matter.
All we have to do now is to capture Edfu Ahmad... and have, uh, Mr. Evans identify him.
- Oh, Mr. Chan?
- Yes?
If I've been rude, I...
I owe you an apology.
I resented your attitude of suspicion.
I didn't realize how cleverly you were handling this matter.
Thank you so much.
You don't seem to realize you are dealing with a fanatic, a madman.
Edfu Ahmad must be captured dead or alive!
And send a troop of my men here to keep watch outside.
Yes, yes. Immediately.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Your Excellency.
These were in my room.
Thank you. Mm-hmm.
- Pardon me.
- Yes, Doctor?
- Is Dr. Racine still here?
- Why, I think you'll find him on the patio.
Then with your permission,
I shall leave the patient in his care.
How soon will I be able to talk with Mr. Evans, Doctor?
It may be some time before he recovers consciousness, Your Excellency.
Hmm. Then there's nothing to do but wait.
- Good evening, Dr. Racine.
- Good evening.
I trust you understand this emergency required immediate attention...
- and you were not available.
- Certainly.
I'm very glad that Mr. Evans was in such capable hands.
- Thank you, sir. Good night.
- Good night.
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry I startled you.
One of my lancets is missing, and I thought perhaps Dr. Jaipur... might've borrowed it and left it here.
I'm sure I don't know.
Have you noticed any change?
He seems all right.
Oh, he must get well.
Would you mind opening the window a little, please?
Has Tom recovered consciousness?
Not yet.
He has a slight temperature... but that's to be expected.
Then if there's no immediate danger, you'd better get some rest, dear.
- But, Uncle John, I...
- Now, Carol, remember, you've been ill.
Come, let me get you something to make you sleep.
- I'm all right.
- Now, don't worry.
I'll let you know the moment there's any change.
I'll be back shortly.
One moment, please.
Do not move.
Place knife on table.
- Here are your police, Mr. Chang.
- Thank you so much.
- What has happened, Mr. Chan?
- And where did you find that lancet?
It was missing from my case.
Very clever thought... to insert lancet into bullet wound... to make silent only witness who could accuse you.
But what about Edfu Ahmad?
Entirely innocent.
Fanatic devotion to resting place of ancestors...
provide excellent shield for real murderer.
You kill Professor Arnold for Ameti treasure.
You drugged
Miss Carol's cigarettes... to discount anxiety over disappearance of father.
Later, when Mr. Barry appeared to have knowledge of treasure... kill him also to keep secret.
And tonight, shoot Mr. Evans when he recognize you in tomb.
Bullet which wound
Professor Arnold six months ago... and one which wound Mr. Evans tonight fired from same gun... your gun.
Take him away.
You have been very helpful,
Mr. Chan.
Thank you so much.
Most grateful for very able assistance.
It was terrible sitting here waiting... wondering how your plan would work out.
Courage greatest devotion to those we love.
Good-bye, Effendi Snowshoes.
Yes'm, but where you go from here?
Journey of life like feather on stream... must continue with current.
Yes. Sir?
I guess you right, but I'm goin' with you.
- Carol.
- Tom, darling!
That's enough, Charlie.
What'd he do that last mile in, Doc?
You didn't seen any jackrabbits pass him, did you?
Maybe we should've sent him to the Olympic Games instead of his son Lee.
- Yeah.
- If son Lee win 100-meter swimming race... chest expand two inches more.
Well, as long as it's your chest and not your waistline, it's all right.
Show him how you can touch the floor with your fingers, Charlie.
- [Strains]
- [Laughing] That's enough.
Well, you're all right until next year's physical examination, Charlie.
You won't be retired this year.
Hello. Who's going fishing?
Charlie. I'm lending him my tackle.
Do you know what this is?
Sure. That's a Waikiki spinner.
Say, that's a beauty, eh?
But he'll need a good heavy line with that.
What do you think he's going fishing for- whales? He needs a light silk line.
Oh, you're talking through your hat.
What-What line do you prefer, Charlie?
Oh, just piece of string with hook on one end, optimist on other.
[Laughs]
A good combination at that.
But honorable chief recommend latest scientific implement... to catch unwary fish.
Well, good luck to you.
But I know you'll get 'em... even if you have to bring 'em in with handcuffs.
Thank you so much, but this time "fish-hunt," not manhunt.
- [All Laughing]
- Well, good-bye, boys.
Good-bye.
Hey, Pop!
Oh, excuse me. I thought my pop was alone.
How do you do, Mr. Scott?
Well, son, what are you all steamed up about?
Junior son Charlie most anxious to start on fishing trip.
Yeah, and I bought a book on how to catch 'em- The Fisherman's Guide.
Good idea.
If don't catch fish... book provide excellent fish story.
Ah, we'll catch 'em all right.
Gee, that's swell tackle!
Look at it sparkle.
Good fisherman, like clever merchant, know lure of bright colors.
But suppose the fish are color-blind?
[Laughs]
Answer that, Charlie.
Well, in that case, perhaps guidebook give address of good fish market.
But anyone could tell a store fish... because it hasn't got the marks of a barbed hook in its mouth.
Fear number two son, like older brother Lee... develop symptoms of detective.
Ah, I can beat Lee at detecting right now.
- [Airplane Droning]
- Gee, look at that big new plane up there!
That's the Hopkins ship. They're making a test flight for the government... demonstrating a new way of handling a plane by remote radio control.
Oh, I know.
Like they do with battleships... so they can send them out to fight without any men on board.
Would be greatest blessing... if all war fought with machinery instead of human beings.
Hello. Hello.
3,000 altitude.
Shall I switch over to radio control?
No. Wait for instructions.
I believe, Colonel, if we keep the plane in sight of the field in the preliminary test... it'll be better for observation.
That's a good idea, Mr. Cartwright.
Unfortunately, Masters, my regular test pilot, injured his shoulder.
We had to substitute Edwards, and he's not so familiar with the robot.
What is the operating radius of the device, Mr. Hopkins?
That's undetermined.
In previous inventions... transmission of the radio control wave was affected by static.
But in Mr. Cartwright's device, we've successfully overcome that.
We can direct a plane over a charted course as long as the motors function.
Well, it sounds all right.
That's why I'm putting all my resources back of it, Commander. I believe in it.
I know what a powerful weapon it would be in the hands of an enemy.
- That's why I want our government to control it.
- Are you ready, Mr. Cartwright?
Ready. Hello? Hello,
Edwards. Switch over.
Okay.
She's on, sir.
The plane is now under radio control from the board here.
Have you any special test in mind, Colonel?
- Take her to 6,000 feet and bank while climbing.
- Yes, sir.
Look at that plane climb!
It's probably under radio control now.
Remarkable achievement of science- body perform work while brain detached.
I'm sure glad you can't go fishing by radio.
Huh? Gentle hint. Come on.
[Cartwright On Radio]
Hello? Hello, Edwards. How's she riding?
[Edwards]
Smooth as silk, Mr. Cartwright.
There's a strong wind drift from the south, but stabilization is perfect.
Why, Dick, what are you doing here?
I've been watching that plane because
I thought you were up there flying it.
No. I knocked my shoulder out this morning.
I didn't want to risk anything going wrong in the test, so I bowed out.
- But everything will go off all right, I guess.
- Well, I hope so.
Hello, Edwards.
Watch yourself. Power dive.
Okay, let her go.
That's good enough for me.
Pull her up.
Cartwright, she's heading out to sea.
Bring her back.
- She's out of my control!
- The plane isn't out of the pilot's control.
- Order Edwards to return!
- Hello, hello, Edwards!
Edwards! Hello!
The phone's dead.
He's deliberately making off with the plane.
Get out another ship and take after him.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello. This is Mr. Hughes.
Oh, Pan American Airways.
Yes, I'll use my reservation on tomorrow's Clipper for San Francisco.
Thank you.
Calling all United States and commercial craft in Hawaiian waters.
Watch for monoplane, number NC203R.
Report immediately any information to Pearl Harbor Naval Base.
News flash! No trace yet of the plane which vanished mysteriously 48 hours ago.
Were plane and pilot swallowed by the sea?
Or is their disappearance a part of a daring spy plot?
Government agencies are making every effort to solve the riddle...
and expect to have an answer at any moment.
- More later.
- Gee, Pop... they're having as hard a time finding that plane as we are catching fish.
Fish in sea like flea on dog- always present but difficult to catch.
Maybe we'll have better luck here.
I'll take a look around.
Hey, Pop, come here quick!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Right down there. Look.
[Chan]
"NC203R."
Undoubtedly the missing plane.
Run to nearest telephone and notify authorities.
Okay, Pop.
Get a shot over there.
Stand out of the way.
Hey, kids, get down from there.
Will you come in a minute, gentlemen?
There's our answer- deliberate theft.
The ordinary mechanism is intact... but the most important part of the device is missing.
And so is the pilot.
Yes, with an invention any foreign power would pay millions to get.
Instrument could be duplicated without aid of original plan?
Easily- by taking it apart and copying it.
Edwards knew that.
That's why he stole it.
Well, he certainly took a long chance setting the plane down on the edge of the water.
Oh, no, he didn't. Tell him what you found in my fisherman's guidebook, Pop.
Fisherman's guidebook show lowest tide of season... was Tuesday at 11:00 a.m.
Halfhour earlier same day, plane disappear from Honolulu.
With tide out, hard sand beach... make excellent landing field.
But unless there was an accident in landing, how do you account for the fire?
Evidence that device was carefully removed... prove fire started later.
Pilot Edwards wear flying suit while testing plane?
[Hopkins]
No, just flannel shirt and trousers.
Here, Pop!
Tell him about this zipper we found.
Long zipper of type used on flying suit... suggest that plane have other passenger besides test pilot Edwards.
That's impossible. The plane was inspected before it left the field.
No one besides Edwards could've been aboard.
I'm no detective, but it's apparent to me... the pilot stole the device and tried to burn the plane to cover the theft.
He's right.
The man we want is Edwards.
In nearby lagoon have already located murdered body... of unfortunate pilot Edwards.
Gee, Pop, you never told me that!
The idea is ridiculous. No one could possibly have hidden aboard the plane.
I inspected it myself just before it took off.
There you are, Charlie.
- How soon before, please?
- Not more than five minutes.
- Any workmen in vicinity?
- A few.
Possible, then, for man to hide in plane after inspection?
Yes, it would be.
But I'll soon find out.
I'll check every man that was on the field at the time.
- Would you like to question them yourself, Mr. Chan?
- Not necessary.
May examine time cards, please?
Certainly.
I'm at a loss to understand this.
All our mechanics are brought here from the
Mainland. They're old and trusted employees.
Were they all here on the morning of the test?
[Hopkins] No, only the ground crew.
The installation was complete...
and I gave the shop force the day off.
Most strange.
- What is it, Charlie?
- Note.
Stamp of Monday night on time cards, light ink.
But stamp ofTuesday morning in heavy ink.
Well, there's nothing strange about that.
The timekeeper must've changed the ribbon.
Quite correct. But notice peculiar circumstance.
Here is card of one man who finish work on Monday night... yet stamped with heavy ink ofTuesday.
So it is. That proves this fellow stamped his card Tuesday, or somebody did it for him.
Also could establish alibi for man who remain on field Monday night... to conceal self in test plane.
- Whose card is that?
- Name: Miller.
Address: Tropic Hotel.
You're sure Miller didn't sleep here Monday night?
I know he didn't.
But he was here Tuesday... and that's the last
I've heard from him.
Disturb nothing, please.
Mr. Miller have lady visitor Tuesday evening?
I should say not! I don't stand for carrying-on in my house.
Very commendable precaution.
But observe.
Hairs from white fox fur... indicate fashionable lady visitor sit here... while talking with someone opposite.
Well, no woman came in here without me knowing it.
Evident bird of fine plumage escape sharp eye of eagle.
You say you saw Miller on Tuesday night?
Didn't say I saw him, but I know he was in.
I put a telephone call through for him to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel about 8:00.
- Who was call to?
- I don't listen in on my guests' telephone conversations.
Unfortunate not to break rule on this occasion.
Anyone connected with the aviation company live at the Royal Hawaiian?
I do, Cartwright does, and so does Masters.
Masters? Isn't that the pilot who was supposed to fly the test?
Yes.
Presence of wine glasses... suggest hospitality offered to lady of white fox fur.
But not used.
And no wine visible.
I don't allow drinking either.
Excellent reason to conceal forbidden fruit.
Perhaps in closet.
- [Screams]
- Miller!
Unfortunately dead.
And that telephone call to the Royal Hawaiian... involves either Hopkins,
Cartwright or Masters.
What about the gal- the one with the white fox fur?
One more crack, and very bright junior son walk home.
Excuse me, Pop.
Well, whoever murdered Miller stole the invention to peddle to some foreign government.
Quite correct. But Honolulu make very poor market.
We'll check every ship that's put out of here since 8:00 Tuesday night.
Perhaps murderer make more speedy exit- use flying ship to reach Mainland.
The Clipper left here
Wednesday at 2:00... the day after the device was stolen.
- Pan American office.
- Okay, Chief.
Here's the passenger list.
Richard Masters!
- Is that the Masters connected with Hopkins Aviation Company?
- Yes, it is.
Recall if Mr. Masters arrive at dock alone?
No, he came in our car from the Royal Hawaiian Hotel with a lady.
Notice only one lady on passenger list-
Miss Yvonne Roland.
- Wear white fox fur?
- Yes, she did.
Police headquarters. It may not be too late to check on them at the other end.
Hello. Chief Scott speaking.
Contact San Francisco Police...
and ask for a tracer on Richard Masters and Yvonne Roland.
Arrived on yesterday's Clipper.
Hey, Pop! White fox fur.
Now positively walk home.
There's nothing suspicious about Masters leaving on the Clipper.
He's a member of the American Olympic team.
He had to fly back in time to make his boat from New York to Germany.
Well, that seems to alibi Masters.
Then the call Miller made to the
Royal Hawaiian at 8:00 Tuesday night... must have been to the woman.
- But 8:00 Tuesday night Miller called me.
- What about?
His return ticket to Los Angeles.
Our workmen are leaving tomorrow. I asked
Mr. Hopkins to send the ticket to his hotel.
Quite correct. Found same in Mr. Miller's mailbox.
Here. Look at this passenger list.
See if you recognize any of these names.
Yes, here's one. Now I know who's guilty of these crimes.
- Who?
- Arthur Hughes.
He's a notorious filibuster who's made a fortune selling arms... to revolutionists in every part of the world.
From the time I had Cartwright's invention, he's been after me to sell it.
If I'd known he'd followed me to Honolulu...
I'd have suspected him at once.
Charlie, see if you can get any information on this fellow Hughes.
Have already investigated all passengers on Clipper.
For past two weeks, Mr. Hughes guest at Royal Hawaiian Hotel.
[Chief]
That's funny, Mr. Hopkins.
You both have been at the same hotel, yet you didn't know he was in Honolulu.
- Whether you believe it or not, I didn't.
- Excuse, please.
Truth, like football, receive many kicks before reaching goal.
Wouldn't it be advisable to trace Hughes immediately?
That's up to Mr. Scott.
We're leaving on tomorrow's Clipper... and I'll put the matter in the hands of the San Francisco Police.
Coming, Cartwright?
Thank you, gentlemen, for the help you've given us.
I'm not so sure the guilty man isn't walking out right now.
His story about Hughes was altogether too pat.
K.G.P.D. Coming in.
- Hello?
- San Francisco on the air, Chief.
Send it through.
[Man On Speaker]
San Francisco Police... reporting tracer on Richard Masters and Yvonne Roland.
Both left Oakland Airport
9:30 Thursday morning... on transcontinental plane for New York.
Regarding later request on Arthur Hughes... this passenger removed to emergency hospital under influence of powerful drug.
Recovered sufficiently to leave hospital in two hours.
Destination as yet unknown.
That is all.
How did that Hughes information happen to come through?
Took liberty of requesting same.
[Man On Intercom]
Yes, sir?
Contact New York for follow-up on Masters and the Roland woman. Get a tracer on Hughes.
Mr. Hughes now become mysterious needle in hay pile.
Honolulu calling
San Francisco Police.
A follow-up on that Clipper tracer-
Mr. Scott, did you get anything on-
Lady of white fox fur?
That is purpose of visit?
No, sir. I brought you down a pot of tea and some sandwiches.
Oh.
Consideration for paternal stomach most unusual.
Yeah. You know, I've been thinking it over, and I've got a theory.
Oh, you have theory?
Suggest you go home, sleep on same.
Meanwhile advise honorable mother... am waiting for important message from New York.
Okay, Pop.
But I'll bet it's the gal with the white fox fur.
[Both Laughing]
Yes? Here comes the dope on that Honolulu tracer.
Get ready to pass it on to San Francisco.
Yes? They're on the steamship Manhattan.
Your work must be intensely interesting.
You know, shortwave radios always fascinated me.
- Oh, really?
- We get excellent reception in Honolulu.
Oh, I pick up the Islands on the shortwave sometimes.
Well, I wonder-
But you're so busy.
Oh, no, not at all. In fact-
Well, l-I mean, not right now anyway.
Come on in, and I'll see if I can get something for you.
- Two minutes of 9:00.
- [Intercom Buzzes]
[Man]
San Francisco coming in.
San Francisco Police reporting tracer from New York on Masters and Roland.
Here's something now.
San Francisco Police talking to Honolulu.
[Man] Both sailed on steamship
Manhattan for Berlin.
Boat left New York 11:00 tonight.
Regarding other inquiry-Arthur Hughes had reservation on same vessel but missed sailing.
Followed in tug to Sandy Hook and boarded ship there.
That is all.
Oh, that was marvelous. Just as clear as we get it at home. Thank you.
Oh, that's all right, Miss Roland.
It's a pleasure.
- Ah, you're so nice. Good night.
- Good night.
Come in again.
Hughes, Yvonne Roland and Masters-
all on the steamship Manhattan.
Say, that's the boat your son Lee's on... the one that's taking the American Olympic team to Berlin.
The same. Berlin now attract many foreign visitors.
Offer excellent opportunity for spies of all countries to operate without suspicion.
That's the very place the thief could easily dispose of the robot.
Charlie, Lee is going to meet his pop in Berlin.
Well, aren't you surprised?
Suspected same.
Have already sent note in tea basket... for honorable wife to pack traveling bag.
Well, they've got a big start on you.
Their boat docks in Hamburg in seven days.
Race not always won by man who start first.
Please.
Will leave tomorrow in company with Hopkins and Cartwright on Clipper.
Honolulu-
18 hours to Mainland.
Then transcontinental plane from San Francisco.
Thirteen hours across country to New York.
Take Zeppelin Hindenberg from Lakehurst, New Jersey... across Atlantic Ocean to Friedrichshafen, 61 hours.
It's fortunate we haven't been delayed.
We'll be on the dock in Hamburg when the Manhattan arrives.
I still think we should have radioed the steamship to have their baggage searched.
Good hunter never warn tiger of trap.
Oh, observe below- steamship Manhattan.
- Boy, is that some sausage!
- Say, that thing really travels fast too!
- How many people does it carry?
- How should I know?
Gee, would I like a ride in that!
[Woman]
Why didn't they send us over in it?
There's no second class on an airship.
- [All Laughing]
- Oh, excuse me, Betty.
- Oh, that's all right, Lee.
- As my pop would say...
"Man who stretch neck looking up very apt to break neck falling down."
- Have you seen Dick Masters?
- Well, l- Oh, he must be somewhere around.
Now, don't try to cover up. I know.
He's with Miss Roland, isn't he?
Now, Betty, don't you worry about that.
Oh, I'm not.
Don't think I'm jealous.
Only... I'd like to throw that slinky brunette overboard.
I wouldn't have said anything if you hadn't mentioned it, Betty... but I've got a theory about that woman.
She's an adventuress.
- What?
- Shh. Come over here.
You know, I'm a pretty good detective, and I observe things.
Well, there's another fellow on the boat watches everything she does... especially when she's with Dick.
- What for?
- Well, I have a theory on that too.
As my pop would say, "When a woman play with fire, man get burned."
Or something like that.
[Laughing]
Well, what are you two conspiring about?
Oh, hello, Dick.
Fancy meeting you here.
- Hadn't you noticed I was on the boat?
- Occasionally.
I suppose I have been monopolizing Dick's company... but I am so interested in all you athletes.
Radiogram for you, Miss Roland.
Oh, thank you.
Will you excuse me?
Would you mind posing for a photo, Mr. Masters?
I am so interested in all you big athletes.
- Aw!
- [Squeals]
- [Groaning]
- Oh, that's swell. Hold it.
- Say, let me carry that for you.
- Go on!
Say, Betty, how's chances taking our picture?
Come on, gang.
Let's all get in on it.
[Man] Hey, Charlie. Come on, Francis.
You want your picture taken?
[Chattering Continues]
[Laughing]
Oh, let me have a picture of all of you.
- Really, I'd rather-
- Oh, please. I'd love to have one. Go on.
[Man]
Get off of my leg. Come on, guys.
Come on, Betty.
[Squeals]
Back a little further, please.
I'll fix it for you. How's that?
[Chattering Continues]
I'll be right back.
So sorry.
[Speaking Chinese]
- Thanks, Betty.
- I'll have the films developed for you this afternoon.
- Oh, never mind. I'll do it.
- But I want some extra prints.
It'll be no trouble, really.
I'll see you later, Dick.
Well, we'd better clean up for lunch.
Am I having lunch with you and Miss Roland?
- No, you're lunching with me alone, you pest.
- Oh!
Meet you in five minutes.
Psst. Betty.
I was right.
She is an adventuress.
She has a husband.
Look.
Where did you get this?
That fellow Hughes swiped it out of her book, and I got it from him.
I'll bet he's her husband's private detective getting evidence for a divorce.
If she gets Dick in trouble,
I'll tear her apart.
- I think I'll do it right now.
- Wait a minute, Betty.
As my pop would say, "Sugar catch more flies than hamburger steak."
[Laughs]
Or something like that.
But you stick with them. Don't leave
Dick alone with her for a second.
That Roland gal is going to think
I'm her Siamese twin.
- And leave everything else to me.
- Right.
Most excellent view of stadium for Olympic Games.
Very interesting. But I'm more concerned with the business that brought us here.
Useless to sprinkle salt on tail of time.
Must wait until
Manhattan dock tomorrow.
[Steam Whistle Blowing]
We received your radio at sea last night, Inspector Strasser.
No one has yet gone ashore.
The three passengers you mentioned have been carefully watched.
- Has any baggage been taken ashore?
- Nothing yet, sir.
Mr. Cartwright is standing by in Customs to identify the device.
Exactly. You see, Mr. Chan,
German methods are very thorough.
Have greatest admiration for well-known efficiency.
Suggest we interview
Miss Roland immediately.
Yes, sir.
- Miss Roland in her room?
- Yes, sir.
[Knocking]
[Knocking]
Recommend use of key.
It looks as though the Roland woman met the same fate as Miller.
It is forbidden to touch anything.
Shut the door.
When was lady last seen?
When she came from the deck to her stateroom shortly before midnight.
The steward has been on guard ever since.
- Anyone visit room?
- No, sir.
No one has come in or out since I've been on duty.
Then someone was waiting here when she entered.
- Did you hear any unusual noise?
- No, sir.
Then he must have made very short work of her.
And this is probably the weapon he used.
The dent was caused by a heavy blow.
And that clock establishes the time when the crime was committed- at precisely 17 minutes after 12:00.
Excuse me, sir. I was near the door then, and I didn't hear anything.
You were probably asleep.
That's enough. You can go.
- May examine, please?
- Certainly.
What was the location of the ship at 17 minutes after 12:00?
About 20 miles off the mouth of the Elbe River.
We were proceeding slowly in a heavy fog.
Exactly. Conditions were perfect for the murderer to dispose of the body.
You see?
The porthole is still open.
He then searched the room, found the stolen object... and escaped without detection.
- A perfect reconstruction, Inspector Strasser.
- [Clicks Heels]
- Exactly.
- [Knocking]
Oh, I beg your pardon.
- I thought this was Miss Roland's cabin.
- Hughes!
Well, this is a surprise.
I never expected to meet you here, Hopkins.
There's the man we want.
The woman was his accomplice.
When he thought they had the device safely in Germany, he murdered her as he did Miller.
That's a very neat plot. It suggests an author's perfect knowledge of events.
When were you in this stateroom last?
I'm sorry, but I've never enjoyed the privilege of Miss Roland's intimate company.
Then explain, please, importance of recovering cigarette lighter from table.
Oh, I did that rather awkwardly, didn't I?
But I'm sure I can explain it.
I was on deck last night with Miss Roland.
I offered my lighter for her cigarette.
She failed to return it.
- I dropped in to pick it up.
- Well, you must think we're all fools.
I'm not acquainted with the other gentlemen.
I demand his arrest!
Pardon, please.
No occasion for arrest.
What do you mean?
Sorry to explode theory of brother officer... but no evidence of murder here.
One moment, please.
Observe.
Dent in water carafe... fit round knob on post of bed... so.
Note, please, varnish chipped on same.
Exactly!
Also took liberty to examine fingerprints on neck of bottle.
Match lady's fingerprint on glass top of dresser perfectly.
Mr. Chan, this is extraordinary.
But I have the solution.
The woman arranged all this herself... so she could get ashore with the stolen device and escape pursuit.
Congratulations, Herr Inspector.
We'll have her in custody in 24 hours.
Well, since you have no further need for me, I'll-
No, you don't. I want this fellow's baggage searched.
You're overplaying your hand,
Hopkins.
- But if the police wish it, I shan't object.
- Exactly.
And I'll arrange for the release of the other passengers and baggage.
Can join you on dock later?
Hello.
Pop! Gee!
What are you doing here?
Please explain first most unceremonious entrance.
I was going to make an investigation here.
I came over the rail so no one could see me.
- Still playing tricks of detective?
- Yeah, I'm hot on a case.
The woman who has this cabin is an adventuress, and she's got a husband... and he's got a private detective named Hughes on this boat watching her.
Now she's trying to hook Dick Masters.
And Betty- that's Dick's sweetheart- is all upset about it.
I said I'd straighten it out.
Suspect recent activities of swimming caused water on brain.
No, sirree. I tell you, this is the real thing.
There isn't a murder yet, but I'm sure glad you're here.
You can help me. Take a look at this radiogram her husband sent her.
Hey, what's happened here?
Object of hot case make mysterious disappearance.
Don't worry, Pop.
With you helping me, I'll find her.
Look! Here's a swell clue!
Her white fox fur!
Have heard enough of white fox fur.
Gee, Pop, why didn't you radio me what was going on?
- I could've had the case closed by the time you got here.
- Modesty most commendable.
Well, you and I could've handled it better than that foreign cop.
All Strasser is doing is sitting back there and getting Hopkins's and Cartwright's life story.
- At least we got a clue.
- White fox fur?
No. That radiogram.
Only thing I can't figure out is where the husband fits in.
Suspect husband, like toupee on bald head... used for cover-up.
Message really very simple. Observe.
Read every fourth word.
"Your followed.
Boat waiting. Cuxhaven. "
Cuxhaven! That must be where she went overboard... and her pals had a boat waiting to pick her up.
And she got away with the invention.
Most improbable lady would risk injury to delicate device... by bath in salt water.
But what could she do with it?
Perhaps accomplice smuggle same ashore.
Well, it wasn't Dick Masters, because
Strasser searched everything he had.
Lady have contact with other athletes?
No. Only Betty Adams, and-
Say, I got it!
She borrowed Betty's camera, and she didn't give it back till last night.
Maybe she hid it in there and Betty carried it ashore.
- Possible.
- But Betty's on a special train ahead of us.
Say, Pop, we gotta do something.
- If Betty has it, those crooks'll be after her.
- [Knocking]
Come in, please.
Excuse me, Mr. Chan.
I dropped in to thank you... for helping me out of that situation this morning.
Very happy to be of service.
But situation in your favor that time.
That's fair enough.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
I'd like to repay you by giving you a tip.
You'll be much safer if you spend your time in Berlin enjoying the Olympic Games.
All play and no work make Charlie Chan very dull policeman.
I wonder if you've been smart enough to figure out who killed Miller.
Perhaps you... have answer.
I think in the final showdown, you'll ask Mr. Hopkins.
Well, I must be going.
[Gunshot]
I got him, Pop! Help me!
Please to release too active number one son.
Well, you must pardon my rough tactics... but I saw a rifle barrel in the car driving on the road beside us.
Now humble turn of Charlie Chan to be grateful.
Thank you so much.
When we meet again, we'll start even?
- [Door Closes]
- Say, that guy's too smart.
He timed the shot almost to a second.
But I'm awfully glad he pushed you out of the way of that bullet.
Humble parent seem to have fortunate fate of cat with nine lives.
I just want you to keep the one you have now.
And I'm sticking with you to see that nothing happens.
Correction, please. Will personally deliver you to Uncle Sam at Olympic Village.
- But, Pop-
- Also have desire to interview
Miss Betty Adams... to learn if she used camera for picture-taking this morning.
Gee, that's right. If she did, she discovered the invention in there.
Now reveal intelligent mind of good detective.
Thanks, Pop. We sure make a swell team, don't we?
Hmm.
[Crowd Cheering]
[Excited Chattering]
So this is Berlin.
- I've never seen so many bicycles in my life!
- Shucks, what a reception!
Hey, someone swiped my camera!
- How do you say stop in German?
- Hey, "stoppa" the bus!
- Arrestez-vous!
- Halta la machina!
- It's empty.
- I should've known better.
Gosh, I wanted that camera to get some pictures of the Games.
Gee, this isn't so bad.
I think I'll take that bed by the window.
Say, I wonder how you ask for a shampoo and a finger wave in German.
[Laughs] I wonder how you ask for something to eat.
It would be better if you girls would see the head matron now... to arrange for your seats in the dining hall.
That's me. I'm starved.
- I could eat a 16-pound shot.
- Well, come on.
- Let's all sit together.
- I wonder where that sauerkraut emporium is.
[Door Opening]
[Chan]
One moment, please.
May examine contents of basket?
It is nothing.
The girl athletes are forbidden candy.
I have taken it to report to the matron.
Would be most happy to save you trouble.
Hand it over!
Will identify, please.
- That's it!
- At last!
And it hasn't been tampered with.
It's been a long trail, Mr. Chan.
Last step ease toil of most difficult journey.
I'll take it.
Recommend immediate delivery to American Consul.
Life in danger while device in your possession.
Well, that's a chance
I'll have to take.
My responsibility's greater now than at home. I'll take charge of it.
- Come away from that window!
- [Maid] Look out! The police are here!
Who was in that car?
Take her away.
We'll find out who her accomplices are.
[Cartwright]
I should think that's obvious.
The Roland woman was associated with Masters, and the device was in his sweetheart's luggage.
[Hopkins] I'll report this to the American
Olympic Committee at once!
- [Strasser] Do you know this Masters?
- Certainly. He worked for me.
Mr. Chan?
Your son Lee told me you were here searching my luggage for some stolen invention.
Yes, and we found it.
- What?
- Excuse, please.
Miss Roland visit your room last night on boat to return camera?
Yes, she did. I was packing, and she insisted on helping me.
I suppose she hid the robot in your baggage without your knowing anything about it.
If that's where you found it, she must have.
You needn't look at me like that. I'm telling the truth.
I think you're trying to protect Masters.
The authorities will settle that.
You won't need the authorities.
Dick'll settle it himself.
Perhaps we've been a little hasty.
Hasty accusation like long shot on horse race.
Odds good, but chances doubtful.
Very obvious now why
Miss Roland borrow camera- give her excuse to visit stateroom... and conceal candy box with device in Miss Betty's luggage.
She certainly knew what she was doing.
The customs officials hardly looked at the luggage of the Olympic athletes.
When I get that matron down to headquarters, she'll tell where the Roland woman is.
Very commendable, but must not forget immediate danger.
Power behind Miss Roland will lose no time in attempt to regain most valuable robot.
Exactly.
And while you remain in Berlin, I'll see to your police protection, Mr. Hopkins.
- Excellent idea, Inspector.
- All right, gentlemen.
I'll drive you to your hotel.
Excuse, please.
Prefer to remain at Olympic Village... for visit with son Lee.
- May use telephone, please?
- Certainly.
- Thank you so much.
- [Clicks Heels]
[Door Closes]
Sure. Mr. Romeo, lady-killer. Just because that banjo-eyed brunette looks at you...
- you go for her like you're trying to break a world record.
- Forget it, will ya, Betty?
How did I know what was going on?
I only tried to be nice.
You were. You couldn't have been any sweeter if you'd given her a hacksaw to get out of jail.
And if Hopkins goes on making cracks, that's just where we'll be.
Well, I told you
I'd take care of all that.
- Then you'd better hurry up and see the police about it.
- All right. I will.
- But first I'm gonna settle with Hopkins.
- Dick! Dick, come back!
- Oh, ya big mug!
- What's the matter?
Oh, that poor goof. I told him what Hopkins said, and now he's going to knock his block off.
- That's swell! And he can do it.
- Oh, shut up.
I didn't mean that, Lee.
But don't you see?
If Dick gets into trouble, they'll suspend him from the team.
Gee, that's right. And as my pop would say,
"Don't rub sore finger with sandpaper."
- Oh, we have to stop him!
- We will, if I have to sock Hopkins myself.
Come on!
Might have been safer to leave the device in the hotel vault overnight.
I'm not trusting anybody.
If I'd know when I invented the mechanism... that it was gonna turn into a Frankenstein,
I'd have destroyed it.
Well, it's over now. We'll be safely on our way back to America in 24 hours.
I hope so. Well, I'll go wash up for dinner.
[Door Closes]
- Don't do it, Hopkins.
- What do you want?
Guess.
[Engine Stops]
- Is that their room on the second floor?
- Yes. He should be there now.
Keep your eye on that window. Be ready to make a fast getaway when he comes out.
I'll be in the lobby.
- Mr. Chan, I want your advice.
- Yes?
I heard an argument in Mr. Hopkins's room, and I was about to go in... when Mr. Hopkins himself let a man out.
- Who, please?
- That's it- I don't know.
Nobody has entered since I've been here, and
I arrived with Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Cartwright.
Most mysterious.
Perhaps wise to investigate.
[Gunshot]
Assistance, please.
[Batters On Door]
It was Hopkins. He escaped through the window. He's got my invention!
- Notify Inspector Strasser immediately.
- Yes, sir.
[Cartwright]
I hadjust left Hopkins alone...
so when I heard voices in here, I hurried in.
Hughes was accusing Hopkins of deliberately double-crossing his stockholders... by stealing my invention to sell it to a foreign government.
One moment.
Will corroborate?
- That's quite true.
- Continue, please.
They quieted down after I came in, but Hughes...
threatened to expose Hopkins ifhe didn't cut him in.
After Hughes left,
I asked Hopkins for an explanation.
He ignored me, went over to the desk and started to pack the device in a handbag.
I tried to stop him, and he drew a gun.
I grabbed for it. He tried to shoot me.
In the struggle I was hit on the head.
[Officer]
You can't go in there. It's forbidden!
Forbidden, my eye! I'm workin' on this case. I'm Chan and Son.
- Hello, Pop. I got some valuable information.
- Go ahead.
As Betty and I drove up, we saw a man drop out of that window into the garden.
Two guys helped him.
They started for a car. I went after them.
One of the guys slugged me.
They got away.
That settles it. Hopkins will be apprehended immediately.
In Berlin, things like this cannot happen.
No. By this time he's probably disposed of the device and is on his way out of town.
What's your connection with the Cartwright invention?
I tried to buy it from Hopkins, but he wouldn't do business.
Then when it was stolen in Honolulu...
I figured that Yvonne Roland had it, so I followed her.
But flying into San Francisco, she outsmarted me.
I caught up with her again on the Manhattan, but I didn't get anywhere.
She stuck too close to her friend Masters.
Wait a minute.
Look here, Mr. Chan.
I didn't have anything to do with this.
That's why I came here tonight- to make Hopkins take back what he said about Betty and me.
I suppose the reason you didn't come up here right away was... because you had a date in the lobby with Yvonne Roland.
- Yvonne Roland? In this hotel?
- Dick, is that true?
- Well, l-
- Oh!
- Hey, Betty.
- Wait! Give explanations to the police.
All right. I did see her, but I didn't have any date with her.
Just as I came in she was standing in the lobby. I started after her.
I wanted her to face Hopkins to help clear me.
Well, she ducked into the florist's shop,
I followed, but she got away.
Then I came up here. And now I'll take care of you for making that crack in front of Betty.
[Whistle Tweeting]
- Take them out of here.
- [Dick Straining]
[Officer]
Get out. Get- Get out of here.
- Mr. Chan, I apologize. It's impossible.
- [Door Closes]
- Things like this cannot happen in Berlin.
- [Clicks Heels]
[No Audible Dialogue]
- You were successful?
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- I received it directly from his hands.
- Very good.
Examine it, Carlos.
I hope you have the draft for the price agreed upon, Your Excellency.
You will receive it as soon as the transaction is completed- before I leave Germany.
Yvonne! What is this?
He's double-crossed you.
"Compliments of the Olympic Committee." Very clever.
The book must have been substituted at the sports forum.
There's only one person clever enough to have done that: Chan, the detective.
Our game is with the Oriental now.
[Lee]
But when did you get it, Pop?
Took opportunity to acquire same during excitement in girls' dormitory.
Then no wonder you weren't worried when Hopkins got away.
Important lesson for good detective:
When all players hold suspicious cards, good idea to have joker up sleeve.
[Laughs] Well, we got that cleaned up, Pop.
Now all we have to do is land the guy...
that killed Miller and round up this gang of spies.
[Knocking Continues]
Letter, Mr. Chan.
- [Coin Clinks]
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
What it is, Pop?
Envelope, like skin of banana, must be removed to digest contents.
Ticket to Olympic Games and letter.
Gee! Box 22.
That's where all the big shots will sit.
Letter apparently from big noise also.
"His Excellency, the Honorable Charles Zaraka...
"requests the pleasure of Mr. Chan's company... at the opening of the Olympic Games."
Zaraka?
You've never met him.
I have never met Santa Claus either, yet accept gift from same.
[Marching Band.
Fanfare, Up-tempo March]
[Crowd Applauding]
[Applauding Continues]
[March Continues In Distance]
Mr. Chan?
We haven't met, but I'm sure you've heard of me. Yvonne Roland.
Had looked forward to making acquaintance before leaving Berlin.
- This is His Excellency, the Honorable Charles Zaraka.
- A very great pleasure, Mr. Chan.
This is most unexpected compliment to humble policeman.
Are you sure that fellow knows his stuff?
He's the best in Berlin.
He'll read every move of their lips.
All right. They're in Box 22.
[Applauding Continues]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[March Continues]
A most illuminating spectacle,
Mr. Chan-
the nations of the world about to struggle for supremacy on the field of sports.
Yet behind all this there is another struggle going on constantly... for world supremacy in a more sinister field.
It's not a game for amateurs, Mr. Chan.
I hope you get my meaning.
Could not be more clear if magnified by 200-inch telescope.
Then wouldn't it be advisable for you to turn over the Cartwright invention to us...
and return to your own little game in Honolulu?
Perhaps... but player sometime disregard even most expert coaching... from sidelines.
- You have the afternoon to consider it.
- Thank you so much.
That's all I wanted to know.
Stick around. Enjoy yourself.
She's even got the nerve to sit in a box. Why don't we go in and make the cops arrest her?
Well, that's a box reserved for the foreign diplomatic corps. The police can't butt in there.
As long as she's with that big shot, she's protected by his diplomatic immunity.
Oh, you'd find some reason to stall out of it.
All right.
Have it your way then.
Aw, Betty, you shouldn't be like that.
A fella doesn't wanna be put on the spot by his girl all the time.
[Applauding In Distance]
- He's right over there by that center arch.
- Thanks.
Mr. Lee Chan?
I have a message for your father.
He's on the south side of the stadium in a box.
- Will you take me to him, please?
- Sure. Now you fix things up with Dick.
I'll see ya later.
Let's go, my man.
Drive us around the south entrance.
- Okay.
- No. Let's walk. It's quicker.
- Dick! Dick!
- [Car Door Slams]
- Get going!
- [Engine Starts]
Dick!
Mr. Chan, the ceremonies are almost over.
What is your answer?
Only one possible for... amateur.
Device will be returned to United States War Department.
- Thank you so much for a very enjoyable afternoon.
- It was a pleasure.
- Here.
- Let me go, you idiot!
Mr. Chan,
Lee has been kidnapped.
Lee?
You have our deepest sympathy, Mr. Chan.
If we can be of service, please call on us.
- [Knocks]
- Come in, please.
There is no news yet.
If the boy is in Berlin, we'll find him.
A dragnet is closing in on every known criminal hideout.
Don't give up hope.
Ancient Chinese philosopher say...
"Hope is sunshine which illuminate darkest path."
[Glass Breaks]
"If you wish news of your son...
"be in your same seat in the Olympic stadium tomorrow... alone and unguarded."
Eleven more hours of anxious waiting.
Don't fear, Mr. Chan.
Tomorrow they'll walk into a trap.
- The police will be there and make short work of them.
- No. Instructions very explicit.
Must walk path... alone.
[Announcer] 1,500-meter title won by Lovelock, New Zealand.
The time. Three minutes,
47 and 8/10 seconds.
- A new Olympic and world's record.
- Oh, the relay's going to start.
This is gonna be a new record sure.
[Pistol Fires]
- Come on, Jesse. Open up that lead!
- Come on. Take 'em!
Pick 'em up, big boy!
Pick 'em up and lay 'em down!
- [Woman] Let's go! Wykoff!
- [Woman #2] Come on, Metcalfe!
- [Man Shouts In Foreign Language]
- [Woman] Come on, Ralph!
- [Man] Look at that boy go!
- [Man #2 Shouts In Foreign Language]
- [Woman] Open up that lead, Franklin!
- [Woman] Come on, Franklin!
[All Cheering, Shouting, Indistinct]
[Man Shouts In Foreign Language]
[Women]
Come on, Frankie!
[Man] Look at that Wykoff go!
Break that record!
- [Woman] Come on, Wykoff! Come on, Wykoff!

[Announcer] 100-meter relay title won by the United States.
Time.39 and 8/10 seconds.
A new Olympic and world's record.
- Are all the men at their posts?
- Yes, Inspector.
- Every exit in this part of the stadium is covered.
- Good.
- There goes Dick. He'll take 'em in the pole vault.
- You've got that all set, huh?
Well, if he doesn't,
I'll break his neck.
[Announcer] Masters of the United States has just cleared...
- 14 feet and two inches on his second try.
- He did 14 feet and two inches.
Oh, Dick can do better than that.
- [All Chattering]
- Way to go, old fella.
Message for gentleman in Box 22.
[Announcer] The bar for the pole vault has just been raised to 14 feet, three inches.
[Cartwright] It's rather an extraordinary request, Mr. Chan.
I don't know how to answer you. I didn't even know you had the device in your possession.
- Very well, you know it now.
- I don't feel I have anything to say about its disposal.
I signed my rights over to Mr. Hopkins and retained only a small interest.
Hopkins is a fugitive from justice.
But if I have your authority to use the device... we can deal with these criminals.
- Are you willing to put it back in their hands, Mr. Chan?
- Cannot answer as officer.
Must speak as very humble father.
- If there's no other way, of course you have my permission.
- Good.
Please accept gratitude of most anxious parent.
Besides, Mr. Cartwright, when the boy is returned safely... we will go after the criminals and get it back.
One more request, please.
This time must insist on acting alone.
Any effort to help might result in serious consequence.
You have our word, Mr. Chan.
We will wait for a message from you.
Hmm.
Good-bye.
And as a further precaution for your safety, Mr. Cartwright... you will remain with me.
He's here.
Checkmate.
How do you do, Mr. Chan?
I'm glad you followed instructions this time and didn't depend on the police.
Wise philosopher once say...
"Only foolish man will not acknowledge defeat."
- I'm sure he was Chinese to have been so clever.
- Thank you so much.
Am ready to complete transaction.
- May now see number one son?
- In just a moment.
There's one more, uh, formality.
- Ask Mr. Hopkins to come in.
- Yes, sir.
You may put the device on the desk, Mr. Chan.
That's it- Chan's signal.
His transmitter's working.
What does your direction finder say?
North by northeast, two points east.
Calling B.P. 41.
Calling B.P. 41. Calling B.P. 41.
Coming in.
Car 37 picked it up.
- "North by northeast."
- North by northeast.
- "Two points east."
- Two points east.
Contact all cars in Areas "D" and "F" for check on direction.
Calling all cars, Areas "D" and "F."
Pardon our caution, Mr. Chan... but Mr. Hopkins will have to identify the mechanism... just to be sure there hasn't been another, uh, mistake.
Yes. This is the Cartwright invention.
Thank you, Mr. Hopkins. That's all.
And now my son, please?
- Bring the boy in.
- Yes, sir.
Car 46 reporting second triangulation point.
- "West by southwest."
- West by southwest.
- "Six points south."
- Six points south.
Car 49 reporting third point.
- "South by southeast."
- South by southeast.
- "One point south."
- One point south.
Notify all cars to converge on Area "D," Block 21.
That definitely sets your location.
Your plans worked perfectly.
Exactly. Soon we will be there, and you will have your device back.
- Calling all cars.
- All right, Sergeant. Go ahead.
I'm sorry I got you into this, Pop.
Danger, like red light on end of moving train, now safely past.
[Zaraka]
Except for one slight detail.
I must make very certain that the pursuit ends here.
I'll remember you when my plane is crossing the border out of Germany.
Good-bye, Mr. Chan.
Just a moment, Zaraka.
Were you planning to leave?
Get their guns.
Line up over there, all of you!
Just a minute.
Give me that bag.
Still playing tricks, eh, Mr. Chan?
- What is it?
- It's a phony.
- It's a transmitter!
- Chan's signal stopped coming through.
- They've discovered the trick.
- Call the other cars. See if they have contact.
Calling all cars.
Calling all cars.
Very clever, Mr. Chan- in touch with the police ever since you've been here.
Come on.
Where is it? And talk fast.
- All cars have lost contact.
- Then instruct them to proceed in the same direction at full speed.
- We must get to Chan.
- Calling all cars.
For the last time, where is the Cartwright invention?
Reposing in place of utmost safety.
Get away from that kid.
Back against the wall, you.
Do I get my answer?
[Engines Stopping]
[Brakes Squeaking]
- It's the police.
- Surround the house.
Don't let any of them get away.
[Battering On Door]
Search the house!
- They went up there!
- Round them up!
- [Clicks Heels]
- Mr. Chan, you see? We have arrived in time.
- The police of Berlin are very efficient.
- [Gunshot]
Inspector! Inspector Strasser!
Keep him covered.
Most unfortunate occurrence.
He's still alive.
Remove him. Get the doctor.
If Mr. Hopkins regain consciousness, report immediately.
Okay, Pop.
- What happened in here?
- I was going by the door when I heard a shot.
As I stepped in, Hopkins was lying on the floor, and Hughes was standing over him.
You can't pin that shooting on me.
I just came in through that door, when l-
One moment, please.
- You did not come into room when shot fired?
- No, I stopped at the door.
Strange.
[Chan] Ink spilled here when Mr. Hopkins fall... yet stain your shoe while standing at door.
Conclusive proof you were close to Mr. Hopkins when he fell.
Now very evident attempted murder of Hopkins... was last act to save self.
You are murderer of mechanic Miller in Honolulu...
and thief of own invention.
That's ridiculous.
I've helped you in every way possible.
If I'd wanted to steal the invention,
I could have easily made a copy.
That would have been obvious way and easy to trace.
But you saw opportunity to gain large fortune... without sharing with your partner, Mr. Hopkins.
[Chan] So devised clever scheme to remove suspicion from self...
by having Miller murder pilot Edwards and steal robot from test plane.
Then, assisted by Miss Roland, you murder Miller... and turn device over to Miss Roland... for delivery to Mr. Zaraka, head of foreign spy ring.
Second point. When Miss Roland disappear before boat reach dock... quite evident someone warned her of plan for capture.
- Hopkins knew the plan as well as I did. He could have-
- Excuse, please.
Mr. Hopkins entirely innocent.
Here tonight he perform heroic deed... when, at risk of his own life, he identify imitation as real device... to assist Charlie Chan in rounding up ring of spies.
And now, final evidence.
The time he disappear from hotel room... found something you overlooked:
Unfinished cablegram written in Mr. Hopkins's own hand...
addressed to United States
War Department.
"Have recovered
Cartwright invention.
Returning to America immediately for"-
- That's where it ends.
- Observe, please, what follows.
[Strasser]
There's nothing but a blot across the page.
Indicate when writing message,
Mr. Hopkins suddenly interrupted by action... which cause pen to slip from fingers.
Pop, Mr. Hopkins is still unconscious, but he's gonna be all right.
The doctor found a bump on his head that must have been made a couple of days ago.
Thank you so much for corroboration- prove you knock Mr. Hopkins unconscious... then drop him from window into arms of confederates, as seen by son Lee.
- That is all.
- Take them out.
Well, it looks like we cleaned this case up, Pop.
But how did you change the robot into a transmitter?
Constructed same in most efficient
Berlin police laboratory... with help of honorable inspector.
You're a fine officer, Mr. Chan.
You went through with your duty even though it meant risking your son's life.
- Better for Oriental to lose life than to lose face.
- You bet. But, you know... for a while I was afraid I wouldn't be there to win that 100-meter swim tomorrow.
- Perhaps good idea not to accept gold medal until race is won.
- [Chuckles] Don't worry, Pop.
I learned to sprint when you used to chase me through the water with a paddle.
Come on, Lee, boy!
Oh, yeah!
Come on! Come on!
- Come on!
- He won!
- Attaboy, Lee!
- Thank you.
- Good work!
- Thanks.
- [Dick] Congratulations!
Congratulations, fella!
Ah, thanks!
- I made it, Pop!
- Very lucky.
- Was prepared for emergency.
- [Laughing]
What do you say, kid?
Are we moving in?
How many times do you want me to say yes?
Every time you say it is like the first time.
My heart starts beating like I just ran around the block.
Those slippery rugs are out.
A guy could break his neck on those.
Mr. Wilson, do you plan doing a lot of running around?
Yeah, after you.
- The rugs are out.
- And the twin beds too.
Out like a light.
Hey, I like peanuts too.
- I thought you hated them.
- I did once.
What changed your mind?
I love you. You love peanuts.
I love peanuts too.
Well, I guess that wins.
It's raining.
Gee, it feels swell against your face.
Tonight of all nights it's gotta rain.
Don't talk about it.
What am I gonna do after you've gone?
Joe.
I'll be walking like this down a street.
- Where are you?
- I'll be here.
Twenty cents.
- How do you like that?
- Oh, dear.
Here, give me.
Don't.
What are you gonna do?
Oh, here it is.
- Come on, I'll sew it.
- Here? No, no.
- You'll let it go. I know.
- Honest, I won't.
- You know you will.
- No, I'll sew it myself.
- I won't forget it, darling.
- Sit down.
Sit down.
There's a lot of people around.
Joe.
I've only got blue thread.
- Blue?
- Yep. Blue.
Train number 19 leaving for De Kalb.
- There. You hear? That's your train.
- That's not my train. Sit down.
- I'm hard to get rid of.
- Like my right arm.
Only I need you more.
Oh, Kat.
I'll come for you as soon as I get that old bank account...
...up to the third floor and a kitchenette.
This waiting is awful.
After all, we're human.
Why can't you stay with your job here?
- At least we...
- We've been through that, darling.
There's a better job there, and I'll be saving for us too.
I know.
Train number 27 leaving for Galesburg and all points west.
- Give me some of those peanuts too.
- Yes, sir.
- How much for that "smellum"?
- That one there?
Take it easy on yourself now.
Four dollars.
Not for me, wise guy.
It's for a girl. How much?
Five even.
I got you a little mementum.
"Memento," darling. "To," not "tum. "
How often have I told you?
It's from wearing braces on my teeth when I was a kid.
You're still a kid. A lot of you is...
...and I love it.
I love you.
I got a memento for you too.
Look inside.
"Henry to Katherine. "
It was my mother's wedding ring.
I was named after her.
So I...
- Turn it around.
- "Katherine to Joe. "
Oh, Kat...
I guess I'll have to wear it on my little finger.
All aboard!
I'll come for you soon.
Soon, Joe.
Soon.
Hello, stranger.
Think you're smart, don't you?
How do you like this, big shot?
How's that?
You look the way I feel.
Lonely and small.
Come on.
Quiet.
That Charlie, always leaving the light on.
Straight ahead.
- Charlie, now, I'm all right.
- Yeah, I know, I know.
Come on, hold it now. Hold it.
- Charlie, where'd you get the dog?
- There's no dog. You're drunk.
- So you went to a movie?
- Hello, Joe.
- Katherine get away all right?
- Yeah.
That's fine. I'm fine too.
I feel awful.
Now, listen, Charlie...
We had a couple drinks after the show.
Kid's gotta have fun.
He just can't take it.
Who said I can't take it?
- I'm all right.
- All right, Tommy. Sure you are.
- All right, kid.
- Even Mr. Donelli said I was all right.
- Donelli?
- All right. I've been waiting for it.
Waiting for an undertaker or cops, the life you're leading.
Running errands for that racketeer.
Let me tell you, Charlie, leave Tom out of it.
Joe, I know, I know.
We met Donelli, and he invited us up for drinks.
Better Tom meets someone who can do him some good.
Do him some good?
I'm glad Mom and Dad aren't here to see the good you're doing yourself.
Can that Sunday-school talk.
Think I'm gonna ride to heaven on 30 a week from a sweatshop?
Be a working stiff all my life, like you?
- Times have changed.
- You bet times have changed.
The people are against you monkeys now.
The people ain't doing so good either.
I don't know what's so hot about you.
Crazy in love with a swell gal and can't make enough to get married.
- Leave Katherine out of it!
- Leave me out. Stop living my life.
I wouldn't live your life for all the money in the world.
Okay, Reverend. Okay.
"Memento," darling. "Memento. "
Soon.
Come in.
It's a special delivery this time, Miss Grant.
- I hope nothing's happened.
- Oh, no.
They come faster than when I was a girl, but I guess the insides don't change.
- He's coming, Mrs. Whipple!
- No.
Wedding, marriage license.
He's bought a car.
Look.
- Be sure and kiss Katherine for me.
- Happy landings, fella.
Don't let the Indians get you out there.
You keep your chin clean.
Look after the kid.
You can trust me.
Rainbow, take care of Joe.
- Goodbye, boys.
- So long, Joe.
- Is there gas in it? Bye-bye.
- All right.
War and crime.
Strikes, taxes.
And some weenies for his dog and an avocado for him.
They call them alligator pears back East, cost a fortune. Think he'll like them?
He won't know what he's eating for being with you again.
What time will I make lunch for?
I'm leaving for Sycamore Corners by bus on the main road.
I wrote him to meet me there at 11:00 at that hot dog stand.
We'll be back by noon sure.
Golly, Mrs. Whipple,
I can hardly stand it.
Over a year now.
Stop your motor, buddy.
Get both hands up on that wheel there.
What is this, a holdup?
- No grass growing under them tires, eh?
- I wasn't speeding.
- And Illinois license plates?
- Yeah, sure. Chicago.
Get that fist up there.
Hey, I haven't got any gun if that's what you mean.
- Peanuts won't kill you.
- Salted peanuts?
- Yeah, why?
- I ain't answering the questions, buddy.
You are. Come on, get out.
Where were you last night,
Mr. Wilson?
If you don't mind.
- I drove all night.
- On that old road?
I got lost trying to find a shortcut to Capital City.
- And the night before last?
- Camping out.
Sorry to take up so much of your time, but... Excuse me a second.
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.
Some peanuts?
Now you're talking my language, sheriff.
I've had that habit since I was a kid.
My old man used to bring them to me.
I got used to having them around.
Yes, sir.
- Always find peanuts in my pocket.
- Wilson...
...where did you say you spent the night before last?
- Camping out.
- Why?
Why? For the...
Is it a crime to get fresh air for yourself when you've been stuck in a ci...?
Hey, look. What am I suspected of anyway?
- I got a right to know.
- Sure.
Me? Why, that's the craziest thing
I ever heard. That'd fit a million men.
Read that.
Am I the only guy in the world that eats peanuts?
- Why, you just...
- I never ate peanuts in my life.
I get it.
Why don't you check?
Get my brothers on the phone...
...in Chicago...
- We'll check all right.
That's what I'm here for.
- Mind showing me your pockets?
- I should say not.
I don't mind, I mean.
He knows what I got.
Keys, handkerchiefs...
...my license, money, what there is of it.
Pipe, tobacco, matches.
- And peanuts.
- Bugs.
- Quiet, Rainbow.
- Check those bills...
...against the numbers of these ransom banknotes.
You've come to the right man, chief.
- Sure he's only gonna check those?
- You're probably right as rain, Wilson.
Take a look under the five-dollar series.
Q 49677308 Z.
And on his bill the same thing.
Q 49677308 Z.
That can't be. That's impossible.
Rip up that car of his.
Might be more of them.
- Man, is this gonna be a sensation.
- Keep it to yourself.
And keep that dog quiet.
- Good morning.
- Hello.
Anybody here?
Any good-looking man from Illinois looking for a good-looking girl here?
- Where's the good-looking girl?
- She'll be along in a minute.
Well, the good-looking young fella ain't here yet either.
He will be.
Well, will you let me phone Chicago then?
Or better, I can phone my...
- Phone your what?
- Phone my brothers.
If you're mixed up with this gang, it wouldn't be smart of me to let you.
Look, sheriff. I got the bill some place in change. I don't know where I got it.
Maybe I got it at a store or a gas station or some place.
Take me back over the road.
I can prove...
Not a thing in the car. Not a thing.
Take care of this stranger, Frank.
Go through his clothes.
Sure you haven't forgot anything,
Wilson?
Yeah.
There's my watch.
The ring. It's too tight. I can't get it off.
Cut it off. Why not?
I've gotta hold you, Wilson, for the district attorney.
But you'll get a square deal.
- Come on.
- You can type that now, Myrtle.
Quiet, Rainbow.
- She'll be all right, sheriff.
- Okay.
- Looks like we got ahold of something.
- Yeah.
- Be at the barbershop if you want me.
- Okay.
Let me tell you, professor, if you young geniuses at the high school...
...fill our children's heads with radical ideas...
...we parents will have to get a law.
- Not possible to get a law...
...that denies the right to say what one believes, in peace times anyway.
- Who says so?
- The Constitution of the United States.
I don't believe it.
You should read it sometime.
You would be surprised.
Well, that's enough of that now, Sven.
I had to read it to become an American.
You never had to because you was born here.
Hello, Meyers? Anything new on this awful Peabody case?
I don't know.
You public servants quit playing cards.
Maybe you'd bring somebody to justice.
What'd you say if I raked in a guy this morning...
...might know something about them kidnappers? Yeah.
What do you suppose it is makes people do things like snatching that kid?
Nutty, I guess.
Now, I'll tell you.
People get funny impulses.
If you resist them, you're sane...
...if you don't, you're on your way to the nuthouse or the pen.
At the taxpayers' expense.
Mr. Jorganson, you've got one of the levelest heads in the county.
Would you believe that in the 20 years that I've been stroking this razor...
...across throats here...
...that many a time
I've had an impulse...
...to cut their
Adam's apples wide open?
Just like that.
Yes, sir.
How about it, Hec?
Do you feel an impulse coming on?
An impulse is an impulse.
It's like an itch. You gotta scratch it.
Hello?
What's that, Hector?
My oldest customer.
All on account of that Bugs Meyers from the sheriff's office...
...telling a cock-and-bull story about his capturing...
...one of that Peabody kidnapping gang.
- I got something on the stove, precious.
Call you back. Bye-bye.
Mrs. Tuttle! Mrs. Tuttle!
- Of all things.
- For mercy's sake, what is it?
Just wait. My husband phoned me.
They've arrested a man.
And they think he's one of the kidnappers.
Fanny!
That barber's wife says this morning they caught a man on the old road...
...who they suspect knows something about this kidnapping.
I got it on the highest authority that they arrested...
...one of that kidnapping gang.
- You don't say.
He tried to escape, but they captured him all right.
- Oh, I'll have three of those.
- Oh, come on.
- And a pound of prunes.
- What's his name?
- Who was he?
- What else?
Well, I can't tell you any more. It was told me in the strictest confidence.
Fanny, that isn't fair.
Please. Come on.
But, darling, you know
I'm as silent as a tomb.
But are you sure he's not innocent?
My dear young woman, in this country...
...people don't land in jail unless they're guilty.
My wife's sister called up and told her that a friend of hers told her...
...that this guy acted as cocky as a bronco.
All he'd answer was,
"Let me phone my lawyer. "
Sure. That's the racket of those bigtime attorneys.
Helping these skunks beat the law.
Well, they won't beat it with any jury I'm ever on.
If all us people had the courage of our convictions...
...these vermin would vanish like spit on a hot stove.
Set them up for the boys, Oscar.
Four beers.
Last time after you played that slot machine...
...it was full of telephone slugs.
Now, ain't that a shame.
Say, Dawson...
...I hear they gave that guy your favorite cell at the jail.
Next time I'm in, it'll be for beating you up.
All right, big shot.
While I didn't vote for Hummel for sheriff...
...his promptness in catching this kidnapper is commendable.
They can't bring him to trial any too quickly to suit me.
- Lf you don't mind.
- Well, excuse me for living.
- Mr. Pippen.
- Hello, George.
- I have some fine, new English flannel.
- Later, Durkin.
- Yes, as you wish.
- My usual, Oscar.
We were discussing down at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon...
We were discussing at the luncheon about what a great publicity break...
What a great publicity break our capturing this Chicago fellow...
...is gonna give our little city, assuming of course the citizens, leading citizens...
See that he's brought to justice.
We'll take care of that, all right, all right.
We'll go to the sheriff, get it from him.
Boys, that's a great idea.
I'll go with you.
Hey! Hey, jailer.
- Has the sheriff phoned my brothers yet?
- I don't know.
But you'll hear something one way or the other in due time.
I'm trying to locate the district attorney.
We'll get the truth as soon as possible.
But till we do, one way or other...
...I've no right to make a statement.
Ordinarily, sheriff, yes.
But there's a nervous feeling about town.
Yes, sheriff.
And the community feels that...
We got a right to know about him.
I don't know yet that he is a kidnapper, so neither do you.
What are you trying to do, Hummel?
- Protect this weasel?
- That's pretty comical, you cockroach.
You teaching me law and order.
You've been stirrings up trouble for law and order hereabouts...
...ever since you put on long pants.
Anything more I can do for you gentlemen?
Here, let me talk.
No offense meant.
I'm sure, sheriff, we can count on you keeping everything shipshape, I'm sure.
Good afternoon.
But I would like to...
Good day, sheriff.
- Goodbye, sheriff.
- Well, good day.
It's an outrage a man can't stand up for law and order...
Men do stand up for it.
I'll tell you one thing, Hummel.
My friends won't be satisfied...
...with what those pillars of society have to tell them.
An attack on a girl hits us ordinary people where we live.
We're gonna see that politics don't cut any ice.
I'm gonna see that a lot of half-baked rumors don't either.
Now hightail out of here and behave yourself...
...or I'll have the county take you and all your relatives off the dole.
Myrtle, get the governor on the phone.
I'll have the National Guard ready for any merited emergency.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Keep me informed.
I hope nothing's happened.
It's the first time he's come West, so...
I ain't heard of anyone being tomahawked or scalped in the neighborhood in a while.
The sheriff's wrong not to give us the facts.
What'd they rip his car up for unless it was to find ransom dough?
I heard there was 5000 in tens, twenties, fifties...
- Ten thousand, they told me.
- It was a lot of money.
First thing he did was phone
Chicago for his lawyer.
That's always the first thing a guy like that will do.
Maybe he gave the money to the sheriff to go free on bail.
- Shut up, Goofy.
- There's Bugs. He ought to know.
- Let's ask.
- That's an idea.
- Bring him in and give him a drink.
- Come on, gang. Let's go and get him.
Remember, just one.
Hooray for Bugsy!
- Give us the dope, Bugsy.
- Come on, Bugs.
- He knows all about it.
- Say, what's biting you fellas?
- What do you wanna know?
- There's an argument about...
...the amount the sheriff found in that kidnapper's car.
- I hate to disappoint you guys.
- Come on, Bugsy.
We didn't find nothing.
We ripped it up...
Go on, we know you found ransom money.
- Yeah, ten grand hid under the seat.
- Ten grand, me eye.
Why, all Wilson had on him of the ransom money was a five-dollar bill.
Who does that make a liar out of?
Wait'll I shove it down the sheriff's throat.
Come on.
Let's give him a serenade.
- Yeah, Dawson's right.
- Attaboy!
Quiet. Quiet, I say! Quiet!
Everybody's getting too excited.
The sheriff's okay.
- This is none of our business.
- No?
I'll tell you, if I lived in this town,
I'd make it my business.
What are you eggs?
Soft-boiled, that you don't stick up for a kidnapped girl?
- Who are you?
- Just passing through.
Been up to Capital City, strike-breaking for the streetcar company.
Maybe you need some help here too.
Not from a mug like you.
Lay off, Garrett. The sheriff made a monkey out of you too.
He's right. We ought to be ashamed letting a stranger show us the ropes.
Come on, fellas, let's go get him.
Come on!
Come on, let's have some fun!
Where's that special deputy list
I made out?
Did I tell you to call up the gov...?
Wait a minute.
Here, Myrtle, first call up the men I've checked on that list.
Get out the tear gas bombs.
- Two apiece.
- Right.
Sheriff, we wanna talk to this Wilson guy.
Boys, keep out of this.
There's no positive proof that the man you want to...
...talk to is guilty.
Or innocent either.
The district attorney is checking on him now.
But whichever he is...
...he's under the protection of the law.
As long as I stand here you can yell yourselves hoarse.
- But you won't see this man.
- Then you won't stand there long.
We'll move you.
Well, then I ought to tell you men...
...the National Guard is on its way.
Orders to stop, telephoned from the governor.
- Stop? But...
- Why, Will?
Because people always resent troops moving in on them.
Hurts their pride.
When the papers phoned me about this little ruckus in Strand...
...I was able to calm them down all right.
But knowing how conscientious you are, Bert, I came right over.
And mighty good thing
I was in time to stop you too.
You could cut our political throats with this soldier stuff in an election year.
You, Freddy Garrett, Durkin, Lopez,
Walker, Johnson, all of you, go home.
You're gonna wind up being sorry for this.
Think of your families.
Stick in with this kidnapper, Milt Grimes, and you'd better not come home tonight.
You elected me to do my duty, and I'm going to.
You're diving in over your heads, men.
Listen to reason.
Stop acting like a lot of hysterical...
I'm warning you!
Don't make me use force.
You're not up against just us here.
- More deputies, with tear gas and rifles...
- Hey!
Hey, jailer! Jailer! Come here, will you?
Hey, jailer!
Jailer!
Jailer! Have the sheriff inform my girl, will you?
She's the one I wanted to call up.
I just didn't wanna get her mixed up in this thing.
She can tell you who I am.
Ten cents.
Hey, buddy! Hey!
Hey, is this the way to Strand?
- Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks. Keep going.
Them newsreel guys are on their toes.
Must have found out before it happened.
I phoned where I live.
There's no word of him.
Oh, he had a puncture, I suppose.
Everything will be all right.
The things that happen.
The bus driver just told me...
...they got somebody they suspect of that kidnapping at Strand.
A fella named Joe Wilson.
The mob there is trying to make him confess.
Joe Wilson? But...
Joe... That's impossible.
He never hurt a hair on anyone's head in his life.
Where's a car? I've got to go there.
Lend me your car, please? I've got to go.
- The boys got my car.
- When's the next bus?
They ain't no more.
What'll I do? I've got to go.
Don't you understand?
I've got to go to him.
Won't you help me?
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, what a shot this is.
We'll sweep the country with this stuff.
Oh, the film's gone. Reload.
And be sure and use that hypersensitive film.
Holy smoke.
Come on, Bill, make it snappy.
And get me that 2-inch lens.
Bar the door.
Open the door!
I can get them through the window.
- More bombs!
- We're almost out.
- Where's them National Guards?
- Where's Ralph?
- Here.
- Where's Milt?
- His wife took him home.
- Why, the yellow...
Wait a minute.
What does that silence mean? Quiet.
Heave ho!
Heave ho! Heave...
Get cabinets, desks, line them up against that door.
Stop! Please, stop!
Jailer! Jailer! Can't anybody hear me?
Let me out!
I'll talk to them!
Let me out! Give me a chance!
Let me talk to them!
Give me a chance, will you?
Can't anybody hear me?
- Up to the cells, men.
- Come on!
- Give us the keys, Lem.
- I ain't got them.
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.
- All we want is this guy Wilson.
- We know you got keys.
- I ain't got them!
- We want those keys.
- Where are they?
- Get a post. We'll break it down!
- Yeah, that's it!
We haven't got time.
Let's smoke him out.
Yeah, he's right. Let's go, men.
Come on, let's get some wood.
Hope you like baked potatoes, Wilson.
- Hey!
- There goes his dog!
- Give me some of them books.
- Hey, come back here!
- Let the dog go!
- Get it down!
Hey, Wilson, they can't parole you out of this.
Hello, Rainbow.
Let him have it. Take it away.
Looks bad, Rainbow.
Looks bad.
There he is!
I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord.
I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
God forgive him and our trespasses, as we forgive them who trespass against us.
Run in back, Wilson. Get back there!
What are you looking for, the Peabody girl?
Get back!
No.
Jiggers! The soldiers are coming!
Soldiers!
- Let's beat it.
- Wait! I've got an idea.
- They'll never get him out.
- That's the stuff.
After this dynamite, they won't be able to find the jail.
Wait! Here's somebody!
Help her up!
Why, the very spirit of government has been violated.
The state disgraced in the eyes of the world...
...by this brutal outburst of lust for vengeance.
And I blame myself.
I let you talk me down.
That mob could have been stopped if assistance had been sent...
...to officers in time.
- Forget it.
The reformers will cuss around for a while and then start cussing something else.
These letters and telegrams backing up the statement I gave.
Congratulations, 90 percent of them.
"Finest thing we've heard of in years. "
"Congratulations. "
I wonder what sort of telegrams we'll get...
...when it's known that Wilson was an innocent man.
Well, when I gave out the statement
I didn't know that.
This story is on every wire in the world right now.
Yeah, yeah.
Now he's innocent. Yeah.
I can't get it out of my head.
I can't get any sleep.
When I close my eyes, I...
I can't understand why we haven't heard from Katherine.
She's like all the rest.
He gets in trouble, and she takes a run-out powder.
When I think how happy he was when he left here...
Oh, stop it!
Hey, what are you doing here?
You better go back.
- Any of that milk left, Tom?
- What?
Oh, yes.
There. Come back over here.
Here.
If I could only get at them rats.
If I could only get my hands on them.
We're going out there, Tom.
We're gonna get them.
- Kill them the way they killed Joe.
- Whatever you say. And whenever.
That's five-and-ten-cent store talk.
Joe!
Joe.
Pull down that shade.
Pull down the shade!
Turn out that light!
You know where I've been all day?
In a movie.
Watching a newsreel of myself getting burned alive.
I watched it 10 times or 20 maybe.
Over and over again.
I don't know how much.
The place was packed. They like it.
They get a big kick out of seeing a man burned to death. A big kick!
What an explosion.
It blew the cell door off, and it killed...
...Rainbow.
I got out down a rain-pipe.
I almost burned my side off.
I could smell myself burn!
- It's awful. I feel like thanking God.
- Did you get burned bad?
That don't hurt me.
You can't hurt a dead man and I'm dead.
Everybody knows that.
The whole country. I'm dead, see.
You remember me preaching to you to live right?
Live right. I tried it. I tried to like it.
And people... But they won't let you!
You were right. Donelli was right.
Everyone was right but me. I was wrong.
I know now. I'll get them.
- We'll get a lawyer and have them...
- Arrested for disturbing the peace?
For setting fire to a jail, maybe?
No, that's not enough for me.
I'm burned to death by a mob of animals.
I'm legally dead.
They're legally murderers.
That I'm alive is not their fault.
But I know them.
I know a lot of them.
And they'll hang for it.
According to the law which says if you kill somebody...
...you gotta be killed yourself.
I'll give them the chance they didn't give me.
They'll get a legal trial in a legal courtroom.
They'll have a legal judge and a legal defense.
They'll get a legal sentence and a legal death.
But I can't do it myself.
You'll have to do it for me.
You see that?
I tore it out of a law book.
My husband says it would be a blessing if the community would forget...
...what happened.
It just leaves a bad taste, and it reminds everyone of what...
...as the minister said Sunday, would be better forgiven and forgotten.
The mailman was just here.
Shall I go?
Yes, yes, I'm coming.
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Garrett.
Come in.
Have you heard anything from the hotel?
Fred's been down at that investigation for so long.
I wondered if your husband had phoned, or anything.
There, there. Don't worry,
Mrs. Garrett, don't worry.
Nobody's going to cut off their nose to spite their face, naming names in this...
I know, but if somebody does talk, then what'll happen?
Nobody's going to talk.
The responsible businessmen have decided it's a community...
...and not an individual thing.
So everybody's got to stick together against this district attorney.
The whole town's tongue-tied.
Under wraps.
- Protecting its own, naturally.
- Ask anybody!
They'll tell you Joe was there.
Before I can charge anybody with murder...
...I have to prove a murder was committed.
And I can't even find anyone who will swear...
...that at the time the jail burned, your brother was in it at all.
Sorry, boys, but I've got to go back tonight.
Come on, I don't believe she ran out on him.
We got an hour till train time, so we might as well try. We can ask, anyway.
I'll do the talking.
Miss Grant live here?
She's very sick.
She can't talk to anyone.
- Our name's Wilson. We're...
- Oh, his brothers. Come in, come in.
Hello, Katherine.
Katherine!
- It's Charlie.
- And Tom.
This is the way she's been ever since she came home.
Katherine, don't you remember us?
We came from Joe...
We're Joe's brothers.
Joe, Katherine.
You see? It's the same as ev...
Land sakes! Excuse me a second.
I've got broth on the stove.
Charlie, look. She is sick.
- Lf we tell her Joe's all right...
- Shut up!
She can't hear. But it's not fair to her not to know. It might help.
No, no. Let me think.
No. No! No!
Joe! Joe!
No, it's Charlie.
Charlie, Katherine, and Tom.
What is...?
Joe's brothers. Try and remember,
Katherine. Joe's brothers.
Charlie?
Tom?
Oh, Charlie...
...I saw him.
I saw him...
...behind those flames...
...in that burning jail.
His face.
There, dear heart, it's all over now.
The witness.
I'll make them suffer.
I'll get them now, all right.
Why'd you have to come to Capital City?
Why didn't you stay in Chicago?
Your picture will be in the papers.
Somebody will see you.
Nobody will see me because I'll be hiding. I had to be on the scene.
Did you think I was going to wait for letters from you?
I think Joe's right. It's natural, wanting to hear everything as soon as possible.
- Maybe he'll wanna see Katherine.
- Get this straight!
Katherine's not to know I'm alive.
She'd crack. Never go through with it.
She wouldn't see things the way I see them.
I wanna hear everything they say.
I wanna see them squirm the way they made me.
I wanna see them at the end of a rope.
Adams, I've got to hold this party together in this state.
These star-spangled heroics of yours will blow it a mile high.
I've got to proceed with this case as my oath of office requires.
You and your wife and that boy of yours...
Adams, you like to eat, don't you?
Sure, Will.
But some of the things people have had to eat in this country lately...
...haven't agreed with their stomachs.
- But...
Well, who are you going to name?
You can't bring a town full of John Does to trial...
...just to pull yourself to heaven on a publicity stunt.
John Doe is not going to trial, Will...
...but 22 citizens of Strand...
...who I can prove are guilty of murder in the first degree.
Because the law declares that in a lynching...
...all who consent to the design are responsible for what took place.
All who participate are responsible for the act.
This may seem harsh...
...but when a mob takes it upon itself...
...to identify, try, condemn and punish...
...it is a destroyer of a government that patriots died to establish and defend.
Every decent person in the country feels the importance of this case.
The nation is hanging on the outcome of this trial.
No lynching can be justified, though sometimes attempts are made...
...to whitewash them by citing the confessions of...
...or proofs of guilt against, the by now silent corpse.
But no one can dare defend the lynching of an innocent man.
American democracy and its system of fair play for the rights of individuals...
...under the law is on trial here, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
To this end, you must be guided not only by your common sense...
...but by your patriotism.
As counsel for these defendants,
Your Honor...
...ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...I must point out that my clients are not on trial for treason...
...against any philosophy of government...
...as our esteemed district attorney seems to think.
They're on trial for murder.
A charge you will see vanish into thin air here...
...as the state, to cover up its own criminal negligence...
...in not protecting this innocent man, proceeds in this savage attempt...
...to kill as scapegoats...
...these 22 bewildered souls.
These defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder.
We're ready, Your Honor.
Are you ready, Mr. Adams?
With the permission of the court and of my friends for the defense...
...and their experienced associate brought from the city of New York...
...I'll reverse the usual order of procedure...
...and instead of establishing the crime itself...
...first establish the whereabouts of the accused...
...during the commission thereof.
As its first witness, the state calls Edna Hooper.
Raise your right hand and place your left on the Bible.
Do you swear you'll tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- Be seated, please.
- Your name?
- Miss Edna Hooper.
- Your residence, Miss Hooper?
- Twenty-three Catalpa Avenue, Strand.
Strand is the town in which this lynching took place?
Objection! Object as to his incompetence.
- Question assumes a fact not in evidence.
- Sustained. Strike it out.
I will reframe the question.
Strand is where the jail burned down on the night of October 26th, is it not?
Yes, but I certainly had nothing to do with the...
You're not on trial, Miss Hooper.
Your occupation in Strand, please?
I am a couturier and a modiste.
By couturier and modiste, you mean you're a dressmaker, do you not?
It's just the difference between a dress shop and a gown shoppe.
On the afternoon and evening of the day in question...
...you were employed in your capacity as a couturier...
...in the home of Frederick Garrett in Strand, were you not?
- I was.
- Who was in the house beside yourself?
The baby and Mr. And Mrs. Garrett.
And this Mr. Garrett...
...is the same Frederick Garrett who is one of these defendants here?
Yes.
Will Frederick Garrett stand, please?
This man, charged with murder, is the Frederick Garrett who...
...by the testimony of your eyesight,
Miss Hooper...
...was at home that Saturday afternoon and evening, then?
Yes.
I will remind the witness that she is under oath...
...and ask her again.
Edna Hooper, will you swear that during the hours when this indictment...
...charges that this defendant,
Frederick Garrett...
...among others, murdered Joseph Wilson...
...will you swear that during those hours
Garrett was peaceably in his own house?
Yes.
That's all. Thank you.
You can go.
Oh, Miss Hooper, isn't it true that for years...
...you've been a close friend of, and, before she married, roomed with...
...Mrs. Garrett?
- Don't answer that!
But this is a witness for the state, sir, not for the defense.
- I'm sorry, I simply meant to object.
- I withdraw the question.
Miss Franchette...
...you are then the proprietor as well as the hostess...
...of the Green Light Inn?
Well, it's my place, if that's what you mean.
That's just what I mean.
The list, please.
Will the defendants whose names I read stand?
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin.
Miss Franchette, do you recognize these men?
I most certainly do.
Did you see them at any time between 5 and 9 p. M...
...on October 26th in Strand?
And, if so, where?
Well, they were all at my place.
In the café.
From 6 till, oh, 10, 11, anyhow.
And what makes the presence of these particular men stick in your mind?
Because, for once, Mr. Dawson paid the bill.
You mean, by Mr. Dawson, the defendant Kirby Dawson.
Oh, yes.
Two years in jail, not identified with any church.
- Objection!
- Sorry. I was just thinking out loud.
Yeah.
This defendant, Kirby Dawson, according to these notes...
...also known as Bubbles...
...for once paid the bill.
But he or someone else didn't pay you to concoct an alibi for him and his friends...
...by any chance, did they?
- Objection!
Sustained. Strike it out.
I wonder if I haven't been calling the defense witnesses by mistake.
His last remark proves the district attorney...
...hasn't lost his humor, in spite of the fact...
...that his attempt to establish the presence of the defendants...
...at the lynching has either failed or been ridiculed by the defense.
Wait. Just wait.
Thaddus Hummel, Sheriff of Strand
County, is now on the stand.
Can you identify any or all of these defendants...
...as having been in the mob that stormed your jail and burned it...
...thereby burning your prisoner to death?
Objection!
To the latter part of the question as assuming a fact not yet proved.
I will change the question to:
"Who stormed your jail and burned it," then.
No, sir.
I can't identify them.
Can you, then, tell me the names of anyone, other then these defendants...
...among those rioters?
- No, sir.
They must have been men from out of town.
Oh, I see. Foreigners.
I will remind the jury of the easy habit of putting on foreigners...
...events that disturb our conscience.
Or perhaps it was a roving band of redskins. Indians, I mean.
Only red-skinned thing I saw was that tomato...
...that plopped me in the face and made a fool of me.
I must remind the spectators of the dignity of this court.
An injury you suffered put you to bed for a week, sheriff.
How did that happen?
The deputies that stuck with me...
...most of them disappeared...
...and I were holding off the mob as best we could...
...with tear gas and rifle butts...
...when somebody slugged me from behind, and I...
You said, "slugged," "tear gas,"
"rifle butts," "mob. "
After all, this was an attempted lynching then!
- Objection!
- The question was proper!
I disagree! Your constant use of the word lynching...
If counsel's ears were as quick as his objections...
...he'd know I said attempted lynching.
If the state's evidence was as breathtaking as its sarcasm...
...which I suggest is being employed to hide from the jury...
...the failure of its own witnesses to back up its hollow case...
Hooray! Hollow as a busted jug, is what it is!
Quiet, will you?
Remove that man.
- I was just...
- Come here. You're going.
They hadn't ought to treat Uncle Billy that way! Uncle Billy's right!
This is a shame against the good name of our town.
- Bring that man before the court.
- Order in the court. Quiet.
He won't do nothing to me.
I ain't afraid.
Sit down, you. Sit down!
I order you held in contempt with a fine of $ 100...
...or 10 days in the county jail.
I protest against this injustice!
The fine will be $200 or 30 days.
But he can't put me in...
Why, all I said was...
A trial for murder...
...is the most solemn occasion upon which men can be called...
...to perform a public duty.
Any further demonstration and I shall order the courtroom cleared.
- Proceed.
- May it please the court.
The state's own witnesses...
...have not been able to identify these defendants...
...as having even been at the scene of the crime...
...alleged in the indictment.
We must insist that the state give us facts...
...instead of...
...tittle-tattle here.
Your Honor...
...in the last 49 years...
...mobs have lynched
6010 human beings...
...by hanging, burning, cutting, in this proud land of ours.
A lynching about every three days.
And of the many thousands that comprise these mobs...
...only 765 were ever even brought to trial...
...because their supposedly civilized communities...
...have refused to identify them for trial.
Thus becoming as responsible, before God at any rate...
...as the lynchers themselves.
I did not put these representative citizens of Strand on the stand...
...to prove anything, Your Honor, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...except that on their oaths...
...to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so help them God...
...they are liars!
And that their contempt of truth shall not go unpunished...
...I shall ask their indictment for perjury...
...on the same evidence that in one minute...
...will prove the identity of these defendants...
...with that of 22 active members of the mob...
...that stormed and burned the jail and lynched Joseph Wilson!
I shall introduce that evidence now.
Will counsel for the defense please approach the bench?
While the judge is hearing arguments over the admission of evidence...
...I'll take this opportunity to remind you this broadcast is brought to you...
...courtesy of No Make-A Me Fat, that magic dessert...
Flash! Against the objection of the defense...
...the judge has just admitted this evidence, whatever it is!
Stand back, everybody.
Clear the door.
I warn the spectators against any demonstrations.
At the slightest sign of disorder,
I will unhesitatingly clear this court.
- We are ready, Your Honor.
- Proceed.
By stipulation with defense attorneys that this is a true film record...
...taken at Strand by Ted Fitzgerald, in employment as a news cameraman...
...I hereby present this film as state's Exhibit A.
Close the shutters.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- Ready?
- Let it run.
Defendant number one,
Kirby Dawson...
...who, according to testimony, was in the Green Light Inn...
...during the hours of the commission of this crime.
A stop action of the scene.
Defendant number two,
Mrs. Sally Humphries...
...who, according to testimony...
...during the hours of this crime was on the farm of her fiancé.
We identify her by stop action of the same shot.
The first brand that transformed that jail into a blazing stake...
...for Joseph Wilson.
The fire department courageously tried to extinguish those flames...
...but overwhelming numbers fought them back.
While in the meantime, the defendant Frederick Garrett...
...peaceably armed with an ax, destroyed the efforts of the officials...
...to save the life of an innocent man.
The enlarged stop action...
No, no! It's not true. He...
Order in the court! Order!
Order in the court!
- Come on. We're gonna be late.
- Couldn't get a car. There's a crowd.
That's all. That's all.
- Do you feel better today?
- Don't worry.
- Second floor. Traffic Court.
- Pardon me.
- Got a cigarette, Tom?
- Sure.
Peanuts.
Judge Hopkins' Court.
Come on. We're getting out too.
The last the sheriff, the jailer, or anyone else saw of him was before the fire.
I must insist on my question.
Who proved that Joseph Wilson was in that jail at the time it burned?
- The jailer threw the keys down.
- Are you ready?
Isn't there the possibility the prisoner angled for those keys and escaped?
- Are you ready?
- We say that possibility exists.
It's up to the state to prove it false.
Is the state prepared to proceed?
We call Katherine Grant to the stand.
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- Be seated, please.
State your name, residence and occupation, please.
Katherine Hrant.
I'm a teacher in the
Washington Public School here.
I live at 96 Oak Street.
With your parents, Miss Grant?
My father and mother are dead.
Your relationship to Joseph Wilson was?
We were going to be married.
Will you tell the jury, in your own way...
...what happened on October 26th.
I fixed a little lunch of things
I thought he'd like.
With flowers on the table...
...and some salted...
...peanuts. He always liked peanuts.
Are you able to go on, Miss Grant?
Certainly I can go on.
I went to meet him at Sycamore Corners.
On the way, I bought him some neckties for a present.
He liked blue.
He never thought of buying things like that for himself.
And then I stopped at the minister's to remind him...
...that Joe and I would be there at 4:00, and not to forget.
We'd been away from each other so long.
More than a year.
And I... I loved him so.
I turn the witness over to the defense.
Miss Hrant. According to the fact of psychology...
...that under great emotional stress the mind sees what it has expected to...
...whether the thing is actually there or not...
...is it not possible that you did not see Joseph Wilson...
...but only the image of him your imagination had created in your head?
No, I saw him. I saw him burning to death there!
You can see that picture now too, can't you?
- I'll always see it.
- So perhaps after all...
...it was an hallucination of your tortured mind that you saw there...
...just as you see it here.
What do you want me to say, yes or no? I tell you I saw him.
Can you, from your own personal knowledge...
...swear that Joseph Wilson is dead?
Why, no. That is, yes.
- I mean, one can assume.
- Excuse me...
...but that is exactly what must not be assumed, but proved!
The state is asking the lives of 22 people for one.
I don't care about the lives of 22 people!
They can't bring back the life I cared about.
I only wish I hadn't fainted. I wish I could have gone in there to him. With him.
That's all, Miss Grant.
I will remind the jury that under the law...
...lives must not be taken on assumptions but on facts!
Where is the corpse of Joseph Wilson?
The law is that the corpus delicti must be established...
...at least by fragments of the human body...
...or of articles known and proved to have been worn by the deceased.
And in the absence of convincing proof of the corpus delicti...
...I move this indictment be wiped off the records...
...and the charges against these defendants be dismissed.
I shall take the motion for dismissal under advisement until tomorrow...
...and hear the state's arguments then.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...I have received an object...
...which, if authentic...
...must be considered as evidence in this case.
As to its authenticity, I am not permitted to have an opinion.
However, in order to present it to you...
...I must take the witness stand.
Mr. Clerk...
...please swear me.
Do you swear that you'll tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- Please be seated.
This is a special delivery letter postmarked...
...in this city at 11 p. m. Last night...
...and addressed "Judge Daniel Hopkins,
Hall of Justice, Courtroom 10."
Is this the letter you received,
Your Honor?
It is.
The communication is not handwritten.
It is formed by letters cut from a newspaper...
...and pasted together to spell words.
It is, ladies and gentlemen, the confession of a tortured conscience.
Listen.
"I can't hide the truth any longer.
I am a citizen of Strand who helped clean up the jail mess.
In the ashes,
I found this enclosed ring.
Nobody knew it, so I was keeping it for a mement... Memento.
But it is upsetting my conscience.
I don't dare sign this, or I would probably get lynched myself.
A citizen of Strand. "
I now draw your attention to this ring.
It's gold, melted and misshapen, as if by fire.
Inside the ring is an engraved inscription, reading...
I can decipher only the words...
..."Henry to K."
The rest is melted out.
But after that word, I can plainly read...
...in a different style of engraving...
..."To Joe," obviously meaning...
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Since when have anonymous letters become gospel in law?
Who can say that ring was the property of Joseph Wilson?
What proof is there that it was found...
...as that concocted letter would have us believe?
Who sent that letter?
A man afraid to sign his name.
I believe that this fraud is a fabrication of some soul...
...poisoned with hostility toward these defendants!
The state recalls
Katherine Grant to the stand.
I will remind you, Miss Grant, you've already sworn to tell the truth.
Have you ever seen this ring before?
- Yes.
- Where and when?
In the railroad station in Chicago.
When I was leaving to come here.
I gave it to Joe.
What did Joseph Wilson do with it when you gave it to him?
He put it on his little finger.
It was too small for any other finger.
How can you be sure this ring is the one you gave him...
...and saw him put on his little finger there?
Because it was my mother's.
It had engraved "Henry," my father's name...
..."to Katherine," which was my mother's name too.
After the "Katherine"...
...I had it engraved...
..."to Joe. "
I want to confess!
Let me go!
I threw stones at him!
I helped kill him!
I'm guilty! We're all guilty!
Let me ask her to forgive me!
Please, please, forgive me!
Forgive me!
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
Forgive me!
...there is your answer to this case!
That letter cinched it for us, didn't it?
Yeah, why?
It was certainly lucky for us that it showed up...
...wasn't it?
- Stop talking about it.
I mean...
...where does it get you?
- Why didn't you tell me Joe was alive?
- What?
- Are you crazy?
- I know he's alive, Charlie. I know.
Will you shut your mouth?
You can't keep me quiet.
What's happened to him?
Does he realize what he's done?
What we've all done?
- Where is he?
- You saw him.
You saw him in that fire.
Why ask me?
You testified, not me. I wasn't there.
You're losing your mind again.
Of course.
Of course you're right.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
Of course you're right.
He's dead.
But I haven't slept for so long.
I want to go.
I can't listen to any more.
I want to go home.
It was that letter that made her jump.
I don't know...
You're trying to make yourself important.
- Katherine suspicious? You're daffy!
- I'm daffy!
Take a look at your radio.
I tell you, that letter...
That letter was the best idea I ever had.
Yeah. Almost cost me my finger getting that ring off.
But it was worth it. It would have been worth the whole hand. Two hands.
Tom, why don't you stick with me?
You know as well...
Yeah, you're right.
What's the use of fighting with him?
Anyway, she's home now.
We got the landlady to put her to bed.
Must have been some sensation when that woman collapsed.
They could stand seeing me burned to death.
- They can't stand an honest trial.
- Cut it out!
I can't stand it!
I can't hear any more!
You haven't been watching them.
You didn't look in their eyes.
- Yellow-livered welsher, sorry for them.
- You're as bad! You're lynching me!
It's getting me too. I wish I hadn't started the whole thing. I was with you.
But I got a feeling you talked me into something.
If I could think of a way out...
Why don't you snitch on me!
- Nobody's talking about that!
- I am! I can't stand it any longer!
Be human, Joe.
We can get out of the country, start over.
But let's tell them the truth.
Let's tell them you're alive!
I'll kill you first.
You might as well kill me too.
You brought her here, you lying...
No, Joe. I followed them!
I knew you were alive when I saw your letter. Why not kill me! Do a good job!
What difference does it make?
Twenty-two, 23, 25!
- Listen to me, Joe.
- No!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to talk that way.
Joe, I understand how you feel...
...and I understand why you feel that way.
When I thought you were dead...
...when I thought of what killed you,
I wanted revenge too.
But now I don't.
I want to be happy again. I want what we've always promised each other.
You ought to have violins playing when you talk.
- I know what I want, and I'm getting it!
- You're hanging 22 people!
No, I'm not. I'm hanging 22 rats for something they did do.
- These are 22 human beings.
- Yeah.
- They live and breathe.
- Like me in the jail, for instance!
They're not murderers.
They were part of a mob.
- A mob doesn't think. It hasn't time.
- What about the guy in jail? He can think.
All right, it's his turn. Let them know what it means to be lynched.
- Don't you think they know by now?
- No.
What you've felt for a few hours, they've had to face for days and weeks!
Wishing, with all their souls, they could have that one day to live over again.
Joe...
...don't you see?
We can be together and be happy.
Let me go with you to the judge.
And then we can start all over again.
Stop thinking about them.
Think about me.
I am thinking about you.
About what a swell guy you were...
...when you were alive.
- When I was alive?
If those people die, Joe Wilson dies.
You know that.
Wherever you go. Whatever you do.
I couldn't marry you now, Joe.
I couldn't marry a dead man.
All right, then, all right!
I don't need anybody!
Nobody!
Maybe this is crazy.
I can't help thinking we'd be better off if you hadn't escaped.
That's what you can't help thinking?
Who cares?
This is a big night.
I ought to be celebrating.
And that's what I'm gonna do too!
Celebrate. Alone!
From now on, I'm gonna do everything alone! I don't need any of you!
Hey.
- Yes?
- This stuff's weak.
- Get me bourbon.
- Sorry, sir...
...but with the kind of license we have here, it's against the law.
All right. Give me a check.
- I'm sorry, sir, if you feel...
- No. It's all right. It's just, it's too noisy.
I don't like crowded places.
Are you planning to do a lot of running around in this room?
Have a good time...
...and bye-bye.
Come in, mister.
- What's your pleasure?
- Double bourbon.
Yes, sir.
Midnight, and another day.
Two pages must've got hanged together.
Do a good job of it!
What does it matter?
Twenty-two, 23, 25!
Katherine! Katherine!
Katherine, don't leave me alone.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...have you agreed upon a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
You will hand the verdict to the bailiff.
We find in the case of the people of the state versus the defendants...
...charged with the murder of Joseph
Wilson as set forth in the indictment.
Jasper Anderson, not guilty.
Gilbert Clark, not guilty.
Richard Durkin, guilty.
Walter Dubbs, guilty.
Kirby Dawson, guilty.
Frederick Garrett, guilty.
- Walter Gordon, guilty.
- No, no! I'm not. Not me!
Go ahead, go ahead, get it over with!
Order in the court!
Your Honor, I am Joseph Wilson.
Keep your seats!
- Go on.
- I know that by coming here...
...I saved the lives of these 22 people.
But that isn't why I'm here. I don't care anything about saving them.
They're murderers. I know the law says they're not because I'm still alive.
But that's not their fault.
And the law doesn't know that a lot of things that were very important to me...
...silly things, maybe, like a belief in justice...
...and an idea that men were civilized...
...and a feeling of pride that this country of mine was different from all others.
The law doesn't know those things were burned to death within me that night.
I came here today for my own sake.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
I couldn't stop thinking about them, with every step and every breath I took.
And I didn't believe Katherine when she said...
Katherine is the young lady who was going to marry me.
Maybe someday after
I've paid for what I did...
...there'll be a chance to begin again.
And then maybe...
...Katherine and I...
- Joe.

Dad said in his letter you were here for a holiday.
Yes, only business in Paris is vacation.
Well, you deserve one after that job in London.
All the papers were full of it.
Papers exaggerate importance of humble efforts.
I wired Dad I'd take good care of you.
We're gonna have a great time.
So kind.
But first one little item of business.
- Must open account at Lamartine Bank.
- Oh, that's easy.
I'll arrange an appointment for you to meet the head oft he bank himself.
- Paul Lamartine?
- None other. I work there, you know.
Dad's one of the directors, so it occurred to him that I should go and do likewise.
- You are bank director?
- Oh, no. In 20 years maybe.
Dad had the old-fashioned idea that
I ought to start at the bottom and work up.
Yes, young bird must learn to fly.
Every day from 9:00 till 5:00.
But after that, my time's my own.
And I'm going to spend it getting you into mischief.
Mischief sounds nice.
Then you will arrange interview... when?
- Tomorrow morning at 10:00.
- That is very good.
Oh, you're not going.
How about a little drink?
No, thank you.
Some other time.
- Oh, wait a minute, Charlie.
Here are some friends of mine.
One of them is very important.
- Yes?
- I want you to meet her.
What is this?
What do you want?
- Boo! We want a drink.
Don't we, old partner?
We certainly do.
- Hello, darling.
- I'll put you down right here.
May I introduce Mr. Chan?
Miss Lamartine.
- How do you do?
- Miss Jacquard.
- How do you do?
- And Mr. Max Corday.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Chan is from Honolulu an old friend of my father's here on a vacation.
Ah?
[ Imitating Chinese Accent]
Me very happy know you.
Maybe you "likee havee" little "dlinkee".
Very happy to make acquaintance of charming gentleman.
Me no "likee dlinkee" now...
"Pelaps" later.
- Oh, now I know I need a drink.
Help yourself.
There's a cold bottle right there.
- Good.
- Me "likee dlinkee" now.
- All "light", Ming Toy.
Charlie, Yvette is the important one.
- Much pleasure to meet.
- Thank you.
- Youth tonic for old blood.
- Why, you're not old at all.
Maybe not heart, but joints sometime argue matter.
- Charlie, we're engaged.
- Oh, that is good. May I congratulate?
- Thank you.
- Company, forward march.
- Company, halt. One, two.
In excitement of happy party, will not forget appointment at bank?
Oh, Victor Descartes never forgets. Do I, darling?
Leave it to Victor always to get more business in the family bank.
- Why not?
- To Mr. Chan's holiday in Paris.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you so much.
You will excuse, please? Must go now.
Ah, wait a minute. Oh, don't move, Mr. Chan.
Hold it just a minute now...
- Oh, he's at it again.
- That's right, Mr. Chan. Hold it there.
A few swift bold strokes.
There you are.
A little souvenir of your first night in Paris.
Most clever, excellent likeness of rotund Chinese.
- I may keep?
By all means. Why, someday those little sketches of Max Corday... may be priceless treasures.
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you so much.
Must not intrude any longer.
- Oh, come along, Charlie. Why not join us?
- Yes, do.
- We'd love to have you.
- Some other time, please.
Have heard so much about thrilling dancer at Le Singe Bleu.
Have desire to see.
Great. I know.
If Mr. Chan won't join us, we'll join him.
- Good idea?
- Great idea!
Absolutely. Then, well, here's to Le Singe Bleu.
[ All ]
Le Singe Bleu.
-This is it! Le Singe Bleu!
- Folks, here we are.
- Humpty Dumpty, come on.
- Come on, Mr. Chan.
- Thank you so much.
Come on, darling.
Oh, here, here! Look out, you, where you're going.
You think the sidewalk belongs to you?
Aw, none of that now or I'll call a policeman.
Wait just a minute, old man. Here.
Here, old fella. Run along and buy yourself a drink. And don't be so belligerent.
- We're not the enemy you know.
- Thank you.
What a horrible man!
Yes, most unfortunate.
Well, pardon the interruption, folks.
Let's not have it spoil the fun.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Let's go inside.
- He's at it again.
- All right?
- Very good.
- Do you like?
- [Charlie] Very nice.
And you... How do you like my bold strokes, my darling?
Not too bold.
Oh, that was lovely.
Too bad you don't dance, Mr. Chan.
Mud turtle in pond more safe than man on horseback.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have that little star... whose interpretation of the dance Apache...
I know will thrill you...
Mademoiselle Nardi.
- [ Man ] What in the world could that be?
Victor, what was that?
- What's the matter?
- Please stand back. Take your seats.
Please! Please!
Please!
- Very important.
- [Woman ] Well, what's happened?
[Woman ]
She's dying! Get a doctor!
Nardi.
Nardi.
Look... in... apartment...
Yes, yes?
Nardi. Nardi!
Am so sorry.
[Man ] Don't ask any questions.
Open the door.
[Man #2]
Yes, sir.
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.
Well, a pretty swell apartment.
Look for all letters, papers, photographs, address books.
I'll examine them at my office.
Find anything?
The usual things... and a recipe for apple pie.
Mmm.
Great work, Laverne.
Chinese incense burner.
Reminds me, my old friend
Charlie Chan's in town.
I wonder what he's doing.
He solved the stable murder mystery in London, didn't he?
Yes.
Great work it was, too.
Yes.
Great work it was, too.
You'd better come along with me.
I'll leave Pierre to keep an eye out in the hall.
Thank you so much.
Come out, please.
Who are you?
Hello, Pop! What's the matter?
Did I scare you?
Gosh, it's good to see you.
Heart most joyful to welcome.
[ Chuckles ]
Honorable mother send me cable from Honolulu... saying big boss send you to Europe on buying trip.
Did not expect to see worthy offspring so soon.
- Business good?
- Fine.
I was in Rome when
I heard you were coming here.
So I finished my business in a hurry and hopped a train.
- Now we can see Paris together.
- Yes, yes. [ Chuckles ]
Most welcome.
Say, you're looking great.
Most fortunate to be looking at all.
What do you mean?
Attempt on life in last hour... indicate this humble person unwelcome in gay city.
Say, I thought you were here on a vacation.
Vacation only bluff. Am here on case for London banking house.
Let me stay and help you, Dad.
No.
You here for good time.
Go find same.
Joy in heart more desirable than bullet.
She was honorable coworker... murdered tonight before we could have talk.
That settles it, Dad. If somebody's gunning for you, I'm staying here.
- No.
- Please.
Thank you so much.
But you must admit there is foundation for my doubt... that you came here especially to see me.
I am not easily deceived, you know.
You old darling, you know I can twist you right around my finger.
Well, how much is it today?
Oh, shall we be quite reasonable and say, uh, a thousand francs?
Anything... just to be rid of you.
There.
Receipt, please.
[Man Chuckles]
Well, hello, stranger.
Where have you been?
- How are you, Albert?
- Uh, this requires your signature.
- I'll look it over.
- I haven't seen you in ages.
- Won't you come in and visit me for a while?
-Yes, of course.
Now, young lady, I'm going to make you give an account of yourself.
Sit down.
Cigarette?
Thank you.
- You used to come in and see me quite often.
- That was a long time ago.
- I've missed you.
- Now, you're not going to start that again.
Please don't.
You know Victor and I are engaged.
Yes. Some fellows have all the luck.
Have you, uh, told him about us?
He knows we went around quite a bit.
But does he know about your letters?
Letters?
Oh, you mean those foolish, silly love letters.
Might not sound so foolish and silly to Victor.
- You haven't kept them.
- I treasure them.
Albert, you shouldn't.
You must tear them up.
You've got to.
I've got a better idea.
I'll deliver them to you in person some evening... at my apartment.
I didn't think you could be so contemptible.
Well, it was just an idea.
- Wait here. Observe closely.
- Observe what?
Don't know. Good detective never ask what and why until after he see.
Okay, Pop.
I mean, yes, sir.
- Oh, good morning, Miss Lamartine.
- Good morning, Mr. Chan.
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
Where can I find
Mr. Victor Descartes?
Right over there, sir.
Third window.
You young fool, the statement's wrong.
It's a swindle.
I always knew this place was a nest of thieves.
I always knew this place was a nest of thieves.
-Well, if there's some mistake...
- I'll have every one of you in jail... starting with that swine Dufresne.
I tell you, I've been cheated.
I demand to see Dufresne.
If l can't see him,
I'll see Lamartine himself.
- What's the trouble here?
- Mr. Xavier is complaining that-
I tell you, I demand to see the managing director.
I've been grossly swindled, and it's an outrage.
- I want to see Dufresne.
- I am the office manager.
Oh, I don't want to do business with small fry-
- That'll do.
- Take you hands off me!
Don't be rough with him.
Just put him outside.
You imbeciles!
I'll have the law on you for this.
You can't do this to me.
Why, I'm an old soldier of the Republic.
You've cheated me and robbed me! Pigs!
- Get along or I'll call the police.
- You mean, I'll call the police.
I'll get justice.
Then I'll land you all in jail.
- Good morning.
- Oh, hello, Charlie.
- Mr. Latouche.
- Yes, what’s it?
- This is Mr. Chan.
- Oh, Mr. Chan. Yes.
Mr. Descartes told me about your appointment with Mr. Lamartine.
I am the office manager.
Will you come this way?
I must apologize for such an unpleasant scene.
- Apology not necessary.
- Xavier, poor fellow-
He's hardly human, an unfortunate relic of the war. Shell shock.
Xavier. [ Chuckles ]
He has odd name.
Yes, yes. Xavier.
Marcel Xavier.
Of course, the bank, as a rule, doesn't deal with such petty accounts as his... but Mr. Lamartine's sympathetic nature-
He's such a fine man, sir.
Kindness in heart better than gold in bank.
- Excuse me. Come in.
- Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Lamartine's in conference, sir, with Mr. Dufresne.
That's quite all right, Bedell.
After you, Mr. Chan.
Mr. Lamartine, this is Mr. Chan.
You had an appointment.
- How are you, sir?
- So glad to meet.
This is Mr. Dufresne,
Mr. Chan.
- How do you do?
- Much pleasure to meet.
Won’t you sit down,
Mr. Chan?
Thank you so much.
Well, Mr. Chan, what can I do for you?
You're here on a holiday,
I understand.
Uh, business too.
About, uh, bonds of this bank.
Our bonds are the best investment in France today, eh, Dufresne?
None better. And now we have a new issue off ours, Mr. Chan.
Pardon, please.
Uh, business about last bond issue.
Please forgive deception about vacation.
- Uh, business very serious for you.
- What do you mean?
Clients in England who buy many of these bonds... send me here to investigate fraud in your bank.
Fraud... in my bank?
These will explain.
Note, numbers are same... but printing not quite.
There must be some mistake.
Hmm, the printing varies unquestionably.
It is a forgery.
Signature not forgery.
It is my signature.
How can such a thing be possible?
Someone must have included these with the real bonds at the time you signed them.
There are six pairs.
Each of a different thousand.
That means that this business has run through the entire issue.
[Lamartine]
What are we going to do?
Investigate.
That is why I am here.
If this becomes known, there will be a panic.
Thousands of people will suffer.
Clients in London of same opinion.
Secrecy most necessary.
Even police must not know.
What do you want us to do, Mr. Chan?
First step, must have complete list of all sales of this issue.
You shall have it within 24 hours.
I'll make a check-up of the other banks immediately.
Good. Meantime, am stopping at Hotel Mazarin.
- Well, can I drop you off?
- No, thank you. Have car waiting.
I'll let you know what I find.
Be assured, we'll help you to get to the bottom of this, Mr. Chan.
Must turn up many stones to find hiding place of snake.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- We must follow.
- Who? Him?
Important fox must not know hounds pursue.
Charlie, my friend.
Well, how are you? How are you?
Now, what are you up to in Paris?
- Up to holiday. See Paris, die happy.
- Good.
Well, it'll only take a moment to deposit my monthly insult, and then we'll make a day of it.
We'll talk shop at the department, have a good time... and then tonight, the best dinner in France.
- [ Chuckling ] Excuse, please-
- Now, no excuses.
I'm a dangerous man to offend, and if you don't come along, I shall be offended.
Only foolish man waste words when argument is lost.
[ Chuckles ]
Excuse me.
Then we can take in Egypt and the pyramids in the moonlight and all that.
And after Egypt, well... if there's any place you'd like to go, we might take that in too.
I suppose the bride-to-be has something to say about our honeymoon trip.
Say, you act as though you were in Egypt right now.
- You haven't heard a word I've said.
- Oh, of course I have.
You were saying that, uh-
- Well, what were you saying?
- Is anything the matter?
- Oh, nothing, really.
- Have I said anything?
Oh, of course not.
I need some sleep, that's all.
We've been out late every night this week.
Well, if that's all it is, you can sleep late tomorrow.
- Come on. Let's go somewhere and dance.
- No. My mind's made up.
I'm going to get some sleep.
Tomorrow night then?
- I suppose I could be persuaded.
- [ Chuckles ]
I persuaded you to become engaged to me, didn't I?
Of course I had nothing to say about that.
Nothing at all, except to say yes.
Home, James.
Oh, home it is then.
Oh, here we are.
I'll get my key.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Say it.
- I won't say it... because you know perfectly well that I love you.
Good night.
Taxi!
Number 8, Lafayette Place.
- Hello.
- [ Man ] Is that you, Dufresne?
- Oh, uh, hello.
- Did that money come in today?
Yes, uh, two million francs.
It's in my box at the bank.
Why didn't you meet me as we planned?
With that Chinese snooping around?
Are you certain that money's in your box?
Of course I'm certain.
What are you driving at?
Then why are you taking the midnight plane to Switzerland?
Why, uh, to head off Garon before he tries to sell... that last series of bonds you printed, that's why.
We've got to be more careful until this thing cools down.
I think you're lying to me, Dufresne.
- I'm not lying. I'm using my head.
- [ Hangs Up]
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, uh, it's you.
Come in.
I had fallen asleep while reading.
- I'm sorry I disturbed you.
- That's perfectly all right. I'm glad you came.
- Won’t you sit down?
- No, thanks.
I've come for my letters.
May I have them?
Why, certainly. You didn't believe
I was really going to keep them.
-Well, what else was I to think?
- I'll prove that you're wrong.
Then you're really going to give them back to me?
Of course. They're right here in my desk waiting for you.
I'm not the big bad wolf you thought I was.
There you are, my dear.
- [Yvette Screams]
- What was that noise?
I heard a pistol shot in there.
- Will you please go and get a policeman?
-Yes, sir.
- I'm pretty sure.
- What's the matter in here?
-[Woman ] I heard a pistol.
-[Woman #2] I thought it was in the street.
[Woman ]
I'm pretty sure it was in here.
Now get in here.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
- [ Gasps ]
- What's happened here?
It's murder.
- She killed him.
- I didn't kill him!
- Look, here's the gun.
- Don't touch that!
- Don't let her get away.
- I'm not trying to get away!
Police headquarters.
[Charlie]
Then you have theory as to who kill Nardi?
During the last few weeks this girl has been seen with some of the richest men in town.
Why, listen to these names-
Emanuel Castaneda from the Argentine.
Paul Dorville, French financier.
Albert Dufresne, banker.
And a half a dozen others.
Men worth millions.
And one of these do murder?
Oh, no, Charlie. No.
Here, let me show you.
A beautiful girl like Nardi couldn't go around with the men she did... without stepping on some other woman's toes.
All right, somewhere, sometime she aroused the jealousy... of some discarded sweetheart who determined to kill her.
A woman familiar with Nardi's act.
A clever, intelligent woman... smart enough to conceal and execute a fairly ingenious crime.
It's a perfect case.
- Hmm. Only one small detail missing.
-Yes, what's that?
Murder.
Perfect case, like perfect doughnut, has hole.
[ Chuckles ] Oh, I see.
Same old pessimist, aren't you?
Optimist only sees doughnut.
Pessimist sees hole.
Yes, he's here.
Just a moment, please.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.
- Police headquarters on the telephone for you.
- Oh, thank you, Pierre.
Excuse me, Charlie, please.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yes.
Renard speaking.
Who?
Where?
Yes, yes, of course.
I'll come myself at once.
Yes.
Pierre, my check please.
- Yes, sir.
-Well, Charlie... here's where I plug the hole in your doughnut.
Not satisfied with killing the woman who stole her sweetheart... our murderess has now shot the man who threw her over.
And this woman is?
Yvette Lamartine, daughter of the banker.
- Must make correction, please.
- Well, go ahead.
Impossible Miss Lamartine kill Nardi.
- Impossible? Why?
- Last night she with me when Nardi killed.
- With you?
- That is hole in first doughnut.
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
All right, Charlie, it was just a guess.
But there is no hole in this one.
They have caught her... practically red-handed.
- We go see?
- Right.
- You have all their names and addresses?
-Yes, sir.
You'll be called when your testimony is required. No one is to leave the city.
You may go now.
So you continue to refuse to tell me the real reason for your visit to this apartment?
I merely dropped in to say hello.
We were friends.
Friends? How long had you known Mr. Dufresne?
Since he became my father's assistant two years ago.
Oh, come now, Miss Lamartine.
Please, let's be reasonable.
You don't expect us to believe your fantastic story of a mysterious, black-gloved hand...
- which you say threw a gun into this room.
- I told you the truth.
You were discovered with a gun in your hand from which one shot had been fired.
You made a desperate effort to escape.
Aren't those the facts?
- Why, I was-
- Aren't those the facts?
- Yes.
- Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
How long had you been on intimate terms with Albert Dufresne?
I'd rather not understand you.
How long have you been in the habit of paying visits at this apartment at night alone?
- I refuse to answer such a question.
- Very well then.
Another little question-
Why did you kill Albert Dufresne?
I didn't kill him.
I told you what happened.
The shot was fired from in there, and someone threw the gun into this room.
You came here tonight because he was going away. He was tired of you.
- In a fit of jealousy, you shot him.
- It isn't true!
I didn't do it!
I didn't kill him!
- Ready, Gaston?
- Ready, sir.
Fingerprint her.
Have Marchand compare them.
Yes, sir.
Over here, please.
This way, please.
Place the three fingers of the right hand on this pad.
Then press them on this paper.
- Come on.
- [ Laughing ]
Albert! Whoo-hoo!
Come on, honey.
Albert-
It's all right.
- Say, what's going on around here?
- You'll be properly informed.
Now, look here.
I come to see my friend Albert... and I find the place surrounded by hundreds of policemen.
What is this?
Wewant to see Albert.
Albert Dufresne is dead.
Murdered.
[Gasps]
Did I... understand you to say...
Albert has been murdered?
Yes. You say you are a friend of his.
A very good friend.
Laverne, take down this gentleman's answers to my questions.
That's all, thank you.
[Whispering ]
You have good reason for coming here?
[Whispering ]
I didn't kill him, Mr. Chan. I didn't.
Very easy to believe you.
But facts now very necessary.
You are engaged to very nice young man.
You must have had reason for presence here.
Why, I-
Desire to help if can.
Then... will you take these for me?
- Shall I destroy?
- Please. Please.
Answer no more questions.
Silence big sister to wisdom.
- [ Buzzer Buzzes ]
- See who that is.
- Why, is something wrong?
- Step inside, please.
You may go now.
I beg your pardon... but this murder has been a great shock to me.
Murder?
- Not Mr. Dufresne.
- Come in, please.
I'll answer all your questions.
Good evening, Mr. Chan.
- When did it happen? Who did it?
- Just who are you?
I'm Henri Latouche of the Lamartine Bank,
Mr. Dufresne's close associate.
I came in to see him on a matter of importance connected with-
Sit down, please.
I'll question you later.
"2-8-C-G"-
Hmm.
- All through, Gaston?
- All through, sir.
- Well?
- The fingerprints on the gun are hers, all right.
There's a small scar on her right thumb which makes identification easy.
Good. All right, that's all.
Take her away.
Why,
Miss Lamartine-
Well, Charlie?
You believe young lady guilty?
Don't you?
Hasty conclusion like gunpowder- easy to explode.
Oh. All right, Charlie. Let's have it.
What have you found?
Answer in there.
But I've already inspected this room.
[ Chuckles ]
And I looked out here too.
- Find nothing?
- Not a thing.
No burnt match, no monogrammed cigarette stub... not even threads torn from a tweed suit.
Uh, flowers maybe say something.
Flowers?
What do you mean?
Well, by George, look at that.
That stem must have been broken during the last hour.
Why, the flower's not even wilted.
It looks as if someone may have come up here by this balcony.
That is hole in second doughnut.
Mmm.
Comfort of bed now most desirable.
I see.
You can't take it, Charlie, can you?
Charlie Chan very sleepy.
This is terrible,
Mr. Chan, terrible.
Isn't there something that I can do?
Just take it easy, old man.
I'll be with you in just a moment.
It's an open-and-shut case.
In spite of your doughnuts, that young lady is going to find it very difficult... to explain her fingerprints on that gun.
Very difficult to explain hole in doughnut, but hole always there.
[ Laughing ]
We'll see about that.
- [ Speaking Chinese]
- [ Speaking Chinese]
I know you did not kill anybody.
I'm sorry, Pop. But I got a lot to tell you.
I made notes.
- Tell me on way.
- Okay, Pop.
- Say, Pop, I-
- Wait, please. You watch here all evening?
- Sure. And I saw-
- Please.
Perhaps you see man on crutches come out.
Maybe after you hear gunshot?
Yeah. The same guy I saw at the bank this morning. How'd you know?
- You follow?
- I'll say I did.
He got into an old taxi and I trailed it.
I never let it out of my sight.
He stopped about five miles from here... a limousine pulled up alongside and he got into it.
- Can you beat that?
- [ Charlie ] What happened next?
[Son ] I stepped on the gas and got close enough to spot the car's number.
But it was a high-powered baby and it got away from me.
Mmm. Eyes of kitten open only after nine days.
Wait a minute!
That isn't all.
When I came back to Dufresne's apartment,
I saw the same limousine.
I checked the license plate.
Some guy came out with a girl, they got into it and drove away.
- Man have walking stick?
- Yes.
Girl have small, round hat?
- That's them. Do you know 'em?
- Man is artist.
He draws very funny pictures.
Why, hello, Mr. Chan.
Come in. Glad to see you.
- Here. Let me have your hat.
- Thank you so much.
Well, this is a surprise.
This time I'm not going to ask you to have a "dlinkie," but I want you to have a drink.
- Much pleasure.
- Sit down, please.
Thank you so much.
You know, Mr. Chan,
I'm all broken up about this thing.
Albert Dufresne was one of my closest friends.
Can you imagine Yvette Lamartine doing a thing like that?
Excuse, please.
Miss Lamartine did not kill.
Guilty man is crippled soldier named Marcel Xavier.
Maybe you can give me information.
I?
[ Chuckles ]
Why, gladly, of course, if I can.
But, uh, why me?
Tonight, after murder...
Xavier come from Dufresne apartment, depart in taxicab... and later get into your car.
My car?
You mean to say that this man used my car? For what?
Maybe to take off disguise.
I don't understand.
Oh, I see.
This Xavier character is only a disguise for the murderer.
He commits his crime... escapes in a taxi... uses somebody's car in which to take of fhis makeup... and then steps out in his true character with no one the wiser.
That's not a bad idea!
[ Chuckling ]
- Very clever idea.
- Yes.
Oh, say. You didn't come up here thinking I might be Xavier.
Like all detectives, must consider every possibility.
[ Laughing ]
Well, it's a lucky thing for me... that Xavier bumped into me last night in front of that café.
- You remember.
- Oh, yes, yes. Yes.
- Please forgive stupid error.
- Why, certainly, Mr. Chan.
- All's forgiven.
- I must go now. So sorry to disturb.
I'm sorry I couldn't have been any more help to you.
On contrary.
Have been most helpful.
Oh, your hat.
- Thank you so much. Good night.
- Good night.
- Wait a minute.
- What's the idea?
You are leaving on long journey?
- Why, I, uh-
- Inside, please.
Little keyhole big friend to stupid detective.
Have you found something, Dad?
Broken bank seal found at Dufresne apartment... matches perfectly with this broken seal.
That man is murderer.
This washes the case up, doesn't it, Dad?
- He killed Dufresne and the dancer Nardi.
- No.
Night Nardi killed, this man with me.
Must find murderer of Nardi.

- C-1-9-3-3-7, series "M."
- Right.
D-3-1-2-8-6, series "L."
- D-3-1-2-8-6, series "L."
- Right.
I had to break a date with Lucille tonight, darn the luck.
- Wonder what the idea of the bond checkup is.
- I don't know.
Old Lamartine's been buzzing about all day like a fly with one wing.
[Bedell ]
But it's impossible, Mr. Chan.
I have no authority to give you
Mr. Xavier's address.
Assure you, matter most important.
No, I can't, and I won't.
That's final, Mr. Chan.
What is so final, Bedell?
Perhaps I can be of service.
Most humble apologies, make so much trouble.
But desire to know where can find Marcel Xavier.
May I ask why,
Mr. Chan?
This morning I hear him make threat against man now dead.
So he did.
So he did.
Get Xavier's card at once.
Of course you're going to arrest him.
Canary bird out of cage may fly far.
Ah, poor Dufresne.
What a tragedy.
To be shot down in the very prime of life.
He was a splendid man,
Mr. Chan.
A splendid man.
Ah, here we are.
Marcel Xavier.
Rue de Pont number 17.
Rather a nasty neighborhood,
Mr. Chan.
Charlie!
Been looking all over for you.
We've got to help Yvette.
Isn't there something you can do?
I don't believe she killed him.
Even if she was in his apartment, she must have had good reason for being there.
Faith is best foundation for happy future.
Then you don't think she did it either?
Can assure you young lady is innocent.
I knew it! Oh, she couldn't have done it, Charlie.
But innocence must be proven.
You would like to help?
Would I?
I-I-I'd do anything.
- I'd tear up the stones in the street.
- Not necessary.
You can please help me to this address?
"Rue de Pont 17.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go.
That phone's been ringing for 10 minutes.
It's getting on my nerves!
Don't open your mouth.
Hello?
- [ Man ] Is that you, Corday?
- Yes.
That meddling Chinese is on his way to Xavier's. I'll meet you there.
All right.
Who was that?
Where's my father going?
Where is Xavier's?
Try and find out.
You go back to car and wait.
If you're going down there,
I'm going with you.
- Take that.
- What about you?
Always carry spare in case of blowout.
Hold this.
What are you gonna do?
Cannot see contents of nut until shell is cracked.
Close door, please.
Do not touch.
Please light candle.
Fingerprints?
Look.
Why, there aren't any on it.
Man cannot drink from glass without touching.
Xavier was all shot up during the war.
Maybe he has to wear gloves.
You have seen him at bank perhaps many times.
He wear gloves?
I - I don't remember.
Have seen Xavier at airport upon arrival in city... on street night Nardi killed... and in bank- no gloves.
You've certainly got an eye for detail.
Grain of sand in eye may hide mountain.
Strange for man to... wear gloves inside... and outside with bare hands.
Say, that is odd.
Blow out candle.
Come.
- [Click]
- Look!
Quiet.
Follow.
[ Gasps ]
Charlie!
Only bullfrog.
Creepy place, isn't it?
Many strange crimes... committed in the sewers of Paris.
Charlie!
Lamartine bonds!
Very clever forgeries.
- Forgeries?
- Yes.
And here are tools for engraving.
And printing machine.
So that's why we were checking out that series of bonds in the bank today.
Yes.
Did you find something,
Charlie?
List of bond forgeries.
Why-Why, that's the sketch
Max made last night at the café.
Charlie, do you think-
- Did you hear that?
-Turn out the lights.
Drop that gun.
Don't move.
Charlie!
Charlie!
- Are you all right, Charlie?
- Yes. Thank you so much.
Marksmanship most excellent.
But made mistake of shooting at flashlight on end of moving broomstick.
You meddling devil!
Honorable ancestors refute suggested kinship.
Hands down, please.
Someone's coming.
[Whispering ]
Over here. Get down.
Close behind me, men.
He may be in here. We'll rush him.
Hello.
- Well! Charlie!
- Dad! I'm glad you're all right.
We seem to have arrived ahead of Mr. Xavier.
When Xavier phoned Corday, I knew you were on the spot. I got hold of Mr. Renard.
Yes, he told me all about it. We'll take care of this Xavier when he shows up.
You two men stay here.
- Go upstairs, tell the sergeant.
- Wait, please.
Uh, not necessary.
- What's that?
- I show you.
Stand up!
You got him, didn't you, Pop?
That's Marcel Xavier!
Correction, please.
There is no Marcel Xavier.
No Xavier?
Then who the devil is he?
Please to remove gloves.
Note- hands not those of beggar.
Charlie, what's all this about?
Answer concealed, maybe... behind false face!
Why, Mr. Latouche!
All right, Charlie.
I'm waiting for the answer.
Bond forgery plot conceived by very clever criminals-
Corday and Latouche.
Between them, they create fictitious character Marcel Xavier.
When Latouche is Xavier,
Corday is Corday.
When Corday is Xavier,
Latouche is Latouche.
Oh.
I begin to see.
System gives both men perfect alibi.
Well, by George, that is clever.
- How did you guess it?
- Correction, please. Did not guess.
Gentleman who give me
Xavier's address... make mistake of leaving same handwriting down here... on list of bond numbers.
Oh!
- See?
- Hmm.
Also, gentlemen overplay hand in acting part of Xavier for me.
Both know I go to café.
Latouche appear as Xavier... and Corday give him money.
Inside of café,
Corday watch me... while Latouche kill my assistant.
- Assistant?
- Yes. The dancer, Nardi.
Next morning,
Corday know I go to bank.
He appear as Xavier and play scene with Latouche.
- But what about Dufresne?
- Dufresne was accomplice in bank... who tried to cheat
Latouche and Corday.
Tonight... when Dufresne planned to leave city with money received... from bond forgeries...
Corday arrive in apartment as Xavier, kill him... and later take off disguise in car.
Well, good work, Charlie.
- All right, Laverne, take him away.
- Come on.
- May- May see you, please?
- Why, certainly.
Must trouble you to release other assistant from prison.
- Other assistant?
- Yes.
Miss Lamartine.
You see, she in Dufresne apartment to get information.
Very important letters... for me.
But I don't see-
Oh.
So the age of chivalry isn't dead after all.
- Thank you so much.
- [ Chuckles ]
Come along, Charlie.
You tell me all about it over a cup of coffee.
- And, uh, doughnuts?
- Yes!
What's the matter,
Joe? Nervous?
Oh, this job gives me gooseflesh.
You're new here, but in a couple of months, you'll get as jumpy as me.
- I worked around sanitariums before.
It's not so bad.
I like the cuckoos myself.
They're the same as anyone else... only they're smart enough to admit they're nuts.
Look at him.
- That guy sings every night, and it's making me screwy.
They oughta keep him out of that recreation room after hours.
- Who is he?
- Nobody knows, not even the guy himself.
He was picked up on the streets.
Amnesia case.
Then he went daffy, and he's been here ever since.
Come on.
Let's get a cup of coffee.
How many times have I told you not to interrupt my singing?
Every night for seven years.
So there is only one answer.
Either you quit singing, or I'll quit bringing the paper.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Lilli.
Lilli.
Did you say something?
I remember now.
You don't mean you remember who you are, do you?
I've got to get out of here right away!
Sure, sure.
Only just take it easy.
Let me take you to your room.
And I'll get the superintendent.
Los Angeles Police calling car 17. Car 1-7.
Man answering description of escaped maniac just seen at 16th and Hill.
Step on it, boys.
That is all. Roberts.
Another one of those phony leads.
Our only clue- a torn newspaper containing plenty of pages of news... of which any one item may have caused that man to become violent.
Well, this is not a séance.
Who has an idea?
Why do you keep harping on that newspaper?
Maybe he tore it up as an emotional outlet.
- Any other clever thoughts?
- How do we know he's even in the city? We have no leads.
We haven't any pictures.
The asylum never takes any.
We've run down every angle, and most of them are phony.
Every railroad, terminal dock, bus line and main artery is being watched.
- What else can we do?
- I even checked all the airports personally.
That's fine, Kelly. Now you better cover the merry-go-rounds and scenic railways next.
Where would this man get money for airplane rides? He's been a charity case for years.
I want every one of you to get this.
As long as that madman's loose, it means he may strike at anytime, anyplace.
I want you men to cover every foot of ground around the asylum.
Check every house, gas station, every road out of there. Someplace there's a clue.
Find it. Now get to work.
Kelly, you stay here. It might do you a little good to meet a real detective.
Ask Mr. Chan to come in.
Wait a minute. You haven't called
Chop Suey in on the case, have you, Chief?
No, but it's not a bad idea.
And take your hat off.
You could learn a little politeness from the Chinese too.
Thank you so much.
Honorable father once say, " Politeness- golden key that open many door."
Glad to see you, Charlie. I was hoping you'd drop in before you went away.
Yes. Work finished.
Return to Honolulu by midnight boat.
Can't be separated from that family of yours.
Become habit, like murderer always return to scene of crime.
Oh, Sergeant Kelly.
- Salutations.
- So pleased.
- Sit down, Charlie.
- Thank you.
I wanted to congratulate you on the racetrack case.
That gang of racketeers nearly ruined American horse racing.
Humble servant very fortunate in stumbling on solution.
Ah. Lucky, eh?
Yes.
Confucius say...
"Luck- happy combination of foolish accidents."
Tell me, Charlie. How did you ever happen to hit on the clue?
It was so small, so obscure.
Small things sometime tell large stories.
For instance, very obvious here that... many men indulge in nervous fit.
Perhaps unfortunate assistant receive dressing down on carpet?
Say, how did you wise up to that?
When policeman on small pay... discard large cigar after two puffs... sure sign of distress.
Also note cigarette die in infancy.
Yeah? Well, suppose you tell us what case we were being bawled out on.
- That ought to be easy for him.
- Not difficult.
Escaped maniac, case number A-469W.
Morning press already inform me torn-up paper only clue.
And there's the case number!
- Congratulations.
- Charlie... do you think this paper may have any bearing on the case?
Heel mark on face of beautiful lady very significant.
Ah, that nut just stepped on it on his way out.
Note carefully.
Heel on picture before paper torn.
Sure sign man know woman unpleasantly.
You're right.
It's deliberate mutilation.
I tell you, the dame is cold turkey.
I saw her at the opera house yesterday, and she knows nothin' about him.
Yes?
Madame Lilli Rochelle to see you.
- Have her come in.
- Yes, sir.
- Inspector Regan?
- Yes.
- I'm Madame Rochelle. This is Monsieur Barelli.
- Enchanté.
How do you do? Sergeant Kelly you know.
And Mr. Chan.
Mr. Chan! You here on the mainland?
This is a delightful surprise.
Plum tree blossom many time... since I hear silver voice of Madame Lilli in Honolulu.
Thank you. Mr. Chan,
I'm in frightful trouble.
Someone has threatened my life.
They're going to kill me.
"They"? Who's they?
My dear inspector, Madame Rochelle expects you to find it out.
Show him the card you have received.
Someone sent me flowers at the theater today. This was attached to it.
- Won't you sit down, Madame Rochelle?
- Thank you.
Perhaps you're right, Charlie.
Our madman does know Madame Rochelle.
I told this officer that I do not know your escaped maniac.
Madame meets many people, but she usually avoids the mad ones.
- Do you suspect anyone?
- No. None in particular.
Naturally, a person in my position makes many enemies.
They're all people who are jealous of me.
Others even imagine they're in love with me...
and, of course, resent the fact that I do not return their regard.
- It's the price of popularity.
- Madame is a great favorite.
But there's no one you can actually point to?
No. But I am afraid, Mr. Regan.
I demand protection for madame, not only for herself, but for the sake of her public.
The voice they love must not be stilled.
- You will give her a guard.
- Just what is your connection with this case, Mr. Barelli?
Enrico is the baritone of my company and one of my dearest friends.
All right. The opera house will be searched and men stationed... at every entrance and exit during the entire performance tonight.
Thank you. And of course
Mr. Chan will be there.
Madame's voice like monastery bell- when ringing, must attend.
You're so kind.
And now I must hurry.
I have costumes to be fitted.
Come, Enrico.
- See you later, Mr. Chan.
- So happy.
I don't like that guy Barelli.
I think he uses perfume.
Hello? Yes, McGrath?
What? My wife in
Inspector Regan's office?
That's right, Mr. Whitely.
She just left here.
And with Barelli again.
You want me to go to the opera house?
No, it isn't necessary.
I have other ideas.
One dozen American Beauty
Roses to Belvedere Apartments.
Miss Lotus Quong Toy.
That will be three dollars.
Uh, Miss Lotus evidently gilded lily.
Pop, you got here just in time. How about a little advance on my allowance?
- I'm almost broke.
- Puppy love very expensive pastime.
Ah, gee, Pop, we're leaving tonight.
And this is just, well, sort of a farewell present. She's a lovely girl.
Graceful as bamboo shoot, beautiful as blossom of water lily.
Yeah, that's her!
When did you meet her?
Never. But long time ago use same description for honorable mother.
Roses and romance like tenor in opera- sing most persuasive love song.
You like the opera?
Such beautiful music.
Rigoletto, Il Trovatore,
Pagliacci, Cavalleria!
Pardon, please. Opera season good for flower business.
Sure. Today stands right there,
Signor Barelli, the great baritone.
He ordered three dozen of the American Beauties...
for the signora.
Signora? You mean
Madame Lilli Rochelle?
No, no. He's got wife hisself.
And no one send flowers for Madame Lilli?
Today, no.
But tomorrow... maybe bushels for her magnificent voice.
When she sings-
Thank you so much.
Please. You send card with flowers?
No. Just cancel the whole thing. Hey, Pop!
- Ah, gee, Pop. Why can't I go to the opera with you?
- Impossible.
You very busy tonight finish packing baggage.
I did it all an hour ago.
They're all ready to be locked.
- Must get steamship tickets.
- Here they are.
- Well, must pay hotel bill.
- Here's the receipt.
Now will you let me go?
First return three dollars for flowers not sent to Miss Quong Toy.
I- I guess I forgot that.
Please. Do not need soup and fish.
Have other plans for you.
Tickets, please. Have your tickets ready, please. Thank you. Tickets, please.
I'm sorry, boys, but no reporters allowed in the theater tonight.
- I know, Pop. We're late.
- Traffic jam.
I tell ya, nobody can see
Madame Rochelle tonight!
Officer, this is a private matter and it's important. Please let us in.
Good evening, Madame Barelli.
Pop, what time did my husband leave the theater this afternoon?
- Why, right after dress rehearsal.
- With Madame Rochelle?
- No, madame. He was alone.
- What's he paying you to lie?
Why, madame.
Who was that firecracker?
Anita Barelli, second soprano.
The wife of Barelli, our baritone.
- Kinda jealous, huh?
- Did you ever see a baritone you could trust?
What's the idea?
Can't you take "no" for an answer?
But I know she'll see me. I'm her-
- Please get us some water.
- We were right! She saw him too.
- Saw what?
- A strange man hiding in here among the costumes.
I was working on Madame Lilli's dress.
I went over in that corner for some lace.
- There he was standing, staring at me.
- Did you see him?
No. Agnes screamed and I ran to her.
No one else was in sight.
- What'd this guy look like?
- All I could see were his eyes. They were horrible.
- Take a look around, boys, and this time find him!
- Did you see anybody?
- No, I didn't see anybody.
- Maybe she just imagined it.
No, I didn't. I saw him all right.
Just leave it to us, sister.
We'll take care of everything.
Come on. Get out now, all of you!
The curtain's going up in a few minutes.
- Don't worry, lady. He won't come in here again.
- Don't leave me alone, Officer!
Shut up! You've got the whole company upset.
- You cops would make anybody hysterical.
- Say, who are you?
My name's Arnold.
I'm stage manager here.
And this opera is going on tonight even if Frankenstein walks in.
That's him again!
- Say, which one of you-
- What's the trouble, Sarge?
- It's one of these guys and I can pick him out! He's a Chinese!
- Yeah? Well, line up here.
Now take off those tin hats.
They're all Chinese!
Boys, boys, put those helmets on!
There's the overture. Come on!
Come on! Get into your places!
Just a minute, you two!
- I thought I told you to stay out of here.
- You did.
One of those boys that know all the answers, huh? Come on.
- Take your hands off her.
- She's lucky I haven't got the bracelets on her.
But we haven't done anything.
We only wanted to see Madame Rochelle.
- It means everything to us.
- It means nothing to me. I've got my orders. Come on.
Now, I don't know how you got in, but this is the way out.
- Why don't you let us explain?
- Please.
Officer, take 'em out of here.
And if I see you again tonight... you'll be doing your explaining to a judge!
This place is driving me screwy!
Where's Regan and his pal, um, Egg Foo Yong?
Here, please.
- I'm sure glad to see you, Chief.
- What's the trouble?
- In the first place- - Have already heard of ghostly visitor from man who tend door.
- Oh.
- Have you searched the entire house?
We've been over this joint so many times I could tear it down... and build it again without misplacing a brick.
Perhaps maybe called on to do same.
Suppose we start systematic investigation.
Look here, Whitely.
You can't talk to me that way!
Barelli, I've warned you before to keep away from my wife.
- This is the last time.
- But perhaps Lilli-
I'll see you about this later.
Now get out.
I want to talk to you.
- Gravelle!
- Yes.
I- I thought you were dead.
Dead? That's what everybody thinks.
What-What are you doing here?
Why shouldn't I be here?
I've work to do.
Gravelle sings tonight.
Don't move another step.
You want to tell them I'm here, but nothing can stop Gravelle from singing tonight!
Carnival! My greatest role.
The voice of Mephisto coming from the flames.
The flames! That was it.
The flames all around me.
The theater on fire!
And someone locked Gravelle in his dressing room.
Who?
You know. Tell me.
- Anita? Anita?
- If you tell them I've come back, I'll-
No. No, no, I won't.
Anita?
Come in.
Hello, dear.
This is Mr. Chan, a detective.
- Madame Barelli.
- So pleased.
And sorry to disturb.
What can I do for you, Mr. Chan?
In humble role of investigator... seek information concerning flowers... sent to you this afternoon by honorable husband.
Flowers? You-
You must have felt very guilty about something, Enrico.
Don't tell me you have forgotten our wedding anniversary.
I had. And I didn't receive the flowers.
Bouquet, like summer tourist on wrong train- evidently suffer switch in destination.
I can imagine what their destination was.
You will have to excuse me, Mr. Chan.
I have a very difficult makeup.
Will question you later.
What's all this about?
Most mysterious.
Someone sent your bouquet to Madame Lilli with threat of death.
With a death threat?
You suspect enemy who might do same?
No, but whoever it was must have had good reasons.
Evidently do not waste love on Madame Rochelle.
Why should I?
She's done everything to humiliate me...
even to stealing my husband.
The entire company knows it and laughs at me.
So sorry.
Disloyalty of husband... sometime ample provocation for revenge.
But I didn't send that note, if that's what you mean.
The flowers were never in my room.
Contradiction, please.
What are you doing?
Cremated ghost of card from flower shop.
I know nothing about that.
You'll-You'll have to go now, Mr. Chan.
Thank you so much.
Gravelle.
- Do you believe her story?
- Not sure until burnt card prove otherwise.
I'm afraid it's too charred to tell us much.
Sometime jewel found in ashes.
Here, you let my supers alone!
Now listen, Inspector.
I've never been a violent man... but if you don't stop this lunkhead cop of yours from chasing my soldiers around...
I'll- I'll-
I won't be responsible.
All right, line up. Quick.
There's your cue.
Go on. Enter.
- There's the Chinese mug I've been looking for!
- Kelly.
What's that, a laundry ticket?
Much laundry, but all dirty.
- "Dear Pop-"
- "Pop"?
Say, is that your kid?
Chip off ancient block.
"Somebody hiding in opera house.
"Madame Lilli and husband in big fight.
Also, have fingerprints you ask for."
Say, if that's your son, who are all the other Chinese?
Honorable fraternity brothers of worthy son... incognito.
Hydrochloric acid, please.
And here's the ferricyanide potassium.
Marriage of two acids reproduce lost writing on burnt card if lucky.
- Have, uh, fingerprints you mention in note?
- Sure.
This is Mr. Whitely's.
I'll bet he's wondering when he lost it.
I almost got caught lifting this out of Mr. Arnold's vest.
This is Madame Barelli's.
- What's the matter, Pop? Lose something?
- Not yet.
But light fingers on number-one son most alarming.
Gee, Pop, we've got it! This proves the flowers were in Madame Barelli's dressing room!
Madame Barelli's fingerprint, please.
Fingerprint on card not hers.
You wouldn't dare do such a thing.
Sorry, Lilli. I've given you your last chance to make a fool of me.
You can't prove anything with your cheap insinuations and lying detectives!
If you name Enrico in a divorce action, he'll deny everything and so shall I!
Barelli will deny nothing when I get through with him tonight.
Tonight? What are you going to do?
Madame Rochelle, two minutes.
- All right. I must go.
- I'll wait.
- Lilli. What's wrong? You should be on the stage.
- I must talk to you.
- Whitely?
- Madame Rochelle!
For the sake of Puccini,
Verdi, Wagner and me... get on that stage!
I'll see you after the first act.
You!
Yes, Barelli.
I've come back to take your place tonight.
Get out of here.
Get out of here, I say!
If it's the dead you're afraid of, don't worry!
I'm alive, even though
I was locked in a burning theater!
I didn't do it. I swear I didn't!
It was a mistake. Lilli-
Yes, Lilli!
Two minutes, Mr. Barelli.
Mr. Barelli, your cue!
This is Madame Lilli's great scene with Mephisto. He joins her in a duet.
She refuses his love, and he stabs her.
Strange. I never heard that quality in Barelli's voice before.
It's great. Eh, Charlie?
All right, Lilli. Lilli! Lilli!
Mr. Arnold!
Will someone bring me a chair, quick!
- What happened? What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.
- What's happened?
- I don't know.
She must have been unconscious when I picked her up on stage.
I bet Barelli had something to do with this.
Hey, you! Come on, boys.
Stop!
Open up here!
- Open up!
- What's the matter?
It's Barelli, Inspector!
He just ran in and locked the door.
- Break it in.
- Wait a minute.
I got a personal grudge against that canary.
Barelli!
Stabbed through heart.
But I just saw him come in here.
- Yeah, he must've bumped himself off.
- Contradiction, please.
Observe. Implement of death missing.
Dead hands cannot hide knife.
You're right. Someone must've been waiting in here to kill him.
Whoever it was certainly worked fast.
He had to commit the murder and escape while we were breaking in the door.
One moment.
Examine wound, please.
It's beginning to dry.
Coagulated blood denote murder committed some time ago.
Oh, yeah? Then I suppose it was his ghost that socked me.
Perhaps substitute devil sock honorable colleague on chin.
Aw, you're just guessing, brother.
This window hasn't been opened so long, the bolt's rusty.
And that door was locked on the inside!
If he didn't sock me and then run in here, where is the guy who did?
Perhaps murderer knows other way of departing from room.
Inspector Regan, there's a trapdoor up here.
I'll handle this.
Go up there with him and take a look around.
- Get the coroner here. Tell the boys to keep their eyes open.
- Yes, sir.
All right, folks, back up.
Out of the way.
Wait a minute, lady.
You can't go in there.
Let me in to him.
He's my husband!
Oh! Enrico! Oh!
Find anything, Kelly?
Nothing yet, Chief.
There ain't nobody up here.
I'm gonna find out if there is.
No Chinese cop's gonna show me up.
Take a look down that other end.
Come outta there.
Stay where you are.
- Who's he?
- I don't know who he is... but I'm gonna find out what he's doing in here.
Get Regan.
What's wrong?
Lilli!
She's dead.
- What's the trouble?
- Murder. And here's your man.
- That's a lie.
- I came in here... and found him standing over the lady with blood on his hands.
There's a dame with him too.
She must be around someplace.
- Go and get her.
- Keep your eye on him, Dugan.
Stabbed. Just like Barelli.
Yes, but Barelli die first.
Blood here still fresh.
He must've come in here while I was out phoning for a doctor.
You leave Madame Lilli alone?
Why not? She was supposed to have police protection, wasn't she?
It's your negligence that is responsible for my wife's death.
- That's enough, Whitely.
- Please. Mr. Whitely's right.
Humility only defense against rightful blame.
Here's the knife!
He must've put it there!
I never saw that knife before!
Whoever commit crime safe for moment.
What do you mean?
By handling knife you have covered fingerprints of murderer.
Come on, everybody.
Into your second act costumes.
Well, come on! Hurry up!
Hurry up, all of you!
- Are the understudies ready?
- Yes, sir.
We're not going on, Mr. Arnold.
Not with a madman loose.
- Two people have been killed already!
- Any one of us may be next.
Don't you realize this is opening night and there's a packed house?
You might as well go on with the show... because none of you hams are leaving the theater until this thing is cleared up.
- This is an outrage!
- Come on. Come on.
I knew Madame Barelli very well.
I was with her this afternoon.
- What time, please?
- Oh, about 4:00 or 5:00.
He's lying. At 4:30, my wife was in Inspector Regan's office.
Pardon, please.
How you know that?
Why, Lilli told me, of course.
You knew Madame Lilli received threat of death this afternoon?
- Certainly not.
- What did you think she was doing in my office?
Why, she told me she'd missed a piece of jewelry from her dressing room.
Be so kind to explain what happened when you carry Madame Lilli into dressing room.
I laid her down on the chaise longue.
Then I sent Madame Barelli to get some smelling salts.
While you remain alone with Madame Lilli?
Yes. But I immediately went out to call a doctor.
So sorry to trouble.
That's quite all right, Mr. Chan.
When you return to dressing room, what happen?
I didn't return.
On my way back, I-
I was told my husband was dead.
No longer necessary to remain.
Thank you so much.
What's the use of all this questioning?
Here's the man you want.
I demand his arrest.
Please.
Voice from back seat... sometime very disconcerting to driver.
Kindly explain blood on hands once more.
When I came into the room,
Madame Lilli was halfway off the couch.
- I started to lift her up and then realized-
- You expect us to believe that?
One moment.
Explain purpose of visit, please.
I'll explain that.
I'm Lilli Rochelle's daughter.
That's the most ridiculous yarn I've ever heard.
My wife had no daughter.
She'd never even been married before.
That isn't true! My mother never acknowledged me openly.
Ever since I can remember, I've been kept hidden away in boarding schools.
Even when I grew up, it was always the same.
She was afraid a grown daughter would hurt her career.
I've tried to be close to her, but she wouldn't let me.
And now it's too late.
Still have not explained urgency of visit here tonight, Mr. Childers.
We wanted Madame Lilli's permission to get married because Kitty is under age.
- You ask consent before?
- Several times, but she always refused... because she knew our marriage would expose her secret.
She even threatened to send Kitty away where I could never see her again.
- That was cause of quarrel?
- She had no right to spoil Kitty's life.
So tonight we came here to ask permission for the last time.
- And when she refused, you killed her.
- I did not!
Please, spare feelings of bereaved young lady.
I'm going to hold you both for further investigation.
One more question.
Can tell present whereabouts of male parent?
My father died in a theater fire when I was about four years old.
He was an opera singer.
Thank you so much.
Excuse, please.
Nothing up here.
Ah, nothing anywhere.
You stand around that stage like a herd of seals...
waiting for mackerel.
All right. Now you do it.
Left! Right! Go!
Pop, this proves that whoever took
Barelli's place committed the murder.
Quite possible.
Gee, what about Mr. Whitely and Madame Barelli?
- They had reason enough to do it.
- Also possible.
- And that fellow Childers-
- Please.
Man who ride on merry-go-round often enough finally catch brass ring.
What's your idea, Pop?
Have here very interesting newspaper item... relating death of Madame Lilli's first husband, Gravelle... in opera house fire in Chicago.
Gee, Pop, if there was only a picture of him!
Get Los Angeles Bulletin on phone.
Information, please.
Hello, Hudson?
Smitty, Chicago Sun, speaking.
The Gravelle picture is coming through.
Okay, Smitty. We're standing by.
It'll only be a minute now, Mr. Chan, while they regulate the speed... so that the roller holding the picture in Chicago is revolving at the same rate... as the roller holding the negative in this cylinder.
Here it comes.
The two machines are now locked together as one.
A small light is traveling over the picture in Chicago.
It's an electric eye that tells this electric eye over the wire what it sees.
Then this electric eye prints on the negative... in this cylinder in black and white... what it sees in Chicago.
I'll have it developed immediately, Mr. Chan.
Many things now clear.
Thank you so much.
- That's him.
- You sure?
I'll never forget those eyes. Who is he?
For present, Mr. "X."
- The opera's over.
- Must insist... no mention of picture to anyone.
- Not me.
- Here, Agnes. Take this stuff.
- I'm so glad to get out of here.
- You and me both.
I never had such a night in my life.
Now must work fast. Have only
30 short minutes to trap murderer.
Why 30 minutes?
Must catch boat for Honolulu.
- Please stop worrying, dear.
- I can't help it, Phil.
I can't help feeling that our coming here tonight had something to do with it.
- How could it?
- I don't know.
But that detective sensed it too.
That's why he accused you.
I'm not worried, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.
And, young lady, I'm taking on a new job today:
Trying to make you happy.
That's better.
You're gonna keep on smiling too.
I'm gonna make you forget there ever was such a thing as trouble.
Inspector Regan wants to see you, Childers.
- Phil!
- I won't be long, honey.
What do you want?
I'm not going to hurt you.
You are Kitty Gravelle.
I knew you a long time ago.
Please don't come any closer.
You're afraid of me, aren't you?
Don't be. I want you to know me. I'm-
Sit down. Please.
Now listen.
Don't you remember this?
It means nothing to you?
Wait! Try to remember.
There was a house and a garden... and a little girl who'd run to the window to listen when I played to her.
And when I'd sing, she'd fling her arms around my neck and put her head on my shoulder!
If you touch her, I'll kill you.
Pardon intrusion, please.
Had no intention of harming beautiful young lady.
Why did you come here?
Merely wished to make telephone call.
Excuse, please.
You're lying.
You're one of the police who are after me tonight.
You wanted to trap me, but I was too clever for you.
You thought Gravelle was a fool.
That's what Lilli and Barelli thought when they locked me in a burning theater.
But I got out, and now they're dead.
You'll never put me behind those walls again.
Remember presence of honorable daughter.
She didn't know me.
She's afraid of me.
She thinks I'm mad.
Everybody thinks I'm mad!
A very old Chinese wise man once say...
"Madness twin brother of genius...
"because each live in world created by own ego... one sometimes mistaken for other."
Your world, music.
Yes! I live in a world of music.
Symphonies, operas, great audiences.
I sing to their applause.
Much applause tonight after beautiful aria.
Always.
Would grant privilege of hearing magnificent voice again?
You mean tonight? Here?
Yes. Will have stage ready and orchestra waiting.
Yes, I'll sing.
You don't expect everyone to stick around here... while you turn a nut loose on that stage, do you?
- What'll we tell all these people?
- Very simple.
Say Mr. Arnold trying out new baritone.
Charlie, you can't do that. The man is mad.
He's a homicidal maniac.
Therefore must use utmost precaution.
Hope plan will make murderer reveal self.
Reveal self? Who do you think's been doin' all the killing around here?
And now you want him to sing again.
Old Chinese proverb say-
Old Chinese proverb say-
Oh, yeah? Hmm.
Excuse, please.
Why, yes, I can sing Lilli's role... but under the circumstances, I-
So sorry.
But hoped for assistance... to apprehend murderer of husband.
I'll do anything you ask, Mr. Chan.
But I won't be able to wear Lilli's costume.
Own costume sufficient.
Thank you so much.
What's the idea of making us get into costume again?
Agnes! Agnes! Give me
Madame Barelli's costume right away.
- Are we ever going home?
- Is this gonna keep up all night?
- Here.
- Where's the belt?
If it isn't there, I don't know where it is. Here. Take this. It'll do.
Oh, hurry up.
Let's get it over with.
This was place you occupy when Madame Lilli on stage?
- Yes.
- Please to remain here while Madame Barelli sing.
- Very well.
- Thank you.
If that Chinese dick knows where he is... why don't we grab him and haul him down to headquarters?
Unwise officer who eat apple not yet ripe get official tummy ache.
The commissioner will certainly make the fur fly if anything goes wrong.
And bouquets fly if everything go right.
I'm all ready, Mr. Chan.
Shall we go on?
Please.
- Keep the stage lights full on. We're taking no chances.
- Yes, sir.
If he makes one mis-move-
Dim those lights, you fool.
This scene is played in shadows.
Darker. Darker.
I knew he was hiding in the theater.
He came to my dressing room before the opera.
But I didn't dare warn you, because he said he'd kill me if I told.
Then when I-
I was singing Lilli's aria... and he reached for the knife,
I- I couldn't stand it.
Egg Foo Yong, the guy that pulls rabbits out of the hat-
Sending a woman out there to let a nut stick a knife in her.
Well, Chief, that about closes the case.
Contradiction, please.
Case still wide open like swinging gate.
- What do you mean?
- Gravelle not murderer.
- Not Gravelle?
- Excuse, please.
Will demonstrate hypothesis.
What?
Word of Greek derivation-
"hypo" meaning-
"Hypo." I get it.
He's hitting the pipe again.
Go on, Charlie.
Knife worn by Gravelle.
Observe coating of oil... used by property department to preserve blade from rust still intact.
- So what?
- Prove most elemental fact in deduction.
Could not have been used for murder.
Of course he didn't use his own knife.
He used Barelli's.
Beg to differ. Knife used to murder Barelli... later used to kill Madame Lilli.
If Gravelle guilty... must have had both knives on person while singing aria.
Previous examination of costume... disclose no telltale bloodstains.
Also, madman would not use
Barelli's knife... having one in his own scabbard.
- He was crazy, wasn't he?
- But method devised by real murderer... born in rational mind.
Used presence of maniac in theater... as perfect alibi to cover own guilt.
Concealed murder knife after first crime... fearing fingerprints.
Later, frightened by immediate arrival of police after second crime... was forced to hide same in bouquet of flowers.
Unfortunately, fingerprints obliterated by Mr. Whitely.
- Do you mean to insinuate-
- Pardon, please.
Have special insinuation for your honorable attention.
Can explain presence of your fingerprints... on ghost of card from flower shop... found in Madame Barelli's dressing room?
My fingerprints?
That's impossible.
Fact most definitely established... by comparison with those found on your cigarette case.
- What about it, Whitely?
- I can explain that, Inspector.
I knew Barelli had sent flowers to the theater this afternoon.
I suspected they were for my wife.
I came here to see the card.
Then sent same flowers to wife with threat of death?
Yes, but I swear I never intended-
I only wanted to frighten her away from Barelli.
- You know Gravelle?
- I never heard of him.
You state complete truth about position in wings during entire aria?
Yes, and I can prove it.
Madame Barelli saw me standing there.
- Will corroborate, please?
- Why, I- I don't know.
As I came off the stage,
I was so terrified... at the thought of Gravelle being loose in the theater...
I hurried to my dressing room and locked myself in.
You must have seen me. You were standing in the wings only a few feet from me.
Why, yes. I saw you there,
Madame Barelli.
You left just after
Mephisto began his aria.
Thank you so much.
Fact that Madame Barelli in wings during aria... final link in chain of evidence.
- You are murderess.
- Why, how-
You were only one who knew Gravelle planned to sing Mephisto role tonight.
Later, standing in wings... recognize voice not that of husband.
Instinctive curiosity force you to husband's dressing room to investigate.
You discover him unconscious... so avail self of perfect opportunity... to avenge intrigue which cause you so much humiliation.
Is this some ridiculous attempt to save your face, Mr. Chan?
Humble countenance merely facing facts.
That same belt you wore with costume earlier tonight?
Why, no. The wardrobe department sent me this because the clasp on the other was broken.
Strange.
Have original belt here with clasp in most perfect condition.
- Where did you get that?
- Found hidden in cushion... of chaise longue in your dressing room.
Observe.
Stain of blood on inside lining... prove definitely you conceal knife on person... after murder of husband.
You're right.
And I used it on Lilli when I came back with the smelling salts and found her alone.
You knew what was going on... but you weren't man enough to do anything about it.
That's all.
I'm ready, Inspector.
- May I see you, Mr. Regan?
- Certainly.
That fellow got a lucky break, Inspector.
The bullet never touched the brain.
In fact, it may relieve the condition that's been causing amnesia.
You think Gravelle have happy chance of recovery?
An even chance... if we can keep him quiet till we get him to the hospital.
He's very restless.
Keeps repeating the name, uh, Kitty.
Excuse, please.
Request most charitable act.
Innocent man unfortunately wounded by impetuous marksman... call for daughter not seen for many years.
Would please take place of missing loved one for small moment?
Perhaps save life.
Please?
Much better if relationship not known until recovery certain.
- Well, Charlie-
- Uh-
All I can say is that you have certainly-
Very lucky in finding solution.
Proving, as said before, luck happy combination of foolish accidents.
You're all right, just like chop suey- a mystery but a swell dish.
- Thank you so much.
- By the way, Charlie...
I didn't quite catch that
Chinese lingo you sprung on us... just before you asked
Madame Barelli to sing.
Ancient proverb meaning when fear attack brain, tongue wave distress signal.
I get it. You made her sing with Gravelle just to scare her into talking.
- Yes, you catch quickly.
- Sure.
Hey, Pop!
Pop, I found Madame Barelli's smelling salts in Madame Lilli's room.
- This proves that she-
- Excellent clue.
But, like last rose of summer- bloom too late.
Also fear too late for boat to Honolulu.
Not if we can help it. I'll hold that boat if I have to lock the captain in his own brig.
I knew we were on the right track, Pop.
The first time I saw Madame Barelli,
I was sure she was guilty because-
Case now closed?
Today, while the earth shakes beneath the heels of marching troops...
...while a great portion of the world trembles...
...before the threats of acquisitive, power-mad men...
...we of America have little time to remember...
...an astounding era in our own recent history...
...an era which will grow more and more incredible with each passing generation...
...until someday people will say it never could've happened at all.
April, 1918.
Almost a million American young men are engaged in a struggle...
...which they have been told will make the world safe for democracy.
- You always come into a rathole like that?
- What do you want me to do, knock?
Cost me the last cigarette I had.
Well, can I offer you a nice Turkish prettiest? Number-nine cork tip.
Yeah.
Hey. Hey, where'd you get those?
A friend of mine in Mineola sends me a fresh batch every week.
Look at that.
Them cooties is getting desperate.
They're feeding off tobacco.
How much can a cootie smoke?
Got a light?
There's 10,000 shell holes around here, and everybody's gotta come diving into this one.
No privacy in this war anymore.
Sorry. I didn't know anyone was in here.
Ought to put up a sign:
"No hunting, shooting or trespassing. "
There goes me prettiest number-nine cork tips. Where are they?
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothing.
You scared?
Yes, I am.
- No heart, huh?
- I'm beginning to think so.
At least I haven't any heart for this.
I hoped this business would be over with before I got here.
- What are you, a college kid?
- I just finished law school.
A lawyer, huh? Can you think of anything that can get us out of this hole?
He wouldn't if he could.
He's the type that cheers back home.
When they get here...
- ... and things get tough, they fold.
- Shut up.
- I'm talking to him.
- And I'm talking to you.
I don't like heroes or bigmouths.
We're all scared.
And why shouldn't we be?
What do you think we use in war, water pistols?
You're all right, kid.
I like guys who are honest with themselves. Stay that way.
Come on. Looks like it's quieted down.
Mailman, boys! Come and get it!
Goodies from home!
- Rothmore.
- Here, right here.
- Fletcher.
- Here I am.
- Tilton.
- Here.
- Aloysius Toohey.
- Here.
Bartlett.
Right, buddy.
Here's mine. Here you are, big and good-looking. Try your luck on those.
- Thanks.
- That's for you.
Yeah, that's all I've been getting.
Anything good, I'll split it with you.
Oh, now, look at that.
Thousands of dames writing us letters that are supposed to pep us up.
Get a load of that kisser.
Hey, somebody must've sent him some dough.
Hey, now, that's more like it.
- Very pretty.
- Yeah.
A million guys in the Army, a babe like her has gotta pick out a mug like him.
- Who she ain't met.
- When you write, ask if she has a friend.
Put in, "Having a wonderful time.
Wish we was in Mineola. "
What do you mean, "we"?
Bugle too vulgar for you guys?
Maybe you need a harp to call you out.
Come on! Move out!
What's the matter? You hard of hearing?
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Keep your shirt on.
When you get an order in the Army, buddy, you jump.
Like you did when you worked for my dad, and he caught you stealing nickels?
I ain't working for him.
I ain't working for you.
Yeah, well, you might be.
I'm gonna give you a break.
I'll let you stand behind the bar with your medals on...
...and tell the drunks how you won the war.
Fall in!
- I said, fall in!
- Where's the sergeant?
Come on. Shake it up! Shake it up!
Someday I'll catch that ape without those stripes on and kick his teeth out.
Fall in.
Come on, move along!
You must be quite a guy back home.
I do all right.
What is this armistice they've been talking about the past four days?
It's just another rumor.
This brawl's gonna go on forever.
I ever get back, I'll have a swell law office in the Woolworth Building.
Have it all picked out on the 28th floor.
You can see the whole city, the bay, Brooklyn.
What do you wanna look at Brooklyn for?
- What are you going to do, George?
- Just a minute.
That sucker jumped 3 feet in the air and come down stiff as a board.
Me? I'll still be in the saloon business.
Prohibition law goes in next year.
It's one thing to pass a law, another to make it work.
- There'll always be guys wanting to drink.
- They'll enforce that law.
No, they haven't got a chance.
How about you, Eddie?
I'm gonna get my old job back in that garage.
Save my money, someday have a shop of my own.
It's my idea of heaven, boys.
A grease bucket, a wrench and a cracked cylinder.
You wanna make a living the hard way.
All I know is, I don't want any more trouble. I've had some.
What's the matter, Harvard?
Lose the Heinie?
No, but he looks like a kid about 15 years old.
He won't be 16.
Hey, it's all over, boys, cease firing!
The armistice has been signed!
Woolworth Building, here I come!
It's gonna be good to look into a motor again.
You know, I like this.
I think I'll take it with me.
1919. The war is over, and the people of New York...
...are tiring of the constant triumphal procession of returning troops.
And still not all of them are back.
There is alarming news that women's skirts are going to become shorter...
...already they are 6 inches above the ankle.
Bobbed hair is introduced, but very timidly.
A young upstart named Jack Dempsey will meet Jess Willard...
...for the heavyweight championship of the world.
People are talking about the high cost of living. Everything is going up:
Food, rent, clothing, taxes.
The Prohibition amendment is ratified by the necessary 36 states...
...and becomes the law of the land.
People are dancing to the strains of "Dardanella. "
Finally, late in the year...
...the last detachments of the American forces come back from policing the Rhine...
...almost forgotten by all but their relatives and friends.
It's Eddie Bartlett!
- You ain't dead?
- If I am, they forgot to bury me.
Well, when you didn't come back with the others, we thought you was dead.
They kept me in Germany to straighten things out.
- Danny Green still live here?
- Sure.
But if you're thinking of moving in again, the rent's higher than it used to be.
- Oh, yeah? How much?
- Four dollars from each of you every week.
That's fair enough.
I won't have it anyway.
Here's your coffee, Danny.
Oh, thanks.
- Tired?
- Yeah.
I drove some goofer all over Times Square...
Eddie!
- How are you?
- Hello, Danny.
- I'm glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.
- Well, I thought that-
- Yeah, I know. You thought I was dead.
Yeah.
Gee, kid, I'm glad to see you.
Yeah, I- I thought you was bumped off.
Why didn't you tell me you was coming? I'd have went down to the boat to meet you.
Well, you could've wrote to me if you'd have tried hard.
- Who's gonna read it to you?
- I got friends.
- Well, the same cheesy old joint, huh?
- Yeah.
- You look healthy.
- Oh, I feel fine now that the war's over.
Eddie, you never saw a sicker guy in your life the day I was-
When I got my number for the draft.
Flat feet, peepers all gone.
I even had a touch of the palsy.
- No bad heart?
- Well, I was working up to that.
- Same old Danny. How's hacking?
- Oh, bad.
- Yeah?
- Things ain't good in the taxi business.
Everybody's walking where they wanna go.
Hey, how's things in France?
Oh, I'm glad you reminded me.
Brought you a souvenir.
You needn't have done that.
I didn't expect anything. What is it?
German trench helmet. Hope it fits.
I had an awful time finding a Heinie with your head size.
Say, that's swell.
It just doesn't fit.
It's a little too small.
I can send it to the cleaners and get it stretched.
- How do I look?
- You're just the girl to wear it.
Oh, boy, I'm gonna give this to my kids.
You know, if I ever have any.
Tell them how I captured it.
Charging the enemy!
I gotta hide this so no one will cop it.
Where will I put it?
Here's the place.
She never sweeps under here.
Can you see it?
Oh, yeah.
You hungry, Eddie?
Come on out, we'll eat.
I got a meal ticket.
We'll shoot it full of holes.
- I'll make it look like a sieve.
- Come on.
Wait, I gotta go over to the garage, get my old job back. Run me over?
Sure, in the cab.
Hey, Eddie.
Did you learn to parlez-vous?
Just enough.
- Hey, bud, where's Fletcher?
- In the office.
Oh, thanks.
That guy thinks he'll get my job just because he's got a uniform on. He used to work here.
Those monkeys are gonna find out what a picnic they had...
...on Uncle Sam's dough while we worked.
- Hello, Mr. Fletcher.
- Hi.
- When did you blow in?
- Just now.
- Sure good to be back.
- I'll bet.
- What are you gonna do?
- Rest a few days, see the boys.
- Then I'll be ready to work.
- Fine.
What are you gonna do?
Where you gonna work?
What do you mean,
"Where am I gonna work?"
- I was gonna come back here.
- Sorry, Eddie. I haven't anything for you.
What?
Well, wait a minute.
Maybe I'm in the wrong garage.
What was that line about my job always waiting for me?
Times have changed. That boy over there has been working almost two years.
What do you want me to do?
Can him just because you came back?
No.
No, I couldn't ask you to do that, could I?
All right. Thanks.
Left, I had a good job
And I left, left
Don't tell me you won't be with us.
If you brought a band and a gun, you might've got the job.
I don't need any gun, you-
Two for one.
Back in this country, the boys who had returned from overseas...
...begin to find out that the world has moved on during the time they spent in France.
Sorry, buddy. Nothing doing.
Everywhere things have changed, but particularly in New York.
The old Broadway is only a memory, gone are many of the famous landmarks.
For already, America is feeling the effects of Prohibition.
There's a concentrated effort at readjustment to normal peacetime activity...
...but unemployment, coming in the wake of the wartime boom...
...is beginning to grip the country.
The soldiers find they've returned to face, on a different front, the same old struggle:
The struggle to survive.
Yes, sir, where to?
Where to?
- How about a flat rate back to France?
- Oh, hi, Eddie.
How are you?
- You didn't land yourself no job, huh?
- Somebody must've told you.
No. I figured that all out by myself.
You know, on account of your face.
You look kind of tired.
I am tired, Danny.
Tired of being pushed around.
Tired of having doors slammed in my face.
Tired of being another guy back from France.
Take it easy, Eddie. Take it easy.
I can't, Danny. I can't.
I can't go around shadowboxing anymore.
I gotta find something to do.
- I've gotta.
- Wait a minute.
Don't- Don't break that.
The landlady will charge us for it.
If you gotta break something, smack me on the chin. It's cheaper.
Look, Eddie.
I only use my cab 12 hours a day.
The rest of the time, it's laying in the garage.
Why don't you hustle it the other 12?
We'll split the gas and the oil, and you got yourself a job.
It may work out, Danny. It may work out.
I gotta do something.
- Who's there?
- Mrs. Gray.
We ain't home!
Here's a letter for you, Eddie.
Forward all the way from France.
- There's three cents' postage due.
- Put it on the bill.
- Don't think I won't.
- And don't you think I think you won't.
Well, who's that from?
Oh, say, she's pretty.
- One of them French peasants, huh?
- No, it's an American gal.
Lives in Mineola, Long Island.
- Well, I won't hold that against her.
- Danny...
- ... how far is it to Mineola?
- Depends upon if you know the way.
For a wise guy, it's 15 miles.
For a gilpin, it's 30 miles.
Pal, you're driving to Mineola. I think a change of scenery will do me good.
This kind of scenery never did anybody any harm.
- Got enough gas?
- Gas?
Old Bridget can make Mineola on her reputation.
Let's go.
- Wait here, my man.
- Hey...
- ... where do you get that "my man" stuff?
- I'm trying to make an impression, you dope.
Hello. Does Jean Sherman live here?
- Yes. What is it you want? I'm her mother.
- I'm- I'm Eddie Bartlett.
Eddie Bart-
Oh, come in.
- Eddie Bartlett, her dream soldier.
- Her what?
That's her name for you. She'll be thrilled to death to see you when she gets home.
- She's not here?
- She'll be back any minute.
- Won't you come in?
- That's nice, Mrs. Sherman.
This is my buddy, Danny Green.
He drove me down here.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
You see?
Jean and I often used to talk about you.
And at night we'd pray for you.
We felt almost as though you were family.
Sometimes Jean would play the piano.
She's very talented.
We'd sing hymns.
She got her voice from me.
- I'll get you some more.
- No, thanks. This is quite enough, really.
Don't be bashful. I'll be right back.
If I drink another glass of lemonade, it's gonna run out of my ears.
Why didn't she think to offer us a sandwich?
She's probably building up to that.
I'm beginning to wonder if this trip was worthwhile.
Let me be the judge of that.
Find out right away if she's got a friend.
If she has, give me the great big buildup.
One thing at a time. Now, look...
...when this gal gets here, watch what you say and do.
Way I figure it, she's got plenty of class.
You hear what her mother said?
She goes to school, sings and dances.
Look, that means she's no mug.
Now, that kind of material needs plenty of delicate handling.
As a matter of fact, the more I think about this...
...the more I think you should take a long walk.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, Ma, I got an A in algebra!
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Well, are you waiting for somebody?
- Yeah, waiting for your big sister.
My big sister?
Why, I haven't got any big sister.
- No big sister?
- Wait a minute.
- Don't tell me you're Eddie? Eddie Bartlett?
- Yeah.
My dream soldier.
Oh, I wondered if I was ever gonna get to see you.
Oh, Mr. Bartlett, you look just like I pictured you.
Brave, strong, romantic and handsome.
Speaking of looks, how about this?
That was taken when
I was in our high-school play.
It was The Fortune Teller by Victor Herbert.
- But you said that you sang and danced.
- I do.
Where?
I sing in the choir every Sunday, and
I had the lead in our high-school play.
Once in a while, I sing and dance for the Elks Club. Everybody says I'm good.
- Would you like to hear me?
- Oh, no, no. No, thanks.
I have absolutely no ear for music.
- Well, it was nice to see you.
- You aren't really leaving, are you?
We gotta get back to town, important meeting with the general.
Aren't you gonna tell me about the war and how you suffered?
Honey...
...you'll never know how I've suffered.
So long.
Well, will I see you again?
- I'll call you.
- When?
In two or three years, when you get to be a great big girl.
- So long.
- Bye.
You should've stayed and helped her with her homework.
1920. For the first two weeks of the year...
...men can still get a drink more or less publicly...
...because although the 18th Amendment is in effect, the law has no teeth.
But on the 16th of January, the Volstead Act takes effect...
...and traffic in liquor goes completely undercover...
...to stay there for many long years.
The word "speakeasy" begins to appear in our language.
And the forces of the underworld, who best know how to operate outside the law...
...are moving in on a new source of revenue, the magnitude of which no man dare guess.
Sixty cents.
Say, will you do me a favor?
Take these into Henderson's and collect
12 bucks. Ask for Panama Smith.
- What's her name?
- Panama Smith.
- I'm taking these across the street.
- Okay.
- Meet you back here at the cab.
- Yeah.
Hey, Panama, how about something to go with this ginger ale?
On the way.
- You Panama Smith?
- That's me, brother.
Package for you. Twelve bucks.
Oh, yes. The meat.
Come on.
Hey, what are you trying to do?
Get us both tossed in the cooler?
There's a law against that dry goods.
I don't know what's in here, and I don't care. Twelve bucks.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
You bootleggers are gonna learn the law is being enforced.
What are you talking about?
You're under arrest for violating the Volstead Act.
I don't know anything about it.
We know. You came in with a load of soda water, and on the way it distilled into gin.
And you were delivering it for a friend.
- That's right.
- You can tell it to the judge.
Come on. You too, Panama.
- What for, snooper?
- For handling this laughing soup.
- This means a padlock for you.
- But I'm not handling it. He had it.
And now he has it. Besides, I didn't know anything about it. Did I, buster?
That's the way it was.
I drive a guy in my cab, he asked me to deliver that to a customer in here.
I forget his name.
I asked if she knows him.
You got me crying for both of you.
Now, come on.
I delivered for a guy who's waiting outside.
This guy's on the up and up.
He's no bootlegger.
- I never saw him before.
- You see him this time. That's enough.
Now, get out of here.
Hey, buster, who do you know?
- I know a lawyer.
- It'd be better if you knew a judge.
Panama Smith, in view of the evidence...
...presented in your behalf by your codefendant...
...and because the arresting officers failed to detect...
...you actually selling intoxicating liquors, I find you not guilty.
Edward Bartlett, I find you guilty of violation of the Volstead Act.
I fine you $100 or 60 days in jail.
Order. And I give you warning that another offense won't be treated so lightly.
Court is adjourned.
Thanks, buster. Thanks a lot.
I'll do the same for you someday.
Well, how do you like that dame?
"Thanks," she says.
I help her beat the rap, and she never even asked if I got enough dough for the fine.
What a first-class gilpin
I turned out to be.
A hundred bucks.
That judge might as well have said 10,000.
I'd hock the cab, Eddie, only it's already in hock.
I guess I'm not a very good lawyer.
Oh, you're all right, kid.
You just went to bat for the wrong guy, that's all.
Next time, make sure your client really committed a crime.
- Whole lot easier getting him off.
- All right, what's it gonna be?
- Well, I haven't got any dough.
- This way.
- Say, do you give any credit around here?
- Sure we do.
You get 60 days to pay.
This way. Come on.
Well...
So long, Eddie.
I'll see you in September.
- Shut up!
- That won't help.
I tried it.
This ain't no jail, it's a madhouse.
- Have you been a soldier?
- Yeah.
- How do you know?
- I been one too.
We all got the stamp on us.
We can't sit still.
We've seen too much action, too much blood.
They think after that we can just sit and twiddle our thumbs. We can't.
- What are you in for?
- Stickup with a gun.
Things got too tough.
If they'd just give me back that gun, I'd use it...
...on myself.
Come on, grab yourself some sense.
Don't talk that way.
- Hey, Bartlett.
- Yeah?
Step out.
- Your friend here paid your fine.
- Danny boy, glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.
- So long, buddy.
And get rid of those silly notions.
So long.
It's good to get out of that rathole.
Haven't slept in three nights.
- Where'd you get the dough?
- I didn't.
Hello, buster.
Just the gal I wanted to see.
Got a few things I want to say to you.
Of all the double-crossing-
- She paid the fine.
- I didn't walk out.
I just had to rustle up the dough.
You'll get it back, if I have to give it in nickels and dimes.
I can wait.
What's your angle, sister?
What bank do you want me to rob?
Who do you want killed?
Which do you want first?
First, let's have a drink.
Hop in the cab. I'll drive you.
- Taxi.
- Just a minute. Business before pleasure.
- See you later, Eddie.
- Get that room rent.
- Where to, mister?
- Any Turkish bath.
Right. Get in there.
Going to do a little painting?
Yeah, sort of. A little interior decoration.
- How are you, Panama?
- Hello, Charlie.
- This is Eddie Bartlett.
- How are you?
- What'll it be, Panama?
- Gin Buck.
What's yours?
Glass of milk.
You always order milk when you go to a speakeasy?
I don't go into speakeasies.
Well, some people like spinach.
Say, you've got something on your mind. What's the gag?
There's no gag.
I think you're a pretty decent guy.
I like to talk to decent guys.
They're hard to find.
All right, let's talk.
- Things have been tough, haven't they?
- They could be tougher.
A guy in the cell with me wanted to bump himself off.
Till I get around to that,
I'm doing all right.
Milk. That's all I got.
Here we go again.
I hope he thinks to sample what's in my glass.
Hey, who owns the car with the Vermont license on it?
I do.
Don't you know you're breaking the law parking your car in front of a fire hydrant?
Where do you think you are, in a little hick town?
If you weren't from out of town,
I'd give you a ticket.
- Get out there and move it.
- Sorry, officer. I'll move it right away.
Hey, Joe.
Come on, let's sit down.
See, buster, it's easy.
All you gotta do is pay off.
- With what?
- Sucker money.
Ever since Prohibition, it's been floating around, waiting to get picked up.
- Now, a bright guy like you-
- Look, will you stop conning me?
Tell me what goes on. Right now.
You've been nice. You took a rap I couldn't afford. It would've put me out of business.
I'd hate to see someone like you banging his head against a stone wall.
The liquor business is gonna grow big, and it's gonna grow fast.
So get in line, buster.
Hack drivers are a dime a dozen.
- But you gotta know people.
- I know people.
- It takes money.
- I can get it, if you start small.
Tell me.
What's in this for you?
What's your take?
Nothing.
That story about the guy in the cell was a sad one.
I'd hate to have somebody tell me that about you.
Why?
I once knew a soldier like you who went to France.
He never came back.
I never got over it.
That's why.
Is that all of it?
If you don't like that story,
I'll try to think of another one.
It'll do for now.
And so the Eddie of this story joins the thousands and thousands...
...of other Eddies throughout America.
He becomes a part of a criminal army, an army that was born of a marriage...
...between an unpopular law and an unwilling public.
Liquor is the password in this army.
And it's a magic password that spells the dollar sign as it spreads from city to city...
...from state to state.
The public is beginning to look upon the bootlegger as an adventuresome hero...
...a modern crusader who deals in bottles instead of battles.
And so, because of the grotesque situation...
...this new kind of army grows and grows...
...always gaining new recruits who care nothing about tomorrow...
...just so long as money is easy today.
I'll take two dozen of those.
- Got a little bad news for you, Eddie.
- Yeah? What?
Little price hike.
It's up a dollar a bottle from here in.
Oh, you don't say. No kidding.
Well, you're not gonna make a sucker out of me.
I can make this tiger-sweat myself.
I've got a bathtub too.
Come on, Danny.
So long, fellas.
This is the real stuff.
They can't fool me.
By now, the Prohibition law is firmly a part of American life...
...but so is the evasion of that law.
College students, male and female...
...and even high-school boys and girls who never drank before...
...find themselves willing and able to buy hard liquor with the greatest of ease.
The hip flask becomes an integral part of the national scene...
...at football games, in automobiles.
In the meanwhile, the supply of good alcohol...
...fails to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for liquor.
But in the undercover liquor industry, crude stills make their appearance.
Wood alcohol is recooked, and the product of this loose and ineffective process...
...is put on the market in a constantly swelling flood.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi, Danny boy.
Hi, Lloyd.
Holy smoke, Eddie, another one?
Yeah, sure. We'll get more as fast as Lloyd can pick them up.
Soon we'll have so many cabs, we'll have to pick up passengers again.
That might not be a bad idea.
- Which one is Bartlett?
- Me. Why?
Hally told us to come here and see you.
Oh, yeah. When did you get out?
Yesterday.
- What were you up for?
- Stickup.
- You drive?
- Why not?
- What about you?
- I worked in a bank.
Oh, I see.
Took a few samples, huh?
Sort of.
Can use you in the office.
- What was your rap?
- They didn't have a thing on me.
I was framed.
Sorry. Can't use you.
- Say, now-
- Beat it.
Look, I don't care what you did before, or if you've got a record a mile long.
But remember this. When you're working for me, you keep your nose clean.
- You hear?
- Sure.
All right.
This is Danny Green.
- Danny, show them the layout.
- Glad to meet you, fellas.
- Some of my best friends are in jail.
- All right, Danny. All right.
Lloyd, let's go in the office.
Do you have a prejudice against hiring honest citizens?
In this booze business, you can't hire any geraniums.
A couple of years in the stir seems to ripen them for the job. Come on.
I tell you, he's on his way over there right now.
Hello. Two cases, yeah.
- Send it right up.
- How you doing?
- They lap it up faster than we can deliver.
- That means you gotta deliver it faster.
Here you are, big and good-looking.
Buy yourself a new set of law books.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
This is too much for what I did.
Buying a couple of taxicabs doesn't rate this.
You saved me dough. Take it.
It's a beginner. Hang on to my shirttails...
- ... you'll be using that for wallpaper.
- Listen, Eddie...
...you should use those cabs as cabs.
You're on the wrong track.
This dough says I'm not.
While the gravy's flowing, I'm gonna be there with my kisser under the faucet.
This isn't my kind of law.
I started out to be a corporation lawyer.
- This is a corporation. It's making money.
- Yeah.
Eddie, for you.
Yeah? Yeah?
Oh, no. No, no. Sorry.
No, can't use it.
Don't be a sap. You want to chase ambulances for the next 10 years?
Take what you can get while you can get it.
Nobody's gonna drop it in your lap.
Chuck, here's a grand from Moore.
- How'd you make out?
- Okay.
- Did you get that dough from Masters?
- Can't collect from a guy you can't catch.
Anybody who can put on a $100,000 musical comedy can afford to pay me.
I'll get it.
I'll see you later.
Don't think everything's all wrong because you're not starving to death, you hear?
Yeah? Sure. Sure, it's good stuff.
- We just got it off the boat.
- This is bonded stuff, 12 years old.
- Masters here?
- Who wants to see him?
- Me.
- Just a minute. You can't go in there.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's a hot night.
Here. Buy yourself a couple of suds.
- Hello, Masters.
- Hello.
You've seen this before.
How about paying attention to me?
Eddie, I don't need any liquor right now. I got plenty.
I know, you haven't paid for it.
Seven hundred bucks.
I'm not taking any runaround.
You know I'm always good for it.
I'll send you a check tomorrow.
Oh, no. I'll take the cash right now.
Well, wait till this number's over.
That's a pretty cute bundle you got on the end of the line there.
Maybe I could wrap it up for you.
I think I can wrap that up myself.
Hi, Mineola.
Remember me?
Bartlett, your dream soldier?
Oh, yes, I remember.
- You haven't changed.
- You have.
Three years make a big difference.
- My character has changed, hasn't it?
- It's filled out.
I have to change.
Will I see you after the show?
- I have an engagement.
- How about tomorrow night?
- I'm busy.
- Then Thursday or Friday.
- I'm busy then too.
- Busy all week?
- Yes.
- Do you mind if I drive by and blow my horn?
You do that, I won't hear it.
Good night, Mr. Bartlett.
Masters, I'll be back tomorrow night to pick up that check.
I'll bet you thought I'd never show up.
I'm sorry. My date'll meet me on the corner.
I'll walk down there with you. Lot of fresh guys out. Something might happen to you.
Oh, really, I'm catching a 12:00 train to Mineola.
I know you're big now, but don't forget,
I knew you when you danced for the Elks.
I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just let me prove it.
In fact... I might even help you with your algebra.
That's what I wanna see.
Look, I still have to catch that 12:00 train because the next one isn't until 3:30.
Mind if I walk down to the station, sort of wave goodbye?
I can do that, can't I?
Sing that again.
I'm a sucker for that. Go ahead.
- I'm liable to wake him up.
- Who, him?
If he's been drinking the kind of booze
I make, it'll take more than a song.
Come on, sing it again.
Not now, it's too sad.
And I feel too good.
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Oh, I've never had a better time.
You know, tonight was the first time
I've ever been in a speakeasy.
What're you doing, singing in baby shoes?
What?
No, no. Never mind.
I was just talking to myself.
A habit I picked up in France during the war.
I suppose you like to spend your spare time baking a cake...
...or fooling around in the garden or sewing a dress.
Did you make that hat?
It's very pretty. Very pretty.
I wish I did have time to do all those things. But I don't.
I spend my spare time studying.
- Someday I'll be a musical-comedy star.
- Oh, I see. I see.
And you're dancing in the chorus to get money for lessons.
You'd rather not, but a girl has to live somehow, doesn't she?
You sound as if you don't believe me.
I do, I certainly do.
Why wouldn't I?
Mineola. Mineola.
I'm so tired I can hardly get up.
I suppose you're very sleepy and wanna go right to bed...
...because you've got a lesson in the morning.
- That's right, I do.
- I see.
Well, here we are.
Yeah.
Here we are.
You're kind of old to play with dolls, aren't you?
No, not too old if they're cute.
Well, good night.
I've had a wonderful time.
- Hey, it's kind of a quick brushoff, ain't it?
- What do you mean?
It's a long trip to Mineola, and I like to relax between trains.
It's 4:00 in the morning.
You certainly have learned all the answers.
Well, you seem to know all the questions.
Well, if you really want to stay, we could sit here on the porch for a while.
The night air doesn't agree with me.
I take cold kind of easy.
I'm strictly an indoor man myself.
- Well, all right, we can go in, then.
- That's a whole lot better.
We got to be careful not to disturb your mother.
What's the matter?
Of course, you had no way of knowing, but Mother passed away over a year ago.
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.
You live here all by yourself?
Well, I have to until I can sell the house or get a break.
You mean get a break singing?
- How long you been with the show?
- Three weeks.
It's closing the end of next week.
- Then what?
- Then I'll just have to look for another job.
- Won't you come in?
- Oh, no, thanks. No.
As you said, it is getting late.
And I'll call you.
- In another three years?
- No, no.
Most likely another three hours.
- You want this, don't you?
- Oh, yes. Thanks.
I think I'm gonna like this doll.
I know I am.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, when did you two sneak in?
What are you doing here?
Rachmaninoff and I are going to audition a dream, one of the better kind.
Now, there's not a thing to worry about, kid.
You just wait right here.
Hi, Panama. Hi, Henderson.
Okay, buster, what are you selling, and what's her name?
I've got a gal here with class, which is something this joint needs.
Disregard the guy's insinuations.
No kidding, lot of stuff on the ball.
Sounds just like Nora Bayes.
All right, Ziegfeld, let's see the prize package.
Jean.
This is Panama Smith.
And the man here with the worried look is Pete Henderson.
Jean Sherman.
- I hope Eddie hasn't built me up too much.
- So do I.
All right, Jean. Come on, honey.
Show them how a song should be sung.
What are you gonna sing?
What key do you want it in?
And how do you want it played?
"Melancholy Baby" in the key of G.
- And not too fast, please.
- Gotcha.
You're among friends, now.
Don't tighten up.
Sit down, Eddie.
Let's get a chump's-eye view of her.
- Thanks.
- Nice going, kid.
You really did it, baby. You really did it.
Sounded like a trio.
Thanks for listening, Miss Smith, and you too, Mr. Henderson.
You wait outside for me, honey.
I'll handle this for you.
- Well, great, wasn't she?
- I've heard worse.
- I don't know one note from another.
- You heard all the good ones that time.
- Eddie, I ain't got room for any more singers.
- You're wrong. You'll make room.
When does she start?
Well, I can only pay her 35 bucks a week.
- Wrong again. You'll pay her 100.
- A hundred? Say, I don't pay myself 100.
You can't sing. Don't worry,
Petty Larceny, I'll make up the difference.
- Only she's not supposed to know.
- I don't care, as long as I don't pay it.
Now you can stop crying.
When do you want her to begin?
Let's say a week from tonight, Galahad.
Maybe you'll be over it by then.
I doubt it.
Well, I'll see you around.
Especially next week. So long, presh.
She seems like a nice kid.
I hope she can outtalk him.
I hope she can outrun him.
Sure. Eddie imports all of his wines.
I'll send it right over.
Hello.
- It's on its way.
- Hi, big and good-looking.
- Hello, Eddie.
- This is Lloyd Hart, our legal brain.
If you want to sue anybody, see him.
- Jean Sherman.
- How do you do?
Hello.
Oh, Eddie, I can pick up five more cabs for you, but it'll take straight cash.
What do we use? Cigar-store coupons?
Get them.
This is where we take orders for the booze.
I'll show you where we make it.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
This is a still.
Some of the alcohol we get around here is not so good, so we recook it.
Jiggers here is making Scotch.
A little alcohol, a little water, a little color, a little flavor.
Tonight we deliver it at six bucks a quart. Costs half a buck.
Louie here's an artist.
He gives it that saltwater smell.
You know, right off the boat?
- Smell it up good, Louie.
- Right.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Mineola.
- Hello.
- Where's your manners?
- Hello, Miss Mineola.
No. The dicer. The skimmer.
Excuse me.
Hello.
This is the deluxe department.
The boy here is making champagne.
Tonight, it will be delivered at the best circles. Fifteen bucks a quart.
- Is it real champagne?
- No, it's diluted New Jersey applejack.
The chumps will think it's vintage stuff off the boat, bottled in France.
It's kind of cheating, isn't it?
Cheating? Yes, if you get caught.
But you don't get caught if you...
...take care of the right people.
And this is big business. Very big business.
Hello, Eddie.
How about a drink?
Not during office hours.
How are you?
- Hello, Ed. How are you?
- Hello, Eddie.
- What's the-? Hi.
- When you're told to do something...
...why don't you do it? Instead of sitting around drinking rotgut you're to sell.
I did it, Eddie. I got the joint jammed with professional applauders.
Two bucks a head and drinks.
One of the guys even brought a dishpan to pound on.
Throw him out.
We need to keep this thing smart.
Tell these monkeys if they sit on their hands, I'll chop them off.
You hear? Now, go on, get moving.
For the last time, I'm telling you, ginger ale is cheaper than liquor.
Mix them accordingly.
Is this kid a draw or isn't she? You haven't had such a crowd since you opened.
Why shouldn't it be full?
Most of them are here on rain checks.
Getting paid, ain't you?
I don't expect to get a sucker like you every night.
Don't you ever say that to me again, do you hear? Never.
- You having a good time?
- Swell.
Shouldn't have told me that, chump.
That'll be 10 bucks extra on your check.
She's just kidding.
Well, she goes on in a couple of minutes.
Oh, yeah.
- What's eating you, Eddie?
- Nothing. Why?
I've never seen you like this before.
You act like a kid who's going to try on his first pair of long pants.
Panama, I'll let you in on something.
Here. Throw a lamp on that.
What a load of ice.
So, what's this kid got on you?
I don't know. Whatever it takes to get a guy like me, she's got.
She know about this?
No. I'm gonna tell her after the show.
You might be moving too fast.
Sometimes you get over these things, and you're sorry.
- I don't think I'll ever get over this.
- You're batting out of your league.
You're used to traveling around with dames like me.
You sure got it bad.
Suppose she turns you down?
Turn me down?
Why should she turn me down?
Suppose you tell me about that later.
Okay, Roy!
All right, now that we got quiet, get your hands out of your pockets. You'll need them.
Tonight we're gonna do a Christopher Columbus.
We're bringing you a little gal that's new to nightclubs and almost everything else.
And she's gonna sing.
And if anybody makes any noise...
...the waiters have been told to slip them a mickey.
Here she is, folks. Her name is Jean Sherman.
The song is "I'm Wild About Harry. "
And when she finishes, you'll be wild about Jean.
So come on out, honey.
What's going on here, anyway?
Applaud, you stewbum!
Oh, I see.
Oh, Eddie. It's beautiful.
That ain't what I wanna hear.
- They seemed to like me, didn't they?
- You're stalling me, Jeanie.
- You've been awfully good to me.
- I improve with age.
If you want the Brooklyn Bridge, just ask for it. If I can't buy it, I'll steal it.
Well?
Eddie, I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
I haven't had time to think about it.
You've had plenty of time.
I didn't have to say how I felt about you.
You must've seen it a million ways.
- I have.
- Well?
I don't know, Eddie. I just don't know.
You ought to know how you feel about me, whether you like me or not.
I do like you, but...
But what?
I just can't tell you.
I know what's bothering you.
Maybe Panama was right.
Baby, you and me don't play in the same league.
Yeah, that's it. You don't like the racket
I'm in, the people I know, the things I do.
It's not me, it's what I stand for.
Am I right?
- Why, I-
- Yeah, I am right.
I'm not letting that stand between you and me.
Not the way I feel about you. I'll get out.
A few more years, I'll have enough dough so we can settle down and forget all this.
How does that sound to you?
Why, it sounds all right.
Yeah. Well, you hang on to that ring.
You'll use it a whole lot sooner than you expected.
Get that yard of clothesline out of your kisser and try to pay some attention for a minute.
Look, Brown, here it is.
The stuff I sell has a very limited market.
People with dough don't wanna buy the poison I make.
Now, I want to get in on that good market.
I know you're head of a syndicate...
...that's running the high-class merchandise sold in this country.
All I want you to do is sell me some.
Well, what do you say?
- No.
- Why not?
I don't sell to penny-ante guys.
I got distribution of my own.
Well, don't forget, this penny-ante guy asked you in a nice way.
I'll try and remember.
You're supposed to be Coast Guard men.
Try to act it till you get onboard.
When you do get on, get that booze off fast.
- And don't use your guns.
- Unless it's a tie.
Unless it's a-
Now, remember what you've been told.
Boat coming up two points off port bow.
That must be Nick's boys.
Cut it down to half speed.
Hey, that ain't none of our mob.
Looks like a Coast Guard.
Ahoy, freighter!
You'd better stop. They can't do nothing.
We're more than 12 miles out, right?
We're in the clear.
Get that line over.
Stand by!
We're coming aboard!
You can't touch us!
We're outside the 12-mile limit!
Go home and rescue a swimmer!
Come on, boys, rip into it.
Get those hatches open.
You can't get away with this.
We're on the outside.
I wouldn't care if we were in the Suez Canal.
Get off of this boat, or we'll throw you off.
Hey, get them up there!
Come on, get them up!
This guy ain't no fed.
Hey, what outfit is this?
Come on, men, move that stuff.
- Who's taking us?
- I am.
Well, you can't get away-
- Hello, George.
- Eddie.
- Hey, I thought you was running a garage.
- Kept me indoors too much.
- Doc decided I needed a sea trip.
- I got the same doctor.
I don't know why, but I'm glad to see you.
So am I.
Before you go through with this, we'd better talk. You're heading for trouble.
This is Nick Brown's boat.
Ernie, keep that stuff moving fast.
We gotta get it all off before daylight.
It's moving.
Let's you and me have a little drink.
- It's real stuff, Danny?
- Maybe not...
...but it'll get into a lot better homes than we ever will.
What'll you have?
Oh, nothing for me.
You don't have to be afraid of this stuff.
This is the McCoy. I drink it.
I still don't like it.
You like it enough to knock over this boat for $100,000 worth of it.
A dress salesman doesn't have to wear dresses, does he?
Sorry I have to clip you, George.
You ain't clipping me, you're clipping
Nick Brown, the guy I work for.
He's gonna be awful sore at you, Eddie.
I'm in too much of a hurry to worry about that.
- He's a mean guy.
- I'll take my chances.
You know...
...I think I'd like to take mine with you.
Between us, we ought to do all right together.
I'm doing all right now.
Look here, Eddie.
It won't be so easy the next time.
Brown ain't gonna stand for you hijacking his boat. Next time he'll be ready for you.
One fine night, a 5-inch shell is gonna blow the top of your head off.
You can't spend your profits in the bottom of the ocean.
- Go on.
- Well, it's like this.
I got the organization to bring the stuff in, and I know where to get it.
You've got the organization to peddle it.
You mean you want to double-cross Brown.
It's been done before, you know.
What do you say?
I don't trust you, George.
You could stand a little watching yourself.
That sounds like a pretty good basis for a partnership.
You're on, it's a deal.
Right.
1924. By now, America is well launched into an era of amazing madness.
Bootlegging has grown from small, individual effort...
...to big business, embodying huge coalitions and combines.
The chase after huge profits is followed closely by their inevitable partners...
...corruption, violence and murder.
A new and powerful tool appears, the Tommy...
...a light, deadly, wasp-like machine gun...
...and murder henceforth is parceled out in wholesale lots.
What's the matter? Are you nuts?
You want the other guard, don't you?
You got those keys?
Open up for Danny.
Take good care of those guys.
All right, boys. Come on.
Get moving, and fast.
- Uncle Sam working for us.
- The government takes it from Nick Brown.
We take it from the government.
Pretty neat.
Danny, you go outside and watch.
There may be some trouble around.
- I don't want you here.
- I ain't afraid.
I don't care.
You're not cut out for this.
Now, go on, do as you're told. Get outside.
- I'd say there's about 4000 cases.
- Eddie, the relief watchman just came up.
Now, look. Get those trucks moving and stay with them.
All right, boys, wash it up.
Get in the trucks.
Get ready to move.
Well...
...if it ain't my old sergeant.
Come on, chop him again.
Let's get out of here.
It's Sergeant Leather Lungs, our old pal.
I told you we'd meet sometime when you had no stripes on your sleeve, and here we are.
- You didn't have to do that.
- He had it coming to him.
Get in back with the boys.
Someday that heater of yours will blast you into the hot seat.
Well, if it does, you'll be sitting right in my lap.
Nice, isn't she?
She sings well.
See quite a lot of her lately, don't you?
I can't help seeing her.
I have to be here quite a bit.
It's all right. You don't have to get sore.
Why shouldn't you see her?
She's your kind of kid.
You both like the same things, talk the same language.
Just like me and Eddie.
All right, chumps.
You've had your entertainment.
Now you can dance.
Because when you dance, you get hot.
When you get hot, you get thirsty, and that's the way we want you.
So come on! Dance and drink, folks.
Come on, dance and drink.
- Packing them in, huh?
- Oh, so-so.
He can't be happy.
He ain't got no tables on the ceiling.
Too bad, because we got new stuff for you.
- Cut a pint into two quarts.
- We're sending you 100 cases.
- I don't need 100 cases.
- You'll take them.
You don't want to hurt our feelings, do you?
Can you imagine that guy, saying business is just so-and-so?
That guy'd beef if he won a sweepstake.
- Hello, kiddies.
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, Panama.
- Hello, George.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.
Eddie, I've been trying to locate you for hours.
There's several important matters we should discuss tonight.
They can wait.
Wouldn't be a bad idea to pay more attention to our business instead of them cabs.
We're doing okay.
What are you beefing about?
I wanna buy 10,000 cabs, I'll buy them.
Besides, they're a good front.
Maybe something to fall back on in my old age.
In this business you shouldn't worry about old age.
- More cabs, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that brings it up to 2000.
- Piker.
- Excuse me. I'll see if I can grab a dance.
- That'll be a break for some dame.
- Mr. Hart, you're wanted on the telephone.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Stick around, Lloyd.
She's coming on again soon.
He's a good kid.
- You hope so.
- What do you mean?
Far be it from me to start any trouble, but I'll lay you 8-to-5 right now...
...that kid's going to move in on your gal.
- I hope you know what you're talking about.
- Sure I do.
Listen, Eddie.
I'm trying to steer you right.
Listen, gals like her go for guys like that.
You know, with all that Joe College stuff.
He'll take her to football games, fraternity dances.
All that rah-rah stuff.
A kid like him can't miss.
Calm down, Eddie.
Maybe George is right.
If he is, there's nothing you can do about it.
Shut up.
I trust my friends.
You know, he's a sucker.
I don't trust mine.
It's mutual, chump.
They don't trust you, either.
Tonight, I'll tell you a story.
What shall it be?
- Little Freddie.
- But you've heard all about Little Freddie.
Come in.
- It was sweet of you to send me this radio.
- Does it work?
Sure. I can hear every word as clear as if the man was in the room.
Are you able to get a lot of gab?
Well, before my last number,
I had a band from Brooklyn.
Yeah, that's science.
Guy has to invent radio so you can pick up a broken-down outfit in Brooklyn.
How are-? How are your singing lessons coming along?
All right, but I don't think you ought to waste your money on me.
It's my money.
Besides, I ain't wasting it.
- Say, you know where we're going Saturday?
- Where?
New Haven. Going to see that football game.
Football? I didn't know you liked football.
I don't. But you can get to like anything if you stick at it long enough, can't you?
Yes, I suppose you can.
Come in.
Pardon me, but Panama told me
I'd find Eddie here.
What do you want?
You forgot to sign the checks for the new cabs. I'll need them in the morning.
I thought you gave a great show tonight.
- Thank you.
- I see you have a new crystal set.
- How's the reception?
- Ought to be good. Paid a lot for it.
I guess that makes it good.
That makes anything good.
- Goodbye.
- Listen, I've got the news broadcast.
You boys listen to it.
- A whole lot easier reading the papers.
- Your news broadcaster is on the air.
Here's a late news dispatch that just came in.
United States government warehouse number 7 in New York was hijacked tonight.
A quarter million dollars worth of liquor was removed...
...after two watchmen were shot down.
One of the watchmen, Pete Jones, 42, was already dead of bullet wounds when found.
Jones was a World War veteran.
- What did he say the watchman's name was?
- I didn't get it.
It sounded like Pete Jones.
That was the name of our loudmouthed sergeant, remember?
There are a lot of Joneses, ain't there?
Eddie...
...where were you and George tonight?
With you.
Or maybe I don't remember.
Ain't that always the correct answer?
Hey, Eddie. I just got tipped off.
Nick Brown's on his way over.
- What'll I do?
- I'll handle him.
See you later.
You seem to be in an awful hurry.
I have a lot of work tomorrow.
I go on again in a few minutes.
It'd be nice if you'd stay and keep me company till then.
I haven't seen so much of you lately.
You're doing all right without any help from me.
Don't say that, Lloyd.
You're afraid of the truth?
I've told you time and time again
I can't hurt him.
He's been so good to me.
You'll get yourself in so deep, you'll never be able to get out.
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Tell him the truth.
Tell him that you don't love him, that you-
That I what, Lloyd?
Just tell him that you don't love him.
Lloyd, you're gonna stay and see the show, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Oh, there's my cue.
I'll see you out there.
Here he comes.
You two guys think you're pretty cute.
- Shut up. The girl is singing.
- Now, you listen to me.
You tipped off the feds I was running in a load last night, and they took it from me.
He makes noise when he eats spaghetti too.
- And you lifted it from them.
- Quit talking through your hat.
The watchman you knocked off didn't die right away.
- He talked.
- He was off his nut.
You're cute, but not cute enough.
Hey, wait a minute, folks!
You're not gonna go home just because some of the boys have a friendly argument!
Come on, stick around.
We're gonna give away more loot.
- What's your hurry?
- Man, get your boss.
Come on.
Get this guy out of here.
Throw him out in the street.
Put your hat on. You'll catch cold.
I hope.
Wait a minute.
Put these in water for me...
...tramp.
- Don't be frightened. It's all over.
- You all right?
Yes, but there were innocent people there.
I didn't have time to think of them.
Get to your dressing room, rest up.
Take it easy. Go ahead. Go on.
You can't come in my club and make a shooting gallery out of it.
I'll bet there's over $5000 of damage.
Oh, crying again, huh? I'll tell you what I'll do. You make a price...
- ... on this rattrap and I'll buy it.
- You'll buy it?
Yeah. I think a big boy like me should have his own playground.
- You two get together, draw up a contract.
- I'm not drawing up...
...any more contracts for you.
What's the matter? The shooting give you the jitters too? Go on, beat it.
Eddie, you stuck up that warehouse tonight, didn't you?
- You have good ears.
- You killed the watchman.
- I wasn't anywhere near him.
- You were responsible.
It couldn't be helped.
You're getting excited over nothing.
Let's talk it over.
No, Eddie, it won't work.
This is where I draw the line.
I said I'm through, and I mean it.
- Don't you wish it was that easy?
- Get out of my way.
- Put that gun away.
- When I get good and ready.
Friendship don't mean a thing to me.
This guy's got enough on us to-
- He won't talk.
- He'd better not.
Listen, you came into this racket with your eyes open.
You learned a lot and know a lot.
If any of it gets out, you'll go out with your eyes open, only with pennies on them.
Now, scram. Get out of here.
Go on home and chase ambulances.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To look for excitement.
There's a lull in the joint.
Now, look. Now that we got things fixed with the right people in office...
...we got to sort of arrange things among ourselves, you hear?
Which means that instead of shooting things out, we gotta talk things out.
We got to get a setup where we work together.
- Where's Nick Brown?
- I sent Danny after him.
I figured he might have forgot.
There's no sense in going on without him.
He's gotta be in on this.
Look, you guys go out to the bar, get yourselves a drink on the house.
- Good idea.
- I'd enjoy a good drink.
You must have been reading about Napoleon.
What's bothering you?
First, you used to ask me about things, then you told me, now you ignore me.
My feelings is getting hurt.
Oh, my poor, delicate, little rosebud.
Ain't that a shame?
Just as long as your bankroll ain't hurt, you got nothing to squawk about.
When Brown comes, you can call me.
I'll be out in the club.
Lefty, how do you like being a stooge?
Oh, chief, I don't care.
Well, I do.
I think maybe I'll have to do something about it.
- I'm going in with you.
- Please, Lloyd, I want to tell him.
All right, but tell him.
I'm getting tired of sneaking around back alleys in order to see you.
If you don't tell him tonight, I will.
I'll tell him. Tonight.
Bye, darling.
- I'll meet you here after the show.
- Okay.
- Good evening, Miss Sherman.
- Good evening.
- Eddie! Eddie!
- What's the matter?
Danny!
Go on inside.
Bartlett, is this one of your boys?
Yeah.
He was.
Well, Danny...
...I told you this wasn't your racket.
Get back there, now. Get back.
Come on. Get back there.
What was all the screaming about?
Brown just delivered Danny's body.
- Get the boys together. We're on our way.
- Where?
- Brown's.
- Not me. You're the big shot around here.
I'm only the office boy.
All right, little man.
Polish up the cuspidors. When you get through with your work, go home early.
He'll be home early, feet first.
Hello. Hello. Get me Orchard-8591.
You know, I hate to do this to Eddie.
Him and me have been such good pals.
- Hello, Nick Brown?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is Brown.
- Who is this?
- It's your Aunt Sadie from Jersey City.
Listen, Eddie Bartlett's on his way over to pay you a call.
Yeah. Okay.
I always say when you got a job to do, get somebody else to do it.
Dinner's over. Get out.
- Just a minute.
- I said, get out.
The check is on me.
I hope you enjoyed it.
Come on.
We're closing up the place.
- But we haven't eaten yet.
- We've run out of food. Get out of here.
Go on. Beat it. Scram, sisters, spaghetti ain't good for you.
Puts fat on the wrong places.
Get rid of these people.
What's wrong?
You try to ruin my business?
That ain't all that's gonna be ruined.
Hey, wait a minute. You stay.
- It's all right. We've finished.
- No. You're wrong. You're hungry.
Bring these people another order of spaghetti.
But I've eaten all the spaghetti that I can take.
You'll eat more spaghetti and like it.
Now, shut up and sit down.
Luigi, keep that electric piano going.
Boys, Bartlett's on his way over.
Now, you know what to do.
Charlie, in the kitchen.
Manny, under the counter.
Rocco, the phone booth, but keep low.
Joey, you take the cloakroom.
That's it. You stand around with that towel as if nothing was going on.
Now, eat as if you enjoyed it.
When Bartlett arrives, give him the courtesy of the place.
Show him that old Southern hospitality.
- Where's Brown?
- Brown?
Oh, yes. He go out one hour ago, but he's coming back.
We can wait.
Take it easy, boys.
Make yourselves comfortable.
What are you sweating about?
Nothing.
It's hot here.
- What's the matter, Mama?
- We want to get out of here.
We want to get out of here!
We have a special news bulletin.
Gang violence flared up again in New York tonight...
...when three men died in a spaghetti restaurant on the East Side.
All were the victims of a gang battle which transpired...
...when one mob was trapped in the restaurant by another faction.
Among those who met their deaths are Nick
Brown, powerful East Side gang leader...
...also Rocco, Brown's lieutenant, and Manny Eckert.
We return you now to the marine room of the Edgecomb Hotel...
...for music by Don McNeil and his orchestra.
That's right, George, you didn't get me.
Take your hand off that heater, Lefty.
The only thing saving your neck is
I can't prove you dealt me a second.
If I ever find out, I got one in here with your name on it.
Remember that.
Well, good night, folks, and come again.
Don't forget, next Friday night we're gonna give away a Shetland pony.
Good night, folks.
- I paid off for Danny.
- Yeah, I know. I heard it on the radio.
Sit down.
You know, I think I'll take Jean home.
Jean's gone.
She said she'd wait here for me.
Eddie, I'll tell you something you won't like.
Jean's quit the club. Gave her notice.
Quit? What for?
Do I have to draw you a diagram?
Now, look, if you're trying to say something, get it off your chest and say it.
Jean's in love.
Now you're being full of news.
Sure she is. With me.
Eddie, this is gonna be kind of hard to take...
...and I don't want you to get mad.
Jean was never in love with you.
She went hook, line and sinker for that Lloyd guy the minute she saw him.
And she's been seeing him every time your back was turned.
I tried to give you the steer, but I guess I didn't get it over.
Everybody knew it but you.
Look, Eddie, as far as Jean is concerned, you've been-
Shut up!
Okay.
- Lloyd, did you hear about Danny?
- Yes, I did.
All the more reason you should leave that club.
- I quit.
- Did you see Eddie?
He didn't show up.
We'll go back and wait for him.
- Cab, Mr. Bartlett?
- Yeah, please.
Never mind.
I'll walk.
Beat it.
Beat it.
- Eddie, listen to me-
- What are you trying to prove?
Nothing, kid.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Does Eddie know that Jean walked out?
I don't think so.
Suppose you tell him.
- Here he is.
- Hey, look...
...how's that booze
I've been peddling? Any good?
- Better than most.
- All right, let's sample a bottle.
No, make it two.
One for you and one for me.
Who can tell? I might like it.
Hey. Come here.
1929. As the dizzy decade nears its end...
...the country is stock-market crazy.
The great and the humble, the rich man and the working man...
...the housewife and the shopgirl all take their daily flier in the market...
...and no one seems to lose.
Then, like a bombshell, comes that never-to-be-forgotten...
...Black Tuesday, October 29th.
Confusion spreads through the canyons of New York City's financial district.
And men stare wild-eyed at the spectacle of complete ruin.
More than 16.5 million shares change hands in a single day of frenzied selling.
The paper fortunes built up over the past few years...
...crumble into nothing before this disaster...
...which is to touch every man, woman and child in America.
Hey, boys!
- Now what do you want?
- I need 200,000 to cover your account.
- I gave you 200 grand.
- I need it again. I'll give you an hour.
- If you don't have it, I'll have to sell you out.
- All right, I'll get it.
There you are. That's five more.
You must be sneaking lessons on the side.
- What, are you still around?
- George, I've got no time to waste.
I need 200 grand.
Yeah? What am I supposed to do about it?
Will you put away that thing?
Look, I'll sell you 40 percent of my cab company for 200,000.
I don't want 40 percent of anything.
- That's a lot of cabs, chief.
- Over 6000.
I'll tell you what. I'll give you
250 grand for the whole company.
Are you nuts? Those guys from Chicago offered me two million three months ago.
Okay, then. Sell it to them.
But I can't get to them.
I need the money now.
You heard my offer: 250 grand.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
Okay, it's a deal.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you, Eddie.
I ain't gonna take all your cabs away.
What's the hitch?
I'm gonna leave you one, just one...
...because you're going to need it, pal.
First to feel the effects of the economic disaster which sweeps the country...
...are the nightclubs, the speakeasies, and the bootleggers who serve them.
With the falling off of profits in the illegal liquor industry...
...the mobsters have difficulty in paying protection.
And the number of raids, arrests and convictions double and quadruple.
Then in the depth of the economic despair that has gripped the country...
...Franklin Delano Roosevelt is elected president...
...partially on the basis of his promise to end Prohibition.
In New York City, thousands of jubilant citizens march in a great beer parade...
...and shortly, 3.2 beer becomes legal.
Finally comes the national referendum on repeal.
Tired of years of violence, corruption, and loss of personal liberty...
...Americans go to the polls and overwhelmingly rout the dry forces.
After 13 years, Prohibition is dead...
...leaving in its wake a criminal element used to wealth and power...
...but unable, for the most part, to cope with the new determination...
...by an aroused public that law and order should once more reign.
- Taxi.
- Hey, taxi.
- Where to, lady?
-331 Quigley Place, Forest Hills.
331 Quigley Place, Forest Hills.
Eddie.
Yeah, I heard.
331 Quigley Place, Forest Hills.
Eddie, it's me, Jean.
- How are you?
- Fine.
How have you been getting along?
I eat.
- How's Panama?
- All right.
Where is she now?
She's around.
Lloyd's been doing pretty well.
He's with the district attorney's office.
So I've been reading in the papers.
He should do all right in that job.
I don't suppose you knew, but we have a baby now.
A boy. He's over 4.
We'd better hide this sleigh someplace or the kid's gonna want to go for a ride.
- Just put it behind the sofa.
- Over here?
- Let me take your coat.
- No, thanks. I can stay only a minute.
- How about some coffee?
- No, I don't care for anything, honestly.
- Hello, Mommy!
- Hello, darling.
- You been a good boy today?
- I just killed three Indians.
Stick them up, mister.
You got me, pal. You got me.
Bobby, this is Mr. Bartlett, a friend of mine and your dad's.
Hello. Can you shoot a gun?
Yeah, I can, but I haven't done it lately.
Come over someday, and shoot Indians with me.
It's a date.
It's Daddy!
- Hello, Daddy!
- Hello there, Buffalo Bill.
How's my cowboy today?
- Fine. How about the funny papers?
- Oh, sure.
- Here they are.
- Thank you.
Why, Eddie.
Well, this is a surprise.
- It's nice to see you.
- Hi.
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.
Well, you're looking great.
Thanks. I drove Jean out from town, with her Christmas shopping.
- Well, good.
- It was good to see you. I guess I'll be going.
- Won't you stay for dinner?
- No, I can't. I've got a date.
Oh, come on, Eddie. It'll be fun.
We could talk over old times.
No, I- Really, I got to get back to town.
Oh, that's too bad.
Some other time, maybe.
- Yeah. We'll do it some other time.
- Oh, Eddie...
If there's anything I can do...
Oh, there's... I'm not looking for any favors from nobody.
I just ran into a streak of bad luck, that's all. I'll be up there on top again.
- I just got to figure a new angle.
- Eddie, the days of the rackets are over.
Don't you kid yourself about that.
There will always be guys trying to get up there quick, and I'm one of them.
I know you take your job very seriously, and I'll give you some good advice.
The papers say the district attorney's office is building up...
- ... a case against our friend George.
- It's already built up.
Remember what George said would happen if you talked?
I remember.
So does he.
Eddie, if I don't see you again, merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
- Same here, Eddie.
Merry Christmas to you.
Oh, Eddie, I didn't pay you.
Lloyd, I owe him $3.20.
Never mind. Buy a
Christmas present for the kid.
Hey, what time do these lawyers go to work, anyhow?
- That's him now, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Bring me back something.
- All right, Bobby.
Come on, honey. In you go.
- What do you want?
- We got a message for you from George.
He says your boyfriend should bury what the D.A.'s got on him...
...because if your boyfriend don't bury it, he'll get buried instead.
That's all.
Pardon me. Do you know a taxi driver named Eddie Bartlett?
- He picked me up here about a week ago.
- I don't.
- Why don't you ask one of those drivers?
- Well, thanks.
- Do either of you know Eddie Bartlett?
- I know him.
- Where can I find him?
- I haven't seen him in a week.
Last time I saw him, he shouldn't have been driving his cab. He was oiled to the gills.
Ask the boys at the Royal Hotel.
They might have seen him.
Thanks.
I saw him a couple of days ago, and is he on that bottle.
If you want to find him, look in the saloons.
- Don't you know where he lives?
- Yeah. In the saloons.
- Well, which one?
- Search me, lady.
You might ask some of the boys over at Grand Central.
Thanks.
Maybe he's at that dive where that off-key canary sings.
Yeah, that's right.
Flannigan's joint on Third Avenue.
- Flannigan's joint?
- Come on, I'll take you.
Thanks.
All right, professor, fold it up.
Of all the dog-and-pony joints
I've worked in, this tops them all.
Never mind, honey.
I like you.
Well, happy New Year.
It's a wet one, anyway.
They sure had a swell kid.
Yeah, you told me.
And Jean...
- Jean looks-
- Yeah, you told me about that too.
Jean gets prettier all the time.
I've heard the same thing day after day for the past week.
I'm sick of watching you try to put out that torch you carry for her...
...with a lot of cheap hooch.
Who's the kid look like?
Like her.
And they got a nice house?
Yeah, it's a nice house, if you like that kind of a house...
...but for me, I'll take a hotel anytime.
- You know that.
- Me too.
Ain't it funny how our tastes have always run the same, ever since the first time we met?
I can just picture you living in the suburbs...
...working in a garden, raising flowers and kids.
Would that be a laugh.
Yeah, wouldn't I look cute?
- Hello, Jean.
- We were just talking about you. Sit down.
- Why are you here?
- I've been looking for you all day.
A taxi driver finally told me where you were.
- I'm in trouble.
- What is it?
You were right about George.
Today two of his men came-
- Knock over Lloyd?
- No, but they threatened to.
- You've got to help me.
- What do you want me to do?
Go to George. Talk to him.
Why should I?
Lloyd will be killed.
He won't be if he does as he's told.
Oh, but he can't. It's his duty.
Yeah, sure it's his duty.
And it's George's duty to stop him.
- I'd do the same thing in George's place.
- Eddie, please. For my sake.
Sit down.
Same old story. Same old story. Anytime she wants anything, she comes to me.
I suppose that's all I ever meant to you anyway.
No soap, no.
Maybe a patsy once, but never twice.
I don't see how it's gonna do any harm to talk to George.
Talk? There's only one language
George understands.
If you think I'm gonna walk into a bullet just because that husband of hers...
...doesn't know enough to keep his trap shut, you're crazy.
- No dice, Jean. No dice.
- Now, look.
No.
All right, Eddie.
I just thought I'd ask.
Well, go ahead and say it.
You just said it all.
Eddie, you've got to do something for them.
She's got something to look forward to.
- Well, so have I.
- What?
I'll be up there again.
Eddie, you're kidding yourself.
The race is over.
We're both finished out of the money.
- Maybe for you, but not for me.
- It's over for all of us...
...you, me and George.
Eddie, something new is happening.
Something you don't understand.
Hey, what's going on here?
Come on, break it up.
Am I paying you to sing or gab?
Now, just a minute.
You remember me. I'm Eddie Bartlett.
Used to sell you your booze.
Yeah, sure I remember.
And fine poison it used to be too, at fancy prices.
Yeah, you used to be quite a guy in the old days, didn't you?
That's right.
Practically ran this town.
Well, you don't now, so beat it.
Wait a minute.
On your way before I have you kicked out.
- Start singing.
- Get yourself a phonograph, jughead.
I'm with him.
Come on, Eddie. I'll get my coat.
You're right, Panama.
We have finished out of the money.
You wait here for me, huh?
I'd better go with you.
- No, you better stay right where you are.
- Eddie...
...be careful.
Don't worry about me, baby.
I can take care of myself.
And maybe George too.
- What do you want?
- I want to see George. It's important.
I don't know, Eddie.
I don't know if he'll see you or not.
Sure. Take him up.
Give the boss a laugh.
Come on.
How do you like that?
He sure hit the skids.
The rags of his pants are beating him to death.
Well, well, well.
When did you get out?
Oh, I get it. Taking advantage of my good nature on New Year's Eve, huh?
All right, I'll go for it. How much?
I don't want no money.
Don't tell me you came to wish me happy New Year?
Something like that.
All right, many thanks and the same to you.
Goodbye, now, Eddie. I'm busy.
I came to talk to you about Lloyd.
- There ain't nothing to talk about.
- I think there is.
Get him out of here, Lefty.
All right, Eddie, on your way.
Wait a minute, George. If you get rid of Lloyd there'll always be someone to take his place.
- I'll worry about that when it happens.
- But they got a kid.
Still carrying a torch for that dame, huh?
- Suppose I am?
- Then what are you beefing about?
I'm doing you a favor by knocking him off.
- I warned him to keep his mouth shut.
- But he can't.
There's a new kind of setup you don't understand.
Guys don't go tearing things apart like we used to.
People try to build things up. That's what
Lloyd's trying to do. In this new setup...
...you and me don't belong.
Maybe you don't.
I do all right, anytime, anyplace.
Well...
...I guess we'll let it go at that, George.
Where are you going, Eddie?
Home.
It's late.
Lefty and a couple of the boys will go with you.
I don't want you walking the streets alone at night.
- Really going to take good care of me, huh?
- Yeah.
You said you didn't belong in this setup, so I'm getting you out of it fast.
Sorry, but this is how it adds up.
You're still in love with that girl.
You'd do anything to help her.
You got more on me than any guy in this town.
And I'll lay you odds that you'll go to the cops and spill everything you know.
Well, I'm just gonna beat you to the finish.
Goodbye, Eddie, and happy New Year.
Get them up, George.
So you thought I'd yell copper, huh?
I never did that in my life and never will.
If I want anything done, I do it myself.
Yeah.
You always was a fair guy, Eddie.
I'll make a deal with you.
We'll be partners again.
I'll take the heat off Lloyd, beat the rap some other way.
Eddie... Crazy...
Eddie, don't-
- Eddie.
- This is one rap you won't beat.
Sounds like Eddie talked out of turn.
Get up.
Open that door.
Get them up.
You like to laugh, do you?
See if you think this is funny.
Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie!
Drop it! Drop it!
Eddie.
Eddie.
He's dead.
Who is this guy?
This is Eddie Bartlett.
How were you hooked up with him?
I'll never figure it out.
What was his business?
He used to be a big shot.
And now, children.
We come to one of the most famous.
And most priceless pictures in the whole world.
The Medici Venus.
I want you to notice the beauty and delicacy of the composition.
And the flesh tints.
Isn't she a little bit skinny, teacher?
Not skinny, Tommy. She is ..
Well, slender.
She is the embodiment of female grace and form.
All visitors out please.
Come along, children. We must be going.
All visitors out please.
Closing time.
All visitors out please.
Closing time.
Hey, Bert! Hey!
Yes? What's up?
Come here, quick.
It's gone.
Look. Look!
"Sorry, but I had a better use for this."
"The Amateur Cracksman."
Read about it.
Old master still missing. Paper, paper.
"Cracksman laughs at police."
"Tell me what is wrong with Scotland Yard."
"There is an enquiry demanded .."
MacKenzie, I want to warn you. You'd better not take this thing too calmly.
What with the newspapers and the questions in parliament.
Scotland Yard is being made a complete laughing stock.
This sort of thing has got to be stopped.
Once and for all.
I'm busy.
- Sir, it's about ..
I don't care what it's about.
- But it's about the picture, sir.
The Venus, sir.
That's it.
The one that everybody is talking about.
Do you mean that you can tell us something about it?
Do you think you've got a clue?
- No.
I've got the picture.
Here, sit down. Sit down.
Well, upon my soul.
What is your name please?
Maud Holden.
How did you get this?
It just came in the post.
In the ordinary way.
I opened the parcel.
And there it was.
And this was with it.
- Oh.
"I saw your farewell performance when
I was a boy. I have never forgotten it."
"Would you return this to .."
"Dear old Scotland Yard for me."
"I understand there is a reward offered."
"Amateur Cracksman."
Well.
So you are Maud Holden the actress?
- Well.
I used to be.
When was your farewell performance, Miss Holden?
Oh .. twenty years ago.
Aye.
You don't think I've had anything to do with this, do you?
The theft, I mean.
- No, no.
Of course not, Miss Holden.
Thank you very much.
I think I can promise you the reward.
Thank you, sir.
It seems as if the amateur cracksman is somewhat of a benefactor, Miss Holden.
Well.
In this case .. yes.
But I don't want anything said of it.
Don't worry, Miss Holden. We're no more anxious for the publicity than you are.
Thank you. Good day.
Good day.
This is the picture alright.
- And do you think that will help us?
You see, we'll be more of a laughing stock than ever if this news gets out.
Can't find the criminal.
Can't even find the picture and the confounded thing is handed to us.
If it wasn't for him, I'd ..
[ Radio: ]
"Mr Raffles is bowling today."
"Apparently, he had the Australian batsmen completely baffled."
"Mr Raffles is getting ready to bowl now."
"There goes the ball. There go the wickets. He's done it!"
"And it's seven wickets for Mr Raffles."
Mr Bunny Manders is on the telephone, sir. He wants to come and pick you up.
Not now. Tell him I'll meet him at The Ambassador.
Very good, sir.
Mr Raffles thanks you, sir.
He says he'll have to meet you at The Ambassador Club.
And if you will excuse me, sir.
- Yes? What is it?
It is these bills, sir.
Some of them are becoming ..
If you will pardon the expression, sir, a trifle exigent.
You said the grim total is 200 pounds?
- Yes, sir.
I'm arranging for that this evening.
- Very good, sir.
[ Alarm bell! ]
Blimey, look!
There is your burglar.
Must have got locked in.
Looks like he's having a good time too.
Here, get him off that alarm button.
Come on, Pussy.
Well, will you put handcuffs on him, Philips?
I don't think so. I don't think he'll try to get away.
No tricks now.
I think I'd better take him back home.
Rascal. Making all this row.
And don't try and steal my watch.
You are a concern.
I think I'd better take him home, eh.
Well, my missus won't have him in the house. I promise you that.
I'm going to try to sneak him into my house.
Good evening, Inspector.
- Hello, Philips.
Everything quiet?
Is that under arrest?
Yes, sir. Taking him in for giving a false alarm at Baldridge's.
What's that?
A kitten in Baldridge's?
- We found him playing with the alarm.
It doesn't sound right to me.
- Not right?
There's no way of getting in Baldridge's without setting off the alarm.
If somebody knew that they might bring along a kitten.
Get some men round the back of the shop.
- Yes, sir.
Come with me.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, A.J. Good show today.
- Thank you very much.
Good work, Raffles.
- Thank you, sir.
Good evening, Mr Raffles.
- Get me a packet of Hiltons, please.
Thank you.
Ah, A.J.
We thought you wouldn't show up.
I've been telling Gwen you'd come.
That means I got here just in time.
Your brother is an atrocious dancer.
Bunny. A waltz is a thing of grace and poise. You take the lady's hand, so.
Place your right hand, so.
See you later.
But Lady Melrose is waiting for you.
This brother and sister dancing should be discouraged I think.
Especially if the sister is you.
- Can this be you talking?
Yes, I think so.
- Gwen.
Lady Melrose.
- Pretend you didn't hear.
Gwen, dear.
If we don't go to her, she'll come and get us.
Lady Melrose.
How do you do, Mr Raffles.
I am so glad to meet you.
I can't see why she wants to meet you.
She doesn't give a hoot on cricket.
No. But I know a personable young man when I see one.
Sit down there. Gwen, come here.
May we have your picture, Mr Raffles?
Do you mind, Lady Melrose?
Not at all.
Just look at each other if you will.
How could I look anywhere else.
Thank you.
Getting that old face of yours in the papers again, my dear?
Yes. I thought I would have to go through the divorce court to do that.
At my time of life.
Well, I'm very glad to see you, Raffles.
I've been to Lords every day this week.
A splendid show. Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
I'm very proud to meet you. I saw you play for the gentlemen in 1919.
Did you, by gad?
Don't encourage him, Mr Raffles.
Or you will be hearing all his cricket history.
You rescue me. Come and dance.
- Yes, I'd like to.
I think you'd better dance with Gwen.
I was beginning to feel like the other woman.
Mind you hurry back.
- We will.
Now that is what I call a really charming man.
He was my house captain at school you know.
There was nobody like him.
And he hasn't changed a bit.
Well, come and sit here by me until he comes back.
I'm afraid I have to get back to barracks, Lady Melrose.
"Barracks"? Nonsense.
A date with a chorus girl, most likely.
Don't be so old-fashioned, George.
But you brought Mr Raffles, so I forgive you.
You and Gwen are coming down tomorrow for the weekend. Don't forget.
There is just the possibility I may not be able to manage it.
I'll phone in the morning, if I may.
- Alright.
By the way, we've got a new telephone exchange down there.
I'll write down the number for you.
I've got to run along.
You'll see Gwen home, won't you A.J.?
- You leaving?
Yes, I've got to. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Do you mind seeing me home?
- Mind? I'm in luck.
Oh, you are saying the nicest things tonight.
I am? Oh, it just comes natural.
I haven't been drinking.
Oh .. Gwen.
There is that voice again.
Mr Raffles.
We've been glad to see you.
Goodnight, Gwen darling.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Where to, sir?
15 Lennox Mews, please.
Very good, sir.
Come on, Lucy. Come on.
Come on.
Do you know that I've never ridden in one of these things before.
I'm glad you haven't.
- Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because I should like you to remember this evening as well as shall.
You know, you're a strange person.
Strange? Well, why am strange?
You say things like that just to encourage a girl and then ..
The next item we meet you are ..
Terribly nice and polite and ..
Distant.
Why, it's not very easy to be distant in a hansom cab even if you want to be.
And I don't.
You know Gwen, when you used to visit Bunny at school.
I was terribly in love with you. I was always far too scared to let you know.
Nine years ago.
You've changed a good deal since then.
Too much, perhaps.
And not all for the better.
What do you mean?
- Oh, nothing.
Now there you are. That's what I mean when I say you're mysterious.
Tell me your big secret.
Because I felt for a long time that you had one somewhere in your life.
I'm awfully tempted to tell you just one secret anyway.
It's simply this.
I'm still in love with you.
Oh, I am so happy.
I could laugh or sing or something. Or just chatter.
Oh darling, so could I.
Can't you make it down to Melrose this weekend?
We could have so much time together.
- With you?
Well .. of course I can.
Whoa, Lucy. Whoa.
Here we are, sir.
Already?
Once more around the paddock?
- Yes.
If it ain't too late for you, it certainly ain't for me.
Come on, Lucy.
Barraclough.
Barraclough.
I am coming, sir.
Did you call me, sir?
- Yes. Did I wake you up?
It's perfectly alright, sir.
- That means I did. I'm sorry.
Have a drink, Barraclough.
- Have a drink, sir?
I'll pour it out for you.
I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir.
- I do mind. How much soda?
Well, if you insist, sir.
I will take mine without soda.
A splendid idea.
It is an old family custom.
- Oh, indeed?
To the Barracloughs.
- To the Barracloughs.
I beg your pardon, sir. Thank you.
Tell me, Barraclough. Why have you never been married?
Surely there must have been some woman in your life?
There was, sir.
Two of them to be exact.
That was years ago.
Neither of them became Mrs Barraclough?
- No, sir.
Perhaps that was because I knew them both at the same time.
It didn't seem to work out.
Perhaps you're wondering why
I'm in such a gay mood tonight?
No, sir. I think I've already guessed the reason, sir.
You have?
From the tenor of the conversation.
With your permission, sir.
I should say that you have met a lady.
The lady.
Barraclough, you're positively psychic.
Thank you, sir.
Are you contemplating matrimony, sir?
If she'll have me.
I'm turning over a new leaf.
After tonight the old
Raffles is no more.
Behold the new.
Love does some strange things, sir.
Barraclough, you need another drink.
No, sir. I'd rather not if you don't mind.
I've become very talkative and I insist on singing.
Ha. Well, what's the matter with that?
I sing very badly, sir.
Is that all, sir?
That's all, Barraclough. For you.
For me, life is just beginning.
I see, sir.
Barraclough, did I remember to say she's the most wonderful girl in the world?
I had hoped, sir.
That you were going to spare me that.
Goodnight, sir.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Look.
Well, what do you make of it?
How did it come?
- In that cigarette packet.
Hiltons.
Fingerprints?
- I've just sent for Evans.
These please.
- Very good, sir.
"My farewell performance."
First the picture and then this.
What do you make of it?
Is the fellow reforming?
I don't know about that, sir.
But I know that he can't wipe out a crime by this sort of thing.
"Farewell performance". Pah!
He thinks he has the right to end things just because he thinks he will.
But that's where he is wrong.
We'll give him his farewell performance.
Have you got something?
He has.
- What is it?
"West Milton 28."
Looks like a telephone number.
- It is.
Foster.
Foster, is that you?
Find out whose telephone number is ..
West Milton 28. I will hold on.
That will be all, Evans.
- Yes, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Lord Melrose?
Are you sure about that?
Thanks.
The telephone number belongs to the country house of Lord Melrose in Essex.
West Milton.
Come on, Mr Raffles.
Show us what you can do.
Jolly decent of His Lordship to give Mr Raffles for our side.
Aye, it will give us a chance for once.
Give it everything you've got, Mr Raffles.
Fine bowling, Raffles.
Come on, Mr Raffles.
Here I am.
Harry. You frightened me.
- Don't be so jumpy.
The old girl bring the necklace down with her?                - Yes.
You saw to that, eh? You got a little plan of the layout like I told you?
Yes. Here it is.
The big tree is just opposite this window.
This is Lady Melrose's room.
First door on your right.
I can do it with my eyes shut.
Harry, don't you think we ought to give it up?
If you're caught it's prison.
For me too.
- Will you take hold of yourself.
You want to go to Australia don't you?
You want to have your own little farm?
You know I do.
- Well, stop worrying.
Don't forget, a sleeping powder in the old girl's milk tonight.
I won't forget it.
Now, we'd better not be seen talking to one another.
Howzat!
Thank goodness that's over.
Now we shan't have to go through it again for another year.
Oh Lady Melrose, I don't believe you dislike cricket as much as you pretend.
My dear, it bores me to death.
It bores poor Gin and Tonic too.
Come along, darlings. Come with mummy.
Shall I take them, Milady?
- Thank you, Wilson.
Goodbye everybody. See you later.
And Wilson, I will wear the gold dress tonight.
Such a nice girl, Wilson.
She's the only maid I've ever had who doesn't breathe on me.
Have you finished in there?
A.J. I've got to talk to you.
What is it?
Well .. I'm in trouble.
Bad trouble, A.J.
I've been nearly off my head all day.
I phoned your flat this morning.
But they told me you'd come down here and that's what brought me.
Is it money?
Bad?
How bad?
Worse than you can imagine.
Oh, I've been a fool.
I've been gambling.
It's at thousand pounds.
All in one go?
No, it's been going on for weeks.
I don't know what started me.
But that isn't the point.
Last night after I left you, I ..
I had a final plunge to get it back.
And of course I lost.
But this time it wasn't my money.
They were mess funds I took.
This morning I found out there is an audit coming on Monday.
Oh, I see.
I'm just a common thief.
I'll be cashiered, disgraced.
They will put me in jail. I've been thinking about doing myself in.
You know that wouldn't help.
- It would get me out of it.
What about Gwen?
Would you do that to her?
What am I going to do?
I don't know yet.
You need a thousand pounds by
Monday. Is that it?         - Yes.
I don't mind telling you I haven't got it.
You haven't?
No. But that doesn't mean it can't be got.
You mean that?
Practically anything can be if it has to be and quite obviously this has to be.
The only question is how.
There is not a lot of time.
That was lovely.
I hope that interruption didn't disturb you just now.
That husband of mine.
Bunny.
Cheer up. Everything is going to be alright.
You mean I can count on it?
- Every penny of it.
Thanks, A.J.
What?
- Did you enjoy it, sir?
Oh yes. Splendid, splendid.
Nothing like a whiskey and soda after music.
How about a spot in the library?
- That's a good idea, sir.
Come along, come along.
- Thank you.
If you can't do it Raffles nobody else can.
Bless my soul.
Scotland Yard?
Scotland Yard, did you say?
Yes. Inspector MacKenzie.
Alright. Show him in. Show him in.
- Yes sir.
What on earth do you suppose
Scotland Yard wants here?
I can't imagine.
Lord Melrose?
Inspector MacKenzie?
Well, what is it? What do you want?
If you don't mind, sir.
My business is confidential.
Nonsense, nonsense. These are my guests.
This is Mr Whitely, Mr Thorndyke.
And Mr Raffles.
Mr A.J. Raffles, the cricketer?
Oh, I am a great admirer of yours, sir.
Well, I've long been a great admirer of yours.
Oh, I've read a lot about you.
You're quite a famous person.
Thank you, Mr Raffles.
Now if you will kindly tell me what your business is.
Lord Melrose.
We have reason to believe that an attempt will be made to rob this house.
Oh, I say.
- Not really?
I take you to mean burglars?
A burglar.
A?
Meaning one?
Aye.
This is very disturbing.
My wife is nervous enough already.
We've been reading all about this chap in the papers.
Oh, what's his name?
The Amateur Cracksman.
Ha. Amateur Cracksman.
The names these journalists invent.
Besides, there doesn't seem to be much very amateur about him by all accounts.
What do you say, Inspector?
- I agree. He is misnamed.
I call him just a thief.
As I told you, Inspector.
Lady Melrose is a very nervous woman.
I don't want her to know anything about this. Not a thing.
Or any of my other guests.
- I understand.
I am afraid she may come in at any moment.
Raffles, would you mind going out to her?
Well, it's been very nice meeting you, Inspector.
Excuse me.
Now, Inspector.
What do you propose to do?
I wonder would it be inconveniencing you too much Lord Melrose ..
If I was to stay here for a while?
Stay here?
Bless my soul.
What am I going to say to people?
Well, if I might suggest.
An old friend.
- An old friend?
Well, you leave me no alternative.
By the way, Lord Melrose.
You have a new telephone exchange here?
Yes, it's been in for two days.
A beastly nuisance changing your number like that.
Now, since getting that new number have you given it to anyone?
Given it? Not that I remember.
Yes. I've given it to one person.
At that beastly nightclub last night. I gave it to Bunny.
Who did you give it to?
- Bunny Manders. A nice young lad.
I've known him all his life. He and his sister are spending the weekend here.
Look here, you don't think that one of my guests is the ..?
Oh no. No, no.
No. That's purely a routine question.
Please remember that.
- Alright.
Who is that strange man with George?
I don't know. I met him only minutes ago and I didn't quite catch his name.
My dear, a most extraordinary thing.
A very old friend of mine has just happened to turn up.
This is mister ..
Cameron.
Mister who?
- Cameron, my dear.
One of the Scottish Camerons, you know.
He and I used to go deer-stalking.
Deer-stalking?
How do you do, Mr Cameron?
It's a pity you didn't get here in time for the music.
And George's snoring.
My dear, you know I don't like music.
Well, I don't like cricket.
But I don't take a nap in the middle of the playing fields.
Look after Mr Cameron.
Yes, of course. Come along, Cameron.
I want you to meet some of the others.
If you don't mind at the moment I'd ..
Like to have a smoke outside.
Yes, of course.
Enjoying a bit of air, Mr Raffles?
Oh, it's you .. Cameron?
Aye.
It was good of you not to give me away just now before the others.
Oh, not at all.
No, I always believe in helping the police whenever I can.
You know, I have a theory about the Cracksman.
I believe he is a myth.
Invented by Scotland Yard to cover up a multitude of, shall we say, failures.
Ah, now you are being very hard on us, Mr Raffles.
No. The Cracksman exists alright.
I'm going to hook him one of these days.
Play him and land him like a fish.
Like a fish?
Aye.
I'm a fisherman, Mr Raffles.
- Oh, yes.
You still haven't told me why you're fishing in this quiet pool.
I prefer not to divulge that.
Well, in any event I doubt there is anything much for me to worry about.
No.
I think you can go about your business undisturbed.
Thank you, Inspector.
After those reassuring words ..
I will.
There you are, A.J.
Mr Manders - Mr Cameron.
How do you do.
- How are you, Mr Manders?
Fine, thank you.
A beautiful spot, I'd call this.
Yes it is.
It reminds me of Stratford on Avon.
Ever been down to any of the revivals?
Yes, several times.
I saw The Merchant Of Venice there a few seasons back.
A student of Shakespeare, Cameron?
As well as a ..
Deer-stalker.
Well, a lover of the theatre, Mr Raffles.
You know, the finest performance of the Merchant of Venice I ever saw ..
Was with Maud Holden as Portia.
I imagine she was a bit before your time, Mr Manders.
No, as a matter of fact
Raffles and I saw her together.
We went to her farewell performance when we were kids.
Yes, she was magnificent.
Whatever happened to her? Is she dead?
No.
No, I don't think so.
In fact I heard of her the other day.
Well if you see her, I wish you'd tell her she still has a faithful admirer.
Yes. Two of them.
Ah.
Have a cigarette?
No thanks. I don't smoke.
Perhaps it's just as well.
There doesn't seem to be any in it.
Oh, Hiltons?
Why, Raffles will have one of those.
That's his favourite brand.
Really?
Yes, of course.
There you are.
- Thanks.
Mr Raffles.
Cricket has conquered music.
They are all calling for you.
Won't you come in and play lion?
Excuse me.
I just wanted to save you from that awful ..
What does George call him, "deer-stalker"?
Who is he? What is he?
- Well ..
You know something.
Come on, tell me.
Lady Melrose, I think it is most unfair the way they keep you in the dark.
Yes. That man is a detective.
- A detective?
What on earth is a detective doing here?
Well, he probably suspects an attempt on something.
Your necklace, for instance.
- My necklace?
What nonsense.
The ideas people get.
Why it's just all those silly papers.
- I agree.
And I suppose you probably keep it in a safe?
No. We have a safe here but ..
That is the first place burglars look.
I always keep my necklace in my bedroom.
Oh.
You think I shouldn't?
Well I imagine if there is a detective in the house it's alright.
He'd likely sleep outside your door all night.
He will do no such thing.
I shouldn't sleep a wink.
- He has to be where the emeralds are.
I will send them down to the safe and he can sleep here.
Good .. and yet ..
What?
As you say, that's probably the first place a burglar would look.
Just what I've always said.
I shall keep them in my room.
You will have the detective lying like a spaniel on your mat.
Not on my mat.
Well, you can't have it both ways.
Or can you?
Yes.
I think I can.
I've got an idea.
Mr Raffles.
I'm a very wily old woman.
George.
Yes, my dear?
I'm going up to bed now.
I want you to come up and get my jewel case and put it in the safe for me.
What? Why, you've never done that before.
Well, after all I've been hearing on the wireless about that amateur cracksman ..
I thought perhaps I should.
I doubted you would be so sensible.
I'll be up in a minute.
- Goodnight, Gwen.
Goodnight, Lady Melrose.
Goodnight. Forgive my going up won't you.
George's cricket was so exhausting I am worn out.
Sleep well. We will.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Deer-stalking indeed.
I'll deer-stalk him.
I beg your pardon, Milady?
- Nothing.
Put the milk down there.
I think I will take a sleeping powder tonight.
Do you think it wise, Milady?
Wise? Why not?
I don't know. I just thought ..
- Nonsense, go and fetch it.
What are you doing?
- Leave the milk there.
[ Door knocks ]
Is that you, George? Just a minute.
Come in.
Here you are.
You're a very sensible girl, my dear.
- Glad you think so.
So do I.
Goodnight, my dear.
- Goodnight.
Nothing to worry about.
- No.
Why are you standing there, grinning?
- Sorry, Milady.
Got my sleeping powder?
Yes, Milady.
- Well, put it in.
I hope I shall get off to sleep quickly tonight.
Yes.
I'm sure you will, Milady.
Never used this safe.
Except to keep the poker chips in.
And Kitty's birth certificate.
A lock of my hair as a baby.
Well, that's that.
When was this taken?
Oh, that was taken last night at The Ambassador.
Good one of my wife, isn't it.
Now sit down, Cameron.
How about a whiskey and soda?
So Mr Raffles was with you last night?
Yes, Gwen and Bunny brought him.
We've never met him before.
What a nice chap.
Aye.
I've no doubt he was the highlight of the occasion.
And to come early to meet the guests and all that.
Well no, as a matter of fact he was very late.
For a while we though he wasn't coming at all.
Is that so?
Remember me?
- Oh, Gwen.
Everybody has turned in.
We have the whole place to ourselves.
I've never seen a warmer, kindlier moon.
Does it meet with you approval?
Yes, it is nice.
Shall we walk to the brook?
Gwen .. I've got ..
What's the matter?
I wish I could explain.
There is so many things I want say and so many things I can't say.
It is so bewildering.
Have I done something?
No, you've never been anything but sweet and wonderful.
Even though there must be questions.
Tumbling over each other in your mind.
Questions that should be asked.
But can't be answered.
Very well then. I ..
I won't ask them.
Gwen, there is one thing you must know.
One thing you must believe.
Nothing matters to me except your happiness.
How very considerate.
Well.
I don't suppose there is anything more to be said.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Ah, Raffles.
Everyone gone to bed?
We've just been putting
Kitty's necklace away.
Now the only thing left to do is to put on the burglar alarm.
Oh, you have a burglar alarm?
Yes. One of these new electric-ray things.
There are six bells and they ring all over the house.
That must have quite a musical effect.
Yes. And once the thing is set.
If anyone tried putting as much as his toe through a window.
I think we've taken every precaution.
- It seems more than adequate to me.
I'm just going to trot off to bed. Goodnight, Raffles.
Goodnight, Cameron.
Well, I'll say goodnight too.
I'll come with you.
Splendid. Splendid.
Are you sleepy?
- Aye. A bit.
Are you?
Yes. I'll probably read for a while before I turn in.
I imagine your work leaves you pretty tired?
It does.
I can think of only one job as exciting as tracking down criminals as you do.
What's that?
Dodging you fellows.
Goodnight, Inspector.
Goodnight, Mr Raffles.
Dear Mr Raffles.
[ Burglar alarm bell ]
A.J.
A.J.
What are you doing? Who are you?
Look here.
You can't do this to me.
Help me! It's the burglar, I believe.
Bunny!
Crawshay, huh?
Out of your depth here, aren't you.
I ain't taken a thing, Guvnor.
True, I ain't.
Well, Inspector. You weren't far wrong. I congratulate you.
I think we are both to be congratulated.
He didn't get anything.
Is this the "Cracksman" fellow?
This?
No.
He looks a pretty slimy sort of an eel.
I say, what about Kitty?
I had quite forgotten all about her.
Cameron, I am a little disappointed in your cracksman.
This isn't the cracksman, Mr Raffles.
Crawshay and I are old acquaintances.
I've been responsible for several little holidays of his.
That's too bad. Rather like fishing for salmon and catching a minnow, isn't it.
The salmon is still in the stream, Mr Raffles.
And patience is a virtue, Cameron.
It's alright. Kitty is fast asleep.
I am so glad she didn't wake up.
Well come along. I think we'd all better toddle back to bed.
Goodnight, Cameron.
You are A.J. Raffles the cricketer, ain't you?
Yes.
A nice looking little ticker you got there.
Well thank you. I hope you weren't looking at it professionally.
Blokes like me, we have an eye for little things like that.
Come on, Crawshay.
How extraordinary.
A.J.
Come in.
Hello Bunny.
- You dressed early.
Got to go to town on that business of yours.
Now?
What earthly excuse are you going to give to old Melrose?
I'll take care of that at breakfast.
Can I come to town with you?
No.
- Why not?
I can't sit around here wondering all day.
There is nothing to wonder about.
It's all going to be alright.
I'll have that money for you by dinner time.
Are you sure?
Just As sure as if it were in my pocket.
What do you expect, sir?
Not another attempt?
I don't know. But something.
That's why I sent for you, Merton.
If Crawshay knows something
I want to know too.
But if the jewels are still in the safe?
I know.
It's a puzzle.
Wait.
Cameron. Are you still here?
I thought your work was done.
No, not yet, Mr Raffles. Not all of it.
What did you do with your minnow?
- Crawshay?
He is in the village jail.
- Oh.
You are up early, Mr Raffles.
- Yes. A lovely morning, isn't it.
Had your breakfast?
- No, I haven't.
Aha. Here comes the saviour of the Melrose jewels.
Three cheers for Scotland Yard.
Good morning, Raffles.
- Good morning, sir.
Oh, kidneys.
- I say, Raffles.
What have you done to your hand?
It's nothing. Just a little bruise I got yesterday.
My dear boy, I do hope it's not serious.
I don't think so. Can you give me some bacon, sir?
But you are bowling for
Middlesex tomorrow.
It will be alright by then.
Is that an egg in there?
Yes. Look here, you may have bruised the bone or something.
Why don't you run up to London and let old Spurgeon have a look at it?
It's really nothing.
It's a very important match, you know.
Maybe I should go up.
Dash up immediately after breakfast and get him to vet it for you.
Yes. I think I will.
Get my bags packed and send the car round to the front door.     - Yes, sir.
I hope you're not leaving me.
George! George!
That sounds like Kitty.
What is it, my dear? I'm coming.
I've been robbed. George, where are you?
I've been robbed.
My necklace, they've stolen it.
Nonsense, my dear. Go back to bed.
You're all undressed. Don't look at her.
Don't be so silly. What does it matter what I look like. Don't you understand?
My necklace has been stolen.
Your necklace is in the safe. Don't you remember? You gave it to me.
No, I did not.
Kitty, those sleeping tablets have been too much.
I'll go and get it and show you.
- I gave you the case.
The necklace is not there.
I kept it in my room.
What's that?
Oh, you're still here, are you?
A fine detective, you are.
Letting them steal my necklace.
A detective indeed.
I believe it was you who stole it.
Have him searched.
- Lady Melrose.
You mean that case you sent down to the safe last night was empty?
Oh, so it's penetrated, has it?
Who told you I was a detective?
Do you think I don't know detective's feet when I see them?
Oh, Mr Raffles.
How right you were in everything you said. But why didn't you protect me?
Where were you, Mr Raffles?
Oh, where were you?
Aye.
Where were you, Mr Raffles?
I, when?
When the alarm went off.
I was in my room, reading.
Of course.
Inspector.
Inspector, look.
The case is empty. The necklace was never in the safe at all.
Of course not. I don't see what you wanted to go and look for.
Well, I'll give a thousand pounds reward.
A thousand pounds to anyone who returns the necklace to me.
All your nonsense of safes and detectives and burglar alarms.
Yes, Kitty. Now go back to bed, my dear.
You are all upset.
Gwen, will you be so kind as to ..
Or kidnapped.
Come along.
See that nobody enters or leave the house.
What's that, Inspector?
I propose to examine everyone.
You can't do that. I won't have my guests treated like that.
I'd rather lose the necklace altogether.
I'm afraid the matter is in my hands now, Lord Melrose.
And you will not lose the necklace.
Well I hope there is no objection my having my guests in the house.
I don't think I'll be needing those now.
That's right, isn't it?
We're under arrest?
Ah, I don't know.
I think we might make an exception in your case.
Oh, thank you.
That's alright. You can put
Mr Raffles' things in the car.
Wait a minute. Are you sure you would not like to search them first or me?
I don't think that will be necessary.
- Alright.
I am extremely grateful to you, Inspector.
Tell Gwen I'll call her from London.
- Alright, A.J.
Good luck with the salmon fishing, Cameron.
Aye.
I'm thinking of trying new bait, Mr Raffles.
Oh, splendid.
But Lady Melrose whatever possessed you not to put the necklace in the safe?
It was the way dear Mr Raffles talked.
A.J.? When?
- Last night.
He agreed with me that the safe would be the first place a thief would go to.
You mean he told you to keep it up here?
- No.
I told him I always did.
Did he ask you?
- Yes.
He seemed quite concerned about it.
Excuse me, Lady Melrose.
I must speak to him.
It wasn't his fault.
It was all my fault I suppose.
[ Car engine noise ]
Are you letting him go?
Yes.
Get a fast car immediately.
And this is what you do.
Take that fellow Crawshay out of the village jail and get him to London.
And when you do get him there, let him escape and then follow him.
What?
- Go on, don't argue.
This isn't the first time I've set a thief to catch a thief.
Filthy weather, Mr Raffles.
Did you get my cricket bag and put the car away?
Yes, sir.
- Thanks.
Oh, you're back, sir.
A boring weekend, I take it.
Not exactly boring, Barraclough. No.
Any letters, any messages?
Bills. All bills by the look of them.
I'm afraid so, sir.
Leave that. I want you to go out for me.
I want you to go to the Airways
Office in The Haymarket.
And get me a seat on the evening plane for Amsterdam.
Here is a tenner. Sorry to send you out in the rain, but be as quick as you can.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me, sir.
Is Mr Raffles in?
- Oh, Miss Manders.
Gwen.
Crawshay has escaped.
Mackenzie let him escape.
What?
"Set a thief to catch a thief", he said.
I see.
Why did you do it? Whatever made you begin it all in the first place?
Too long a story to tell you, darling.
It's all so incredible, so fantastic.
Maybe that was the reason.
Well, thank you for coming to tell me about Crawshay.
I didn't come for that.
[ Doorbell ]
Don't let them in. Don't let them in.
Gwen, you shouldn't have come here.
- They couldn't keep me away.
It will be alright. It's alright.
Wait.
Come in here.
[ Doorbell ]
Ah, the fisherman.
- Aye.       - Come in.
You must have exceeded the speed limit.
I suppose police don't mind doing that.
Aye, I have a good car.
You have a good cloak too.
Yes.
It is useful cover in an emergency.
That's worth remembering.
What did the doctor say about your hand?
I haven't been down to see him yet. I'll go along later on.
Let me get you a drink.
- No thanks.
Do you mind if I help myself?
No. Go ahead.
Crawshay has escaped, Mr Raffles.
Has he now?
Well, that sounds rather careless of you, Inspector.
He is here, in The Albany.
Is he?
I must look out for him.
I am looking out for him.
I've got the place surrounded.
Then there is nothing to worry about. Except the necklace.
I'll get that as soon as I've got Crawshay.
Has he got it?
No. But he knows who has.
- Oh.
Do you mind if I look around the rooms?
For Crawshay? By all means.
Thank you.
- Do you mind if I read my letters?
By all means.
- Thank you.
A nice vase you've got here.
Yes.
Not big enough for Crawshay to hide in though.
Is this your bedroom?
- Yes, allow me.
After you.
Is this the bathroom?
Yes.
Go in. I'm not bathing at the moment.
And that other door?
That's the spare room.
May I see it?
At the moment, it is occupied.
Occupied? You don't say.
By a lady.
Her name is not Crawshay.
Hmm.
You can trust my discretion.
How do you do, Inspector?
Have glass of sherry, Gwen.
Yes, thank you.
That's a fine looking clock you have.
Are you interested in clocks?
Take a look at the works.
An interesting specimen.
I'll take your word for it.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see it?
No thanks.
I've seen all I came to see.
And a bit more.
Maybe I will have a drink with you after all.
Splendid.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
Do you mind a pipe?
No, not at all.
What's the matter?
- I left my pouch.
Is this pipe tobacco?
- Yes.
I don't think you'd care for that.
Let me give you a cigar.
I have something rather special.
Thanks.
I'll smoke this after dinner.
Take another one for now.
No, I'd rather have my pipe.
Oh, my cigarette.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope you will find that alright.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me, I'm playing butler today.
Mr Mackenzie?
We've spotted Crawshay.
He's on the roof.
I'll come along.
You had better leave someone outside Mr Raffles' door in case ..
In case ..?
Well, in case Crawshay tries breaking in that way.
Oh.
I want to give you every protection, Mr Raffles.
Or in case Mr Raffles tries breaking out.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
- I do.
Put your hands up.
What do you want?
- I want the sparklers. So hand over.
Mr Crawshay, if I give you those jewels it won't do either of us any good.
The police want both of us.
They know you're here.
Yes, I don't think. You ain't going to get away with no story like that.
Either you hand over them sparklers or I blow the blooming daylights out of you.
Alright, then. Go ahead and shoot.
But do you know Crawshay what will happen to you?
Have you ever heard a man condemned to death?
I have.
The murderer I saw clung to the dock-rail like a wet towel ..
When the judge put on that black cap.
It's not a cap exactly.
It's a piece of silk or something.
Just telling you this so you'll know.
And while he does that there is a silence.
You can hear your heart going like a piston at the bottom of your throat.
You try to swallow.
But you can't.
That's when you feel the rope round your neck and the trap door under your feet.
And then from a long way away.
You will hear the judge's voice.
Telling you that you are to be hanged by the neck.
Until you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
I'm sorry, Crawshay.
I admit that wasn't very fair.
Why, you ..
That's what comes of listening to a bloke like you.
I entirely agree with you. Now come on, we've got to get you out of here.
Here is the rope, Inspector.
That's how he went down.
Pull it up!
Got any money?
- Nothing.
Here's a fiver. It's my last but good luck.
Look.
Now go downstairs and get the pair of them.
They've got me, Guvnor. They've got me. What am I going to do?
That ledge. Down that pipe to the next ledge.
That window leads to a passage.
And then you're on your own.
Sorry for the bad evening.
You're a pal, Guvnor.
Before you go do a pal a good turn. Know what that is?
God love you, Guvnor. You're a pro.
A real pro.
Now for them.
[ Door knocks ]
Where is he?
Mr Raffles? He's in his room.
Of course I've got him.
He's been put out with something.
Where's Crawshay?
He got away through the bathroom window.
Mr Raffles.
Mr Raffles, what's happened, sir?
What is it?
- Mr Raffles.
Mr Raffles, sir.
What's happening?
Mr Raffles.
What is it?
Oh, Barraclough.
Well, Inspector. Crawshay came alright.
Aye, Mr Raffles. Crawshay came and went.
Inspector.
Inspector, we've got him.
- Anything on him?
Only a five-pound note.
A five-pound note?
Just a minute, sir.
Don't stop me. I've been sent for.
Gwen, my dear. What are you doing here?
What you must do too, Lord Melrose.
Trying to help Mr Raffles.
You are too late, all of you.
Confound it so.
Well, Inspector. You got your man.
Aye.
We got him alright, Mr Raffles.
Good. You can always depend on dear old Scotland Yard.
Yes.
Here is a warrant for your arrest.
No!
- What?
You will have to explain your business in Amsterdam, Mr Raffles.
My business in Amsterdam?
Amsterdam is the jewel market of Europe.
You are the Amateur Cracksman, aren't you Mr Raffles?
Yes.
Aye.
Raffles.
Well, there it is, Bunny.
I'm sorry, but there it is.
You still haven't got your necklace, Inspector.
Lord Melrose. Do you remember the reward you offered?
One thousand pounds to anybody that would return it.
I don't need to be reminded.
Bunny, could you use a thousand pounds?
I'm sure you could.
Now you just give the necklace back to Lord Melrose.
You will find it in my tobacco jar.
The tobacco jar?
Well, I'll be ..
Yes, I thought you would be.
A.J.
How could you have been such a fool?
Supposing I did need the money?
What is all this? I don't understand.
I think I do.
Now see here, Inspector.
We've got these back.
No need to go any further.
And I don't want any scandal.
Aye, you needn't worry.
Your name is not on the warrant.
Well Inspector, you got your necklace.
I have.
But you haven't got me.
Here!
Here, get after him!
Go and get something to break down that door.
[ Gunshot! ]
Good heavens, he's killed himself.
Gwen.
Go on.
Barraclough. The door.
I can't stop.
- No, hurry.
Goodbye, Barraclough.
Hurry Raffles.
Hurry, sir.
Good luck, darling.
They'll nab him downstairs.
I wonder.
You see him?
- No.    - He's got away.
You two men cover the side of the house.
- Very good, sir.
You get over there.
You two follow me.
We've the entire square surrounded, sir.
- Good, good.
Where did he go? Where did he go?
Don't stand staring like that.
But sir, but sir ..
- What's the matter?
You just went down that way, sir.
That was him you fool.
There he is.
Where?
"Meet me here at 7 o'clock."
"Positively my farewell performance."
Sir, it's a hoax to waste our time.
I'm not so sure.
You know, Merton.
There is not much fun in life if you never trust anybody.
And this Raffles fellow.
Well, I don't altogether dislike him.
I hope you're not making a mistake.
I'll chance it.
You may take your men away.
I think I'd rather wait for Mr Raffles alone.
Yes.
Darling, you shouldn't have come.
Suppose they're watching for you?
I had to see you once more.
Just for a moment.
Yes. But supposing they f頽d you here?
- Now don't you worry. I'm not worried.
I love you.
I know I said it before but I thought you may like to hear it again.
0h, darling.
No matter what happens, we'll be together. Promise?
I want you to stay, and yet.
I want you to go.
It so happens I've got to go.
Where?
Just round the corner. I have an appointment at 7 o'clock.
I hate to keep anybody waiting but sometimes you have to.
I understand.

Here I come!
Here I come!
I beat you!
We want to do it again.
Come on.
Well, they seem to have you down, Mr. Chan.
- Sixty summers young. Sixty winters old.
- Come on.
Come on, Charlie.
We wanna do it again.
What'd you say?
You want song about
Princess Ming Lo Fu?
All right.
- Come on.
- Thank you so much.
Come on, Charlie. Come on.
You conduct mission long here in China?
Yes. In Yangtze Valley.
Very interesting.
Taking a vacation, eh?
Staying in Shanghai long?
A holiday mood like fickle girl... privilege to change mind.
Now then, play fair. This is your first visit to Shanghai in many years, isn't it?
Yes. Most anxious to renew acquaintance... with land of honorable ancestors.
Oh, there he is, Diana.
- Mr. Charlie Chan?
- Humbly acknowledge name.
I'm Philip Nash,
Sir Stanley Woodland's secretary.
Most happy to make acquaintance.
This is Sir Stanley's niece,
Miss Diana Woodland from Canada.
- How do you do, Mr. Chan?
- So pleased.
Sir Stanley asked me to apologize for not meeting you himself... but he was detained on business.
You will see him, of course, at the banquet tonight.
- There is banquet?
- Oh, why of course.
The arrival in Shanghai of so distinguished a visitor can't go unnoticed.
Much flattered... by unexpected acknowledgement of humble efforts.
You'll have to make a speech, you know.
Idea of making speech bring goose pimples.
Much scared.
Hi, Pop!
Hi.
Joy equals astonishment... at seeing offspring in Shanghai.
- Explanation, please.
- Mom cabled you were coming to Shanghai... so the firm sent me here to look into the trade situation.
Yes? Selling oil for lamps of China?
Pocketbook, of course, left in other suit?
- Believe it or not.
- Old excuse... like ancient billy goat has whiskers.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me... as president of the chamber of commerce... to welcome our illustrious guest, the famous Charlie Chan.
And now I have a bit of good news for you.
We are not making speeches tonight.
Just a few words of welcome to Shanghai.
I call on Colonel Watkins, our commissioner of police.
I count myself lucky to have known
Charlie Chan for quite a few years.
Charlie is a splendid friend...
but I'd hate to be his enemy.
Here's to our friendship,
Charlie.
- When did the commissioner of police meet Mr. Chan?
Scotland Yard, at the time of Sir Lionel Bashford's murder.
I call on Mr. Sun Wong.
I made an important discovery this afternoon.
That's what prevented me from meeting you.
We can get together after this is over.
Two ears for every tongue.
What does all that mean?
He said,
"Thank you so much."
And now we are fortunate in having with us our old friend...
Sir Stanley Woodland, who has a few words to say in our behalf.
It is a great pleasure to me to perform this friendly ceremony.
I am certain I can think of no better words... to voice our sentiments, Charlie... than are inscribed on the scroll contained in this jade box... fashioned, who knows...
by the hands of your ancestors.
- May I read it to you?
- Please.
Uncle Stanley!
Uncle Stanley!
Murderer most ingenious.
But the motive, Charlie?
The motive?
Motive like end of string... tied in many knots.
End may be in sight, but hard to unravel.
Sir Stanley had so many friends but few enemies.
Only one enemy necessary to commit murder.
Box was in hands of, uh,
Sir Stanley's secretary?
Yes. But he...
Let's hear what he has to say.
- Diana, how is she?
- She is taking it pretty hard.
Hmm. That box, Philip, you were looking after it, weren't you?
Yes. It was in my room all afternoon.
I brought it here myself.
You look in box before coming here?
When Sir Stanley first gave it to me, I did.
It was all right this afternoon.
- Did not look before starting for banquet?
- No.
Someone could have changed box during afternoon?
Well, yes, I suppose it could have been done.
Too bad you let it out of your sight.
- But how could I know anything like this would happen?
- Yes, yes, yes.
Perhaps home better than here for young lady.
She'll appreciate it.
May I, Colonel Watkins?
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Thank you.
Sir Stanley very good friend.
With your permission, would like to help on case.
I was hoping you'd say that.
My whole department is at your service.
For present, would prefer to work alone.
Yes, yes, of course, if you wish.
Thank you.
- Will say good night now.
- Good night, Charlie.
Thank you.
- Find fingerprints?
- Now listen, Pop.
If you and Sir Stanley had business together... it's a cinch that whoever sent you this note killed him... and is after you too.
Very clever deduction.
Instincts of detective father... inherited by noble offspring.
- But what's it all about?
- Talk cannot cook rice.
You mean you don't know what it's all about yourself?
Silence best answer when uncertain.
- You go to bed now.
- All right.
But don't say
I didn't warn you.
Thank you.
Distance no hindrance to fond thoughts.
Good night.
Good night, Pop.
Good night.
Do not forget your prayers.
May need them.
Hey, Pop. What was that?
Pop!
Dad. Dad.
Dad!
Operator, get the police, quick!
- Can relax.
- Dad!
- I thought they'd got you.
- Have idea someone make attack... so come into your room to watch on sofa.
So sorry fall asleep.
Hello. Hello. Police department.
Police department.
Charlie Chan speaking.
Is anything wrong, Mr. Chan?
May tell commissioner that desire of my son to report murder... based on hasty conclusion and devotion to father.
Yes.
Safe now to sleep.
Sleep?
Insignificant man has never improved on nature's tonic.
But you can't sleep with this sort of thing going on!
Contradiction, please.
Murderer believed
Charlie Chan dead.
Second attack unlikely.
- Gee, Pop, you gave me the scare of my life.
- Yes?
Wake up, Charlie!
Thank you so much.
Office.
Good morning.
Have wish to order breakfast.
Room service is busy, Mr. Chan.
Will you wait a moment, please?
Marloff, something went wrong last night.
What do you mean?
I'll connect you on this line.
Listen carefully.
And don't say anything until I speak again.
You may have room service now, Mr. Chan.
Will have coffee, rolls... marmalade and very large omelet.
You see?
All right, you stay there and keep your eyes open.
I'll let you know what to do later.
Oh, it's you, Pop. I dreamt that
I was facing a firing squad.
Dreams like good liars... distort facts.
One fact very clear... have much hearty hunger.
- Now you dress.
- Okay.
Grant favor, please?
Omit song in bathroom.
Gee, Pop,
I sure miss my radio.
~ The bear went over the mountain ~
~ The bear went over the mountain ~
~ The bear went over the mountain ~
~ To see what he could see ~
Hurry, Lee.
Cold omelet like fish out of sea... does not improve with age.
Where you going, Pop?
To visit very charming young lady.
You stay here and look after telephone.
I will inform my most august lady of your exalted presence.
Thank you so much.
May your honorable ancestors rest in peace.
- Good morning, Mr. Chan.
- Good morning.
So sorry to disturb.
Have come to offer sympathy.
Thank you.
Am trying to help police.
Have necessary questions.
- Perhaps you have answers.
- Ask anything you wish, please.
Sir Stanley appear nervous.
As if afraid of attack?
Why, I...
I never thought of it before, but... for the last few weeks
Uncle Stanley has been rather... oh, how shall I describe it... rather cautious.
Can be more definite?
Well, now that I think of it, he never wished to be left alone.
Was to have assisted honorable uncle in important matter.
- You know nature of his business?
- No.
Someone made very certain
Sir Stanley did not talk to me.
Perhaps search among uncle's papers... disclose important communication for me?
Mr, Chan, last night after Philip left me... someone broke into
Uncle Stan's library.
- There were papers all over the floor this morning.
- May I see, please?
Yes, this way.
Nothing has been touched?
Philip was here for a few moments this morning. Then he called the police.
And Colonel Watkins said to leave things untouched until he arrived.
Young man Philip is here?
No. He went to the docks to meet a Mr. Andrews.
- From Washington?
- I believe so.
Uncle Stanley was expecting him, I know.
- You like young man very much?
- Yes, very much.
Most fortunate young man.
If papers found for
Mr. Andrews or self... will take good care?
- Most important.
- I will, Mr. Chan.
Thank you so much.
Aw, listen, baby.
What have I been doing for the last 30 minutes but listen?
On the boat you said you wanted to see me every night.
- Have you changed your mind?
- Sure, I want to see you.
Do we meet tonight or do we not?
I'm trying to tell you that
I can't say for certain, you see.
Hello! Hello!
Hello!
Yes. This is his room, but he's not in.
Sure, I'll tell him just as soon as he comes in.
Am in.
- That was...
- Sir Stanley's secretary?
Yes, and he said...
That Mr. Andrews has arrived?
How do you do it, Pop?
With mirrors?
Good for seeing backwards.
Well, here's one. Do you know that this Mr. Andrews wants to see you?
Well, now that you tell me, I know.
- Mr. Chan?
- Am Charlie Chan.
I'm from the commissioner of police.
He sent this note.
You talked to girl on telephone all morning or many girls?
Only one, Pop.
I tried to shake her, but I couldn't.
Will wait one moment, please?
Certainly, sir.
Get, uh, commissioner of police.
Operator? Get me 15380.
Say, Pop, you don't think this is phony, do you?
Phony? Translate into English, please.
You know, is there something fishy about it?
Slight odor, perhaps.
Will see.
Yes?
The old boy's pretty cagey.
He's checking up on us.
Put him on.
Police department.
What name, please?
Oh, Mr. Chan.
Just a moment.
I'll put you through to his private secretary.
Good morning, Mr. Chan.
I've been trying to get you for an hour, but the line has been busy.
Humbly apologize for... telephone flirtation by my son.
The commissioner wants you to come at once to the address he has given the chauffeur.
- He's one of our men.
- Thank you so much.
Where do we go from here?
I go. You stay here.
And please make note.
You pay bill for all female telephone calls.
Well, I got here just as soon as I could.
You seem to be in an awful rush, if you ask me.
Hello. Who wants him?
This is Colonel Watkins, commissioner of police.
Oh, good morning, sir.
Pop got your note all right.
- He's on his way to meet you now.
- On his way to meet me?
I never sent him a note.
You didn't?
Charlie Chan's son said that his father's just left the hotel... in answer to a note
I'm supposed to have sent him.
- That's odd, sir.
- It's more than odd.
Send over a couple of men at once.
- I want an immediate report.
- Very good, sir.
- Do you want to buy flower?
- Oh.
Thank you, sir.
- I've got to get a taxi! I'm in a hurry!
- Taxi!
Catch that car!
Double fare if you make it!
Hey, step on it, will you?
We've got to catch that car!
Hurry!
Here, let me drive this thing!
Well, here we are.
Sit down.
So much reception.
Most flattering.
Charlie Chan often see enemies in shadow box.
Now enemies see Charlie Chan.
Just a little taste of your own medicine.
Medicine very bitter.
What are you doing in Shanghai?
Think perhaps you have made answer impossible.
- Here's another one, Chief.
- Lee!
Listen, Pop.
The commissioner rang up...
Let capture be good lesson of virtue of silence.
Silence won't help you.
You came here to meet
Sir Stanley Woodland!
If answer known, question seem unnecessary.
Are you trying to tell me that you don't know why...
Sir Stanley Woodland summoned you to Shanghai?
Answer to question veiled in death.
Yes, Mr. Chan.
For you and for your son.
Hasty conclusion like, uh, hind leg of mule... kick backward.
What do you mean?
- If we die, you also die.
- Yeah?
Have ace in hole.
Suggest view through window.
Very interesting.
Look for beggar.
Not very good beggar, but very good detective.
- Detective?
- Sure, he's a detective.
A second after you left, the commissioner rang up... and when I told him what had happened, he said to tell a cop to follow us.
By now, this whole joint is surrounded by cops.
That's right, he did say something to a cop as he came out of the hotel.
That is ace in hole.
Come on, Pop!
Let's get a move on!
Go.
Very proud of athletic offspring.
As you say, scram!
And you're certain
Sir Stanley left no message for me?
- None that I know of, Mr. Andrews.
- Hmm.
Have a cigarette?
Thank you.
Well, make yourself at home, Nash.
I'll go freshen up bit and see if I can get rid of these sea legs.
Rough trip.
I beg pardon, sir.
The laundry on the boat fairly ruined the master's shirts, sir.
Do you happen to know where
I could purchase a new supply?
There's a little shop about two blocks down the street... Soo Low Gow's.
Thank you, sir.
- Is this Mr. Andrews's apartment?
- Yes, miss.
- Name, please?
- Miss Diana Woodland and Colonel Watkins.
- Is Mr. Nash with Mr. Andrews?
- Mr. Nash is in the study.
- Shall I announce you, miss?
- All right.
- Yes.
- Diana thought we'd find you here, Philip.
I found this in Uncle Stanley's desk.
Colonel Watkins thought we ought to bring it over. It's addressed to Mr. Andrews.
Oh, Mr. Andrews.
Miss Woodland.
- May I extend my deepest sympathy, Miss Woodland.
- Thank you so much.
This is Colonel Watkins, commissioner of the police department.
- A pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you, sir. You have something for me?
Yes, I found this in my uncle's desk.
We thought it might contain information... that would throw some light on Sir Stanley's death.
Will you pardon me, please?
Why, no, there's nothing in this to help us, Colonel.
Pardon me, please.
Hello.
Yes, have him come up.
I hope you won't think me rude... but I've a most important visitor whom I must see immediately.
Yes, of course, certainly.
Well, we'll see you soon, I hope.
No, no. Don't go, please.
There's a pleasant breeze out on the balcony... and I'll join you shortly for a gin rickey.
- Splendid idea, eh, Philip?
- Why, yes.
- Mr. Andrews?
- Yes. Come in.
- Just came from...
- Visitors.
This way, sir.
This matter is of such enormous importance
I don't trust anyone.
- Most wise.
- Will you sit down?
- Thank you.
- Young Nash tells me that you and Sir Woodland... had no opportunity for a private talk.
- Most unfortunate.
- You know, of course, why he sent for you?
Sir Woodland's letter very vague.
Await explanation, please.
Well, as you know, Sir Stanley was a secret agent of the British government.
I'm in the same service, representing the United States.
Cooperating with the Opium Committee of the League of Nations... and certain officials in the Chinese government...
we were planning a campaign to round up a group of smugglers... who've been using Shanghai as a clearinghouse for their goods.
It's a grave situation,
Mr. Chan.
The terrific toll of life taken yearly by this insidious traffic is beyond belief.
Beauty of poppy conceals sting of death.
In more ways than one,
I'm afraid.
Sir Stanley was murdered because he knew too much.
- He left report?
- Apparently not.
Oh, I've an important phone call
I must make for Mr. Andrews.
- You won't mind?
- You go right ahead, my boy.
I'll see that she's here when you come back.
So, without a doubt, it was Sir Stanley's idea that you, knowing the language... and customs of the country, would succeed where we might fail.
Confidence most flattering.
- Not misplaced.
- Thank you so much.
Uh, commissioner of police assisting?
No, we thought it best to limit the knowledge of our work to just us three.
Kidnap plot and attempt to kill humble self... indicate that many others share knowledge.
They tried to kill you too?
Spider does not spin web for single fly.
Sir Stanley's secretary now work for you?
I think so. Sir Stanley apparently had great confidence in him.
- He might identify men we seek.
- No.
Sir Stanley confided in no one.
I don't know where to begin.
Long journey always start with one short step.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
No, don't risk it.
- No! Now don't be a fool!
- It's quite safe.
- Did you see anyone in here?
- Why, no.
Are Colonel Watkins and Miss Woodland safe?
- What's all the excitement?
- Why, someone shot at Mr. Chan from this room.
- Charlie, are you hurt?
- No.
- I rang up and your son said...
- Please, talk later.
- Did you just come in?
- Yes, sir.
- See anyone in the hall?
- No, sir, and no one in here either.
Except Mr. Nash. He was just coming from the bedroom, I think.
- He stepped in to make the phone call for you.
- Phone call? What phone call?
Hello, operator.
Operator.
Was any call made from this room during the last 10 minutes?
Thank you.
Well, young man?
Charlie, do you mind looking in the bedroom?
Oh, Philip.
What were you looking for in my bags? Search him.
- Oh, Philip, don't let them.
- Please, dear.
Here.
The note to you from Sir Stanley.
But why should he have taken that?
It's of no importance.
- May see?
- Yes.
- Stand by that door.
- Yes, sir.
Perhaps fingerprints.
Probably. We'll have them compared at headquarters.
Waiting not necessary.
- Have powder puff, please?
- Why, yes.
Observe.
Scar on thumb.
Hmm.
Your right hand, please.
That scar settles it.
Nash, you're under arrest for attempted murder of Mr. Chan.
Philip! Oh, he couldn't have done it, Colonel.
Please, Diana.
You have nothing to say?
It's my duty to warn you that anything you say may be used in evidence against you.
You're making a great mistake, Colonel.
I'm sorry, Diana, but that's for a jury to decide.
He's the only one at the time of the shooting whose movements are not explained.
Your man was coming in at that door.
He saw no one in the hall.
I was on the balcony with Miss Woodland... and you and Mr. Chan were in the study and you were found near the spot... from which the shot was fired.
No one could've gone out of that window because it's locked on the inside.
And finally, there's an identifying fingerprint...
found on the butt of this gun.
Now I call that a pretty clear case, wouldn't you, Charlie?
Charlie!
See who that is.
Charlie, where on earth did you get to?
Made most interesting discovery.
But, Charlie, the evidence is as clear as the nose on your face.
Owner of face cannot always see nose.
All right, what's the big discovery?
Very possible someone leave apartment through this window.
Huh. It's fastened on the inside.
Most humble apologies for exhibiting commonplace match as clue.
Examine, please.
Well, I don't see anything unusual.
- Notice spot of oil?
- Yes.
Note handle.
Maybe it squeaked and someone oiled it.
Maybe someone have better reason.
Will demonstrate.
Now listen, baby. Nothing would please me more than to take you out tonight... but how many more times have I got to tell you that I can't say for certain yet...
I'm very sorry, but that's absolutely all I can say!
Mr. Chan has nothing for publication.
Hello, Pop!
Oh, all right.
Here's your dime.
Cash on the line for one female telephone call.
Thank you so much.
- Tired?
- No.
Just had refreshing ride on fire escape.
Got a clue, Pop?
Shot in dark sometime find eye of bull.
- Have read?
- It sounds reasonable enough.
Observe envelope.
I don't get it.
Unimportant letter in envelope marked "important."
Get it?
I'm sorry, Pop.
I missed it.
Look, Pop!
"Have made important discovery involving one Ivan Marloff.
"A m closely watched.
Use this means for communication as agreed. 'W'. "
Gee, Pop, you don't think that's the man who kidnapped you?
Most elementary conclusion.
Well, I'll be...
- Got something?
- Something very strange.
Mr. Andrews did not think letter important.
I get it.
And he should have... because if he and Sir Stanley were working together... he would have known about the invisible writing.
Most excellent conclusion.
Very proud.
- What you going to do now?
- Ask Mr. Andrews questions.
I'm Mr. Andrews.
Is Mr. Chan in?
Come in, please.
Been trying to reach you for the past hour,
Mr. Chan, but your line's been busy.
- So sorry. Romantic offspring.
- Oh, I see.
- Will you sit down, please?
- Thanks.
Very great honor to receive visit in humble hotel.
- May offer refreshment, please?
- Yes, thanks. Scotch.
Soothing drink like summer shower... bring grateful relief.
Oh, you're not joining me?
Preserve appetite for less potent Chinese tea.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
You're very hospitable, Mr. Chan, but not always polite.
- Hmm?
- When you walked out on me today...
I naturally expected you to return after the others left.
So sorry for delay.
A very casual letter from Sir Woodland... in an envelope marked "important" was not sent to me for nothing...
Mr. Chan, and you took it with you.
Apologies.
Very bad habit of collecting clues.
I was right.
Must look for man named Marloff.
You brought this up too?
Principle of trusting no one make me doubt even you. So very sorry.
Well, in view of what's happened
I can't say that I blame you.
But you must understand I couldn't have exposed the secret message before the others.
Very excellent precaution.
This gives us a good lead.
We can start work on this at once.
Suggest first search kidnap house.
May find clue there.
- You know where they took you?
- Have very excellent reason to remember.
Well, let's go then.
- I'm going with you, Pop.
- Contradiction, please. You stay here.
And keep away from telephone!
If our friend Marloff was the man behind the lights... he and his gang left here in a hurry.
Smart rats know when to leave ship.
Recognize fingerprint with scar?
Well, let's see.
It's Nash's all right.
Who's there?
Give us most hearty fright.
Hands up, please!
- What you do here?
- To help you.
Huh?
I didn't know what you and Mr. Andrews might run into... so I came along, just in case.
Got idea of disguise from detective book?
Yeah, and it's a pip too.
May borrow book sometime?
Sure. Ah, you're kidding me, Pop.
On contrary, greatly appreciate, just in case.
- Suggest we now take police into confidence.
- I think it wise.
Any orders, Pop?
Four. Return to hotel, burn disguise... study detective book, watch telephone...
- and, uh, take bath.
- Okay.
You say you'd recognize these men if you saw them again?
Except man behind lights.
Recognize accent.
- What about the switchboard girl at the hotel?
- Very pretty brunette.
Hmm. I suppose you remember her, hey, Charlie?
Make very good impression.
You're fighting a desperate gang.
My department is yours if you need it, you know.
Secrecy in our operations is most important, Colonel.
Offer greatly appreciated.
All right, gentlemen, it's your funeral.
Hope not.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Miss Woodland is here, sir.
- Oh. Ask her to wait.
- Yes, sir.
It's Miss Woodland.
She wants to see young Nash.
You know, it's difficult to believe... that a decent young fellow like Nash would try to murder anyone.
- You've questioned him?
- Can't get a word.
Perhaps young lady can make him talk.
If anyone can.
- Dakin.
- Yes, sir.
- Send in Miss Woodland at once.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel, you know very well
Philip didn't try to kill Mr. Chan.
But, Diana, my dear, the facts are very clear.
- Mr. Andrews...
- I'm sorry, Miss Woodland.
You believe in him, don't you?
Situation for young man very bad.
But you said someone else used the window. You proved it.
Correction, please.
Only proved someone could have used.
Oh, I thought
I understood you, Mr. Chan.
I see I'm mistaken.
- May I see Philip?
- I needn't tell you, Diana... that Philip is in really a desperate predicament.
And a few words of explanation at this time would be of great help to him.
- Get him to talk.
- I'll try.
- Dakin.
- Yes, sir?
Have Nash sent into the anteroom at once.
- At once, sir.
- In here, Diana.
Thank you.
Now we'll hear what he has to say.
Five minutes, Miss Woodland.
Diana, you shouldn't have come here.
But I had to, Philip.
Haven't you anything you can say that will clear up this terrible misunderstanding?
There's nothing to be said.
What I've done I've done.
If I have to stay here, well, there's nothing I can do about it.
But surely there's something you can say.
Sorry, gentlemen.
I say, Nash!
I'll have the motor going in a second.
Get over there, all of you!
Stay where you are!
One moment.
Only foolish dog pursue flying bird.
The young upstart.
Dakin! Dakin!
Imagine a girl like Miss Woodland... trying to help a would-be murderer to escape from prison.
There's no question, Mr. Chan, he's the man we're looking for.
Innocent man does not run away.
Yes, sir.
What's happened?
Dakin, send out every available man.
Search the settlement.
The whole city if necessary.
Find him! Bring him back!
Mr. Nash, sir, has he escaped?
Has he escaped?
Of course he's escaped!
- What do you think?
- Yes, sir.
Lee.
Lee.
Hey, Pop, tell these mugs to lay off me, will ya?
We caught him as he was coming through the fire escape.
Please.
Clothes of disrupted beggar conceal dearly beloved son.
- Ah, phooey!
- Son.
Now wait a minute, before you bawl me out, Pop...
I was on my way back here when I saw the taxi driver that knocked me out.
- You follow?
- I'll say I did.
He went into a cheap joint on the waterfront... the Versailles Café.
- Did not notify police?
- Of course I didn't.
- I beat it back here to tell you.
- That is good.
Hello? Yes, sir.
It's Mr. Andrews.
Charlie Chan speaking.
Get over here just as quickly as you can.
I think we've cracked this case wide open.
Will make immediate haste.
What's the matter? Has something happened?
Can I go with you?
Only little time to talk.
Have important business for you.
- Must act quickly.
- Okay, Pop.
So sorry for delay.
- Caught in traffic.
- In the study, Mr. Chan.
Most happy to renew acquaintance.
Gentleman who make abduction.
Oh, so he's one of them, is he?
I caught him going through my papers.
- Now then, you're gonna talk. Where's Marloff?
- I don't know any Marloff.
- Come on! Where's Marloff?
- I don't know!
Well, we'll see about that.
- Now then, you gonna talk?
- Yeah, I'll talk. He's at the Versailles Café.
- You ever hear of that place?
- Can easily find.
53, reporting on secret assignment file 457 M.
Have a squad of men surround the Versailles Café.
Keep them in reserve until something breaks.
Right.
It'd be foolish for us to move in on that mob alone.
One man cannot move a mountain, you know.
But two men can start digging.
Keep your eye on that fella.
If he gives you any trouble, call the police.
- Quite right, sir.
- Are you ready?
As son Lee would say,
"Let's go."
Say, he'd like to knock my teeth out.
You'll have a chance to get even when they walk into that nice reception... at the Versailles Café.
Come on.
That Oriental girl certainly knows her stuff, doesn't she?
They're trained, these dancers, since childhood.
See what it says here in the guidebook?
Yeah. You read it.
Whiskey.
Well, if it ain't my old pal from Chan-king.
Come on, Bo.
We've got a lot to talk about.
Turn around.
All right, down those stairs.
- Where did you find him?
- Snoopin' around upstairs.
- You're Marloff, aren't you?
- Yes.
I'm in a jam.
The police are after me... and I've gotta get away from Shanghai.
Listen, Marloff, you've got a boat out there on the river. I wanna go on it, to America.
You know a lot, don't you?
I know you're in a spot if you don't get out of Shanghai tonight.
I can tell you every move Charlie Chan has planned. That oughta be worth something.
- Sure it ought to.
- Not here, you fool.
Do you want the crowd upstairs to find out what we're doing down here?
Listen, you spy.
That break of yours from jail was just a trick... arranged by your friend
Charlie Chan.
And we've just been waiting for you.
Sure, we'll take you to America.
- They're on their way now.
- Fine.
Now you go upstairs and let them see you.
And when they follow you down here, we'll be ready for them.
- Okay.
- Get that stuff below.
- What about this guy?
- We'll take him with us.
When we get out to sea, we'll drop him overboard.
- Gentlemen?
- Scotch. Yours?
- Sarsaparilla.
- What you say?
- Sarsaparilla.
- No catch you.
I'm afraid you'd better follow a bad example.
Scotch, two. Chop-chop.
You don't have to drink it, you know.
Bottle of whiskey and two glasses.
Taxi driver who assist in abduction.
Looks like we're too late,
Mr. Chan.
Careful. Remember you never drink anything stronger than tea.
Appearances sometimes deceiving.
Like a wolf in lamb's clothing.
Oh, so that's it.
Shipping it in wine cases.
Shipping place not far off.
River runs nearby.
Which means they've a way of getting to the water.
Very clever deduction.
Trapdoor.
Possibly leads to river.
Right again.
Got a flashlight?
Throw it down there.
We'll have a look.
See? Loaded boat at the dock.
Nobody around it.
Let's investigate.
All right, Mr. Chan, you go ahead with the light... and we'll signal my men from down below... and then we'll run the boat around to the government dock.
- Greatly admire efficiency of G-men.
- Yeah.
Insignificant offspring of searchlight... seems to have internal trouble.
Let me have it.
It's all right.
Motorboat.
Must be police you telephone for to surround the place.
Keep 'em down there.
Grab those guns.
Stand over there.
- Come on, come on. Get over there.
- Keep those hands up.
- Upstairs, boys, come on.
- You all right, Charlie?
A little late, Charlie, but we got here.
Sorry I couldn't have been of more help, Mr. Chan... but Marloff saw through our jailbreak scheme.
Thank you so much for able assistance already rendered.
Why, what's Forest doing here?
No one knows less about servants than the master.
Forest one of gang.
He made attempt on my life in your apartment... escape through window and appear to have just entered by door.
Well, I can believe that now.
Well, what about
Nash's fingerprints on the gun?
Marloff think young man know too much... because of position with Sir Stanley.
So use fake fingerprint on gun to create impression... he try to kill me.
Rubber stamp pad in fireplace at kidnap house... with the sample fingerprints on paper.
Very clever device.
Then Marloff was also responsible for the concealed gun... that killed Sir Stanley at the banquet.
And it was one of his gang who tried to get you at your hotel.
Very probable.
Mr. Chan, you deserve the thanks of the United States Government... for the help that you've been on this case.
Believe government owe you debt also.
Without able guidance, could never have located storehouse of opium.
We'll share that honor, Mr. Chan.
I'll be very happy to assist in taking charge of these men.
I'll remove them to the government dock in their own boat.
Certainly. I'd appreciate it.
Our police boat is very small.
- All right, take these men below.
- Uh, pardon, please.
- One more prisoner to be accounted for.
- Who's that?
Real head of dope smuggling ring.
Reach for ceiling.
Let's have our laugh later, after this business is finished.
- Come on. Get started.
- Put up your hands.
Take gun away from gentleman, please.
Hey, Pop, here's your wire photo of Andrews and a cable from Washington.
That man isn't Mr. Andrews.
Read cablegram, please.
"Andrews, Bureau of Investigation.
"Agent 53, assigned to opium smuggling detail in Shanghai...
"murdered in San Francisco three weeks ago.
Murderer not apprehended."
Corroboration of evidence most gratifying.
You pretend to be G-man.
Now turn out to be
N.G.-man.
Young Mr. Nash, when going through
Sir Stanley's private correspondence... from Department of Justice at Washington... discover that real Mr. Andrews did not smoke or drink.
When you come to reclaim... private letter of Sir Stanley to real Mr. Andrews... you make smart guess about secret writing.
But very foolish to accept scotch and cigarette.
Also foolish to fake telephone call for police.
Fortunately, humble self took precaution to notify same.
You very clever though.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Gave you plenty rope.
You make excellent noose for neck.
Now we go in boat to government dock.
Suggest you go to young lady.
Will find her waiting at home.
Charlie, you're all right.
Thank you so much.
Go home. Okay now for one female telephone call.
Thank you so much.
