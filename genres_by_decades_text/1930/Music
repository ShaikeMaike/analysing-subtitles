Thirty beautiful girls, the pick of New York City.
Guaranteed to send a shiver up and down the spine... of each and every boy from 18 to 80.
The gallant extravaganza...
- I don't like the looks of this place, Tod.
- Come on, you'll get a lot of laughs.
Step right up, folks. Step right up.
Step right up.
Thirty beautiful girls, the pick of New York.
- Where do they pick them from?
- Right off the streets.
Come, come.
You're talking of the ladies I love.
Hey, mister, can you spare a quarter today?
- Come on, I'll buy you a ticket. One more.
- Thanks.
I ain't had no entertainment for weeks.
There you are, Mr. Farnsworth, there you are.
- Has the striptease begun yet?
- No, not yet.
- Tod, what is a striptease?
- Oh, it's some more of that...
What?
Hey, young fella
Best to close your old umbrella
Have a glorious day
Throwing rubbers away
'Cause it ain't gonna rain no more
Hey, young fella
Put your raincoat in the cellar
While you're tying your tie
Take a peek at that sky
'Cause it ain't gonna rain no more
Look at that brave little rainbow
Fighting those clouds up above
I'm in the ring, Mr. Rainbow
With a horseshoe in my glove
Hey, young fella
Throw away your old umbrella
Give your trousers a hitch
'Cause we're gonna be rich
'Cause it ain't gonna rain no more
Hey, pipe the carriage trade.
Give him love
With a kiss
Hold him close to you
With love's caress
Lead him on to happiness
With a sigh
And the thrill
Close your drowsy eyes
Drift to paradise
Give him love
And you'll hold your man
Say, Janie... get a load of Park Avenue, will you?
Yeah, doing the slums in ermine.
I'll pull it for you, baby.
Encore, encore!
Wait a minute, beautiful.
Come on over to the station house, the Lieutenant is throwing a party.
- Can't I even get some clothes?
- No, he wants you just as you are.
Oh, it's that kind of a party.
- Yes, it's that kind of a party. Come on.
- Well, wait a minute. Don't get to...
All of you, sit down.
Hey, what's the big idea?
All right then! He should come.
Oh, goody, we're going on a buggy ride.
I won't even have to walk home.
All right, let's go.
Get in, Mr. Farnsworth. Get in.
Thank you so much for the lovely party.
- Where do we go from here?
- Night court.
Night court? Excuse me, I'll walk.
Order in the court!
You are charged with giving an indecent performance... at the International Burlesque house.
- Who's the arresting officer?
- I am, sir.
What did you see?
- Well, they were doing an indecent dance.
- What kind of a dance?
Well, it was something like this,
Your Honor.
These girls were doing a striptease.
A striptease. I see.
What is your name?
Rosette Henrietta LaRue.
Occupation: Hip swinging.
Now, Miss LaRue, just what constitutes a striptease?
A good constitution and a couple of zippers.
- Don't be ambiguous.
- I won't if you won't!
Sergeant... to what extent of exposure does the striptease go?
Hey, don't ask him, ask me.
I'll be delighted to show you.
- No, you won't!
- What's the matter? Why can't I show...
Order!
Next defendant.
The judge could give you 15 years for what you're thinking.
It'd be worth it.
- Name?
- Janie Barlow.
- Occupation?
- Social worker.
Why were you doing a striptease?
If you'd walked the streets looking for a job... and hadn't eaten for a week, you'd do a striptease, too.
Do you mean to tell me that in a city like this... burlesque dancing was the only work you could find?
It was the only dancing I could find.
- Did it have to be dancing?
- Yeah, it had to be dancing.
- Why?
- Because I'm a dancer.
Young woman, am I the defendant or are you?
I don't know who's the defendant, but I'm the victim... and you don't have to rub it in.
I don't see any girls hauled in here... for pushing pencils around on paper or massaging a typewriter.
I'm a dancer and I'll keep right on being one when I get out of here.
You'll get out of here when you pay a $30 fine.
You can't fine me, I haven't got a dime.
All right. $30 fine or 30 days in jail.
Right this way, please.
Recess, 15 minutes.
Let's go some place and get a drink.
I'm bored.
- Yes. Let's do that.
- Okay.
Take them over to the St. Regis Roof.
I'll join you later.
All right.
Come on. Come on, on your feet.
What's the matter now? Raising the ante?
No, dearie, somebody's paid your losses.
- What? You mean...
- You're bailed out.
Why'd you pay that $30 fine, Mr...
- Newton.
- Mr. Newton.
That's my business. Investments.
Sorry to tell you, but I'm the kind of investment that don't pay.
- Why, I could give you everything...
- Can it.
Say, what're you writing all the time?
I'll tell you later.
You sure drink a good dinner.
Now, why did you want to change the subject?
- What subject?
- You.
Don't you know you'll never get anywhere with those notions of yours?
Maybe I will.
I'm like that guy throwing quarters in the slot machine.
- I keep on trying.
- Listen, those machines are fixed.
It's 1,000 to 1 shot unless you know the combination.
And I'm the little fellow that knows the combination.
Little fellows like you have been trying to teach me all sorts of combinations... ever since I was a kid.
- But I only know one game.
- Dancing?
You said it.
Just the same, you're not playing that right, with stopovers in jail.
I'll get my break.
I'm your break, beautiful.
I'm a chance of a lifetime, Janie.
You better take me up.
Oh boy, I won!
I'll stick to them 1,000 to 1 shots.
Sometimes they win.
I must say you're a pal.
Leaving me to get home from jail on my own.
On your own? With that swell
Park Avenue juvenile bailing you out.
Why, you poor halfwit.
I sneaked off on purpose just to give you a break.
You didn't stop to think I might have to wrestle my way home, did you?
Oh, that's all right. Let him insult you.
Many a girl has cashed in on a good, hearty insult.
Oh, I nearly forgot. He gave me a note.
Hope he signed his right name.
A $50.
"Don't say 'them things.'
"Don't say 'can it.' Don't say 'guy.'
"Don't buy shoes with ribbons on them.
"Don't forget, what's a striptease on Second Avenue is art on Broadway.
"The $50 is to buy yourself a dress without a zipper."
"Don't say 'can it."'
"Don't say 'guy."'
"Don't say 'them things."'
Why, that Park Avenue know-it-all.
"Don't buy shoes with ribbons on them."
Fresh egg! And don't...
And don't get so noble with the groceries.
There's enough in this to eat for a month.
Oh, all right.
Now I owe him $80.
Oh, how can you pal around with me and still stay so dumb?
Say, what's the matter with them shoes?
These shoes.
Come on, baby, hit the hay.
The joint will be jammed tomorrow and after our pinch tonight... they'll expect us girls to pull that zipper twice as fast.
I'm not going back to the joint.
I'm through with burlesque. I'm going up.
Up town and on my own.
Listen, hon, I've been up there and I came down flat on my own.
Oh, can it.
Drop it.
Variety says Patch Gallagher is putting on a new show.
What kind of a guy is this Patch Gallagher, Rosie?
Compared to him an elephant's hide is tissue paper.
But he sure knows his stuff.
I'm going to see him in the morning.
Yeah?
And I'm having breakfast at the White House.
I'm going to work for Patch Gallagher.
You can dream better if you'll get to sleep.
I'm through dreaming.
I'm gonna start doing.
I'm going up where it's art.
Uptown.
I was never treated so disgracefully in my life.
Don't lose your temper now.
And you all can tell that Mr. Gallagher... that cotton will grow black before I come to see him again, sir.
Where we all come from gentlemen know how to speak to ladies.
- And you can tell him from me...
- Break it up.
You all go back to the Mason-Dixon line, sugar.
What a wise agent you are.
Gallagher ain't tough enough.
You had to make him tougher.
Oh, I told you that Southern accent would sound phony.
Now, wait a minute.
Listen, wait a minute, won't you?
Way up. Way up. Come on. That's it.
Now, back. Back, back.
All right, all right. Break it up, break it up.
Just a minute, Miss Warner.
All right, Harry.
- I met a Southern girl out there.
- Way from the South?
Now, don't tell me.
Don't tell me you're from the South.
And they want to build a statue of my father... but I wouldn't let them.
- Oh, stop. Come in.
- Yeah. That's true.
Don't tell me they want to make a statue of your father.
- Look.
- Hello.
What do you want?
I was wondering if y'all could tell me where I could find Mr. Gallagher?
What do you want Mr. Gallagher for?
Well, I'd kind of like to talk to him about that Southern part.
About the Southern part.
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
There he is over there.
Take a good look at him.
It's funny, but I'm a little nearsighted.
I'm afraid
I'll have to get a little closer to him.
Come on, come on. You're big-eyed enough to see that he's busy.
But I wouldn't take up any of his time.
The lady is leaving.
Look now,
I know if you'd let me get in there... that he'd let me do this part.
I know he would.
Did you read that sign on the door:
"No more girls wanted"?
Yes, I read it.
Will you read it again and get that mush out of your mouth?
How'd you like some of it in your eye, you big bruiser?
- Steve.
- Okay, boss.
I've decided to take Miss Warner for the part.
- Miss Warner?
- Yeah.
Oh, I see.
Congratulations, Miss Warner.
You all don't come from the South, do you?
No.
- Steve.
- Yeah, boss?
That's all today.
Regular rehearsal a week from Monday.
Break it up! Break it up!
That's all for today.
The regular rehearsals start a week from Monday.
- So, you took Warner, eh?
- Yeah. I know she's not so hot.
But with all the real talent gone to Hollywood... you gotta make the best of what you can get.
We'll be down to using midgets pretty soon.
Well, work on her.
Use the whip if you have to.
She's got to be loosened up by the time we open.
I'll offer her candy. Maybe she likes candy.
- Offer her anything but more money.
- Okay, Mr. Gallagher.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Slumming again?
- No, I joined the Uplifters Society.
- Who's the victim?
- You.
I looked for you down at the burlesque,
I couldn't find you.
- You going after art?
- Gallagher.
You're finding out the machines are fixed against your 1,000 to 1 shot?
- Lf you're running low on coins...
- No.
Don't pull that $50 gag again, please.
Aren't you ready to give up?
I've been chasing that guy, Gallagher around for days.
But I'm young yet.
Got a lot of time ahead of me.
Got a lot of sleep to catch up on, too.
- Goodnight, Mr. Newton.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Now, suppose I gave you a letter to Jasper Bradley... make it easy for you?
- Bradley?
- That's Gallagher's boss.
How about it?
What's there in it for you?
Now, this is no place to discuss that.
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- Can't you read?
I'm no gentleman.
Besides, I need pen and ink for that letter.
You'll find pen and ink in the parlor.
- Okay.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You haven't told me yet where you cut in.
If you want it that way,
I won't cut in at all.
- At least not for a while.
- No. I'll do it for art's sake.
Okay. I'll take it.
But remember,
I stay out of your private collection.
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Bradley.
- Good morning, Miss Allen.
- Good morning, Mr. Bradley.
- Good morning, Miss Allen.
- Good morning, Junior.
I mean, Mr. Bradley.
What do you think
I want to see you about?
How about un-belting with some more cash for this show?
You're not putting on a dog and monkey circus, you know.
Look at these costumes.
- See anything wrong with them?
- No. They're very pretty. Very nice.
Yes, they're pretty. They're nice.
I suppose you can see they're not of the same period.
The styles are only a hundred years apart.
What of it?
Nobody will know the difference.
Besides, they're the best we could rent.
So that's the gag. Rented.
You can afford to buy some, can't you?
Yes, I can, but there are taxes and advertising... and salaries for people like you and Junior.
It costs money to send Junior to Harvard to study the drama.
Well, you can write that off as a dead loss.
Oh, now, now, don't get excited over nothing.
If you don't care about your rep,
I care about mine.
And I'm not going to put on a charity bazaar for anybody! That's flat!
- Did I ever deny you anything?
- Never mind the salve.
- Do I get the costumes?
- All right, of course. Of course.
You didn't really mean to walk out on me just for a few costumes.
Rather than send beautiful girls out in those, I'd let them go on naked.
You know, Papa, that's a swell idea.
It's the same idea that got you kicked out of school.
Come on, girls. On the stage.
Junior!
Yes, Papa.
Come in.
- Mr. Bradley...
- Go away, I can't see anyone. I'm busy.
- But I have a...
- I told you to go away. Go away.
All right, but there's a letter here from Mr. Tod Newton.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
- Newton. Tod Newton.
- Tod Newton.
- Show the lady in. Show the lady in.
- Yes, sir.
This Tod Newton has a lot of money.
Maybe we'll get some good costumes after all.
My boy, you're learning the business.
Miss Barlow.
Miss Barlow. How do you do?
Why, this is wonderful.
Why didn't you come in before?
Well, your lady traffic cop out there had the signals against me.
Oh, that's a shame. I'm sorry.
- It won't happen again, I assure you.
- Thank you.
- Won't you sit down?
- Yes, thank you.
My son... I beg your pardon, you haven't met my son.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Bradley, Jr. Miss Barlow.
Hello.
Now, Miss Barlow, I think it would be best if you'd see Mr. Gallagher at once.
- Yes, thank you.
- Junior, will you escort Miss Barlow...
- down to Mr. Gallagher on the stage?
- Thank you.
- Mr. Gallagher is our director.
- Oh, I know.
And we're always looking for fresh talent.
- You can sing and dance, I suppose?
- Yes, sir.
- But, Papa, how about her rhythm?
- That's Gallagher's job, not yours.
Tell him a dear friend of mine sent Miss Barlow.
Thank you so much.
Now, Junior, be sure you take good care of our little friend.
Let out on your long line a little bit, will you?
When do you write your column, Ward?
You're always hanging around here or some other dump.
- Well, it gets written, doesn't it?
- I wouldn't know.
I don't get much time to read gossip.
Speaking of gossip, what's new?
You ought to know.
I suppose you got that story about one of our girls and the Ambassador?
No, no, what's that?
- Got a pencil around here?
- No, I haven't.
Well, never mind.
- When do you start rehearsals?
- Next Monday.
- Boy, I'd rather start boxing with Carnera.
- Here comes love!
- Hello, Ward.
- The rest of the name is King, my son.
That's all right. Call me Junior.
A very important friend of Papa's sent a girl around for you.
Papa wants you to take care of her.
She's outside.
I get it. One of those.
So Papa wants me to give her a tryout, huh?
- Steve. Steve!
- Yeah, boss. Yeah.
Steve, a very important friend of Papa's... has brought around a very important young lady for a very important tryout.
- Have you got any?
- Yes. I think we just have one left.
Steve will take care of her.
- The old brush off?
- Yeah, that's the way it goes.
These very important friends... who want to put their dames in the front row... so they can show their friends how well they can pick them.
Say, who is this very important friend of Papa's, anyhow?
You can just say a certain young man in the money... and you won't be very far wrong.
Fine, fine.
Oh, well, never mind.
Got your music?
Is that all I get, a piano?
The last audition I gave
I had a 40 piece orchestra.
All right, little lady, we'll dig up Paul Whiteman for you.
- That'll be swell.
- Wait a minute.
If you want a tryout, get your rehearsal clothes.
- I didn't bring any with me.
- The wardrobe lady will give them to you.
- Okay, boss. Okay.
- Hurry up.
Do you want Junior to help you?
No, thanks.
Junior has enough to do to dress himself.
Hey, you mugs! Come here.
Okay, boss.
- Listen, fellows.
- What's the matter?
- We're going to have an audition.
- A raw edition?
No, an audition! You heard me.
- See that girl that went upstairs?
- Yeah.
We're going to give her the brush off.
- The brush off?
- Yeah.
- Same instruments.
- No instruments, we're going to sing.
Oh, you'll never know
Just what you start
You start with me, I'll break...
- That was a B flat?
- Yeah.
- Sing it.
- Yeah.
What do you know about music?
You're talking to one of the best musicians in the country!
How are you in the city?
Oh, you
Boys, listen, I'm wrong.
We're not gonna sing it, we're gonna play it.
Get the instruments.
You heard me, didn't you?
- We could sing it.
- You know I'm the boss, don't you?
- Get organized now, come on.
- Okay.
- Get the chairs. Get organized.
- Okay.
- You ready? Right.
- Right.
- Right.
- Right.
- Right.
- Right.
Stop. Stop. Everything's all right, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to count off.
- One, two.
- Button your shoe.
- Three, four.
- Close the door.
- Five, six.
- Brush her off.
Hey, here she comes now.
All right, fellows.
Come on. Get organized.
Right. Right.
- What can we do for you?
- Well, what have you got?
- We got plenty.
- All right, let me have it.
I'll need a little more room, though.
You'll get it. All right, fellows, break it up.
Spread out!
That's it.
- Faster, please.
- Faster, the lady wants it faster.
Slower.
Slower. Give it to her slower.
Help the lady out.
Help the lady out, will you.
That's it.
- All right, a little step on now, fellows.
- Careful. Sit down, fellows, sit down.
Say, Curly, help the lady out, will you?
Okay, boys, I get it. It's the brush off, huh?
Okay.
All right, hold it a minute, will you?
Okay, bruiser, the first round's yours, but I'm not licked yet.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, will you?
Say, listen, Paderewski... do them funny noises come out of you or the piano?
Boss, come here, will you?
Boss, come here!
- What do you want?
- Boss, come here.
This girl's got plenty of talent.
Oh, Steve, don't be like that.
I'm busy, I haven't...
You got confidence in me, haven't you?
Look, come on with me, will you?
All right, all right, we've got nothing to lose. Come on.
Very, very clever. There she is.
Oh, you.
- Get her out of here.
- Wait a minute, boss.
- Steve, I haven't...
- Boss, she's got plenty of talent!
Listen to me, just watch her once, will you, please?
All right, let's see what you can do.
Steve, same instruments?
Get out of here. Take those chairs and get out of here. Get out of here.
This is on the level, now, play it, don't fake it!
Go ahead.
Say, Junior, you don't happen to know the name... of that important friend of Papa's, do you?
Sure, I know.
Got a pencil?
No.
- Well, don't you want to know his name?
- No, no, let it ride.
All right.
Report for rehearsal next Monday.
- Oh, Mr. Gallagher...
- And don't follow me anymore!
Yes, sir.
Steve, stick her in the front line with the Closser unit.
Yeah, boss.
You sure have got rhythm, baby.
Yeah, well, keep your hands off it.
What is this?
Can't you quit shadowing me now that you've got your job?
I'm not shadowing you now,
Mr. Gallagher...
I just wanted to thank you for the break.
All right, all right, thank me.
You may not think it's such a break when I get through working you.
Listen, I've been through the mill already.
Why, I've worked in cheap vaudeville, one night stands, honky-tonks, burlesque...
Well, what do you want?
To be made an Eagle Girl Scout for it?
I've been through the mill, too.
I've played honky-tonks.
But that isn't it.
It's just that you can't scare me away... from my first break by threatening to work me.
- You like to dance?
- Oh, I love it.
Well, it's good you do.
You may be a natural, you may be a flop.
You can't ever tell.
- Takes years and years of hard work.
- I'm not afraid of work.
- Takes guts and brains.
- Yeah, I know.
After you've given everything maybe something will come of it.
- Maybe nothing.
- Something's got to come of it.
- I suppose if you feel you got it, you got it.
- Yeah.
- You like to dance?
- More than anything in the world.
- You want to work with me?
- Yes, Mr. Gallagher.
- Shake.
- Yes, sir.
- Now, beat it!
- Thank you!
How about a little drink to our partnership, Mr. Newton?
All right.
Now remember, this is just a private deal between you and me.
My friends wouldn't understand an investment of this kind.
They don't want me contaminated by show people.
It's Q.T. With me. I won't tell a soul.
By the way, do these girls get paid during rehearsals?
Well, not as a rule.
But in Miss Barlow's case,
I think it could be arranged.
Fine, charge it to me.
But don't say anything about it to...
Or anybody.
- Well, here we are.
- Thanks.
Hey, look, would it be all right if I gave a little party... for the whole company tomorrow night?
Why the whole company, Mr. Newton?
Well, I've tried working it alone, doesn't seem to get very far.
I see. It might work better in a crowd, huh?
But don't expect Gallagher.
When he's directing a show, he never goes out.
That's okay.
This is one show I'll direct myself.
The more I'm with you, the more I can see
My love is yours alone
You came and captured a heart that was free
Now I've nothing I can call my own
Everything I have is yours
You're part of me
Everything I have is yours
My destiny
I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you
And the stars that shine
Everything that I possess, I offer you
That my dream of happiness come true
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours
My life
My all
Goody, goody, champagne.
You know, this is my first time to one of these doggy parties in years.
They're all right.
And at that, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Janie.
She made me stop hoofing and start cooking.
We got a little joint around the corner from Broadway.
Broadway isn't what it used to be in the old days, you know.
Churchill's, Reisenweber's, the old Madison Square Garden, all gone.
I heard of them.
Did you know New York when they was here?
No, I was working on the Kansas City Star in those days.
- Do you like gardenias?
- I love them.
I could take you in my yacht to Tahiti where they grow wild, millions of them.
- Hoping I'd go wild, too, huh?
- Might do you a world of good, Janie.
Tod, dance me toward the bedroom, will you?
I want to get my coat.
I'm going home.
Come on, let's dance.
You think you're a dancer, huh?
You'll never be an artist until you find out what life's about.
You ought to open up an art school for chorus girls.
Oh, excuse us.
There goes your great artist.
Is this the only way
I can get you in my arms?
- Janie?
- Yes, Tod?
Is it?
No.
We can always dance.
What are you doing with me, a striptease?
Tod!
Janie.
I must go home, Tod.
You sure about that?
Sure.
They were all at the party last night... just because you said they could stay in bed and rest up this morning.
- They were in bed all right.
- All right, Steve, I know all about it.
I can't play nursemaid to a hundred girls.
If they're tired for rehearsal this afternoon, that's their hard luck!
- I'll be up in the gym.
- Listen, boss, I want to ask you something.
What's the matter? Sore because you weren't asked to the party?
No, not exactly that, but tell me, why am I a social failure?
- Ask your best friend.
- Even he won't tell me!
Wait a minute, what is all this?
What are you doing up here?
Oh, it's you.
I might have known wherever there's anything private I'd find you around.
I just sneaked up to get a little workout.
What's the matter, the one at the party last night wasn't so good, huh?
If you're so interested in our private affairs... why don't you come and see?
I don't mix business with pleasure.
Well, it'd be a pleasure to me if you'd mind your own business.
Yeah? Say, listen.
It's my business to see that you gals keep your shapes, Duchess!
You mean, to see that we don't give them away.
Listen...
I don't give a rap about your private life, only as to how it affects me.
Then stop handing out sarcastic orders.
It doesn't affect you at all.
Say listen, did you ever take a look at a dame who's been out too many nights?
The customers out front just love it.
Will you stop beefing.
You're not on the stage now.
- Why don't you watch yourself?
- Why don't you...
Feel better?
Well, what do you know about that?
He can actually smile.
You look nice when you smile.
Why don't you try it a little more often?
Come on. Come on. Play ball.
Okay, you asked for it.
- Say, are you doing that on purpose?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Pretty ambitious, huh?
Getting up so early after a night out.
- A lot of sleep'd done you more good.
- I left early.
Yeah? Well, keep up the good work.
Maybe I'll give you a specialty number all for yourself.
- Gee, really?
- Save it. Save it.
You haven't got it yet.
- Shoulder feel all right now?
- It feels swell when you rub it.
Oh, no, you don't.
It was nice you could get away.
Yeah. Mr. Gallagher traded me the afternoon for working all night.
That was kind of him.
I nearly forgot. Got something for you.
- I only owe you $25 now.
- Are you still at it?
Until the last dime is paid, Shylock.
Tod, I'm scared.
Come on, now. Just be yourself.
And remember, don't bite or scratch no matter what happens.
Go on, now. Don't worry.
Gee, this is a swell... place.
- Who's that?
- That's one of the early Newtons.
He fought in the Revolution.
Looks like he started it.
You talking about those darned old Newtons again?
He blew the top of his head off with a duck gun.
You never heard of anything like that from my side of the family.
This is my grandmother on my mother's side. Mrs. Todhunter.
She's quite deaf, but she's the real thing.
- Nanny, this is Janie Barlow.
- What?
I'll have to write it for her.
So a Newton's brought a woman into this house finally.
This is Janie Barlow.
Nice girl, isn't she?
When's the wedding?
Oh, but you...
Now, there's no use answering her.
Looks like good, healthy stock.
You know, Tod,
I didn't think you had it in you.
You know, we Todhunters knew how to pick the women.
It was the Newtons who were always a bit finicky.
- All right, darling, all right.
- Well, they were.
You know, I know what I'm talking about.
- Tod!
- Hello, kid.
I thought I heard your car.
Janie Barlow, this is my sister, Grace.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- I'm so glad to know you.
- Thanks.
- And that's all the family there is.
- Tod!
Yes, Nanny.
Well, don't yell like that. I ain't so deaf.
You know you might have telephoned.
I could have prepared a little.
- All we want is a swim.
- Him?
- What him? Who?
- A swim.
Why didn't you say so?
I'll have Charles fix something down at the lake.
- You like it?
- Love it.
- Afraid?
- Of what?
The country.
- I'm used to it.
- How so?
I milked a cow once.
What kind of a cow was it, a Jersey or Guernsey?
I don't know. I didn't see the license plate.
Gee, this is a swell place.
You got everything in it.
All you need's a piano.
How'd you like to look for a house and furniture?
Let's talk sense.
We want to be friends.
We can't be unless you keep it on a sensible basis.
I'm suggesting a dandy basis.
Here, drink some of this.
Maybe it'll make you see things the way I do.
No, thanks.
Everything's beautiful just as it is.
- Come on in.
- I don't like to mix my drinks.
The water's nice.
All right, you take the exercise for both of us.
Come on in.
For a guy that's had as much practice as you, you're a pretty poor shot.
Is that so?
Mr. Newton.
This is so sudden.
I learned that in the Navy.
I'll have to get myself a diver's suit.
You'll never get one to fit you like the one you got on.
You know, you're too versatile to be working just on land.
Why don't you find yourself a nice mermaid?
I've tried mermaids.
They can't dance well enough.
And I dance and that's all.
It can't be very much fun for you... going around with a girl whose dancing is her career.
There are other careers besides dancing.
- Not for me.
- Marriage is a career.
- Marriage?
- Sure.
I'll buy a ring and a license if it'll make everything cozier.
I didn't know you meant that, Tod.
Neither did I. It just occurred to me down there in the water.
Sold?
No.
- I don't want to marry.
- You mean, you don't want to marry me.
I don't want to promise to marry anyone yet, Tod.
I've got a job to go through with first.
- Not very much of a job is it?
- I don't know. Might be.
Mr. Gallagher's promised me a chance at a specialty number.
And if I make good at that and the show's a big hit... it would mean everything to me.
And what if the show isn't a hit or if you don't make good?
Well, then I guess...
It's got to be a hit.
I'll never get such a chance again.
- My whole career depends on it.
- Your whole dancing career, you mean.
Well.
Janie, suppose this big job of yours turns out to be not so big as you think... would you marry me then?
We love each other enough, don't we?
I think so, Tod, but...
The only "but" is whether or not the show gets over.
If it does, you stick to show business.
If it doesn't, you stick to me.
For life.
Please say yes.
Please.
Hey, look what Ward King says in his column.
"It is rumored that one of the new girls in the forthcoming Bradley production...
"soon will go to the altar with a gay blade...
"from the social register section of our town."
What does she do, hypnotize them?
- What has that Barlow dame got?
- Eyes, that's all.
Can't do it with eyes, my dear.
Maybe she's got a book that tells about it.
I've tried everything but a blackjack.
I'm going to talk to Papa about you tonight. Anything I say goes.
Break it up. Get out of the nursery.
You, get in your overalls.
Say, do you realize to whom you're speaking?
I'm democratic, I speak to everybody.
- I'll speak to Papa about you.
- Go on, you big tom-boy.
All right, girls, on your feet.
Come on, everybody.
- The Duchess!
- Yeah, that's right.
- You know we got a rehearsal today?
- Have we?
Steve, this is my roommate, Rosie LaRue.
- Take good care of her, will you?
- She needs it.
- I'll be down in a minute, Rosie.
- Okay.
Say, I remember you.
The third girl from the left in the Florodora Sextette.
You want a wheelchair?
No, thanks.
I'll just take one of your crutches.
- Morning, Cyclone.
- The Duchess.
- All right, Steve.
- All right, boss.
Let's get going. Get the girls down for the Bavarian number, will you?
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Goodbye, handsome.
What, are you getting sentimental?
All right, girls, the Bavarian number!
Quiet! Girls, quiet!
Come on, girls, Mr. Gallagher's waiting.
- Why don't you knock?
- What for? You ain't got nothing to hide.
Come on, girls, everybody. Come on, now.
Come on, stop that kidding.
Stop that playing cards.
Come on. Come on, girls, everybody down.
Come on, the beer number.
Come on, girls.
What's the matter with you?
Stop that, will you?
Take this, will you?
Everything will be ready in a minute, Mr. Gallagher.
- All right, Steve.
- All right, girls, come on.
Come on. On your feet, everybody now.
Come on.
Jessie, take care of these girls, will you?
All right, come on, girls, the beer number.
Hello, Duchess.
Hello, Mr. G. How many nip-ups today?
I feel pretty light on my feet.
Yeah, how did you get that way?
The session in the speakeasies last night?
No. A nice, quiet evening in the open.
Trees and a lake and all that sort of thing.
- Out with the rich folks?
- Just one rich folk!
One's usually enough.
Do you think you could bring yourself down to do a little work now?
Let's go.
- Oh, democratic, too?
- Yeah!
If you'd told us where you were... we'd have brought the company out there to rehearse.
- Come on, Steve, let's have it.
- All right, Miss Warner, this is for you.
- Hey, give me a pickup.
- All right, come on, girls.
Hey, listen, boys...
- you're the authors of this show?
- Yeah.
- Do you like it?
- I think it's splendid.
- Certainly.
- It looks great.
Well, that's too bad.
Because it's going to be changed.
- You can't do that without our say-so.
- We've got our rights.
It's in our contract.
It's in my contract, that I don't have to put on a turkey!
What I say goes.
Mr. Gallagher, I might say I've been expecting something like this.
Now, don't irritate Pinky.
You know how he is.
Sure, sure. I know how he is.
I had a cousin like him once.
We had to shoot him.
What's wrong, Mr. Gallagher?
What's wrong? Tell us that.
You tell me what's right.
The whole thing's terrible.
It all has to be re-written.
You're crucifying me!
Now, don't get excited, Pinky.
He isn't worth it.
Don't go to pieces, Pinky.
Don't go to pieces!
Oh, come on, come on.
Get back on your nest.
Then just what is your idea, Mr. Patch?
My idea would be to write a whole new show.
- Oh! You're crucifying me.
- Now, listen!
This show as it stands is Spanish-American War stuff.
Country girl, city slicker, oatmeal, butterflies!
You can't get by with that sort of thing today!
You gotta give them something out of modern everyday life.
- Something out of the city streets.
- I'll kill myself.
Give them the slums, burlesque shows, riveting machines.
A girl who has to beat time to the city's rhythm.
A girl who craves to dance. Do you get it?
- How can Vivian Warner do that?
- Vivian Warner isn't going to do it!
- All right, break it up, break it up!
- Break it up, break it up!
- Barlow?
- Yes, sir.
In my office.
I've got a few things to say to you.
Yes, sir.
Steve.
Finish this and tell them all except Warner to be back here at 8.00 tonight.
- You don't want Warner?
- No, without Warner.
Listen, everybody, we'll run through this number once more... and that'll be all for this afternoon.
Mr. Bradley wants to see
Mr. Bradley, Jr. Right away.
It's very important.
Babe. If you see Junior, tell him Papa wants him.
Yes, sir. Papa wants you, Junior.
- I've been thinking things over.
- Yes, sir.
You're through with the unit.
Sorry I didn't make the grade,
Mr. Gallagher.
- I worked awfully hard...
- That's right.
That's why I'm taking you out of the unit.
- Why? Because I worked hard?
- No.
Because I want to put you on the top spot.
- The what?
- The top spot.
- Top spot?
- Yes, yes, yes, the top spot.
Where if you drop, you've got twice as far to fall.
Well, maybe I'm a sap for trying it... and maybe I can make something out of you... if you can stand up when I get through with you.
I've got good legs, Mr. Gallagher.
Yes, so I've noticed.
But don't let them run away with you.
I won't. I'm sticking right here.
Well, don't. Go on home.
Clear all this stuff out of your mind and be back here at 8:00 tonight.
Gee, I don't know what to say,
Mr. Gallagher.
- You don't know how much...
- Save it, save it.
Yes, sir.
Shake?
- And now, will you...
- Beat it. Yeah, I know. I'll beat it.
My dancing lady, there's nobody like you
You find such pleasure in doing what you do
A change in music and suddenly you start
That little syncopated beat in your heart
You look inspired
That's one of your great charms
And when you're tired start dancing in my arms
After a while, dear
These two happy feet will beat down the aisle, dear
My dancing lady to you
When I look at you in admiration
Wondering where I got the luck
Landing someone quite so grand
When so many folks get stuck
You're supply of everything that's needed
Just meets my demand
Pardon if I seem to gush
But I say without a blush
After a while, dear
These two happy feet will beat down the aisle, dear
My dancing lady, to you
All right, girls and boys, come on, now break it up. That's all.
All right, break it up, everybody.
Take a rest now.
- What's the matter, cramp?
- A little. It's all right, though.
- Routine on that number's not bad.
- Thanks.
- Needs a little cleaning up, though.
- You're telling me.
- Sure you're all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Don't want to quit?
- No, sir.
Do you feel like going through that opening number with Mr. Astaire?
All right.
- Freddy.
- Yes, Patch.
Show Miss Barlow the routine on that opening number, will you?
- I'd love to.
- Good evening, Mr. Astaire.
Miss Barlow. Do you know the routine?
- I've seen it often enough, I'll try.
- That's fine.
Harry, give us the pickup on that gang number, would you, please.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.
How does that Barlow get to take Warner's place?
Didn't you ever hear of personality?
- All right, girls, stand back, stand back!
- Help me take her in my office.
Boss, I'll carry her.
- I always wanted to be a hero.
- Steve, take her in my office.
Come on, girls, get back. Get back!
All right, Paley, go ahead with that number.
Come on, girls, now, snap into it.
Take her right in here.
- All right, get me the liniment, Jess.
- Yes, sir.
- It's over there, Jess.
- Come on, let's get the shoe off.
- Oh, take it easy.
- Yeah, all right. There you are.
Come on now, let's straighten it out.
- Come on, let go.
- I can't.
Yes, you can. Come on, let go.
That's it. Oh, that's better. That's fine.
- Give me the liniment, Jess.
- Yes, sir.
- You know, I had a charley horse once.
- It hurt, didn't it?
- Certainly it hurt.
- There, is that better?
- All right, boys...
- Yeah.
...get them back to rehearsal.
- Shall I take them, Steve?
- No, I'll take them.
- They got more confidence in me.
- Oh. Sorry.
Better keep it straight now. That's it.
Come on, keep it straight.
This is going to hurt a little.
Let it go easy now, right back.
That's it.
Wriggle your toe.
What kind of a gang are you running with?
What do you mean?
I see a lot of cracks in Ward King's column about you.
It's no fun sitting at home all the time.
No, I suppose not.
What are you going to do, marry into dough?
- I don't know.
- Well, don't do it.
Those guys are a lot of silk hats and silk socks with nothing between.
That's what all these dames fall for.
Don't let it fool you.
It never works out.
But...
Dancing is your racket, Duchess. I know it.
I'm not going to run out on you.
I'm not getting married.
Is that on the level?
Sure.
You mean that, Duchess?
Sure, I mean it.
I'm not going to quit on you after all you've done for me.
What do you take me for, anyway?
- You think you can make it now?
- Yes, sir.
Well, all right, on your feet, on your feet.
Sure you're all right?
Well, let's see you walk.
All right?
Well, what are you waiting for? Come on.
All right, Steve, come on.
Get them in their places for the Dancing Lady number.
All right, boss.
Come on, girls. You heel-beaters.
Come on now. Come on, get up.
- Come on, now.
- Everybody, now, everybody.
- Come on, girls, please.
- Come on, move fast.
All right, Harry, drop that puzzle.
Give me a pickup here.
All right, break it up, break it up!
Just a minute. Come here, everybody.
This concerns you so you may as well hear it now.
"Have decided to give up production for this season owing to ill health.
"Stop.
"Am on way to South of France. Stop.
"Dismiss company immediately. Stop.
- "Junior sends best."
- Stop.
Signed, Jasper Bradley.
So, Junior sends best, a charming fellow.
He can't mean that. He can't do that to us.
No? You don't know Jasper Bradley.
- Isn't there anything we can do?
- Sure, we can go home and forget about it.
I'm awful sorry, Mr. Gallagher.
Save it, Duchess, save it.
What seems to be the matter?
We just got word, they're closing the show.
Oh, that's too bad.
I guess I'd better get out of these.
I look kind of silly in them now.
I'll be down in a minute.
Well, that takes care of the 40-hour-week, all right.
My folks begged me not to become an actress.
Your folks needn't worry, you didn't.
You ready, Janie?
Yeah, I'm ready. And for what?
Well, it might be something pretty nice if you just relax a little.
I don't want to rush you into anything.
We'll talk about getting married when we get back from the cruise.
Cruise?
Where are we cruising, up and down Sixth Avenue?
No, Cuba. I thought a little sea air might do you good.
And Grandma thought so, too.
She's coming along to chaperone... or maybe you'll chaperone Grandma.
And you can bring anyone along you'd like to.
Rosette, if you want, in case I bore you.
Rosette would love Cuba or vice versa.
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.
- I want to see Patch.
- All right.
Come in. Come in.
Oh, it's you. I thought you'd gone.
I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciated everything... even though it didn't work out.
Oh, that's all right.
I've been in this racket for years.
If you don't get a good break, you get a bad one.
That's show business.
What are you going to do?
- Keep a promise.
- Marriage?
Maybe.
I get it.
Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye. Lots of luck.
- Thanks, I'll be seeing you.
Sure, sure.
We'll sit around the fire, whittle sticks... and talk about a girl who traded Broadway for Park Avenue.
You shouldn't have said that, Patch.
No, no, I shouldn't have said that.
I shouldn't have said anything to you but "beat it," the day you came in here.
Why did you say that to me, Patch?
I won't go this way.
I couldn't leave knowing the way you feel.
Oh, get out of here,
I told you to beat it, didn't I?
I can't go.
I don't want you to think
I'm letting you down.
Please.
Okay, Duchess.
Better luck with his show than you had with mine.
Thanks.
You ready?
Not a bad jill at that, boss.
- What?
- The girl.
Well, boss, looks like we're heading for the warehouse.
Yeah?
- Well, we're not.
- What do you mean?
Listen, Steve, Bradley can't do this to me.
I'm going to carry this show myself.
I'm gonna produce it.
I got some dough, and what I haven't got, I'll get.
I'll hock my car, my clothes, my house, everything.
That's great. And I got some money
I've been hoarding... against the next depression and you can have every dime of it!
- All right, drag it out. Get ahold of Warner.
- Okay, boss.
- Warner? How about that Barlow dame?
- Oh, let her go! She's gone Park Avenue.
Say, listen, Steve, from now on... this is one theater those guys get into only on a ticket.
Get those people back for rehearsal tomorrow morning as usual.
That's great, boss.
Girls, girls, don't go way. Girls!
Hey, Grandma, here's mud in your eye.
Pie? Who wants pie in a place like this?
Grandma, you're getting to be a cut-up.
Having fun?
That's a swell dance.
- It's a little bit uncivilized, though.
- Maybe that's why it's so beautiful.
It isn't loaded down by a lot of...
- Drop it.
- Okay.
- Where do we go from here?
- Tod, let's go home.
- New York?
- Yeah.
That's the rhythm of the day
- All right, break it up, break it up!
- Break it up, break it up!
- Warner.
- Yes, Mr. Gallagher.
I just wanted to make sure that you understood this is a dancing number.
- I was under the impression I was dancing.
- Yeah?
Well, that just shows how we can all get the wrong impression sometimes.
My mistake!
That's not your first mistake,
Mr. Gallagher.
- No. My first mistake was...
- Was what?
Oh, let it go, let it go.
Start at it again, Steve.
- Listen, boss.
- Steve, I'm not gonna stand for that!
- I'll quit, so help me, I'll quit!
- Miss Warner, he's a little tired.
You know the show can't get on without you.
You're an absolute sensation.
- Well, I'll give him just one more chance.
- Thanks. You're a brick.
Come on.
Say, I got a letter here from Junior Bradley.
And I guess it's down at the office.
Anyway, he said that before his old man blew out on the show... you were going to put the Barlow girl into Miss Warner's place.
Anything in that?
- Oh, what difference does it make now?
- Well, it don't make sense.
What don't make sense?
Well, he said...
Gosh, I wish I had that letter.
Well, anyway, he said that the reason his old man blew out on the show... was that Tod Newton paid him a lot of money to close it.
What?
- Say that again, I don't follow.
- Well, neither do I.
Now, look, the Barlow girl is Newton's sweetie.
So, why should he buy out a show and close it... and take her away to Cuba just as she's about to get a good break?
Doesn't make sense.
Yeah. It makes sense all right.
Well, I guess there's something about it
I don't understand.
You figure it out.
- Steve.
- Yeah, boss. Yeah.
Take over this rehearsal.
I'm going out and get a drink.
Oh, boss, I can't handle this.
You got a hippodrome here.
Do whatever you want to do with it.
I don't care.
Boss, listen, please.
We got a dress rehearsal coming up.
- We open in a week.
- A week?
- Lucky if we open at all.
- But, boss.
I see they're opening Dancing Lady cold tomorrow night.
- Maybe it's something hot.
- Maybe it's shortage of dough.
Champagne cocktails, six.
None for me, Tod. I'm not thirsty.
I get it.
When a lady says she isn't thirsty... she means all she can drink is champagne cocktails.
You ought to write a book about what women want.
Come on, it'll help your sea-legs.
I can still feel the motion of that boat.
That's what you call it.
Patch.
What? What?
Well, if it isn't the Duchess herself?
- Is that all you have to say to me?
- Oh, leave me alone.
Scotch, straight.
Patch, what's the matter with you?
- Me? Nothing's the matter with me.
- Hello, Gallagher.
Well, well, if it isn't the other half of the firm.
Back from Havana so soon?
Somebody close your show, too?
Are you trying to be funny, Patch?
Tod's not in the show business.
Another.
- He's not in the show-business, huh?
- Come on away, Janie. He's just a little...
I'm a little drunk.
Is that what you're trying to say?
Well, drunk or sober, my hat's still off to you.
There are more ways than one to close a show and you've taught me a new one.
- That's enough, Gallagher.
- Hey, wait a minute.
What's the matter? Afraid your boyfriend will get a poke in the jaw... for throwing a hundred people out of work... just so he could take you on a joyride to Cuba?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No? Not much.
You got paid for rehearsing.
Nobody else did.
- You didn't think Bradley gave you that?
- Shut up, Gallagher.
- Say, what is this?
- Oh, you don't savvy?
- No.
- Well, maybe I ought to speak Cuban.
But it's the same in any language.
I suppose you don't know that your boyfriend here... paid Bradley to close the show.
You can settle that with me, Gallagher.
Janie had nothing to do with it.
- Tod, did you?
- Oh, yes, Tod did.
And I'd like to take Tod over to the theater right now... and feed him to the boys and girls for breakfast.
- They need something to eat.
- Mr. Gallagher.
Well, the show opens tomorrow night and on my dough.
Mr. Gallagher, quiet, please!
All right, Joe. All right.
I'm not gonna tear up your joint.
But you better be careful who you let in here.
The place will be getting a bad name.
- Oh, Janie.
- Tod, did you do that?
Sure. It was the only way I could get you.
- You don't know what you've done.
- I loved a girl.
I wanted to marry her.
All I did was make sure I could marry her.
Yes, and incidentally threw a hundred other people out of work.
I didn't see it that way. I'm sorry.
It's a little late for that now, I'm afraid.
- Janie, l...
- I'll see you later, Tod.
Wait a minute. The boss is all steamed up, and this ain't no Turkish bath.
- Get out of my way.
- No, wait a second.
No auditions today.
You're in a new show now.
Listen, bruiser, I'm mad and I'm not fighting according to rules.
The boss is in enough trouble without you.
You see?
What is all this?
- Patch, I want to talk to you.
- What?
- You've got the wrong address, sister.
- You gotta listen to me.
I didn't know anything about that, honest I didn't.
Don't give me that.
Do you think I'd do that to you and the rest of them?
Would I do it to myself?
Patch, listen!
If you don't believe me about the others, you've got to believe me about myself.
I wouldn't sell out my one chance.
Oh, it's not only you, it's everything.
Even the creditors are wise.
Hanging around like a pack of hungry wolves.
But don't you see, if you could show them a hit...
You can't kid them.
I'll be lucky if they let the curtain go up.
They know a hit from a bust.
Oh, Patch, if it's going to be a bust, let me be there when it happens.
It's too late. We open tomorrow night.
But I know the routines.
Please let me go back in.
Forget about it, Duchess. It can't be done.
Life's too short.
So the great Patch Gallagher's laying down.
So, life's too short?
So the first opus he's got his own dough in is a flop!
Well, the wisies on Broadway will say it wasn't Gallagher, it was Bradley!
- What?
- Without Bradley, Gallagher's a washout!
- What was that Bradley crack?
- That's what they'll say.
They'll put you on the pan and keep you there till Bradley takes you off!
I've got a notion to...
If that's what it takes to get you on your feet, go ahead!
- What are you looking for, boss?
- I'm looking for that opening number.
- Here it is.
- Well, all right, put it on!
- How about that Warner dame?
- Put her back where she belongs.
Say, that place has been closed for years.
- Say you know those routines?
- Sure I do.
All right, get out of that back drop and let's see them.
- Right.
- Right.
- Let's go!
- Right away.

Everybody laughs their sides sick
While they yell for more
Beer! Beer! Beer!
Here's a place where skies are never gray

- Yes, sir.
- The customers seem to like it.
- Yeah? Well, we're not through yet.
- Come on, girls, everybody. Come on!
You're old-fashioned, you're passé
Rhythm 's in the air today
Come with me, leave the past
Life today is wild and fast
On your toes, everybody rise
On your toes, open up your eyes
This is the time for plenty of action
Action!
On your toes
Shout it to the skies!

Faster, faster, follow master

Even love has a beat

Keep at fever heat
Up, up, up
Hitting the skyline
Pulses beating, keep repeating
Go, go, go, that's the rhythm of the day
That's the rhythm of the day
Nice work, Gallagher, old boy. Great show.
- Certainly enjoyed it, Patch.
- It's all right with me though.
Think you've got a hit.
Well, you double-crossed me, Janie.
You're a success.
You were marvelous.
Believe now that dancing is my racket, Tod?
Well, I'll give in if you will, Janie.
Marry me.
You can still go on with this.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Tod, I love to say "can it" and I...
I love shoes with ribbons on them and I got a perfect passion for zippers.
Well, you can put zippers on your sables, if you like.
No. I'm afraid "them things" won't mix with "those things."
- Steve. Steve!
- Yes, boss.
- I was just talking to one of the girls.
- Yeah.
Steve...
tell Joe to dim down on that Dancing Lady number.
Dim down on Dancing Lady.
Yeah, but to follow Miss Barlow with an amber spot.
- An amber spot.
- Yeah.
Yeah, an amber spot.
And tomorrow night I'll try a rose spot.
I get it. Miss Barlow.
Top spot, amber spot, rose spot.
Come in, come in.
- Oh, you're busy. Excuse me.
- No, that's all right. Come in.
Oh, and Steve... during that dramatic bit tell them to follow Miss Barlow with a blue spot.
- A blue spot?
- Yeah.
- Blue.
- Good night.
- Good night, boss.
- Good night, Duchess.
Night, Steve.
White spot, amber spot, blue spot.
Looks like you're in a spot.
- Sure glad that first night's over.
- Yeah.
I saw your face once in the wings.
Made me feel as if everything I was doing was wrong.
I guess I got that kind of a face.
You better go home and get some rest.
And don't stay out too late with your boyfriend.
He's gone.
Yeah. Until tomorrow night.
He's gone for good, Patch.
Say, what is this you're dishing out?
Can't you take it?

I got to talk to you.
I got news.
I thought I told you not to come here when I was workin'.
Yeah, well, you ain't workin' here anymore.
Say, what's gotten through you?
Well, I got news.
Guess what I read in the paper?
I didn't know you could read.
Remember that old bird you met on the boardwalk in Atlantic city?
Who? His name was Wilson.
You know, he looked like an Airedale.
Oh, yeah. What about him?
Well, he's pushin' up the daisies.
You know, dead.
Dead. I could've told you that in Atlantic city.
Yeah. Well, take a look at that.
Somethin' has got to be done.
Can you imagine that old buzzard signin' off and leaving all that dough?
You know who he left all his money to?
Don't ask me riddles. Who?
Nobody. That means you.
Me?
Say, are you nuts as well as dumb?
It's the law. The law says if a guy meets a dame on the boardwalk in Atlantic city and introduces her around as his wife, she is his wife.
Yeah, and what kind of a law is that?
Common law.
That's what you was, his common-law wife.
Now the mug's dead, you're his widow and the heir to $77 million.
$77 million! Where is it?
Egg-yip. Egg-yip?
E-g-y-p-t, egg-yip.
Egypt, you dope, Egypt.
Ok, but let's grab the dough.
Let's hop a train and go to egg-yip tonight.
You lame brain, you can't go by train.
Egg-yip is across the ocean.
Well, there must be some way of getting over there!
Say, what do you think?
I've dug up professor Wilson's heir!
What? There is a son.
Where did you find him?
I followed the clue that Gerald
Lane, Wilson's assistant, gave us.
The boy is living on a barge in Brooklyn with an old stevedore and his 3 sons.
Stevedore? Yes.
He's been living with them ever since professor Wilson disappeared 23 years ago.
Did you see him? Not yet.
I'm on my way to break the news to him now.
Say, you wire Gerald Lane, and I'll have the boy sail Wednesday.
Right. I'll have Lane meet the boat at Gibraltar.
Good. Wait, bill.
You better take about
$2,000 for expense money to get young Wilson to Egypt.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
How do you do? How do you do?
Well, pardon me, does Edward Grant Wilson Jr.
Live around here?
Yes.
He lives on that barge.
Oh, thank you.
Eddie. Ok, Eddie.
Eddie, where are you?
Are you sure it's safe? It's ok.
All right, kids. Come on out.
It's all right.
Where is he? Where is he?
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Nora, who was that guy?
He asked for you, Eddie. For me?
Maybe somebody complained about your brothers beating you.
They ain't your real brothers, are they, Eddie?
No, Lenny.
They're his stepbrothers.
Yes, and every chance they get, they step on me.
Look at what Oscar gave me on account of bein' jealous.
Whoa!
Jealous? Yeah, jealous of Adolph for giving me this.
Boy, that's a beauty!
I even think Oscar's is bigger than Adolph's, don't you?
Yeah. Yeah.
No, Adolph's comes clear around to the elbow.
No!
Oscar's is bigger than Adolph's!
Take it easy, you bunch of tarzans.
My brothers are gonna get just what's coming to them.
I've got something right here in my pocket, and the next time those gorillas lay their hands on me, it'll be just too bad.
Eddie, you mustn't!
You got a gun? No.
Knife? No.
Well, what is it?
Tell us what it is.
Take a look at this.
Build up your muscles in 20 lessons.
Learn to croon for 10 cents extra.
Come on, let's fight!
Oh, you wanna fight?
Yeah!
You can't take it, huh?
I'll show you whether you can...
If you boys wanna play, go outside!
Come in!
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Well, what is it?
My name is William Slade.
Come on, get up.
Don't lay around like that.
Can't you see we got company?
Well, what do you want?
What's your business?
Why, I'm a lawyer.
A lawyer!
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. First off, it wasn't me or my sons.
We saw a cop get hit on the head.
We saw a crowd running, and we ran the other way.
And besides, we got an alibi.
Well, does a Mr. Edward Grant Wilson Jr.
Live here?
Sure he does! What about it?
Well, I'd like to have a talk with him.
Now wait a minute.
If he's in a jam, he's on his own.
Besides, he's not my son.
He's adopted.
Oh, we don't have nothing to do with him.
You see, pop, I told you to throw him out.
He's good for nothing.
Well, I... say the word, mister, and we'll kick his teeth out.
Well, gentlemen, what I came here to say is that.
Mr. Edward Grant Wilson Jr.
Has inherited considerable money.
You mean dough? Yes.
How much?
Oh, about $77 million.
$77 million?
$77 million?
$77 million?
Yes, $77 million.
Say, have you got it with you?
All right. Now listen, kids, we've got a lot of work to do today.
Are you all ready to tune up?
Yes!
Ok, toots.
Now, Lenny, don't you know that you're 2 bars behind all the other kids?
Ha, don't worry about me.
I can catch up with them any time I like.
Now cut out the kidding and let's go.
Gee, kids, look at that big ship.
It's got a rich cargo.
It ain't your ship and it's not mine.
Ah, but I've got a ship some place, and it's coming in some day.
And when it does...
♪ I'll have a golden castle grand and tall ♪
♪ With 18 butlers standing in the hall ♪
♪ And Walter Disney paintings on the wall ♪
♪ When my ship comes in ♪
♪ I'll leave the choice of autos up to you ♪
♪ And if you think a big Rolls-Royce will do ♪
♪ I think I'll play it safe and order 2 ♪
♪ When my ship comes in ♪
♪ I'll buy Barnum & Bailey ♪
♪ And move 'em right next door ♪
♪ They'll give
2 performances daily ♪
♪ For the kids who never saw a show before ♪
♪ In golden chairs we'll sip our tea for 2 ♪
♪ I'll have Paul whiteman there to play for you ♪
♪ I'll have bing Crosby singing boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo ♪
♪ When my ship comes in ♪
♪ I'll buy out every ice-cream factory ♪
♪ So all the kids can come and get in free ♪
♪ And I'll throw all the spinach in the sea ♪
♪ When my ship comes in ♪
♪ I'll buy up all the public schools in sight ♪
♪ And all day long I'll have them closed up tight ♪
♪ But they'll be used as picture shows at night ♪
♪ When my ship comes in ♪
♪ I'll have suits made to measure ♪
♪ In fact, I'll buy a store ♪
♪ And can you imagine the pleasure ♪
♪ Wearing shoes that no one ever wore before? ♪
♪ I'll phone to each department store and say ♪
♪ Call up your Santa claus and raise his pay ♪
♪ And tell him we'll have
Christmas every day ♪
♪ When my ship comes in ♪
Hey, Eddie!
Look, Eddie!
Come here! Come here!
Quick, Eddie, let's hide.
Eddie, wait! Eddie, come here!
Eddie, let us in.
Come on, Eddie.
Ah, Eddie, open the door!
Oh, Eddie! Ed...
What's this under here?
Hey, you, where's Eddie?
I don't know.
Leave him alone,
Herman, here I am.
Eddie.
I can explain everything.
Why, there's nothing to explain.
We want you to come home.
We missed you.
You did?
Come on, Eddie.
Why, sure we did.
Come on, Eddie.
Please, Oscar, don't hit me.
I only borrowed your shoes.
That's all right, Eddie.
Keep the shoes.
Keep 'em? Yeah!
And, Edward, I'm gonna give you my new overcoat, too.
You mean the one that's too big for you?
Oh, you'll grow into it, Eddie.
Sure, you're gonna be a big guy now.
Oh, get into this, will you, Eddie?
Oh, my.
Oh, boy, do you look good.
Eddie, you look like a million dollars.
And I'm gonna give you my blue serge pants, too.
Well, with this coat
I won't need any pants.
And I'm gonna give you my new hat.
Now you got a swell outfit.
Gee, it's an all-year-round outfit.
I can wear the coat in the winter and the hat in the summer.
Eddie, have a cigar.
Oh, but I don't smoke.
Take it. I like you.
I'll light it for you.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll light it.
Huh.
Hey, listen, you. I like Eddie, and I'm gonna light his cigar!
Say, what's the idea?
You think you're the only one that likes Eddie?
I guess you all like me.
Hey, you shut up.
We'll tell you who likes you!
Wait a minute!
You keep your paws off this kid, you understand?
Listen, lug, I'm gonna light Eddie's cigar.
Oh, you are, huh?
I'm sorry.
Are you gonna put that cigar back in Eddie's mouth?
It's all right, fellows,
I'll smoke it later.
Huh, maybe you'd like to put it back yourself.
Yeah, maybe I would.
Yeah. What are you doin' there?
I like Eddie best, and I'm gonna light his cigar.
Nothing doing, we'll all light it.
Yeah. Here you are, Eddie.
Where's your cigar?
You've got it.
No, he took it.
I didn't take it.
Oh, he wants to play.
Here he is! That's him.
Are you Edward Grant Wilson Jr.?
Yes, sir.
Congratulations, my boy.
You have just inherited $77 million.
Radiogram, sir.
Hmm?
Oh, thank you, boy.
If this is bad news, bartender,
I'll need a little touch of somethin' to fortify my spirits, so set me up another julep.
Let's hope it's good news, sir.
Huh, then I'll celebrate.
Eternal thunderation!
Joan! Joan!
Anything I can do, sir?
Y-y-yes. Give me whiskey, bartender.
Plain, straight whiskey.
Yes, sir.
Joan! Joan!
Joan!
Uh, steward, here.
Yes, sir!
What can I do for you, sir?
Find my niece and bring her here to me at once!
Yes, sir.
Are you having a little trouble?
I'm tryin' to take a picture of myself to send to my girl.
Well, I'll take it for you.
Would you? Of course.
Now, uh, you sit up there.
Up here? Mmm-hmm.
Ready now. Hold still.
Don't move.
I won't move.
Pardon, miss larrabee?
Yes? Your uncle wants to see you at once.
Oh, thank you.
It, uh, seems important.
Oh.
Did you want me, uncle Harry?
Read that.
Oh, how perfectly wonderful.
Wonderful? By gad, child, what's wonderful about it?
Why, about Jerry getting aboard at Gibraltar.
Young lady, the purpose of this trip is to lay claim to a treasure worth millions, not to help along your romance with that young whippersnapper.
But this radiogram says that the treasure belongs to someone else.
Our society financed professor
Wilson's expedition to the Sahara and I, as representative of that society, shall claim whatever's found.
Look, Louie, look.
Hey, be careful.
Keep off them maps.
What are you lookin' for?
Africa.
There it is, stupid.
It's green!
I always thought
Africa was black.
No wonder Columbus had such a tough time finding it.
$77 million. You know what
I'm gonna do with that dough?
I'm gonna get me yachts, swell cars, 40 suits of clothes, see Europe, go around...
Before you spend all the money, take a look at this.
Wilson, Edward Grant Jr.
What do you mean, "Jr."?
A son, the old bird had a son.
You mean, he had a baby?
I'll say it slow so you can soak it up.
Mr. Wilson is dead.
He left some dough.
He also left a son.
The son gets the dough, and we get the air.
You mean the son's come between us and the money we've worked for?
Exactly. Why,
I got half the dough spent already.
Well, it looks as if we just came for the boat ride.
Son or no son,
I'm gonna knock his ears off.
No junior is gonna horn in on our dough.
Where you goin'?
To give junior a music lesson!
Wait a minute. Wait, nothin'!
I'm gonna knock that chump off.
I'll fill junior so full of lead he'll drown if he takes a bath!
Great idea. You knock him off, jump in a taxi, and escape through the crowd.
Certainly. On a boat?
Oh, that's right. You can't get a taxi on a boat.
Relax. Sit down.
Rest your hands and face.
But I can't think unless I stand up.
That's fine. Sit down.
This calls for immediate action.
We got to do something.
I've an idea if we can get junior to sign his name on a piece of paper...
Come in.
Pardon me, is your name Eddie?
Yes, ma'am.
Eddie Wilson?
Yes, ma'am.
Eddie Wilson Jr.?
Yes, ma'am.
My boy, my boy, my little boy.
Don't you know me? No, ma'am.
I'm your mother.
My mother?
You mean you were married to my father?
Yes, darling.
Mama. Junior.
Kiss me, darling.
Now I know what killed father.
Sit down, mama.
I'm so happy to meet you, mother.
You're beautiful.
Yes, I know I am.
And you're so young, too.
How old are you?
I'm 19, son.
I'm 25.
You are? Yes.
Say, maybe I'm your mother.
Oh, there you go, joking just like your father.
You know, you're the perfect image of your dad:
Large, sad, brown eyes.
You talk like him and you act like him.
I'll bet you even write like him.
Could papa write?
Oh, yes, junior, and I'll bet you write exactly like him.
Junior, write something for mama.
All right, I'll get a pencil.
No, wait a minute. Here,
I have a fountain pen.
Then I'll get some paper.
Oh, never mind.
I have some paper, too.
What luck.
And here's a blotter, too, junior.
Mama, you don't happen to have a writing desk handy?
Oh, no, junior, mama can't think of everything.
Here, just use the table.
What will I write, mama?
Oh, just write your name, your full name, on this.
Uh-huh.
No, no, junior. Down at the bottom where it says signature.
Mama, what does it mean?
"Witness the hands and seals of the parties hereto."
Oh, pay no attention to it, Jr.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Now go on, sign your name for mama.
Oh, mama.
Oh.
I'd better clean that up.
Oh, never mind, junior,
I'll wash it later.
Oh, no. How would it look for a big boy like me to stand by and see his mother do the washing?
Oh, please, junior, first sign your name on the paper for mama.
What a mess.
I'll bet they'll charge me for the things.
Oh, pardon me, mama.
Oh, never mind, junior.
I'll answer the door.
Did he sign the...
Well, well, this is a pleasure.
Junior, I want you to meet your uncle Louie.
I'm glad to meet up with you, kid.
I heard your old man talk about you an awful lot.
You, my uncle Louie?
Yeah, your uncle Louie.
Now, junior, kiss your nice uncle Louie.
Oh, shucks! Couldn't we just shake hands?
Sure. That's enough.
Kiss him, darling.
Uncle Louie, you don't kiss like mama.
Oh, yeah?
Junior was just giving mother his autograph.
Oh, you mean in the corner where it says "signature"?
Yes, mama wants to see if I write like papa.
Now, listen, junior, make sure you put down the right name...
Come out in the hall, uncle Louie.
Mama wants to talk to you.
What for?
Don't go away, junior.
Mom will be right back.
Hey, did he sign the paper?
Yes.
And if you hadn't helped me,
I would've had it by now.
Where is it?
He's got it in his pocket.
Well, go on back and ask him for it.
I'm afraid he's liable to get wise.
Listen. You stay here and don't try to help me.
I'll get it somehow.
Now, junior.
Gee, mommy, isn't that uncle Louie a funny duck?
Oh, wait till you get to know him better.
He'll kill you.
You know, I don't remember him at all.
Of course you don't remember him.
You were just a itsy-bitsy baby.
Come on, darling, now sit down on mama's lap.
Come on, Sonny, come on.
You know, mommy,
I feel funny about this.
Junior, dear, where's the paper you signed for mama?
I have it right here in my pocket.
Well, then give it to mama.
No, no, mommy.
First tell me some more about daddy and you and me and uncle Louie.
Oh, well, Eddie, when you were a little baby, we used to have such good times together.
I used to play with your little toes:
"This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home."
Gee, I... I can't remember.
Of course you can't remember, you were just a little baby.
And you weren't even born yet.
I'm... I'm all mixed up.
Yes, junior, just like your father.
Oh, mommy, forget about the paper.
Tell me some more, momsy.
Oh, then we used to play another little game called,
"tickle me, tickle me more."
"Tickle me, tickle me more."
Well, what's that?
Well, it used to go like this, you used to tickle me, and then I used to tickle you just like this.
Now let me tickle you, mommy.
Oh, no, junior, you're not a baby anymore.
And remember when we used to play leapfrog?
"Leapfrog?"
Oh, I keep forgetting.
Let's be kids again.
You leap over me, junior, and I'll leap over you!
All right. Come on.
Yoo-hoo, mama, I'm first.
Come on. Come on, all right.
Ready? Junior, come on.
Now you, ma.
All right. Here we go.
Oh!
Mommy, you're playing "tickle me, tickle me more" again.
Mama!
Oh!
Oh, I beg your pardon!
Oh, hello. I want you to meet my mother.
Your mother?
Yes.
Well, somebody should tell your father.
Wait. Miss larrabee, wait a minute.
Oh, junior, you forgot to give mama the signature.
Oh, yes. Here.
Here, mama. Miss larrabee. Joan!
Darling. Joan.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Honey, it's been 2 long years.
2 years and 9 days.
And 4 hours.
And 10 minutes, if you want to be exact.
Now, as I was saying, there was general Grant.
This is general Lee, here.
And here was the ravine.
Levine?
I knew a levine in Jersey city.
These were the Virginia levines.
Oh.
Ravine. Ravine.
Well, sir, general Lee kept on advancing and advancing until he reached the river.
General Grant.
Kept falling back and falling back.
Yes, sir, it was a magnificent war.
Just a minute, colonel.
You got my general.
Are you insinuating that I would pilfer a measly little drink?
Why, sir, I could buy you and sell you.
Yeah? And I could buy you and keep you, too.
Only you'd have to have
$77 million to buy me.
Stranger, it may surprise you to know that I've got $77 million.
You're nuts!
Well, I just got to go to Egypt to pick it up.
You mean the Wilson fortune?
Exactly, sir.
Well, listen, sourpuss,
I'm the guy that's entitled to that, and I'm the guy that's gonna get it.
If you try to horn in on that dough,
I'll shove this down your throat.
Sir, you're nothing but a low-down, conniving rapscallion.
Say that again!
A low-down, conniving rapscallion.
Wait.
Hey, what's a rapscallion?
A scoundrel, sir.
Oh.
That's different.
Oh, colonel larrabee.
How are you, colonel?
Save that. Save that.
Now, I want you to tell this insolent upstart who I am.
Go on. Tell him that
I'm the head of the egyptological society of Virginia and the only rightful claimant to the fortune found by Edward Wilson.
But, colonel...
Now, go on, tell him.
But I can't tell him that.
Well, why?
Well, I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but you're not gonna get a penny.
And that's still too much.
Do you realize it was my society that financed professor Wilson?
If your society sent professor Wilson any money after the first month, he never received it.
See here, sir, are you accusin' me of stealing the professor's money?
That I'm an embezzler?
Yeah, and a crook, too.
Shut up!
Listen, buddy, I'm dotty Clark's manager, and she's Wilson's widow.
This is a lot of nonsense.
Wilson never had any widow...
Oh, so you're tryin' to horn in on the dough, too, huh?
Trying to Rob a poor little widow.
Why, you're nothing but a... a...
A... a... a thief. Thanks.
Now look here, smart guy...
Now wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Professor Wilson's last words were that he wanted his son to get the treasure.
And it's my duty to see that he gets it.
You mean to say that
I'm to be robbed, sir, of my lawful inheritance?
No matter what you think, colonel larrabee, you know that your claim is false.
As a matter of fact, neither of you have any claim, and you both know it.
Gee, I'm sorry I had to run away from you before.
Come on, we've got a lot to talk about.
I think you've done enough talking.
But, Joan, darling.
Hey, wait a second.
What is this all about?
I heard what you said about uncle Harry.
But, dear, you don't understand.
Your uncle's claim is false.
No, Jerry, you're wrong.
Uncle Harry sent the money to professor Wilson every month.
Well, I'm sorry, dear, but professor Wilson never received it.
Are you insinuating that my uncle stole the money?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
Oh, let's forget about it.
It's not important enough to argue about.
Well, then you go to uncle Harry, apologize, and say you were wrong.
No, dear, I can't do that.
All right, then.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I tell you, there ain't no justice!
What's the matter with you?
Oh, I got news.
I'm all mixed up.
As a matter of fact, I'm puzzled.
That's not news.
What's happened?
Remember you said there was only one guy standin' between us and that $77 million?
Well, you was wrong.
You mean he's a phony?
No, there is 2 guys.
Colonel larrabee, an old
Virginia appleknocker from some Egypt optical company.
What?
The captain will be claimin' it next.
Oh, but I got an idea.
Oh, quit your kidding.
No, wait, this'll floor you.
Something has got to be done.
Listen, just leave the old bird to me.
I'll handle him.
Yeah, you handled junior for 6 days and all we did was kiss him goodnight.
What do you want me to do?
Kiss larrabee, too?
No. This time we'll do it my way.
I'll knock them both off and it's done.
I'll take care of the old guy.
You just worry about junior.
Worry about him? Huh,
I'll feed him to the sharks.
I'll tie an anchor around his neck and throw him overboard.
Well, yoo-hoo, mama.
Hello, uncle Louie.
Hello, junior.
Come in, junior.
We were just talking about you.
Now, junior, kiss your uncle Louie.
Oh, I don't feel very well.
What's the trouble?
You look pale.
I don't know.
I ate so much fish, my stomach goes in and out with the tide.
You know what's the matter with you?
You're seasick.
I am? Sure.
Come on, let's go out and get some air.
Will I see you later, mama?
Well, uh, that's up to uncle Louie.
Uncle.
Look, you know what's making you seasick?
What?
Well, you see that thing bobbing up and down out there?
You mean the equator?
Well, that's the thing that's makin' you sick.
Now look. Shut your eyes.
You feel better already, don't you?
Yeah, but I can't walk around with my eyes shut.
Oh, I'll fix that.
Wait a minute, uncle.
I'm liable to fall down and get... and get hurt.
Will you let me take care of that?
Uncle Louie, are you taking me for a ride?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh, it's awful nice of you to do this for me, unkie.
What... what are you gonna do now, uncle Louie?
I don't know, but sit still.
I'll think of something.
Oh, uncle, I... I think
I'll take off my blindfold.
No. No. No. No.
Not now, not now.
Of all times, not now, junior.
How do you feel?
Well, I would feel better if you would push me some more.
Oh, you want to be, uh, pushed some more?
Yes, unkie.
Ok, junior.
Give me a big push.
Oh, you want a big push, huh?
Uh-huh. It's a pleasure.
Oh, uncle Louie,
I think I've had enough of this.
What'll we do now?
I don't know, junior.
As a matter of fact,
I'm puzzled.
Oh, I got what we'll do.
Uncle, I'll take your picture.
Huh? I'll take your picture.
No.
I'll take your picture first.
For mama? For mama.
All right.
Now back up a little bit.
Now go back a little bit further.
How is this?
That's perfect.
Only I'd go back about 5 more feet.
Is this better?
No. Further than that, junior, further.
Now just pull back a little itsy-bitsy more.
I think will do it.
How did you make out?
How did I make out?
When I set my mind on something, it's in the bag.
The $77 million is ours because little junior is now playing with the mermaids.
Uncle Louie!
Uncle Louie!
Oh, uncle Louie!
Did you get my picture before I moved?
I don't know.
From the way things look,
I can't tell whether you're lovesick or seasick.
Jerry, if it makes you happier, you can have any part of my money.
Take $10 million.
No, thanks.
All right, make it $15 million.
All right, take $20 million.
I'm not gonna argue all day.
But, Eddie, it's not a question of money.
No? No.
Mr. Lane, the lady wouldn't take the note.
May I keep the quarter?
Yeah, that's all right, son.
Thank you.
Oh, I see. It's a girl, huh?
Well, look, Jerry, if she makes you unhappy, she's not worth bothering about.
Forget her.
Yeah, but it's not as easy as that.
Oh, listen, some day the right girl will come along who'll appreciate you.
A girl like my toots.
Yeah, but, Eddie, maybe you're luckier than I am.
What do you mean? Wait a minute.
There's a girl on this boat you'll be crazy about.
I want you to meet her.
She's gonna sing in the ship's concert tomorrow night. And say!
They're looking for somebody to sing with her, a guy like you.
But I don't feel like singing.
Oh, but Jerry,
I promised her I'd find somebody.
Well, couldn't you find somebody else?
Oh, but, Jerry, I do want you to meet her.
She's wonderful.
She's got a nice round face and the biggest eyes and the whitest teeth.
And when she walks...
Oh, come on, will you?
Well, I've got just the fellow to sing with you.
Really?
This is my pal, Jerry Lane.
Jerry, this is Joan.
What is this?
Hate at first sight?
This isn't first sight.
You mean, you...
You know each other?
Yes.
Oh, so she's the girl you're all broken up about.
Don't be absurd.
And he's the fellow you're so heartsick about.
Certainly not.
I don't know which one of you is the better liar.
Well, I'll see you later.
Now, wait a minute.
You promised me you'd sing with her, didn't you?
Well... I won't sing with him.
Oh, but, Joan, you've got to sing with some fellow.
You don't wanna spoil the show, do you, now?
Well, ask him if he knows
head on my shoulder.
She says, do you know
head on her shoulder?
Tell her she knows very well
I know head on her shoulder.
He says to tell you that you know very well that he knows head on your shoulder.
Tell her to move over.
He says to tell you to move over.
All right. She says, all right.
Tell him I'll start here.
She says to tell you she'll start right here.
Right. He says right.
Ask him if he's ready.
She wants to know if you're ready.
Tell her I'm ready.
He says to tell you he's ready.
Ready.
Well, if you're both ready, there's nothing else for me to do so I'll scram.

Ladies and gentlemen, introducing our interlocutor,
Mr. Gerald Lane.
Presenting
Mrs. Edward Wilson, sr.
Mr. Edward Wilson, Jr.
Ladies and gentlemen, be seated.
Mr. Interlocutor, there's a little somethin' I wanna ask you.
All right, go ahead.
Do you know the difference between a horse and a girl?
Why, no.
You certainly must have some funny dates.
If you insult me just once more,
I'll have you taken right ashore.
Oh, you make up prose, don't you?
Prose?
Why, you don't even know the difference between prose and poetry.
Who don't? You don't.
Look, I'll show you.
If I said to you, "poor little
Annette, she fell in the water"
"and got all wet," that would be poetry. Uh-huh.
But if I said to you,
"poor little Annette, she fell in the water and got soaked," that would be prose. Do you see?
Oh, that's easy, I can do that.
You can? Well, of course, look.
"Poor little Annette fell down the well.
She got to the bottom and went straight to..." what do you want, prose or poetry?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Well, I've got to see about the baggage.
And a few other things.
All right, don't be long.
Remember me?
Joan, I'd like to speak to you for a minute.
There is nothing you can say that I'd care to hear.
Well, would you do me a favor?
Well, what is it?
Would you please tell your uncle for me that I love his niece very, very much?
I'll tell my uncle, but I don't think his niece will be interested.
We got just 24 hours, and then junior gets all the dough.
And you can get a skiff and row home.
But, brother, you'll be without me.
Now, listen, sweetheart,
I tell you I got it all fixed.
If I ever wanted a guy to live to a ripe old age,
I'd hire you to bump him off.
I'm promisin' you.
Junior won't be with us long.
What are you gonna do, outlive him?
No, this'll floor you.
See them mugs over there?
Well, I've got it all fixed with those boys to drag junior up an alley and cut him into little itsy-bitsy pieces.
Shh.
Oh, hello, mama.
Hello, junior.
Hello, uncle Louie.
Hello, junior.
We were just talkin' about you.
Yes, making plans for the day.
Don't forget to include me.
Oh, we won't forget.
Are we going places and do things?
Yes, junior.
You're going places, and uncle Louie is gonna do things.
Oh, but wait a minute.
I've got to go to this address first.
Jerry Lane wants to see me about the treasure or something.
Oh, well, wait a minute, junior.
Uncle Louie will take you.
He knows Egypt very well. Huh?
Egg-yip?
Like the palm of me hand.
Leave your things with mama, junior.
Uh, you won't need 'em.
Right, mama. Here's my tennis and here's... here's my music and I'll give uncle Louie the bird.
No. Give it to her. Here, mom.
Goodbye, mama. Goodbye, junior.
Come on, uncle Louie.
We're buddies now.
Ready. Ready. Ready.
Look, everybody.
I make big trick.
Put boy in basket, say few magic word.
Boy become dog.
Come on, junior, let's go.
No, uncle Louie, he's gonna make tricks.
I now put boy in basket.
I now change boy into dog.
Are you inside, boy?
Here I am.
Allah, abracadabra.
Presto!
Come on, let's go.
This guy's a fake.
Fake?
What you mean "fake"?
You heard me the first time!
I said "fake."
Perhaps the gentleman would like to get into the basket and see for himself?
Ah, you're screwy. Roll over.
Afraid, eh?
My uncle Louie afraid?
Go on, show him.
No! Why should I get in the basket?
I'm no tomato.
You see, he is afraid.
Come on, buddy, get in.
Show him you're not afraid.
Come on. Call his bluff.
Yeah, go on.
Come on, get in.
Go on. Show him you're not yellow.
Who's yellow?
Attaboy!
Ok. Give me the works.
Are you in there, uncle Louie?
Certainly!
Where do you think I am?
He's there. Ready.
Ready. Ready.
Sockococo. Abracadabra.
Presto!
Uncle Louie.
Uncle Louie.
My poor uncle Louie, don't you know me?
I'm junior. I'm your nephew.
I'm sorry I let you go in the basket.
Now you're a dog.
When I'm eating strawberry shortcake and ice cream, you'll be gnawing on a bone.
Uncle Louie!
Uncle Louie, wait!
Help! Help! A bear!
Help! Help!
Help! Help! A bear! A bear!
Help! Help! A bear! A bear!
Help! Help! A bear!
Do something! Do something!
Look out, lady, he'll bite you!
If he bites me,
I'll bite him back.
He wants the frankfurter.
Let him buy his own frankfurter.
Come on, uncle Louie, we'll have dinner together.
Oh, wait. Wait, wait.
I want to thank you for saving me from that big bear.
Big bear? He's a small dog.
Oh, you were wonderful!
You not only saved my life, but you saved my frankfurters, too.
Believe me, if I were emotional,
I'd kiss you again for what you've done.
But I'm not very affectionate, especially with strangers.
Do you see what I mean?
Say, maybe you don't like me.
You know,
I'm a daughter of a sheik.
A sheik's daughter? Yeah.
I thought there was something distinctive about you.
Oh, that must be from hanging around these camels.
So you're the daughter of a sheik?
Uh-huh.
Where can I get a hold of your father?
Oh, I don't know.
He's awfully ticklish.
Say, come here.
Do you wanna know somethin'?
I bet for saving my life, my father will make you stay at the palace.
What would I do at the palace?
We'd play games and...
What kind of games?
Hula-gula.
What's hula-gula?
Well, that's something like your American ping-pong,
And it's some fun, I'll say.
You hit a little ball, and it goes under the table.
Then you hit it again, and it goes under the table again, and then you pick it up.
Yeah, but where does the fun come in?
Under the table.
Say, don't hit me like that, even if you are the sheik's daughter.
You know, I'm not very strong.
No.
When I was born
I only weighed 4 pounds.
That's nothin'.
When I was born
I only weighed 8 ounces.
8 ounces? Yeah.
Did you live? Oh, sure.
You ought to see me now.
I wonder what the doctor said to your father when you were born.
Well, why bring that up?
That's just what I thought.
Well, stupid, I can see what happened to you, but what happened to junior?
Junior didn't get in the basket.
O sire, here is the treasure.
It is worth millions.
In all the desert there is no treasure to compare with this.
My ancestors fought, robbed, even killed to acquire it.
If necessary, I shall do the same to keep it.
Allah is just.
Yes, but Allah should have let me kill this professor Wilson.
This American dog who dared to ravage the tomb of my ancestors.
You may still have your revenge, o sheik.
I know.
Wilson's heir is coming here to claim the treasure.
And when that heir comes, it will mean death.
I have sworn it.
Death to the Wilson heir!
Oh, come on. Come on out, Eddie.
Don't be afraid.
This is my home.
How do you like it?
Where's 3rd base?
Fanya! Fanya!
Hello. Oh, father!
My daughter, my precious daughter.
You have saved the woman I love.
You mean, that?
Someday she shall be my wife.
If any man tries to take her away from me, he shall die.
And he'd be better off dead.
Here he is. This is my father.
How can I show my gratitude for your wonderful bravery?
What bravery? It was nothing.
Nothing?
Father, it was terrible.
A tiger got loose at the marketplace.
It was 6 feet long and weighed 1000 pounds.
It was a small dog.
He leaped at my throat and was getting ready to mangle me when, like a shot out of a Cannon
Eddie appeared and killed him, till he was dead.
It was a small dog.
My son, you've been through a terrible ordeal.
It's funny, I don't feel the least bit tired. Look.
It will be an honor to break bread with you tonight.
All right, we break bread.
But wait, wait!
What, more?
Yeah. Yeah.
Right after he shot the leopard, a ferocious lion came running towards me.
I never saw such a lion.
I never heard such lyin'.
He was the largest beast I ever saw.
It was a small dog.
Tell us, daughter, what happened then?
Yes, what did happen?
Yeah, tell us. What happened?
Yeah. Yeah.
Go on, tell 'em what happened to the lion. Who, me?
Yeah, you. Tell 'em what happened.
Listen.
You brought him in, now you get him out.
I think it was a small dog.
What?
That's right. It was a small dog that attracted the lion's attention.
And when the lion turned around, he bit him. Uhm.
The dog bit the lion? No!
The lion bit the dog?
No!
No, I, uh, I bit the lion.
Yeah.
Some lyin'.
What a man! What a man!
Yeah, I'll say.
Array him in fine clothes.
Bring him rich gifts.
We must keep him here as our guest.
Yeah, my hero!
Go away,
I can't talk to an idiot.
Come here, I can.
Good. Say, that's a nice little show you got here.
I wish we had seats down front.
That is not a show, Eddie, bey.
These are my wives.
All of 'em?
Certainly.
I have not so many now, a mere 125.
Just an armful.
Oh, but once I had over 200.
I know, everybody cut down during the depression.
Are they on the night shift?
No, they are late.
And that redhead there is always late.
Oh, those redheads.
I traded a very fine camel for her, too.
I certainly got cheated.
You mean, you prefer a camel to a...
Oh, Eddie, bey, she won't even kiss me.
Did the camel kiss you?
Of course not.
What are you complaining about?
Oh, thou speakest wisdom, sahib.
Tell me, do all the sheiks have as many wives as you?
No, my brother has only 30.
Only 30? Practically a bachelor.
Say, I bet when you guys get divorced, you must spend a lot for alimony.
Allah? Allah-mony?
No. No. No.
Alimony.
What is "alimony"?
Well, in America, when you get rid of a wife, you've still got to keep on paying her money.
Oh, but isn't that like buying oats for a dead horse?
Thou speakest a hunk of wisdom yourself, sheikie.
What are you cooking here, a beef stew?
Oh, no, this is my pipe.
Here, try it.
Gee, I never smoked a double-boiler before.
Oh, it is very simple.
See.
Now I'll try it.
Oh.
Why, you! I...
Gee, you ought to get a plumber.
Your pipe is leaking.
What? Why you...
He's got some crust, some nerve, believe me.
Who's got some nerve, some crust?
Ben hamud got fresh with me.
He did?
Yeah, he asked me for a kiss.
Did you slap his face?
Certainly, as soon as he got through.
Will you do me a favor? What?
Will you go away and leave your father and me alone together?
No, I won't go until you give me somethin'.
All right. Here.
Oh!
Lollipop. Wait a minute. Wait.
You take off the paper and eat it.
What?
Take off the paper and eat it.
Ah.
Now look, look!
Oh, sheik, I'm sorry.
Look what you've done to my beard.
And I was all dressed for my rendezvous.
You mean, you have a date for tonight?
Shh.
Keep this under your turban.
I am going to the village.
There is a famous dancer there.
Mmm-hmm.
And you're one of her fans?

You look after my wives. Yeah.
I can trust you, can't I?
Oh, sheikie, you don't have to worry about me.
I've got a little girl in Brooklyn.
Oh, pretty.
Mmm.
I like her.
I will trade you a horse for her.
A horse?
How would it look, me sitting in the movies holding hands with a horse? Oh.
Sheikie, remember you're not a kid anymore.
Not too much dancing.
O Eddie, bey.
Not a word to my wives.
I'll tell your wives you went to the pool room.
Imagine that guy, Nora, thinking I'd ever look at another girl.
I'll be true to you, toots, no matter what happens.

Sire! I have news.
An heir has come to claim the Wilson treasure.
Allah is good.
At last, my ancestors can be avenged.
He shall die!
Welcome to my palace, o my brothers.
Sorry to bust in on you kids.
Your honor, this little gal is the widow of Edward Wilson.
What?
And as the mouthpiece for this poor, defenseless little wren,
I come to you to grab the dough because all the boys said that you was a straight shooter.
Do I understand, sahib, that this little lady is the only surviving relative of the... the old gentleman who discovered the treasure?
Brother, you said it.
All the rest is phonies.
Then she is the one
I have been waiting for.
Hold everything. I'm coming.
What is this?
Your honor, it is my pleasure, it is my privilege, it is my duty...
Yeah, but it's my dough.
My friends.
I am most eager to discover the real heir to the treasure.
And when I do...
What is this, a parade?
On behalf of the rightful owner,
I am here to claim the treasure found in the tomb by professor
Edward Grant Wilson.
Edward Grant Wilson!
You dare mention the name of that infidel in my presence?
On the memory of my ancestors, I have sworn it.
Death, death to the heir of Edward Grant Wilson.
Wait a minute.
You mean, whoever tries to claim the treasure is gonna get knocked off?
He shall die.
He shall be boiled alive in castor oil.
Personally speaking, sir,
I have said from the very first, there ain't a court in the world that would uphold the measly little old claim I got.
Are you the heir?
Me, the heir?
Why, sir, I have to laugh.
Are you?
Who, me? No.
You lie. You all lie.
Now speak, in the name of Allah, who is the heir of Edward Grant Wilson?
Somebody paging me? Coming.
Somebody here called for Edward Wilson?
Jerry! And Joan!
Mommy! Hello, Sonny boy.
Just a minute, o Eddie, bey.
Is your name Eddie Wilson?
Sure, that's me.
Didn't you know?
I'm the son of professor Wilson.
What?
Your highness, don't believe him.
He's not the son and he's not the heir of professor Wilson.
Jerry,
I'm not the heir?
No, you're not.
Tell him you're not.
No. I won't. I won't.
Mama, you tell him who I am.
Junior, mama doesn't remember who you are.
But, mama, Mr. Lane says that papa wasn't my daddy.
But, junior, mama doesn't remember daddy's name.
Maybe it wasn't Wilson.
You see, you're mistaken.
Of course you are.
And I thought you two were my friends.
He's crazy, please believe me.
He's not Eddie Wilson.
Why, the boy is out of his mind, y our honor.
He didn't even know professor Wilson.
Silence!
You couldn't prove you're his son, could you, Eddie, bey?
You think not?
Every Wilson for generations had a mole on his right elbow.
Take a look at this.
Wrong elbow.
Here you are. Here's my mole.
Who stole my mole?
Here you are. Look at that.
It means nothing.
A lot of people have moles.
Of course they have.
It's just an accident.
Yes. Well, here's one accident you can't laugh off.
Look at my birth certificate.
Now, give me the treasure, and I want everything that's coming to me.
Well, son, they can't say you didn't ask for it.
I'm sorry, o Eddie, bey.
I hate to lose you.
Oh, that's all right, you'll get used to it.
You know what they say, here today, gone tomorrow.
Then you'll die like a man?
Die?
Yes, I must kill you.
But... but I thought you liked me.
I do, o Eddie, bey.
I'm very fond of you.
But you don't have to kill me to prove it.
An oath has been taken.
But I didn't take it. Search me.
I swore to my ancestors that I would kill the heir of Edward Grant Wilson.
But I'm too young to die.
Nonsense. There is no way out.
What about that door? No!
Wait a minute.
You can't do this.
He's an American citizen, and I demand his release.
Silence! Take him away and imprison the others.
Mama! I want my mama!
I want my mama!
You can't do this.
I warn you, sir.
The state of Virginia will never stand for this.
Silence!
Keep them locked up here.
I will dispose of them later.
Well, what shall we do with the women, sire?
Oh.
I will marry them. Yes, sire.
Strip him.
What's this?
This is the way
I came into the world, and this is the way
I'm going out.
Prepare him for the oil!
Sire, he'll make fine soup for your camels.
Me? Camel soup?
I'm sorry, Eddie, bey.
It's an ancient custom.
Make haste.
Some salt.
Make it smelling salt.
Now some pepper.
What, no mustard?
Gesundheit!
Where are you going?
I'm going out to buy some vegetables.
I am the chef.
Sure, you're the chef, but I'm the soup.
Are you ready?
Ready or not, you're sure to be caught.
Goodbye, Eddie, bey.
This is going to upset me more than you know.
Take him up!
Oh!
♪ He floats through the air with the greatest of ease ♪
♪ The first sheik I've seen on a flying trapeze ♪
Don't bother about him.
Help me! Help me!
Silence! Now you die!
Stop!
Father, you can't kill him.
No? No.
Why not?
What?
He kissed you on a camel?
O Eddie, bey, you have placed me in a very embarrassing position.
Look at the position you got me in.
Silence.
Do you realize that according to our tribal laws, you have committed tramafatz?
Tramafatz!
Tramafatz!
In our country, when a man commits tramafatz, there is only one thing possible.
Marriage.
Yes.
You must marry her.
That settles it.
Boys, drop me in.
No! Take him down.
Eddie, bey.
Amscray.
Well, you finally got someone to marry you, even though it's through tramafatz.
Listen, I'll have you know that
I've been asked 1000 times to get married.
Yeah? Yeah.
Who asked you? My father.
Take the dog away.
Take her away.
No, you! Me?
Prepare him for the wedding.
Bathe him, shave him, spray him with lilac water from head to foot and spread the news throughout the desert.
Tomorrow at high noon, a shotgun wedding.
I can hardly wait.
Are you alone? No.
You are not alone?
No. You're here.
So you're gonna marry fanya?
Do you know what a wedding means?
Sure. A wedding is a funeral where you smell your own flowers.
Your sense of smell will be cut off.
You mean, I'm going to lose my schnozzle?
You are going to lose your life now!
Please, not with a knife!
Why not?
It makes such an awful mess with blood and everything.
Besides, it's so foreign.
We Americans, we're used to being killed by a gun.
Now, if you wanted to shoot me with a gun, I wouldn't mind, see, ha.
But you have no gun. But I have!
Some surprise, isn't it?
Not only am I going to shoot you, but so there will be no sin on my head, you yourself will give the command to fire.
You mean I'm gonna say...
Oh! I almost said it.
Don't worry,
I'll make you say "fire."
No, you won't. Yes, I will.
What comes out of a stove?
Fi-fi... flames.
Yes, but what makes the flames?
Fi-fi... fuel.
You thought I was going to say "fire."
Come out and die like a man, you dog!
Oh, please, Mr. Ben Ali.
I don't wanna marry fanya, believe me.
I've got a girl in Brooklyn.
I love her and I wanna get back to her.
Do you mean that?
So help me, Allah.
And if I should help you to get away, you swear you'll never try to see fanya again?
Oh, my, yes, yes, yes.
I promise on bended elbows, yes.
Good, then come with me.
I forgot that.
Don't forget my dog biscuits.
Come!
Hey, where do you think it leads?
Maybe it leads to the wine cellar.
What difference does it make?
It couldn't be any worse than this place.
Oh, that's what you think.
I spent 3 months diggin' my way out of prison once and come up in the warden's office.
What are you gonna do?
What is this?
This is the chamber of the dead.
Chamber of the dead?
Yes.
And these mummies?
Dead.
All died standing up, huh?
Get into an empty casket and wait.
Later I'll come for you.
Empty casket? Me?
Do as you're told.
Don't forget to come for me.
Dead.
The treasure.
O spirit of the dead, the hour of vengeance is at hand.
I swore by all that is holy to kill Eddie, bey.
But in my heart there is great love for him.
O spirit of my ancestors, if you could only speak and advise me.
What?
Do I hear a voice?
Who is talking to me?
I'm the spirit of your ancestor.
My ancestor. Allah, in heaven.
Which one?
Your uncle Benny.
Oh, yes, Ben hammad.
Your voice sounds so young.
Ben hammad died when he was 76.
Are you his spirit?
Yes. I'm the spirit of '76.
O spirit of my ancestor, art thou in pain?
Thou, too, wouldst be in pain if the spirit of the royal crab was crawling around your shroud.
You will rest more easily, o worthy ancestor, after thy honor has been avenged.
And these 3 other Americans have been sacrificed.
What Americans?
The old gentleman from the south.
I beg your pardon, sir.
In behalf of the gentleman from the south,
I would just like to say that all we mummies think he is a mighty fine fellow, too.
Us mummies was in a huddle.
And we all agree that
Louie is a sweetheart, too.
And the 2 girls, o mightiest of mighty sheiks, what about them?
I was going to marry them.
How dare you do that?
I'll report you to the United States consul.
If all you mummies don't pipe down, we're liable to wind up in the soup.
O spirit, speak.
What sacrifice can I make to appease thee?
There is only one way for us mummies to rest in happiness.
Let the Americans go.
Yes.
"Let my people go."
Oh, lordy, "let my people go."
♪ Oh, lordy, let my people go ♪
♪ Let my people go ♪
♪ Oppressed so hard they could not stand ♪
♪ Let my people go ♪
I heard strange voices.
Are you in trouble, sire?
The spirits of my ancestors have spoken.
Now they sing.
Allah be praised!
And what of my people?
Your people shall be freed.
You have said a beard-full, big boy.
Sire, 'tis this mummy here who speaketh.
Allah be praised.
Take it, carry it to my throne room set it up in state where all may see and wonder.
Phew.
Be careful, boys.
Take it easy. Easy.
I'm not really dead.
Wait. You wait.
What do you want?
You are to come with me.
Where are you takin' us?
Out of the palace.
Sheik mulhulla has ordered you Americans to be released.
Come.
It's a lie.
Come with me.
Ben Ali wants to see you.
But I don't wanna marry fanya.
Come!
Come on, you are leaving with the other Americans!
Wait, wait. Where are we going?
Do you see that plane? Yes.
That's our only means of escape.
You mean, we're going in that?
No, you're going in it.
Me? I've never been in a plane in my life.
Remember, if you stay here to marry fanya, you die.
Yes, but if I go in the plane I'll die.
Fanya or the airplane?
Give my regards to fanya.
Get in!
But listen!
Get in!

I'm going to take the elevator.
- What floor is Ezra Ounce on?
- Why, the Ezra Ounce floor.
Take this elevator to the 25th floor then take the special tower elevator.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
I beg pardon, which is the tower elevator?
- Did you wish to see Mr. Ezra Ounce?
- Yes, sir.
Have you an appointment?
- Yes, sir.
- Have you any identification?
Ezra Ounce is my wife's cousin.
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.
- Send him up.
- Send him up.
- That way, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Pistol?
- Kidnappers.
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.
- Send him in.
- Take him in.
Electricity.
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway of New York City has an appointment to see Mr. Ounce.
Cousin Ezra, that is, Mr. Ounce, sent for me to come from New York.
You are three and one-half minutes early.
This is the first time that Cousin Ezra...
...Mr. Ounce has sent for me in 20 years.
March 8, 1912, you had an appointment at 10:23 a.m.
You stayed four minutes.
Yes. He had heard that I'd had a baby.
That is, my wife, Mathilda, had it.
He wanted to add it to the family tree.
Girl. Name: Barbara.
Weight: Five pounds.
Complexion: Undetermined. Hair: Bald.
Yes. Barbara took after me at first.
She was born bald.
She's got hair now.
- Fortunate.
- She's 22 now.
Twenty-two years, two months, three days is correct.
Cousin Ezra wasn't very happy about her being a girl.
Mr. Ounce does not approve of females.
I'm, that is, we're sorry we couldn't have given him a boy.
It is time for your appointment.
Mr. Ounce is very particular as to punctuality. Mr. Ounce is waiting.
Oh, thank you.
Electricity.
You told me the tire would run 10,000 miles.
Now, what happened? It blew out.
I don't want a new tire.
I want my $ 18.75. If I don't get it back,
I'm gonna sue you.
Cousin Ezra, it's been 20 years since...
He told me the tire would run 10,000 miles.
What happened? It only ran 9998 miles.
It's dishonest. False representation, that's what it is.
I don't want a new tire. Sounds eccentric but I can afford to be.
I've got $35 million.
You haven't got $35 million.
You can't afford to be eccentric.
- What are you shaking your head for?
- I can't afford to be eccentric.
- That's what I said.
- That's what I mean.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Mathilda and Barbara send their love to you.
- Barbara sends her love to me?
- Yes, Ezra.
Why should she send her love to me?
She's never seen me.
Well, she's seen your picture.
She's sending her love to my picture.
No, no, you see. We've told her, that is, she knows all about you.
Sit down.
I've prepared a questionnaire. And if you answer the questions to my satisfaction...
- Yes, Ezra?
...to my entire satisfaction...
...I may have an important decision to announce.
Hemingway questionnaire.
Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Are you a moral man, Mr. Hemingway?
Well, I like to think so.
- Well, don't you know?
- Oh, yes, yes, I'm a moral man.
- Have you ever touched liquor or nicotine?
- Never.
Have you ever purposely sinned?
No, not much, on purpose.
Have you ever dawdled with the idea of sinning?
Now, Ezra, you know I never dawdle.
- Answer me, yes or no.
- No.
- Yes, Mr. Ounce?
- Listen carefully, Horace...
...and you'll understand my decision. The family tree.
Yes, sir.
This is the Ounce family tree.
Here's Mr. Ounce coming right up out of the trunk.
This is Mathilda Ounce Hemingway...
...out on this limb.
You married this limb.
And this twig sprouting here is Miss Barbara.
Show him the withered branches.
Mr. Ounce has looked with horror on the rotten branches of his family tree...
...if I might use the term.
Bad banana in every bunch.
There is only one more living fruit of the Ounce family tree...
...and that is bad fruit.
James Higgens, over here, has succumbed to the stage...
...in defiance of Mr. Ounce's known wishes in the matter.
James "Bad Fruit" Higgens, an actor.
And have you barred said James Higgens from your home...
...pursuant to Mr. Ounce's memorandum,
January 13, 1930?
- I have.
- You'd better.
Very well, Mr. Hemingway. Mr. Ounce has decided not to wait until he dies...
...before dividing his fortune.
He's going back to New York with you tonight.
There he will liquidate $ 10 million...
...and give it to your wife and yourself.
Ten million dollars.
What about it?
- That's very nice of you, Ezra.
- Yes, but if I find out you haven't...
...answered the questions truthfully...
- Ezra.
If I find your moral life is nothing more than a snare and a delusion...
...I'll cut you off like a ripe banana.
Yes, Ezra, like a ripe banana.
James "Bad Fruit" Higgens.
Take a look at that.
Destroy this. He's no longer an Ounce.
Like to hear a little secret?
I love you.
Jimmy Higgens, why all this love and affection? Have you got a job?
Do I have to have a job to love you?
No, but I'd like to hear both.
Well, I haven't got a job.
Nothing but love.
Thirty-four shows in New York and not a one of them aching for me.
You'll get there yet.
You just keep trying.
Honey, a couple of boys and myself are writing our own show.
You should have waited until Uncle Ezra died before you went on the stage.
I'd have been playing old-man parts by then.
Besides, I don't want any of his money.
I only want to do the things I like, and kiss the girl I love.
It doesn't seem right, our loving each other like we do, being related and everything.
Related? We're 13th cousins.
- Thirteenth?
- Thirteenth.
- Say, is that bad luck?
- Nothing's bad luck, sitting here like this.
- Too hot?
- Of course not.
- That spot...
- So what?
It's a precious souvenir to me
- In love?
- In strong
With me? How long?
Oh, since you were about
Now, let me see
- 'Bout 8? 'Bout 10? 'Bout 12?
- No
- Well, when?
- I'll tell you very confidentially
When you were a smile
on your mother's lips
And a twinkle in your daddy's eye
I loved you then
I loved you when
You were a little tender sigh
When I was a babe in my mother's arms
I would wake up with a lonely cry
I cried for you
They never knew
They thought it was my lullaby
I gave up every little toy
I played no game
I was a lonely little boy
Until you came
The days flew apart
You were in my heart
And I waited for the stork to fly
When you were a smile
On your mother's lips
And a twinkle in your daddy's eye
No. That way.
Up.
Careful.
Oh, Barbara.
Barbara, guess what?
Cousin Ezra is on his way form Buffalo with father.
- And he's gonna give us $ 10 million.
- What's he gonna give Jimmy?
Don't you dare breathe that young reprobate's name to Cousin Ezra.
My, your father has dreamed of this moment ever since we were married.
That's all you've talked about as long as I can remember.
But just think. Ten million dollars.
Oh, I can hardly wait to see dear, dear Ezra.
I'd rather see Jimmy once than that old ruin 10 million times.
Barbara, that's almost sacrilege.
Yes, and I wish Uncle Ezra would hurry and get here so I could tell him so.
Barbara.
Laura, how could you do this to Cousin Ezra?
Come on, get up.
Barbara will be glad to see you, Ezra.
Why not? And I've got some good news for you and Mathilda.
While I liquidate $ 10 million, I've decided to spend about a month at your house.
Oh, that is good news, Ezra.
New York City reeks with sin, especially the hotels. I wouldn't go near any of them.
Oh, you're right, Cousin Ezra.
And here's something else.
I shall take a second 10 million to form the O.F. For the E. Of A.M.
- The what?
- The Ounce Foundation...
...for the Elevation of American Morals.
You can elevate a lot of morals for $ 10 million, Ezra.
New York City is a hotbed of vice.
We'll start with New York and work west.
- Very commendable.
- Mathilda can work south.
I'll give her the southern territory.
- Mathilda will appreciate that very much.
- Yeah?
She's always been interested in reforming everything.
Ten o'clock. Past our bedtime.
Come, Horace.
Bulger. Bodyguard.
Stop that, you old roué, you.
Did you see her trip me? Come, Horace.
Shows you how careful one must be.
You're a good, clean moral man, aren't you, Horace?
- Oh, yes, indeedy.
- Well, see that you remain that way.
We must prepare for the battle in New York.
Sleep well, Horace.
- Good night, Ezra.
- Good night. Come, Bulger.
- Oh, the wrong room.
- No, it isn't my room. It must be yours.
- No, it's not mine.
- Well, look.
- It is mine.
- Good.
What are you doing in my compartment?
I was with a burlesque show. We were stranded and laid an egg in Troy, see?
- I don't see it at all.
- It's very simple.
This is better than walking to New York.
- Y... You get out of here.
- Why? I don't snore.
Snore?
One, two, one, two.
One, two, one, two. Well, Horace.
I thought you were in bed.
No, I'm not in bed. I came out to get some air. You're not in bed.
My compartment was too small so I came down to exercise. It's good for you.
Stimulates the digestion, strengthens the corpuscles. One, two, one, two.
I've overdone it. Athlete's stomach.
Must go to bed, Horace.
Come, Bulger.
Well, here's your compartment, Horace.
This should've been mine.
"E" stands for Ezra. Do you get it?
- Good night, Cousin Ezra.
- Good night, Horace.
Oh, I thought there was a catch in this.
Indian giver, huh?
Get out of here,
I'll call the conductor.
Call him. I'll tell him we got on at Buffalo and that you got cold feet.
I'll make a scandal to shake this rattler off its tracks.
- Oh, no.
- I think I'll start screaming.
Oh, no, no, no. Stay right here.
Make yourself at home.
Wild horses couldn't keep me in here.
Mr. Hemingway.
Is there anything wrong with your compartment?
Oh, it's full of rats.
I see.
I'm not a drinking man myself, but I'm broad-minded.
Yes, sir. I had a cousin used to see rats. Pink ones.
- Come on, you better go to bed.
- No, no, I refuse to go to bed.
Will you go quietly, or must I call Mr. Ounce?
Oh, no, no. I'll go quietly.
Mathilda, I shall appoint you first-crusading vice president of the Ounce Foundation.
Well, what do I do first, Ezra?
Well, first... First, we must put our ear to the ground.
What do you mean, Cousin Ezra?
Oh, just snooping around.
Barbara.
- Well?
- And a good, good evening to you, miss.
- We don't wanna buy nothing.
- I represent the Empire Insurance Company.
- I have a little policy for you.
- We've got it. Go away, I got orders.
So have I.
I've got to see Mr. Hemingway.
Take your foot away from the door...
...and I'll tell him you're here.
- I'm coming in...
...if you don't mind.
I do mind. You stay right here.
I can hardly wait till you get back.
- I never saw such nerve.
- Laura, who was at the door?
One of them fresh insurance fellas, ma'am. And he got in.
What company does he represent, miss?
- He says he's from the Empire of Buffalo.
- I'll get rid of him, Ezra.
No, just a moment, Horace.
He represents my company.
I like persistency. Show him into the sitting room. I'll interview him.
Laura, show him in.
Here I am.
Mr. Ounce says for you to come into the sitting room.
Well, what's this?
- Well, this is the sitting room.
- All right, I'll sit.
Do you realize that 65 out of every
100 people become paupers at age 50?
- No.
- It's the truth...
...and nothing can prevent it but life insurance.
And you, Mr. Hemingway, do you realize that 65...
...out of every 100 people become paupers at age 50?
- No.
- Do you?
- Do you?
- Yes.
The lady is right and nothing can prevent it but life insurance.
- Haven't I seen you someplace before?
- You haven't. That's why I'm here.
I want to give us a break.
My spies told me you'd be here.
- You are James Higgens.
- You are Uncle Ezra.
I've got a musical show that's a honey.
It's called Sweet and Hot.
- Get out.
- I got the show, you the dough.
- Get out.
- Now wait a minute.
We don't know or like each other, but this is strictly a business proposition.
- And you stand to make at least $25,000.
- Horace, tell him to get out.
- You get out of here.
- Now you get right out.
- If you don't make money it's a good show.
- If you mention show to me... Bulger.
Bulger.
Bulger.
Bulger. Here. Put that gun away.
Put that gun away. And throw him out.
- Wait a minute.
- Throw him out. Throw him out. Out.
D.S. Oggle-wopple. D.S. Oggle-wopple.
D.S. Oggle-wopple.
- What does D.S. Oggle-wopple mean?
- Maybe he's hysterical or something.
Hysterical? He's a maniac.
- What's the matter?
- When I get excited...
...I get nervous indigestion.
Come over here and sit down.
Now you sit right down there, Ezra.
And keep quiet.
- We'll get you a drink of water.
- No. No.
Well, go get Uncle Ezra some bicarbonate of soda.
- No.
- Wouldn't plain baking soda be all right?
No.
Well, then hold your breath and count a hundred.
Have you ever tried holding your finger to your upper lip, hard? Like this?
There's only one remedy.
- What is it, uncle?
- Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
- Made in Buffalo.
- I'll run to the drugstore and get some.
- Yeah, hurry, hurry.
- All right.
Call the drugstore, quick.
What's the matter? Don't you know people have hiccups for weeks sometimes?
- Line's busy.
- Well, call another one.
Aren't there any other drugstores in New York?
Do something.
Want me to tickle his feet?
He might start laughing.
I don't wanna hear another word out of you.
Have you got
Dr. Golden's Silver Elixir?
Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
All right. He hasn't got it anyway.
Maybe if the gentleman would stick his head upside down in a bucket of water.
You're fired. Go pack your things.
Very well, ma'am. And I hope the old buzzard hiccups himself into spasms.
Get out. Get out. Ezra. Ezra.
That was a very dangerous and silly thing for you to do.
He was my last chance. I've been to every producer's office and couldn't get in.
- You got past our maid.
- I'll be an expert...
...at getting thrown out.
- Say, how'd you get out?
- Oh, I was lucky.
You gave Uncle Ezra the hiccups, and I had to run for medicine.
- Well, I hope they haven't got any.
- Oh, you nasty man.
- Good evening, Barbara.
- Good evening.
Do you have Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir?
- What?
- Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
I haven't been asked for that in 20 years.
I may have a bottle somewhere.
- I'll look.
- Thank you.
You know, Mother asked me what D.S. Oggle-wopple meant.
Jimmy, I've heard you say that over the phone so many times...
...I figured out that D.S. Meant:
Meet me at the drugstore.
But what does Oggle-wopple mean?
It's a long story. That was just to make it tough in case the folks were listening in.
Oh, I understand.
Here's your elixir, Barbara.
It's probably the only bottle in New York.
- Thank you. Charge it, please.
- Certainly.
- Want a sip?
- Thanks.
Good?
- Well, let's go.
- All right.
- So long, Eddy. See you later.
- So long, Jimmy.
Oh, my elixir.
You don't have to go right back home, do you, honey?
Gosh, it's the first night we've been together in months.
Look at that moon, sweets.
I wanna talk about the show and about us.
I can't concentrate on it, Jimmy.
All I can think of is Uncle Ezra's hiccups.
Now which would you rather do, listen to Uncle Ezra's hiccups...
...or let me tell you how much I love you?
- Where you gonna tell me, Jimmy?
- I could do it here, but I won't.
I gotta have background.
Okay, kid, come on.
How's this for background, sweetheart?
The sea, the moon and you.
- It's perfect, isn't it?
- Almost.
- What do you mean, almost?
- Jimmy, if your play was a success...
...we could choose our own background always, couldn't we?
Success? Sweetheart, we've got a million dollars right here...
...if I can get someone to back me.
Just listen to this.
This is how I feel about you.
My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And, dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion too
Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes
For you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes
For you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes
For you
Gee, Jimmy, that's swell.
So are you.
My.
For heaven's sakes.
Ezra, please let me send for a doctor.
Don't wanna. I hate doctors.
Don't know what's keeping Barbara.
Well, are you comfortable?
Is there anything I can do?
Yes. Get me some elixir and get out.
Never had a woman in my bedroom before in my life.
- But, Ezra...
- Get out.
- But I...
- Go on, get out.
Crown Drug?
I'll give you $ 100 for a bottle of Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
And I'll give you 1000 bucks if I ever heard of it.
Do something.
I've called up 500 drugstores, and you ask me to do something.
Call one other one, quick.
My.
Hello? Star Drug?
I'll give you 500 bottles...
$500 for a bottle of Dr. Silver's...
- Dr. Golden, Dr. Silver's Gold...
- Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
I haven't seen a bottle since the Spanish-American War.
Oh, get another number, quick.
Ezra.
There's not a drugstore in New York that carries it.
Serves me right for coming without it.
Imagine no druggist in New York City carrying Dr. Silver's Elixir.
Send to Buffalo.
Get a couple of cases. Don't stand there.
- But I...
- Do something. Get out.
Go on. Get out. Get it. Get the elixir.
How do I know where you get it?
What kind of a drugstore is this?
That's your business.
Oh, Horace, control yourself.
- I've called up every...
- Horace.
- Blankety-blank drugstore in this town.
- Control your language.
- Ezra might hear you.
- I don't give a...
Horace.
Barbara.
Where have you been?
- Staten Island.
- What for?
- Oh, for Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
- She's got it.
- Give it to me, Horace.
- Hurry up. Give it to him. Cousin Ezra.
- Come on, hurry up. Give it to him.
- Cousin Ezra, here it is.
That's it. The only thing that never fails.
- How many spoonfuls?
- Never mind. I'll drink it out of the bottle.
Goodbye, hiccups.
That stuff is magic.
I feel like a new man.
- Honey.
- Jimmy.
I got a date with a producer.
They're playing the songs.
- I need you for good luck.
- Okay.
Fine.
Boys, that's just what the theater needs.
It's fresh. It's young. It's good.
I like the songs. I like the book.
The whole thing is colossal.
- You'll accept it?
- For immediate production.
I'm going to give you my check for $5000, advance royalties.
Five thousand dollars?
Did you hear that?
- Oh, gee, that's swell.
- We're in. We're in. We're on the way.
There's your check, my boy.
Now if you will just put your name to this...
...merely a release of the property to me...
...while we're waiting for the contracts.
Now, I'll notify you when rehearsals start.
Will we get the regular percentage?
You don't have to be satisfied with any usual royalties.
I'll guarantee you boys a straight
15 percent of the gross.
Mr. Todd, you don't know how grateful we are.
Indeed. The only other playwright getting
15 percent is George Bernard Shaw.
Mr. Todd, you're the swellest guy in the world.
My boy, you're youth.
Your play is youth.
And I always believe in encouraging youth.
In fact I may almost say that I was young once myself.
Well, you go right ahead and say it.
Nobody's stopping you.
Well, well, Mabel.
My, you're looking splendid.
I ought to. I spent my last 200 bucks on this outfit.
- Know what I came back to New York in?
- In good health.
- In a coat and a pair of step-ins.
- Did you have to walk back?
It wasn't your fault that I didn't, you bandit.
Well, Mr. Higgens,
I'll call you up later...
...since this is a personal matter.
- Personal my eye, I want witnesses.
One o'clock. I have a luncheon engagement with my banker.
- Now, you'Il...
- Fork over that $57 back salary or I'Il...
You'll have to see my lawyer.
Your lawyer. You four-flushing chiseler.
He sends me out in a turkey show that folds up like an accordion.
He leaves me holding the bag, stranded, broke in Troy.
Have you ever been stranded in Troy?
Have you ever even been there?
- No, no.
- No.
Well, buddy, what did that look like to you?
It looks like you can't get blood out of a turnip.
- Did he hook you too?
- No, he just...
...gave us a check for $5000 for our show.
Five thousand?
Pardon me while I have a convulsion.
Well, I'd like to meet my fellow sufferers. I'm Mabel Anderson.
This is Miss Hemingway.
And this is Johnny Harris.
And this is Buttercup Balmer.
And I'm Jimmy Higgens.
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Hello.
You're not related to Horace P. Hemingway?
- He's my father.
- The sausage casing Hemingways?
- Yes, why?
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing. I just seemed to see a meal ticket coming over the horizon.
Jimmy, please. Let's get out of here.
No, wait a minute.
I'm getting an idea.
Yes, I've got it.
You say you've got a show?
Have you got $20,000 to put it on?
I've got 17 cents and the clothes I stand in.
But there's life in the old girl yet.
Let's you and me go into a conference.
Beat it, Buttercup.
Come on, Johnny.
Miss Hemingway, if you please.
Goodbye now.
She's got a nerve.
My friend, what kind of a show have you got?
It's a great musical show, got the swellest songs you ever heard.
Is that a fact? Well, let me hear one.
I got one here I think you'll like.
It's called:
"Try To See it My Way."
Here we go.
Girl of my heart
Why should we start
Quarreling you and I?
That's a very bad beginning
Ending with goodbye
You're a bit wild
Simply a child
Wanting your own sweet way
So before you leave me
Count up to 10
While I say
Try to see it my way, baby
Don't break up a beautiful affair
- What are you smiling at?
- Isn't that a sweet song I wrote?
Why is he singing my song to her?
I guess that's the way a crooner works.
- tried to see it your way
Tried to understand your point of view
But I don't want to see it your way
'Cause your way means we're through
Let's both sit down and talk a while
That's all that I suggest
A word of love, a tender smile
And a kiss or two will do the rest
Your way is the last goodbye way
My way is the end of every tear
Won't you try to see it my way?
Try to see it my way, dear
- Well, what are they doing now?
- Maybe they're planning a double suicide.
- That's swell.
- Wait till you hear the rest of them.
There's a great part for you.
- Help me put the show on.
- All right. The show's on and I'm in.
All you've got to do is get me a private interview with Horace P. Hemingway.
- Is that all you need?
- I'll get enough money...
...to finance Ben-Hur with solid-gold horses.
- Let's shake on it.
- I'll raise you one. We'll kiss on it.
Barbara. The show's in. Mabel's done it.
I don't care what she's done.
And I don't care what happens to your show or to you.
Oh, Barbara, Barbara...
Business before pleasure.
Wait, let's see if I've got it.
Yep, there it is. There's the backer of our show, and there's the billet-doux.
Look out, Uncle Tom Hemingway, here comes Mabel Legree a-cracking her whip.
Thus, my friends, we form tonight the kernel of the nut which is to be.
That nut is the Ounce Foundation for the E. Of the A.M.
Oh, thank... Thank you.
Thank you.
Those magic letters signify so much to all of us.
What does it mean? My friends, the elevation of American morals.
That's what it means.
The nut I refer to is going to be a hard nut to crack.
We all know what a task lies before us.
You know what a task lies before you.
You know, you know and you know.
And if the O.F. For the E. Of the A.M.
Shall prevail, and it must prevail...
...every theater in our wicked city shall be closed.
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway, our vice president...
...will conclude the meeting.
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway.
All right, folks, our honored president has declared war on the wicked.
Now if you'll just pick up the little slips of paper which you have...
...we shall all join in the battle cry.
Rise, please.
Now, all together.
"The Ounce Foundation for the Elevation of American Morals.
Who are we?
The Ounce Foundation for the Elevation of American Morals.
Rah-rah-rah.
Ziss-boom bah.
The O.F. For the E. Of the A.M."
The meeting is dismissed.
Thank you. Thank you.
- I'm so glad you could come.
- Goodbye.
- Wonderful.
- The Ounce Foundation.
We are fathering... I mean, mothering a great movement. Yes, indeed.
Good night. Thank you.
Don't forget the Ounce Foundation for the Elevation of American Morals.
The Ounce Foundation...
- Is Jimmy there?
- No, he's out. Say, listen, Barbara.
We're writing in a little dance tune for you.
- But where's Jimmy?
- Out with Mabel, digging up our financing.
Don't write any dance tune for me.
Write them for his Mabel.
I don't ever wanna see him again.
- Was I all right with the battle cry?
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you, Cousin Ezra.
- I was proud of you, Horace.
- Yes, it was a remarkable fine meeting.
- Oh, I was thrilled to the core.
- Me too.
- Let me see. Oh, it's 10:00.
Way past our bedtime.
Good night. Sleep well so your loins may be girded for the battle.
- Same to you, Cousin Ezra. Same to you.
- Thank you.
- Good night, Horace.
- Good night, dear.
"Please don't mention this unfortunate night to a soul.
Horace P. Hemingway."
You dreadful woman.
How did you get in my room?
Hello, Horace.
- You can't smoke in here.
- I am smoking.
Do I smell cigarette smoke?
Not in this house, Ezra.
Must be someone burning garbage.
Well, good night, Mathilda.
Good night, Ezra.
How did you get in here?
What did you want?
- Twenty thousand dollars.
- T... Twenty what?
Twenty thousand of these.
Twenty thousand dollars.
- Go away.
- Look, honey.
We've played this scene before, we know how it goes.
Now please don't waste any time.
Give.
Every time I come into this room
I'm afraid of finding you.
I dream about it at night.
I wake up in a cold sweat.
Are you gonna quit stalling or am I gonna start screaming?
- You wouldn't dare.
- Cousin Ezra...
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from down here.
Horace?
Yes, Ezra?
Did you hear something just now?
No.
That was just the plumbing.
You mean that little:
"Ezra"?
Was that the plumbing?
Y... Yes, Mathilda.
Just a little wind in the pipes.
I've heard many a wind in many a pipe, but never a sound like that.
Well, now, Ezra, you'd better go back to bed.
Well, there's something amiss here.
I can feel it in my bones.
- Good night, Ezra.
- Good night, Mathilda.
- If you ever scream like that again...
- I'll never scream like that again.
Next time you'll hear me a mile away.
It won't sound like no wind in the pipes.
- What will you do?
- What'll you do, Horace?
Don't call me by my first name.
- Okay, P. P's your second name, isn't it?
- P stands for Peter.
All right, Pete, how about the 20 grand?
I feel another scream coming on.
You'd rather give me $20,000 than lose Ezra's 10 million, wouldn't you?
- How'd you know about that?
- A little bird.
W... Where you going?
- To tell Cousin Ezra what a Romeo you are.
- Oh, no.
I'll tell him about our night.
That we were train roommates.
- I'll show him your card.
- How much?
- Twenty-five thousand.
- You said 20 before.
- Why didn't you pay me before?
- That's every cent I've got.
- I'd cry, but I haven't a handkerchief.
- If I give it to you...
...will you give me the card, let me alone?
- Need you ask?
- All right.
Plumbing, huh?
Wind in the pipe, huh?
- There.
- Twenty-five thousand.
All that fuss over a mere trifle.
You take my last penny and call it a trifle.
- W... Who is it?
- It's Mathilda.
My wife. Come on, get out here.
- No, I won't get out...
- Here. No, I...
If she catches you in here, I'm ruined.
Come on, get in this closet.
Why... Why, Mathilda. It's you.
I'm your wife, Mathilda. Remember?
I... I was nervous.
I couldn't sleep.
- So you've been to bed?
- Oh, yes, yes, you see? That's... That's it.
Since when do you go to bed with your pants on?
Well, you see I...
Suddenly I had a heart attack.
Yes.
- You know.
- If I don't, I'll find out.
That's the bathroom.
What do you suppose I thought it was?
The Bank of England?
- W... Where you going now?
- You'll find out.
- Goodbye, fatty.
- Conspiracy. Conspiracy.
Well, only a few weeks more and the $ 10 million is yours.
Providing you don't make me change my mind.
Thank you, Ezra. Thank you very much.
You don't know how generous you are, Ezra.
Now how about a bite of lunch?
Well, I do feel a bit peckish.
Oh, I know a real nice place where we can get a healthful meal.
- Well, let's go there.
- Oh, yes.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
I found the first object for our foundation to crush.
James Higgens is rehearsing a play on
Broadway entitled Sweet and Hot.
Just read that disgraceful item,
Horace. Read that.
"Sweet and Hot, Jimmy Higgens' torrid musical comedy...
...springs from the fountain of youth.
Author, songwriters and actors are all youngsters."
- Go on, go on.
- "Jimmy's backer is said to be...
...none other than a big businessman...
...who is very much interested in the career of Mabel Anderson."
Well, it was horrible enough for Jimmy to write such a terrible play...
...but any man who would finance such an outrage...
...should be tarred and feathered.
The Ounce Foundation shall run him out of town.
I myself shall give him a scathing rebuke.
We'll attend the opening of this production.
- And denounce it to the world.
- Will you excuse me?
A conference with a lot of big, sausage casing men from Australia. See you tonight.
Not a word about our attitude toward Sweet and Hot.
We must swoop down on them.
Oh, yes, Ezra, swoop down on them like an eagle from the sky.
- Well, goodbye, Ezra.
- Goodbye, Horace.
- Goodbye, Mathilda.
- Goodbye, Horace.
You know Horace's heart and soul is with the Ounce Foundation.
I know.
Say, that kid can dance.
Say, you'll do, kid. Go up and get measured for costumes.
Oh, gee, thanks.
All right, girls, take it easy.
Say, that kid's got plenty of stuff.
Who is she?
I don't know. What name she give?
Joan Grey. Never heard of her.
She'll do till a better one comes along.
Okay.
All right, kids. Come on, places now.
Let's get set. Let's get started.
All right, Buttercup, hit it.
Hiya, pop.
Go away, go away.
Burn my clothes, if it isn't Romeo, our financial backer.
I wonder what's on his mind. Come on.
- Well, well, Uncle Horace.
- Hello, Hemie.
James, a word with you.
- See here, young man...
- Congratulations, Horace, congratulations.
- On what?
- Defying Uncle Ezra and seeing our show.
I'm not defying Ezra.
And this show has got to stop right now.
Got to stop? Fat chance,
Uncle Horace, fat chance.
You young scoundrel. It's my money.
It was your money.
You're a credit to this country.
- You put a lot of people to work.
- Not this kind of work.
- If this gets out, I'm ruined.
- You'll take bows when the show opens.
This show is not going to open.
Stop it. Everybody, stop it.
This show is off, understand?
- You're all dismissed.
- Girls, girls. Don't pay any attention to him.
This show must not go on.
He's only our backer and we've already got the money. Feed him to the lions.
Help. Help.
Let me go, let me go, let me go.
Back to rehearsal. Let's go, everybody.
Come on. Snap into it.
I'll call the police.
I'll have you arrested for assault.
Go ahead, Uncle Horace.
We'd be glad to get the publicity.
- Publicity?
- Sure. "Horace P. Hemingway...
...big sausage man in town...
...gives chorus girl $25,000 to put on show...
...puts a lot of people out of work"...
- No, no, no.
Please don't do anything like that.
Go ahead and rehearse.
But promise me that Ezra won't find out about me.
Now, don't you worry, because...
All right, girls. Come on, come on. Get into it. Hit the deck. Let's see it.
- Barbara.
- Hit it, Buttercup.
- Barbara.
- My name is Joan Grey.
You go put on some clothes.
- I have them on.
- Why, that's disgraceful.
Barbara's just a visitor.
She's not in the show.
Oh, is that so?
You asked me to come to rehearsal, and your dance director hired me.
I got in the show, and I'm going to stay in.
Now, now, now, honey, maybe your father's right.
You don't want me around, is that it?
Afraid I'll cramp your style with your darling Mabel?
I've heard enough of this.
You get some clothes on.
I don't care what either of you say.
I'm free, white and 21.
I love to dance and I'm going to dance.
And if you fire me from this show,
I'll get a job in another one.
Wait till Ezra and Mathilda hear about this. I'm ruined. Sunk. Lost.
Listen, you don't really think we'd let Barbara...
...appear in a professional show?
Why, she can't. She's an amateur.
Helen Wills is an amateur in tennis.
- She can't play pro tennis, can she?
- I don't know, can she?
Why, of course she can't.
Now, don't you worry.
I can handle Barbara.
Besides, the show's a bit long...
...and we're gonna cut out all the numbers that Barbara's in.
If Ezra ever finds out anything about anything...
...he'll cut me off like a ripe banana. He said so.
How's he ever gonna hear of it?
He always has his ear to the ground.
Lot of newspapermen to see you about the show, Mr. Higgens.
- This is the end.
- Now you go hide someplace...
...I'll take care of everything.
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Hi, boys.
- Who's this secret backer of yours?
Can't tell you just now, boys.
I get it. The more mysterious, the more publicity.
You've got the right idea.
This is the one. Put it in the alley.
Here they come. Finally.
- Have you seen Barbara yet?
- Hasn't she shown up?
- Hasn't she even called?
- Not a peep.
I told you about amateurs.
She probably forgot it's the opening and made another date.
- You know the opening number?
- Backwards.
Put on Barbara's costume.
If I drop dead from all this, play my part.
Come on, Mabel, we're late.
Hurry up, will you, Mabel?
Go ahead, hurry.
Hold that curtain. We can't start.
The leading lady hasn't shown up.
Okay, boss.
My, I'm so glad Barbara didn't tease to go.
I'd never permit it.
She's much too young.
- Yes, yes, indeedy.
- Yes.
Bulger? Are your loins girded for the battle?
The loins is ready to roar.
Are these gentlemen capable and fearless?
Sure, they's the cream of the crop.
They understand my signal for action?
Sure, when you takes out your handkerchief and waves it...
...they gives it the works.
- Right.
- Right.
Mathilda, Horace, forward.
Ezra, don't you think you're going a trifle too far?
No, evil must be met with force.
Ezra Ounce is merciless when aroused.
Overture.
Come on, everybody, places, will you?
On stage. Everybody. Come on.
Curtain.
Ezra, have you discovered who is backing this nefarious enterprise?
We find out tonight. Tonight is my night.
- W... Will you excuse me a minute?
- Gladly.
Now, hurry back, Horace.
I'll be right back. Yes.
Not yet, Ezra, the handkerchief.
You can't stop the show before it's started.
Just a little excited, that's all.
- Ezra.
- Thank you.
Hey, I gotta talk to you.
You certainly picked a swell time.
Places, everybody.
- I mean it. This is serious.
- You're serious and I'm going daffy.
- Tell Mabel to step on it, will you.
- Mabel, step on it.
- This is the point.
- What is? Mabel?
No, this. Ezra's gonna give me
$ 10 million tomorrow.
I'll give you a million dollars if you don't open.
My first show on Broadway.
Is Mabel ready?
- Mabel, hurry up.
- I've worked, hoped, dreamed for this night.
I've aged five years and lost 12 pounds at rehearsal.
I'm about to pull the curtain on the most important thing...
...in my life and you come blubbering for me to stop.
- Scram, will you?
- I'll give you two million.
I'll give you two seconds to get out. Clear the stage.
Hurry on, girls. Plenty of pep now.
Give me a big smile out there.
On stage. Come on, hurry.
Come on, get out of here, will you?
- Jimmy, I'm late.
- I'll say. Too late.
- Barbara, what are you doing here?
- I'm in this show.
You told me amateurs couldn't play tennis.
- Who's asking her to play tennis?
- If you step out on that stage...
...you're no longer my daughter.
- We'll argue that later.
- I'm ready.
- She has on my costume. Take it off.
Sorry, I take orders from Jimmy.
Hello, Horace.
Jimmy, I couldn't sneak out until after 8...
...and my taxi got caught in a traffic jam.
- Well, you didn't show. Mabel did.
- If you let her step on that stage, I'll...
- Get out of here, leave us alone...
...or I'll tell them you're backing the show.
No, no, don't do that. I'll go.
Come on, get out.
All right, everybody, on stage. Come on.
I wonder what happened to Horace.
I hope the excitement isn't too much for him.
He's so enthusiastic.
Oh, my.
Thank you.
Bulger, this elixir tastes a little strange.
That's the new triple-strength kind.
A case just came down from Buffalo this afternoon.
Oh, I'm so sorry you don't like it, Ezra.
Who said I didn't like it?
Kill your house lights.
Get ready for the curtain.
Horace, where have you been?
There's nothing so dreadful about that.
Think so, Ezra?
Well, they're saving the worst for later. Wait and see.
No nudity at all. I'm disappointed.
Agreeably, of course.
Barbara.
A fine "fishel" of kettle...
Kettle of fish. Your daughter.
Treachery in our own ranks.
Oh, Horace, the pity of it. Our daughter.
Our flesh and blood. A painted actress.
Quick, Bulger, a bottle of that elixir.
Excitement has unnerved her.
I don't feel so well myself.
Give me a bottle of...
I'll take one if you don't mind.
How can you control $ 10 million?
You can't even control your own daughter.
Oh, Ezra, are you gonna cut me off like a ripe banana?
A ripe banana.
I'm just a victim of fate.
'Cause I only have eyes
For you
- One seat, please.
- How many?
- One.
- There you are.
Got a couple in the balcony?
Well, you got the last two, mister.
And am I glad.
And I only have eyes for you
Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes
For you
Are the stars out tonight?
- He doesn't know if it's cloudy or bright.
- That's right.
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high.
- But he can't see a thing in the sky.
- Why?
'Cause I only have eyes for you
Now you don't know if you're in a garden, do you?
Come on, answer me.
Or on a crowed avenue.
Be truthful. Never mind.
You're here, so am I.
Maybe millions of people go by.
- Yes, but they all disappear.
- Where?
From view
And I only have eyes for you
My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And, dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion too?
Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you
Yes, I only have eyes
For you
And I only have eyes for you.
Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes
For you
Very beautiful.
Very, very beautiful.
Oh, very, very, very beautiful.
Ezzy, you wouldn't cut off poor old
Horace like a ripe banana, would you?
No, Horacey, not like a ripe banana.
Like a ripe avocado.
Boys. Quiet.
- How we doing?
- We're doing all right.
- The customers love you.
- Do you like me?
- Do I what?
- Am I forgiven for being late?
Ask me if I like you again.
Do you like me, Jimmy?
Now ask me if I love you.
Well, do you love me?
- Ask me after the show.
- You think I won't?
I tell you, gentlemen. If I'm going to put any money into this show...
...I want to be sure that we get the best music possible.
You're absolutely right.
Great songs draw people into the theater.
The story's what's important. I don't put in a cent until we get the best playwright...
Listen, nobody cares about the story.
People want songs.
Right, V.C. We've got to get good snappy music.
You've got to have a great leading man.
You said it.
- Mr. McDonald of the Commercial Trust.
- Can't see him.
I tell you it's the story that makes the show.
- No, sir, it's the cast.
- It's the publicity.
The music.
Gentlemen, please, please.
Just think for a moment.
Who writes the words and music
For all the girlie shows?
No one cares
And no one knows
Who is the handsome hero
Some villain always frames?
But who cares if there's a plot or not
When they've got a lot of dames?
What do you go for?
Go see a show for?
Tell the truth
You go to see those beautiful dames
Yes, sir
You spend your dough for
Bouquets that grow for
All those cute and cunning
Young and beautiful dames
Oh, dames
Are temporary flames
To you, dames
You don't recall their names
Do you?
But their caresses
And home addresses
Linger in your memory
Of those beautiful dames
- Yes?
- Mr. Earl Farroll to see you.
- Can't see him.
- Also Mr. George Hershwin.
Tell him, "Tomorrow." Now, gentlemen...
- Well?
- Miss Dolly Devoe to see you.
Show her right in.
- Miss Devoe?
- Yes.
- Come right in.
- Thank you. Kind of you to see me.
Oh, not at all. Yes?
- Miss Dubin, Miss Warren, Miss Kelly, Miss...
- Send them all in.
Come right in, girls.
Leave your addresses
My big successes
All depend a lot upon
You beautiful dames
As I was telling all those gentlemen
A while ago
That what do we go for
Go see a show for
Tell the truth
We go to see you beautiful dames
We spend our dough for
Bouquets that grow for
All you cute and cunning
Young and beautiful dames
Oh, dames are necessary
To show business
Dames, without you there would be
No business
Your knees in action
That's the attraction
And what good's a show
Without you beautiful dames?
Rehearsal tomorrow, 11:00
Be there promptly by then
Better set your alarm clocks for 9
At least no later than 10
Hooray for the Ounce Foundation
For the Elevation of Celebration. Hooray.
The O.P. For the E. Of the A.F.M.
Boys. Be quiet.
Those people are all staring at you.
Well, they couldn't be staring at a better couple of men.
- He's getting ready.
- It won't be long now.
That creature's trying to lure you boys.
Impossible. I never even saw her before in my whole life.
She's a very nice, friendly young lady.
Stop this show.
Keep going. Keep going, girls.
What's the matter? Girls, girls.
Oh, Ezra, you started it, now stop it.
I knew I should've stayed at home.
Quiet. Quiet.
Oh, Horace, get away from those shameless women.
Oh, Mathilda, go away and leave me alone. I'm in jail.
Silence.
Mr. Ounce, I've arranged to get you out of this terrible jail.
Yes, but I don't wanna get out of jail. I like it.
I never had a better time in my life.
But, Ezra, think of the Ounce Foundation.
You know what I think of the Ounce Foundation?
Phooey.
We'll get a million dollars' worth of publicity out of this. The show will run a year.
Maybe we owe Uncle Ezra a vote of thanks.
I'll offer him a job as company press agent.
Say, by the way, I was going to ask you something after the show.
Is it all right now?
You couldn't pick a better time or a better place.
ENGLISH
What's the matter with you, Emma?
─ I forgot the soup bowl for dinner.
Soup bowl? Bah!
I hope your soup bowl is better than your music. That's enough.
Darling, don't be mad just because we didn't turn out to be four little genii.
Anyway, you seem to forget there is a genius in the family.
If you're referring to Kay's voice, it's just an ordinary voice.
It needs years of hard work and training ..
Why father, when you applied at the Foundation for the scholarship ..
You wrote: "A thrilling voice.
The greatest this side of Tetrazzini ."
Well I couldn't spell "mediocre".
Anyway, they expect a father to exaggerate.
Spell "exaggerate".
─ E.X.A ..
Besides, what the use of having a voice like Tetrazzini if you're lazy to study.
All you think of is stuffing yourself with chocolates and reading trash.
Look at it: True Love Stories. Bah!
Dad, you should be glad we're the way we are.
Instead of frumps with long noses and eyeglasses.
That's what you really deserve, Mr Lemp.
The trouble with you Dad, is that your old-fashioned.
Old-fashioned?
I suppose you'd like this house full of jazz and swing and crooners and whatnot.
Will you be quiet! Will you stop it!
Madness, madness, madness!
I can hear you at the back of the house and so can all the neighbors.
Well, let the whole world hear.
I've been a good person.
What have I done to deserve such daughters?
How many more times must I remind you about your blood-pressure?
Listen, you are my sister, not my doctor. And it is my blood pressure.
If I want it to go up, it will go up, and I want it to go up!
I tell you this modern fashion isn't and never will be music.
I won't insult my ears with it.
I'd rather hear Brahms played with discord.
I'll go to the Hall Of Records to strike my name off your birth certificates.
Yes! That's what I'll do ..
─ Daddy, Daddy ..
Keep smiling, Dad.
─ Goodbye.
Let me kiss you goodbye, Daddy.
─ I don't want a kiss from any of you!
Keep smiling, Dad.
─ You want an umbrella?
It won't rain.
─ Let me fix your tie.
Let it hang.
I never knew a man who got so much enjoyment out of being angry.
Girls, you shouldn't tease him like that.
Hello, Mr Lemp.
─ Hello, young man.
Emma, here comes your heartbeat.
Stop kidding.
Hello.
More flowers!
You know Ernie, you shouldn't.
Well, this time, aunt Etta.
You see, what I'm trying to say is ..
Never mind. Take it easy. Take it easy.
Hello, everybody.
─ Hello, Ernest.        ─ Hello, Ernest.
Hello, Emma.
─ Hello.
What is it today, Ernest?
Orchids.
Orchids?
Ernest, you shouldn't.
Why, the flowers you brought yesterday are still as fresh as can be.
Well .. it's .. it's for you.
Why Ernest, I didn't know you needed glasses.
I'm Thea, the clever sister.
There is Emma.
Now run to her with the orchids, and bless you, my children.
But this time .. it's really for you.
For me?
─ What?
You're just a small town Lothario.
Yes. Thanks.
There is a card inside. A fellah came into the shop and .. he suggested I ..
"Mr Benjamin Crowley".
"I hope you'll wear these tonight."
Why Thea, who is he?
Where'd you meet him?
Look girls. I just met him this morning.
He's so handsome.
─ Where'd you meet?
He was with Amanda Rawlings at tennis.
He drove up in a great big gray car.
Thea, you say the handsomest ..
Well, make that the most distinguished.
Is he tall?
─ Well ..
Yes and no.
Is he young?
─ He's young enough.
And he's rich?
He's strictly surtax.
He's president of the Booster Society and Secretary of the Saltmarsh gun club.
He loves duck dinners.
And he probably has indigestion every Tuesday and Friday.
What did you say his name was again?
─ Mr Benjamin Crowley.
Well, I guess I'd better ..
He can't be so very rich.
He asked me to go to the Country Club dance tonight.I accepted.
You didn't?
─ I did.
Well, I guess I'd better get going.
I beg your pardon?
─ I said, I'd guess I'd better go.
Oh yes. Well, goodbye.
─ Goodbye.
Oh Ernest, what did you have to bring them for?
You see, you've spoiled everything.
Why didn't I have had the thrill of the delivery boy rushing up to the door ..
"Flowers for Miss Thea Lemp!"
Don't be silly.
Well, it seemed foolish, me living next door. It saved the boy a trip.
Of course, Ernest. It was the sensible thing to do.
And you're just in time to get your socks.
Oh, I forgot.
─ Here they are, Emma.
Do you think orchids are just my type?
Well, they are beautiful at that.
That's romance for you. Orchids in one hand, socks in another.
Here, Ernest.  They're all mended.
>> Gee, I don't know how to thank you.
Don't thank me. Aunt Etta darned them.
Oh. Well, thank you for handing them to me.
Oh, aren't they marvelous?
If there is anything I can do ..
They're dry. You don't have to wring them.
Look out.
Goodbye.
If ever someday he finishes a sentence, I'll marry him.
I hope he does.
Hey, Emma.
Will you just wait here a minute. I've got ..
It's for you.
Ernest, you can't afford this.
Well, as long as Mr Crowley can send orchids to Thea, I guess ..
Well ..
Goodbye.
─ Goodbye.
I guess I'd better run along.
Bye.
Hey, Emma. Emma.
Where is your slip?
I can't find it anywhere.
I've been looking all over for it.
Thea Lemp, you're not going to wear another slip of mine.
I want this stocking, Thea.
That will make a pair.
I'll be glad to do your hair for you.
─ Well, heaven's sake, let's get going.
He'll be here any moment.
Hey, what's going on in here?
Never mind that. Let me have your slip.
Maybe someday you'll want mine.
Hey, Emma.
You'll find it in my drawer over by the window.
A fine state of affairs when I have to look in Kay's drawer ..
For my slip so that Thea can wear it.
Here we are, work ourselves into a lather and you ..
Kay, why don't you do something?
─ I'm doing very important work.
I'm relaxing for you.
When a Lemp beauty goes out, the rest of the family becomes a nudist colony.
You all think Master Ben Crowley is worthy of all this here fuss?
Why sure he is, honey-child. Master Ben
Crowley has got money and lots of it.
What Thea wants is butlers like the
Rawlings, with servants to order around.
We get along.
─ Yes. Making over old dresses.
I want people in a crowd to point me out in a crowd and say:
"There goes the smart Mrs Crowley."
But suppose you don't love him?
─ Love is overrated, old fashioned.
Last generation.
Last generation or not.
I still want love.
Storybook style, with all the trimmings.
A knight in shining armor on a white horse.
Don't be silly. Where are you going to find a white horse these days?
Why worry about the future?
If you've got anything coming to you, it'll come.
Ann, tell them I'm right.
About love, I mean.
I don't think you are.
I wouldn't mind mothering someone like a kitten or a puppy or a baby.
And I want fun. Lots of laughs.
All the married people I've seen,why there a little bit short on laughter.
Maybe if I had a baby without any husband.
Now you are talking nonsense.
Oh I don't mean having a baby. Just mothering someone. Oh, you get the idea.
I hope not.
Ben is being announced.
>> He would be punctual.
That's his car. Isn't it a beauty.
It looks paid for.
─ I'd still like a white horse.
Gee Thea, an open car. It will muss your hair up every which way.
No it won't. I'll wear your scarf.
Oh, I was afraid of that.
The orchids. The orchids!
Let me fix .. oh, you forgot the cape.
Give me the cape.
Where is the cape?
─ It's on the couch.
I wish it were gold dust.
Here's the cape.
─ You're a darling.
Wish me luck.
Aren't we going to meet him?
─ What?
And have him wonder why he picked me?
No, you're all much better looking than I am.
But I'm the smart one. Goodbye.
Come on, Kay. Here's your chance to see Master Crowley.
Must I?
Good evening, Thea.
Good evening, Ben.
Thea's answer to a maiden's prayer. Not mine.
Ah, you can't sing for your own amusement.
One, two, three, four. Forte piano ..
Quiet. You're disturbing the cooks.
I'm afraid my sister's cooking needs some inspiration.
[ Singing: ]
"Oh, once I felt that i would go .."
"A rosy, rosy, rosy of wow wood. Yeah, man!"
What .. sacrilege!
I can't understand it. This duck is beginning to show signs of life.
The more I look at it, the more I'm convinced it looks like Ben Crowley.
Is everything going alright, girls?
─ Now don't worry.
It's going to be a perfectly wonderful dinner.                 ─ Oh, I hope so.
Just leave it, thus. We'll take care of Mr Crowley's condiments.
Calm down, Thea. You're going to look as if you really did cook this dinner.
That reminds me. Ann, have you got your lines straight?
Then let me hear it.
Oh Mr Crowley, I just can't get over it.
Thea cooked the whole dinner. Every inch of it herself and just look at her ..
She's as fresh and beautiful as if she'd just stepped out of a bandbox.
Gee, I'm hungry.
─ That's wonderful.
Well, I think I've finished setting the table.
Thanks, Dad.
Now the next thing to fix is ..
Oh Dad, your tie.
─ What's the matter with my tie?
Be a dear and let me fix it, will you.
─ Oh, go on then.
To think that I have to go through all this three more times.
[ Doorbell ]
And that is Mr Benjamin Crowley.
He finally got here.
About time. I'm starving.
Now you girls do a little last minute prepping. I'll answer the door.
Oh no. You'll not go out in that apron.
That might be a good idea.
Let Mr Crowley see how bullied I am.
No. You put your coat on, Dad.
I'll see to the door.
Girls, you tidy up in there and don't forget the flowers.
Oh, Kay.
Slip this sweater on.
I wore that dress last night.
Alright.
Good evening, Ben.
─ Good evening, Thea.
May I have your hat?
Oh yes. Thank you.
Well, you have a very lovely home here.
─ Thanks.
Your coat?
Coat.
Say, you're looking beautiful tonight.
─ Thank you, Ben.
I hope my watch is right.
I've been driving around the block.
Afraid I'd be here too early.
You're right on time, as usual.
Well, that's my long suit: punctuality.
I believe in hitting appointments ..
Right on the nose!
Yes.
I've been taught not to point, but do you know the finest father in the world?
I added that for a little sentimental touch.
How do you do. Glad to meet you, sir.
The pleasure's mine, Mr Crowley.
>> Thank you.
Would you like a little wine?
Well, I don't care if I do.
We have some very nice home-made blackberry.
Thank you.
─ And this is aunt Etta.
Well, well, aunt Etta.
I've heard a great deal about you.
─ Have you?
What have you heard?
Well .. only the best.
And this is my sister Emma.
How do you do, Emma.
And this is Kay.
How are you, Kay.?
─ And this is Ann. The baby.
Hello.
I was the baby in our family too.
Would you like to sit down?
─ Yes, I would.
Your very good health, Mr Crowley.
─ Drink hearty.
Nothing like a little home-made blackberry to warm you up a bit.
That's what I always say.
─ I made it myself.
Would you like to sit down?
─ Thank you.
Now if you will excuse me, I will have to go and attend to the dinner.
A rosebud garden of girls.
You're quite a poet.
That isn't original with me.
I .. I must have read that somewhere.
Well, the fellow who wrote it must have certainly seen this family.
Come along, come along.
Dinner is all ready.
We've got duck.
I always say there is nothing like a good, home-cooked dinner.
I think your home is charming.
Thanks. You sit here. You get a nice view of the kitchen.
Thank you.
Oh Mr Crowley, I just can't get over it.
Thea cooked the dinner, every inch of it herself. And just look at her.
She's as fresh and beautiful as if she'd just stepped out of a band-box.
Yes, she is.
Beautiful.
May I have your gloves?
Yes .. oh, my gloves.
The duck smells delicious.
We thank thee Lord for the bounty we are about to receive and ask thy blessing.
Oh .. oh!
What is it, aunt Etta?
>> You might as well face the situation.
Ann forgot to light the oven under the duck.
For the sandwiches we are about to receive ..
We thank thee oh Lord and ask for thy blessing.
I wish I could stop lying to my diary.
You saved a little boy from being run over today.
No, but it makes good reading.
That sounds like Thea,
It is.
I'm dying to know what's happened.
─ So am I.
Thea came home.
─ Hey ladies, wake up!
Emma, how do you spell "intoxicated"?
I.N.T.O.X.I.C.A.T.E.D.
Emma, Anne!
For heaven's sake, she'll wake up the whole family.
I've got something to tell you.
I've got something to tell you.
─ What?
Whats happened?
─ It has happened.
Tomorrow at Tiffany's. A ring.
It must be a 100 carats.
For Pete's sake Thea, what happened? What did he say?
Well, I was looking so beautiful in Emma's dress.             ─ Yes.
And your hat .. and your coat.
─ Well, what did he say?
"Thea" he said .. oh,
I go to phone him ..
What did Ben say?
He said .. all I am, all I ever hoped to be ..
Oh, I'll tell you later.
Ask Ben if he minds being a bigamist. I want a ring, too.
Aunt Etta!
Aunt Etta.
Emma.
─ Yes?
Do you think she really loves him?
She's going to marry him.
I mean, do you think she loves him as much as she loves us?
Well, it's a different kind of love, Ann.
You mean a stranger could come here and mean more to me than Dad or aunt Etta?
More than my own sisters? More than you?
Oh, you're certainly not very worldly-wise.
Oh, Ann.
Emma.
Don't lets get married, ever.
Let Thea and Kay if they want to, but not us.
We'll grow old together.
Beautifully, gracefully.
Wait and see. We'll both look just like Whistler's mother.
Yes, but if we don't get married, how can we look like anybody's mother?
You'll feel a lot differently one day.
You're a lot younger than I am.
Five years. What's that?
And I practically brought you up.
Why, didn't I have mumps and chicken pox and measles when you did?
I was your companionship.
You little wretch. You gave them to me.
No. I shared them with you.
Oh ..?
─ Emma.
Look at me.
─ Why?
You haven't met anyone? I mean ..
You're not holding out on me are you?
No, apparently I'm headed for the shelf.
The Lemp family is going to have one old maid.
Two .. and we'll have a cat.
A tortoiseshell one.
We'll call it Bathsheba.
Mehetabel?
Topaz, because it will have yellow eyes.
And the longest, most gorgeous tail.
Wait a minute.
Don't make it too beautiful.
We want her to be an old maid, too.
Hey!
Hello.
What's the big idea?
Is this your gate?
I've an interest in it, yes.
It isn't much good for swinging.
You know that, don't you.
Well, you have a nerve. I've swung on it for 18 years. It's done right by me.
Evidently my standards are much higher.
The fault lies with you not the gate.
You don't know how to swing on gates.
I don't know how to swing on gates?
─ No.
Ridiculous.
No leverage. That's your trouble. Mind if I show you?
Not all all. After all, its your gate.
Alright. Now, watch this.
The way to do it.
Hmm.
─ See?
Say, that is good.
Is this how you do it?
Almost.
─ Almost, huh?
Now, a little more pressure on the ball of your foot and you've got it.
There, that's it. Now you've go it.
This is the third or fourth or maybe the fifth happiest day of my life.
Oh, excuse me.
Of all things ..
Hello, Mrs Richfield.
─ How do you do?
This is mister ..
─ Deitz .. Felix Deitz.
Old friend of the Lemps.
This is Mrs Richfield.
How are you, Mrs Richfield?
─ I'm fine, thank you.
And Mr Richfield?
Why, he's fine, too.
How is his back? Better?
Much better.
─ I'm so glad to hear it.
Goodbye, Mrs Richfield.
Well, of all the ..
How do you know Mr Richfield?
First time I ever heard of him.
But I don't understand. How did you know his back was bothering him?
Oh, well Mrs Richfield ..
Looks like a woman whose husband
would have trouble with his back.
Mrs Capper.
There is a young man with .. Ann Lemp
Say, what is this "old friend of the family" business?
A slight exaggeration.
You see my father was a very good friend of old Mr Lemp.
I'm his daughter. He's not so very old.
Oh, so you are Miss ..?
─ Ann
Ann the gate-swinger.
─ Well, Ann.
In this pocket I've a letter to your father. In this pocket ..
If fact, he's quite young-looking.
>> Granted, but what ..?
Right now he's down at the Foundation.
He works there as Dean of the faculty.
In fact, he's one of the youngest looking Deans they've ever had.
I'm sure he must be.
This happens to be a letter to the President of the Foundation.
Could you possibly direct me?
Why yes, it's down one block.
An there on the corner you'll find it.
─ the Foundation? Thank you.
No, the traffic officer's booth.
You can ask the policeman where the Foundation is. He'll tell you.
Thank you again.
─ You're welcome.
I must be stuck.
Goodbye.
─ Goodbye.
Oh, by the way.
What have you for dinner tonight?
─ Lamb chops. Why?
That will do very nicely.
Nobody invited you for dinner.
─ Your father will. I'll see to that.
Au revoir.
See you for dinner then.
Goodbye, Mrs Richfield.
Well, I ..
There is no reason to set the extra place, Ann. He won't be here.
I've seen him. He'll be here.
He'll not only be here.
But he'll tell us where to sit.
Monopolize the conversation, do the carving, say the grace.
And help himself to a second portion of dessert.
That's my impression of Mr Deitz.
And my impression of your impression is that Mr Deitz sells vacuum cleaners.
Well, whatever he sells, you'll buy it.
─ Oh no.
I'm completely won over.
Kay, may I use your face powder?
─ You may not.
I'm won over too.
I'm going to be the beauty tonight.
I refuse to be disturbed out of my usual calm.
I shall devote myself exclusively to my lamb chop.
You had better.
Don't forget, you're engaged.
By the way girls, what's he look like?
>> Well, he's ..
What's that?
That is Mr Deitz.
Would you like a try?
Your father was a great musician and a great man.
What would he say to these antics?
>> My father would help me to swing.
Your daughter would approve it. Bah.
I tell you this modern music won't live.
Now Beethoven, he has lived.
And will live for hundreds of years on every opera stage, every concert hall.
Opera stages, concert halls.
Do you call that living?
You and your jazz and your swing. Bah!
Now, promise me you won't say "bah" again.
Alright, I promise you.
Bah.
I've got ..
Something is wrong here.
Father. Why, hello there.
Well, we thought you'd never get home.
How is my handsome Dad?
Did you have a hard day, dear?
Something is still wrong.
Hello, Deitz.
─ Hello, Lemp.
Father dear, won't you ..
Girls, this is Felix Deitz.
He is a blasted young pup.
He prefers jazz to the classics.
He is arrogant, disrespectful, argumentative, conceited ..
He .. and I like him.
I forgot to say I've no talent whatever.
You told me that all the way home.
I can see that just by looking at you.
I'm Thea.
You look talented to me.
─ Thank you.
What do you do?
─ I compose.         ─ Oh.
I'm Kay.
─ How do you do.
How do you do .. what do you compose?
Trash. If he'd only listen to Beethoven ..
Modern tone-poems, I call them.
And I think so little of Beethoven, I wouldn't even bother to steal from him.
No, you promised me faithfully you wouldn't say "bah" again.
Bah.
I'm Emma. Positively the last sister.
I'm very glad to know you, Emma.
─ I'm very glad to know you.
Go head, produce more.
I'm not in the least bit tired.
Excuse me.
I thought you said there were no more sisters.
Come and meet the youngest.
─ Delighted.                ─ Etta.
This is Felix Deitz, son of my old friend.
This is aunt Etta.
─ How do you do.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Not only the youngest, but the most charming.
You embarrass me.
Aunt Etta. I'll sit by you at dinner and we'll hold hands under the table.
In other words, I'm just your type.
─ Exactly.
Flatterer.
I'm flattered to be with such a lovely family.
Adam.
He's the brightest thing to come into the house since the electric percolator.
There is no hope for it. I'm afraid you'll have to see quite a lot of him.
You know the President of the Foundation?
─ Yes.          >> Hard-boiled, isn't he?
Well it took this young man here, just 7 minutes ..
To talk himself a job at the foundation.
Ten minutes. I timed it.
─ It included introductions and goodbyes.
That means you must live in Briarwood, doesn't it, Mr Deitz?         ─ It does.
Oh, we all want you to feel free to come and swing on our gate any time you like.
The emotion chokes me.
Well, this calls for a special celebration.
Emma, put the best silver on the table.
─ We did, Etta.
And the dinner napkins with the monograms.
They're on the table. I put them there just on Ann's description.
Oh .. well ..
Do you know Mr Deitz that those napkins and that silver have not been used.
Not once .. not even when the
Mayor was here for dinner.
I'm honored.
─ Yes.
Thanks, Lemp.
─ That's alright, Deitz.
Home-made blackberry.
─ Oh.           ─ I made it.
Well .. where are you going to live?
I hadn't thought about that yet.
There's a hotel in town, sort of small.
─ And mangy.
I don't think you'd like it.
Well, there are a couple of nice rooming houses.
Suppose we discuss this after dinner.
In the meantime, my lamb-chops are getting cold.
A very good idea.
Aunt Etta, here's what we'll do.
Suppose you sit over there by me.
Right over there. Miss Kay, we'll put you right in this chair.
Oh no, that's specially reserved for gate-swingers.
Miss Emma. I think you'll be comfortable right over here beside aunt Etta.
Miss Thea, a very special seat for you here.
There. Isn't that better?
I suppose you have no objection to my sitting in my customary chair, have you?
Not at all, sir. Make yourself at home.
─ Thank you, sir.
Well, what did I tell you, girls?
I'll tell you a secret.
Diary.
I like him.
Look.
Over the hills.
That is, I meant to say there's ..
There's some beautiful rhododendrons.
I thought maybe we could walk over ..
We can't right now, Ernest. I've got to finish mending Felix's sweater.
The moths have declared a vendetta against him.
Oh look, my button.
I saw that Ernest, and it won't do you a bit of good.
Oh, this is gorgeous.
Beautiful. Simply beautiful.
I wouldn't mind building right on this spot.
And you could buy it for a song.
Put the house right over there facing the creek. In your name, of course.
Subdivide it and give it a fancy name.
I'll bet I could make a pretty penny.
Darned if I wouldn't consider it, too.
If you'd only name the day for the wedding.
Thea, it's almost June.
Doesn't the idea of being a June bride intrigue you?
Let's leave it to the fall. I promise you I'll be much more definite then.
What's the verdict? Does he love you or does he love you not?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Why, haven't I told you that?
Yes.
Etta, what's cooking?
─ Barley soup.
I don't like barley soup.
Felix likes it.
Hey Felix.
─ What?
Come here.
What is it?
Do something about the sun, won't you. Its in my eyes.
Why not put your hand over your eyes?
You do it. I don't want to pamper myself.
See, that's all there is to it.
Is that better?
That's good.
Hey, Emma.
Excuse me a minute. You do it a while.
I'll fetch that bucket.
─ I can manage.
You can carry it back when it's full.
That's the idea.
Here we are.
─ Here, give it to me.
Why is it no musician can ever make a decent knot in his tie?
Because a musician is ..
Let me fix it.
Alright.
Say, you've got a steady job fixing my tie.
That is if you can take time off from your cooking and sewing and cleaning.
Sounds like interesting work.
I'll find the time.
Thanks.
Well, I suppose we're holding up aunt Etta.
She must be waiting for the water.
We'd better get back.
I'll take it.
You look positively radiant, Emma.
That's because the sun is shining and the flowers are in blossom and ..
Kay loaned me her face-powder.
Hey!
All this bunk you read about druids living in trees and loving it.
I'll take the Lemp home any old time.
It's not drinking water, Ann.
─ Who's afraid of a little typhoid?
Oh no you don't.
Deitz, I don't like your tie straight.
─ Cut it out. Emma fixed it.
That's a lot better.
─ You look better with hair mussed.
Oh you want a fight, do you?
Come on, I'll take you on.
Say.
Somebody had better go to the stand and get some more hot-dogs.
Father has made a way with the dust.
I'll go on my bike.
─ I'll race you there.
I bet I can beat you with only a pedal and one foot.
Get me a case of beer!
Hey, what's holding you back?
You got an anchor on your wheel?
A slow starter. Watch me on the stretch.
Look out!
You see, things were quiet until you came to live with us.
There is something about you that always sets people laughing.
There's an effect you have, too.
Yeah, what?
─ You do something to a room.
The minute you enter it, it lights up.
Who, me?
─ Yes.
Maybe an Edison has an explanation for it but I can't understand it at all.
Somehow, what happens to that room is transferred to me.
I glow, too.
I haven't noticed it.
Oh, it's an inner glow.
The expensive kind.
We're a great combination, aren't we. Light and laughter.
Yes, but we can't have one without the other.
If you don't light up, I can't laugh.
Vice versa.
So we two ..
We should never be further apart than a stone's throw, should we.
I'll vote for that.
─ Ann.
I don't know whether this fits into the conversation or not, but ..
Your eyes are very beautiful.
If fits.
Ann.
Holy smoke, the hot-dogs. We left a whole family starving back there
And there's a few members of the family that I'm very fond of.
Wait a minute.
Here's a little memento
I picked up for you.
Oh Felix! That's darling.
It's nothing. Just a little trinket.
It isn't worth very much.
One of the charms says "I love you".
I hope you like it.
Thanks.
─ Oh, don't thank me.
Just promise me we'll go back slowly.
I promise.
Gee, I'll bet they'll be starving.
Felix. Felix, now stop it.
Stop it, you hear me?
Felix, listen to me.
Listen. I don't mind you wasting your time but don't waste it on my piano.
First prize is a thousand dollars.
I'll use it to buy you a new piano.
You'll win first prize will you, with this collection of cat-calls?
Come on, you've got a class to teach at 3 o'clock.
There is still half an hour.
I'm waiting for Mickey Borden.
Who's he?
─ A piano player I picked up.
Going to help me orchestrate my compositions.
It's criminal wasting another person's time on this abominable ..
It's not exactly a waste of time. Mickey is out of a job now. I can use him.
Tell him from me.
That orchestrating this stuff is one step lower than being out of work.
Will he be here soon?
He's an hour late now, but he may not be here for a week.
In fact he may not get here at all.
─ I was un ..
I was under the impression that only trombone players drank.
Mickey doesn't drink.
He's just a little ..
Well, unpredictable.
─ Well, I'm very glad to hear it.
No completely sane person could do a good job on that stuff
Furthermore ..
I'll see you at the Foundation.
[ Doorbell ]
I'll get it.
Is this ..?
It is. Come in, Mickey.
We're waiting for you.
I've been struggling with this opus for days.
Say, you're going to find this arrangement right up your alley.
A rug on the floor.
A smell of cooking in the kitchen, piano and flowers.
It is homes like these that are the backbone of the nation.
Where's the spinning wheel?
─ Shut up.
Did you miss the train?
─ I ignored the train.
I thumbed my way up.
─ Why? I gave you enough for the fare.
Well, I bet the four dollars on a horse I could have bought for seven.
It had a lovely name, Felix, that
I can't for the life of me remember.
This time of day there's a lot of traffic from town. You shouldn't be late.
Oh, I had lots of offers from small fry.
Fords, Chevies, but I held out for a town car.
It's a poor man's privilege.
Well, I have to get over to the
Foundation. A class from 3 to 4.
Suppose you get a room here for a few weeks until we're through.
Save you a lot of travel.
That's alright with me.
I was evicted this morning.
I'm going to miss those cobwebs.
Well, look over this first movement. I'll be back after 4 and we'll get you a room.
Just so it's the other side of the rail tracks. I can't breathe this clean air.
Say, there's a lady in the kitchen.
Introduce yourself to her.
The name is "aunt Etta".
─ I know the type.
See you later.
I thought it didn't sound like Felix playing.
As far as I know, you may be a burglar and have designs on the piano.
According to Felix, I'm supposed to introduce myself.
Mickey Borden.
I guess you are aunt, aunt something-or-other?
Etta.
─ Etta.
Yep.
The name fits right in with those curtains and that hob. Domestic.
My name came first. Then the curtains.
What type of aunt are you?
A rough voice hiding the soft heart?
Or are you ..
The "sweet-simple land-sakes-alive
I-smell-something-burning"aunt?
Felix should have prepared me for you.
How about a cup of tea?
─ Sure.
May I throw in a couple of cakes?
How did you know I hadn't eaten since yesterday morning?
I'm the "near-sighted-you-can't hide-a-thing-from-me" type of aunt.
I see.
Well you needn't look so noble.
Tea is only a little hot water.
I'll go and put the kettle on. I'll let you know what I think about you later.
Hello, aunt Etta.
─ Hello, dear.
You're home early, aren't you?
Yes, I couldn't finish my lesson.
Steven Spratt broke his violin.
Oh isn't that too bad. Did he drop it?
That's what I claim but he says I threw it at him.
This is my niece, Ann.
Ann, this is Mickey.
Mickey something-or-other.
Borden.
Borden?
The name just goes with that shirt and tie.
He's a friend of Felix, I think.
We just know each other.
I'm orchestrating his composition.
I was going to make
Mr Borden a cup of tea.
Just a little hot water.
Get set. You're in for something.
Got a cigarette?
Why yes.
Here you are.
Cork tipped, no less.
You've scared it. It always behaves that way in front of company.
Oh, just keep on playing.
You know, I read someplace, that the invention of the cigarette lighter ..
Increased the use of matches a thousand percent.
I laughed when I read it.
You could have at least smiled.
Say, is that part of
Felix's composition?
Something of my own.
─ Why, it's beautiful.
It stinks.
You are probably right.
I was only making conversation.
Still, I hope you're not entering it in the competition.
You know, round these parts, we want Felix to win.
I couldn't enter it if I wanted to.
It's only got a middle.
You only wrote a middle?
─ Just a middle.
Oh, no beginning, no end?
You think that's right to leave a song dangling in midair with no face or feet?
Why not?
Well for one thing, a full bodied composition may easily win first prize.
I wouldn't win first prize if I were the only entry in the contest.
Mathematically speaking,
I think you'd stand a fine chance.
You think they'd let me win?
Of course.
Say.
The fates, the destinies, whoever they are that decide what we do or don't get.
What do you mean?
They've been at me now nearly a quarter of a century.
No let up.
First they said, let them do without pianists.
They'll get along.
Then they decided.
He doesn't need any education.
That's for sissies.
Then right at the beginning, they tossed a coin..
Heads he's poor. Tails he's rich.
So they tossed a coin .. with two heads.
Then for the finale, they got together on talent.
Sure they said. Let him have talent.
Not enough to let him do anything on his own. Anything good or great.
Just enough to let him help other people.
It's all he deserves.
Well, you put all this together, and you've got Michael Bogart.
Bogart?
>> That's the name I was born with.
I thought if I changed it, I'd throw them 'em off the trail.
Didn't work.
Of course, you know you've been very silly.
Who asked you to listen?
Sorry.
You are insulting a person who believes that a man decides his own destiny.
Who believes that if a man has enough courage and enough ambition ..
I guess I deserved that.
But I know enough of music to know that if you finish your composition, you'd ..
I tell you they won't stand for my winning.
They are up there, working overtime against me.
What some people will do for time and a half.
Here, have another cigarette.
We won't talk about it anymore.
I can see it is a painful subject.
Ha .. it's my favorite subject.
Talking about my tough luck is the only fun I get.
But ..
Oh,aunt Etta, help.
I can't cope with him.
Were you laughing just then?
─ Huh?
Were you laughing?
─ Oh yeah, I think so. Why?
I wish you'd do me a favor.
─ What?
Throw your head back and just laugh.
Why?
─ No reason. Just laugh.
I knew I was right.
You don't know the first thing about laughter.
I see the sort of thing I'm up against.
The gay-young-thing type.
An unimportant species.
It isn't the quality of your laughter I'm complaining about. It's your attitude.
Attitude?
Yes, when I wanted you to laugh just then you wanted to know why you should.
As if a person had to have a reason to laugh.
Someday I'll give you a talk on the difference between a laugh and a giggle.
Oh aunt Etta, you were right.
I've had enough.
Now then. Cream or lemon?
Neither.
No see here. You're just being purposely contrary minded.
You'll take on or the other.
Quick, now? Which?
Now don't try to be hard-boiled, Etta.
It doesn't come off.
I'm going to have some tea and figure this man out.
Wait until he gets a sandwich.
He won't be so vicious.
Can you read them?
Thea .. Ben .. Felix .. Ann.
Dad .. aunt Etta.
Emma .. Ernest .. Kay.
And .. Mickey.
No.
You deserve better than that.
We cooked the lot in a week.
There. Hows that, better?
You like yourself?
─ You got me grinning like an idiot.
I knew you'd see a resemblance.
Say, were you sneaking round my room yesterday when I was out?
How did you guess? I tried not to leave any fingerprints.
The minute my back is turned you put curtains up on me.
That isn't all. Next time you're out,
I'll slip a few flowerpots on your sill.
No. No flowers.
Why not?
─ Well, they use up all the oxygen.
Hey listen. Get tough and I'll be up the lace pillow cases.
You just tried.
You may object to living like a human being but at least you'll sleep like one.
My landlady has got orders to shoot you on sight.
When I've finished with your room, I'll start in on you.
Just look at yourself.
─ What's wrong with me?
Your hair is reaching for the ceiling, your tie is at half mast, and ..
Mickey, there is something about the
State of New York I want you to know.
Huh? What?
Well in the State of New York it is strictly constitutional to have ..
A crease in the pants.
Tonight is Dad's birthday party.
I think a pair of pressed pants would add the right touch to the celebration.
I'll think about it.
I've got to go in town and buy Dad a present.
In the meantime, how about doing a little work on your own composition?
Ah .. shut up.
Think what a kick it would be to those destinies of yours  ..
If you run off with first prize.
What if I do win?
Oh, here it comes again.
My picture in Life, a new suit and hullabaloo.
And one morning, I'm walking down the street minding my own business ..
When a bolt of lightning with my number on it follows me round the corner and ..
Out like a light.
─ Oh, Mickey.
Yup. That's the way I'm leaving this world: lightning.
I'll give odds.
Somewhere Mickey, is a straight-jacket with your number on it. Just waiting.
Come here and you can lick the spoon.
Why, Mickey.
I don't want you to think that this is a spur-of-the-moment kiss.
I planned it for a week.
Pretty mild for a start.
Just a friendly kiss.
We're going to be great friends, aren't we.
Yeah .. I'll work at it.
In fact we'll be such great friends ..
That we won't have to give each other anything for Christmas.
And don't let anyone tell you I haven't done wonders for your smile.
Well, I've got to go now. I'm late.
Hello.
─ Hi.
Were you on the train?
Yes. Relieve me of these packages and I'll show you my ticket.
Don't know how I missed you. I walked through the train on the chance ..
I sat up with the engineer.
We're old friends.
I see.
And whose hand was on the throttle when we rounded that horseshoe curve?
Mine.
─ Congratulations.
For just one moment I thought we weren't going to make it.
So did the engineer.
Seems I picked the wrong time to powder my nose but I'll know better next time.
You won't take this personally, I hope.
But hereafter I'll take the bus into town.
Oh, I know the bus driver.
We're old friends, too.
Well, there is still the bicycle.
Well, we'll walk.
I love you, Ann.
─ What did you say?
I love you.
─ I can't hear you.
I said, I love you.
I won't say it again.
You love me?
─ Yes.
Since when?
Since the moment I first saw you.
You can't be original when you're in love.
Well?
─ Well, what?
That was in the nature of a proposal.
I expect something in the nature of an answer.
Of course I adore you, Felix.
A good start.
But couldn't we go on just the way we are? You know, lots of laughs?
We could be married and still go on laughing.
There have been cases.
I love you, Ann.
I can't swing on a gate and I'm not much good at bundle-carrying, but ..
I'll try to make you happy.
You're this crazy world to me, Ann.
And the crazy world before this and the crazier world to come.
In fact, I love you.
I'll warn you I'll probably laugh at the ceremony.
What do you think I'll be doing?
You're sweet, Felix.
Would you hold these just a moment?
─ Why, sure.
"For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow."
"For he's a jolly good fellow .."
"Which nobody can deny."
"Which nobody can deny."
"Which nobody can deny."
"For he's a jolly good fellow .."
"Which nobody can deny .."
Happy birthday, Dad.
I'd appreciate the sentiment a little more if you were all in tune.
Well I never .. a radio.
A very peculiar radio.
It doesn't play jazz.
We made the down-payment ourselves.
Well, that's how your mother got the piano.
Look, Dad.
A velvet smoking jacket.
Oh, we just threw a few old curtains together.
It will make your old 5-cent cigars look like golden coronas.
Take a glance at all these, Dad.
It looks like a Christmas tree.
Why .. why, look. Toscanini.
Here is my gift, Daddy.
─ Oh.
Many happy returns.
─ Ernest.
Here's something to keep you warm the when you listen to Bach.
I just happened to be passing
Tiffany's the other day.
Tiffany's, Ben.
Why Ben, you shouldn't have been so extravagant.
Tell me, does it yodel?
I don't care. A watch with a Swiss movement ought to be able to yodel.
Here, Dad. We're just bribing you to stay young.
I accept the bribe.
─ That calls for a speech.
Speech .. speech!
Speech.
Well, I ..
This has .. been the happiest birthday.
I shall always remember.
I don's suppose I've got many more birthdays.
Another crack like that, and we'll send you to bed without dinner for a week.
Oh don't mind your father. He's just trying to appear philosophical.
But he hasn't got the beard to go with it.
Come on, let's cut the cake before I flood the place with tears.
I put too many candles on your cake anyway.
Mickey.
You too. Well, that was a kind thought.
I didn't ..
─ Shush.
I got it myself for you.
If you don't mind.
Well, thanks.
That puts me in the class with Ben
Crowley. I know his kind like a book.
He's the "I-sold-papers-when-I was-kid-now-look-at-me", type.
I've got your type neatly cataloged, too.
Any bets?
At any birthday party, you're the sort that always pipes up with:
"I-never-had-a-birthday party-or-got-a-present".
Isn't that right?
You win.
So, to prevent you from making that little speech.
I got you a present myself.
Cufflinks with initials.
Say.
This is no joke.
These are good links.
Well, I always do my shoplifting at the best counters.
Oh!
Here is a customer.
Wonderful.
You made this all by yourself?
─ Absolutely.
In that case, I can't do without you.
We elope tonight at twelve.
That's a date.
─ Sure?           ─ Sure.
While your about it this afternoon, why don't you get a new tie? Look at it.
Oh, it's alright.
Say, you girls are looking beautiful tonight.
You don't look at all like your father.
─ What?
Felix, if I were ten years younger. Oh, bah!
What?
I think he's already guessed.
You think so?
─ Hold this.
Yep, got it.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Everybody listen.
I have a commercial announcement to make.
What is it?
Listen.
─ Go ahead, go ahead.
Felix and I are engaged to be married. Look.
Well, that's wonderful.
─ Well, well, Felix.
So .. you're going to be married.
She swept me off my feet.
─ Ann. Darling.
Aunt Etta.
Gee, isn't that swell.
If we ..?
Say, don't I get kissed?
Why, of course you do.
I think I'm marrying the wrong girl.
─ Oh, you go on with you.
I'm jealous. I have a good slightly-used career I'll exchange for a husband.
Must resemble Felix.
I'd like to add my good wishes. Thanks, Ernest.
I'm glad too, Felix.
Oh, I'm sure you're both going to be very happy.
I feel it in my bones.
─ Thank you, Thea.
When do you two children propose to get married?
Well, as soon as my laundry gets back.
In August sometime.
How about some coffee? I'm not too happy to have forgotten about that.
I'll start it perking.
─ Oh, Emma.
I'll give you a helping hand.
This marriage business isn't contagious, is it?
I don't know whether I should give my daughter to a composer of modern music.
You don't?
─ Just this once, Dad.
Ann .. I think I'll beat you to the altar.
Do you still want me to be a June bride?
I certainly do.
Thea!
Bring on the orange blossoms.
I don't know what to say.
─ Why should you say anything?
June? Then I'll still be here for your wedding, Thea.
But Kay, you'll be here for my wedding, too.
Nonsense, Kay. Where else would you be?
Philadelphia, studying for that scholarship.
And please, I've heard all the jokes about Philadelphia.
But you're going so suddenly, Kay.
Well, I .. I decided it was about time I got serious about my work.
Say.
What has got into my family?
Well, I think I ought to propose a toast.
Come on everybody.
Let's drink to the happy couple.
This is for you, Ann.
Oh, thank you.
Happiness, Ann.
If you'd bury your head in my shoulder ..
There'd be less chance of those people out there hearing you.
I can't help it, aunt Etta.
I love Felix, you know.
Ah,, somebody else will come along.
─ No.
Oh yes they will. In about six months.
That's the usual time.
Now don't contradict me, Emma.
I know all about these things.
Being a spinster.
Emma, Emma!
Emma, you haven't even ..
Why Emma, darling. What's the matter?
Oh you mustn't feel like this.
I'm not going away, I'm going to stay right here with you.
Nothing is going to chance for us, really it isn't.
I know, dear.
It's just that I ..
I bet you thought I'd never marry.
I didn't think I would, either, but we're all going to.
We'll have housefuls of children. All violin players.
Emma, you like Felix don't you?
Of course she does. We all do.
It's just Emma can't get used to the idea of losing the baby of the family.
Any more than I can.
Oh come girls, pull yourselves together and help me with the coffee.
Aunt Etta is right.
I'm just being silly, Ann.
Come on, let's get this ..
─ Emma.
I won't marry him if you don't want me to.
We'll still be the old Lemp girls with our tortoiseshell cat.
No .. no.
There isn't anything I wouldn't do to make you happy, Emma.
Of course, dear. I know that.
Really Ann, they're all going to begin to wonder what's happened to us.
You sure it isn't because it's Felix?
I mean.
You've never seemed to like him as well as the rest of us.
But really Emma he's awfully sweet and such fun.
After we're married, you'll learn to love him.
Ann, stop chattering.
If we don't get some of this coffee in to those people in there ..
Nobody is going to love anybody.
Come along, now.
You take the plates and I'll pour the coffee.
Thank goodness there is one steady hand in the family anyway.
Ooh!
Well, the coffee wasn't any good anyway
And just because I'm .. I'm ..
Well that's no reason I've to stop trying to make a human being out of you.
I'm the girl who brought chintz curtains in your life. I'm not going ..
Must you look so beautiful?
Who, me?
You're getting married. Now a ..
Another dream shot.
If that isn't tough enough ..
But you've got to look like a convention of angels.
Why must the light hit you just right?
If your nose was shining and your eyes dull.
Jehoshaphat .. it would make things easier.
But look at you.
Not a hair on your head out of place.
A girl can't get married without a permanent. It wouldn't be legal.
Nice work.
My congratulations.
They take a guy in out of the cold, give him a look at real family, real people.
The old man, aunt Etta.
They throw Ann in his path and let her get a half-nelson on his heart.
Then .. out in the cold again.
Here is a new lease on the gutter.
Oh Mickey, please listen to me.
─ Nah ..
You always said it was my fault.
I never put up a battle.
Alright. I'm full of fight now.
Ann, no-one else can have you!
I love you. You hear me?
Please, come to your senses.
Okay.
You see, Ann.
The theory is all cockeyed.
It's no use fighting.
I accept the verdict. What's more,
I'll attend the wedding.
My smile will be just as brave as Emma's.
Emma .. why should Emma ..?
Why should Emma?
You mean to say you don't know that Emma is insane about Felix?
Emma in love with Felix?
Mickey, you must be out of your mind.
I guess when you're used to being on the outside looking in ..
You can see a lot of things other people can't.
I don't know what you're talking about.
─ Poor Emma.
That night when you told everybody, I was watching her.
Her face went as white as a sheet.
She ran out the room.
─ No.
When she came back her eyes were red from crying.
That made me feel very close to Emma.
But it wasn't that.
It couldn't have been.
It was because I was getting married. You see ..
Emma and I have always been so close.
Oh Mickey, I don't believe you.
You're only saying it to frighten me.
Go ahead. Get married.
You'd better go home.
People are waiting.
But it isn't true.
You were lying, weren't you?
Yeah.
That's as good a name for it as any.
Well .. I got to go. Got to pack.
Goodbye, Ann.
Allah be with you.
─ Goodbye, Mickey.
You go first.
I want to look after you.
Hey, Emma.
Yes, Felix?
What is this, is it a tie or a canoe paddle? I can't make it out.
When it's in that shape, it's usually called a cravat.
It is?
Isn't it awful what getting married will do to you?
Any other day I'd have a good answer to that.
Well, go to work, Emma.
Whatever it is, tie it for me.
Gosh, I'm jittery.
My fingers have turned to jelly. Feel.
Oh, they're cold.
Say, so are yours.
You know, I should have rented an outfit instead of having it made.
It would have fit better.
How's it coming?
─ Wait a minute
It looks alright.
This is the end of my steady job, isn't it?                        ─ Uhuh.
Say, isn't that a steal from something?
─ And a good one.
Hey .. just leave me enough air to say "I do".
I'm sorry.
Now hold still.
Thanks.
Well, how do I look?
The price tag showing?
─ No, you look very nice.
Striped trousers. Isn't that symbolic?
Here comes the groom .. the dope ..
Her comes the groom ..
You got 3:12?
My watch says 3:08.
What time you got, Adam?
Oh .. 3:15, Ben.
Excuse me.
What you think's happened?
All girls get the fidgets on their wedding day.
She probably took a walk to calm down.
I took a walk on my wedding day.
Whatever possessed the child to do such a thing?
It should take her at least 15 minutes to dress.
What time did you say you had, Adam?
─ I told you, Ben. It is 3:15.
I wonder what the hall clock says.
It says for you to put your watch away and quit acting the pompous fool.
I'm sorry, Thea.
My first wedding.
I could stand a bracer.
[ Doorbell ]
That must be Ann now, Etta.
─ It's just about time.
It's a messenger boy. A telegram.
No. Never mind. I'll get it.
Ah, the wire we've all been waiting for.
Pioneer furniture company.
Congratulations and our furniture sale starts Monday. Easy terms.
Oh, Emma.
Emma, it's for you.
Probably from Kay.
What's wrong, Emma?
What's the matter?
It's from Ann. She's ..
She's married Mickey Borden.
Let me see that telegram.
What does it say?
"Dear Emma, you must break the news to Felix."
"Make him understand that this is for the best."
"I found out just in time to avoid making a dreadful mistake."
"Mickey and I will be married by the time this reaches you."
"Felix will understand and forgive."
Sorry, son.
What are we going to do?
Father.
Ben, why don't you do something?
Don't stand there looking so helpless.
I can't go in and face all those people.
But somebody has got to do something.
I'll take care of it.
I'm sorry Reverend Thompson.
But the family wanted me to speak for them, to you and to their friends.
"Break the news to Felix."
"Make him understand that this is for the best."
"A dreadful mistake."
"Mickey and I will be married by .."
Oh this quiet. It hurts my ears.
Only one in my orchestra now, Etta.
Oh cheer up, they'll all be here for Christmas.
I'm writing to Ann now.
Let's continue, Emma.
But play it louder.
All I ask is a little noise.
Darling.
─ Huh?
You hate vegetable soup, don't you?
No. I kinda like it.
For my sake, hate it.
─ Why?
Well, I just discovered something about myself. I can't make vegetable soup.
Well, could you salvage something from the vegetables?
An omelet, or a stew or something?
I must have done something wrong.
Those vegetables in the pot.
They disappeared.
Well, anyway we can look forward to the
Christmas dinner your Dad's making us.
I read aunt Etta's letter again.
It gets better with every reading.
In the meantime we'll go down to
Joe's Room and get a bite to eat.
What will you do for money?
We spent the last you had on a couple of tickets to Briarwood.
I can get rid of something
I don't need anymore.
Yeah? And after that, what?
Well after that, social security will take care of it.
I'm afraid not.
Although I feel old enough to be eligible.
I can't make any money orchestrating.
I wish there was something else I could do.
Nonsense.
A few gray hairs at your temple and you'd be a wonderful bank president.
Yeah?
I'll bet you'll be glad to get out of this dungeon for a couple of days.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Ann.
After all these months.
Do you still love me?
It's only four months. Sure.
You really do?
Get a notary, I'll sign an affidavit.
You still love me?
You must be crazy.
That's a statement that will get you into the most exclusive insane asylum.
Listen, you wouldn't do so bad yourself on the entrance exam.
Come on, I'm hungry.
I don't see it.
You don't see it?
Now look, you're at the piano, I'm at the drums.
Earl here is doubling on trumpet and sax.
And Sammy is with the fiddle.
I tell you, it's a cinch.
Sure, we can clean up and have a lot of in the bargain.
Say, there is where you have lot fun: South America.
How do you know? You ever been there?
No. But I seen postcards, ain't I.
South America sounds interesting.
Say, what kind of lightning they got down there?
Lightning?
Oh, there must be Lulus.
You know, that's a topical country.
"Tropical". Topical means right now.
Well, was I wrong?
Say, what's so old-fashioned about South America?
What is all this?
Wouldn't mind a change.
What the cost to get there?
Now you listen to me, Michael Bogart.
With or without the missus?
Well ..
No snap judgments, now.
With.
With?
Oh, two or three hundred smackers.
Of course you know that's second class.
Well, that's the end of South America.
I was in Washington a year ago, and walked through the Mint.
That was the first and last time I ever seen three hundred dollars.
Well, you got anything you could hock?
Well, what do you get for wives these days?
Well, she'd bring more than the average.
Thank you.
And if one of my three sisters was a brother you'd all have black eyes.
More coffee?
─ One check.
It's alright. I want to recapture the feel of a walk through the Mint again.
Say, Mickey. Try and dig up the dough, will you. You know we want you with us.
Well.
Goodbye, Mrs Borden.
─ Goodbye.
Oh yeah. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. Come on, Earl,
Yeah, merry Christmas.
Thanks for paying the bill.
─ Sure.
Say .. maybe I can wangle three hundred dollars out of Ben Crowley?
Micky, you'll do no such thing.
>> It'll be a strictly legal wangle.
I promise to pay 6% and promise to sign all the papers he shoves in front of me.
You can't Mickey, you can't.
Why not? He's in the family isn't he?
He sneaked in through marriage. We didn't charge him for it and we don't intend to.
Listen Mickey, unless you promise you won't speak to Ben, I ..
I won't go home.
─ Okay, okay.
I promise I won't ask. I'll go further than that and offer to loan him money.
Here. Have a cigarette.
─ Thanks.
Now it's my turn to ask you something.
These last four months.
Have you been happy?
I've been closer to it than
I've ever been before.
Then, why do you want to go to South America?
Perhaps to give its lightning a chance at me. Only fair.
If you weren't married to me, if I wasn't around your neck ..
You would get there somehow, wouldn't you.
A stowaway or something.
As a matter of fact, two can stow away as cheaply as one.
No, Ann. If I go, I want to go in some sort of style.
What's up?
I'm wondering .. if I found a wallet in the street or something  like that.
I was just wondering if I'd be a big enough of a heel to run out on you.
How are you betting?
Nothing I would do would surprise me.
Make that two.
Here we are.
You stick close to me Ann, will you. I feel kinda funny.
Thanks, Ernest. It was awfully nice of you to meet us.
All I know is I got my orders.
Oh I see, Emma is bulling you even before your married.
Something fierce, but it's a funny thing, I'm thriving on it.
Now wait, Mickey. I want
Ernest to carry all the suitcases.
It puts him in trim to wash the dishes.
─ Yeah, you see what I mean?
Well, you sure have him under control.
Oh this is nothing, Wait until we're married. He'll do he cooking then,, too.
Yeah, but will I eat it?
Let me in on this, Ann.
It looks like a good thing.
Hello, Ben.
May I?
Glad you could get here, Mickey.
─ I'm glad to be here.
Hello Lemp.
Hello, Deitz.
How are you, Ann?
─ Fine.
Well, how's he been since he won the prize?
There is no living with him. He walks about with a check in his lapel ..
And a contract for the Seattle Symphony
Orchestra pinned to his hair.
Shades of Sebastian Bach.
Oh, come along, let's have some Tom and Jerry.
Boy, do I need that. Was it cold.
Merry Christmas.
─ Ann, come and see the Christmas tree
Hello, Mickey. Merry Christmas.
─ Same to you, Felix.
Congratulations on winning the prize.
─ thanks.
Don't forget that your orchestrating helped a lot.
Beethoven did his own orchestrating.
He didn't need any help.
He was a musician.
Christmas cheer, Mickey.
Thank you.
Like some, Felix?
─ Yes, thanks.
Where is Kay? Isn't she here yet?
Poor Kay. Too bad she couldn't make it.
─ We've a surprise for you.
Kay can't get here.
─ Why not?
Well, she couldn't be in Briarwood and sing over the radio at the same time.
Could she?
─ Oh, aunt Etta.
Oh, is Kay going to sing on the radio?
Tonight at 8:30 National Network.
And we've already sent her a wire telling her how wonderful she was.
Isn't that great?
─ Kay on a national hookup?
Well, what have you got to say now?
I haven't a word to say until I've had my dinner.
Dinner? That turkey ought to be ready by now.
Why, Ernest.
That'll cost you two dozen roses.
Well, there's no point in wasting this good mistletoe.
In love and war, surprise is half the battle.
Oh now Ben, don't be silly.
Here is my chance. I've been wanting to kiss you for months.
Lemp, the Latin lover.
Etta, come here.
Now, shoulders back, chin up.
It took a long time but my charm finally got him.
Aunt Etta, dinner is ready.
[ Radio: ]
"The honor of presenting that young lady who won the Foundation scholarship.
"Miss Katharine Lemp.
Miss Lemp will sing .."
"On wings of song."
"How worthy of my dearest."
"Upon the wings of my song."
Not bad. Not bad at all.
You know, with time ..
Adam Lemp, if you don't say right now ..
That our Kay has the loveliest, sweetest, purest voice that's ever been heard.
Of course he thinks so, aunt Etta.
He's just being modest.
Well let him be modest about his own flute-playing, then.
And not about our Kay's singing.
I am too old to change.
Musicians are all like that.
I remember when I was a boy.
There was a musician lived next to us.
He was the most eccentric ..
─ I'll have to be running along.
There is just time enough to make my train.
So soon, Felix?
Yes, sir. I really must.
Why, Felix.
Ernest, his bag.
Alright, alright. I'll get his bag.
You know, I've heard of hen-pecked husbands.
Butt this is the first I've heard of a hen-pecked fiancee.
I'm the youngest.
I'll get his coat and hat.
Felix, I'd like to tell you about that funny musician ..
We'll start with the prettiest.
Goodbye, aunt Etta.
I'm so sorry to have you leave, Felix.
Can't you miss your train?
You know, they'll never believe you're a great musician in Seattle ..
If you get there on time.
Goodbye, Adam.
─ Felix.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Emma.
─ Goodbye, Felix.
Goodbye, Thea.
─ Goodbye.
Come on, Ben. No trouble?
─ No, no. No trouble at all.
I can use the fresh air.
We'll just have to use the car.
We expect a letter every week. A full report.
I'll send press clippings for your Dad's benefit. Make sure he reads them.
Bah ..
I'll hurry Ernest up.
Here you are.
I hope it's your coat.
─ If it doesn't fit, it's mine.
It's plenty cold out. Be sure your scarf is up around your neck.
It's there.
Whoever said "out of sight, out of mind" was a liar.
Probably Shakespeare.
He said everything.
Goodbye, Lemp.
So long, Deitz.
Here you are, Felix.
Goodbye and have a nice trip.
Goodbye, Emma.
─ Goodbye, Felix.
Do you mind if I drive Felix to down to the station? I've something to tell him.
Sure. Go ahead, Mickey.
Just drop me off at the drugstore.
I need some cigars.
I'll walk back. Maybe I can walk off some of this Christmas dinner.
I just thought I'd drive you down.
Right. We ain't much time.
─ I'll step on it.
You  get in. I'll sit on the outside.
I'll get out at the store.
You don't mind?
No, of course not.
─ That's fine.
I asked Ben to let me drive you down because this is the last chance I hat ..
To tell you I'm sorry ..
I messed things up for you
Ancient history, Mickey. Forget it.
Busting things up, that's where I shine.
There is one saving grace, though. I usually end at the bottom of the pile.
How things been going with you, Mickey?
─ No complaints
Working?
─ After my fashion.
Everything is alright, then?
─ Sure.
Saw Jake yesterday.
Talking about you.
He said ..
─ Jake is a bigger liar than I am.
Do me a favor, Mickey.
─ How much do you need?
I've been lucky lately.
Let me lend you a little something, to tide you over.
Say, don't you ever get tired of being a swell guy? It would bore me stiff.
Thanks, Felix. But I cant take it.
Why not?
─ I don't know.
Maybe it's because I'm a new man.
The old Mickey would have taken it.
The old Mickey was no fool.
Well, there is your train.
Porter.
Better hurry. Behind the seat.
All aboard!
All aboard!
So long, Felix.
─ Thanks. Here you are.
Mickey.
─ Yeah?
Here.
Something for Ann.
Use it any way you think will make her happy.
Bye, Mickey.
─ Wait a minute.
Of course it was too bad
Kay couldn't be here.
But then it was so wonderful hearing her voice.                    ─ Yes.
The things we've crowded in since last Christmas.
This time last year Thea wasn't married, you weren't married.
Kay hadn't won her scholarship,
Felix hadn't won his prize.
Oh, we didn't even know Felix then.
Emma, I've got to know.
What?
You and ..
And Felix. I thought you were in love with him.
I was.
I guess we all were.
But looking back, that day you were to marry Felix I thought that if ..
The world should come to and end now, it would just be an anti climax.
I know better now.
And I really owe it all to you, Ann.
To me?
You see .. if you'd married Felix.
I suppose I'd have gone on all my life ..
Thinking I'd missed my prince charming on his white horse.
And when when your telegram came, everyone just went to pieces.
That is, everyone but Ernest.
Ben, who blows the loudest trumpet, he couldn't do a thing.
I'll never get over the way Ernest took hold.
He was so quiet .. capable.
So dignified.
Well, that started it.
Now I can't imagine life without me ordering Ernest around.
And if ever Ernest gets to ordering me around, that will be alright, too.
Funny how long you can be around people and not know how much they mean to you.
Take you and Mickey for instance.
Gracious, Ann. You're not crying about a broken plate?
You don't have to, it isn't ours.
We borrowed it from Mrs Ridgefield.
It isn't ..
It's just being home and everything.
Ann.
If you're going to ask me if I'm happy, I am.
That never entered my mind.
Mickey has done everything to make me happy.
He's trying very hard.
─ Of course.
[ Scream! ]
Thea, please, please.
Thea, what's wrong?
─ What's happened, Thea?
It's Ben. He's had an accident.
I cannot hear you. Shush.
St Joseph's Hospital?
Alright, I'll bring his wife with me.
Is he badly hurt?
I'm afraid so. My car is outside.
We'll go with you, Thea.
Poor Ben.
I didn't make him happy.
I didn't even try.
Thea, you mustn't.
He's always been so kind and generous and I never showed any appreciation.
Ben will be alright. It isn't too late.
You'll have a chance to make it all up to him.
But suppose .. suppose he is.
Oh Thea, please. You mustn't.
Thea, it's not Ben.
Ann, it's ..
Mickey?
─ Hmm.
He was driving Ben's car.
Is he hurt badly.
Mickey.
Mickey.
Ann.
More of their work.
They wouldn't even let me go out in style.
Don't try to talk.
You'll be alright.
Only lightning couldn't get you.
I have your word for it.
Lightning.
Can be manufactured.
You know.
Oh, Mickey.
I think perhaps it's better if you ..
I know his type.
Got a cigarette?
Could I?
─ Yes, alright.
Cork tipped.
No.
Mickey.
Mickey.
Oh, Mickey.
Oh, Mickey.
[ Rusty gate squeaking noise ]
Hello, Lemp.
─ Hello, Deitz.
You haven't done right by my gate.
Listen to that squeak.
I wouldn't swing on a gate that didn't squeak.
Why is it women hate to use an oilcan?
Why do men smoke smelly pipes?
It isn't the pipe.
It's the tobacco.
Stonewall Jackson cut plug?
─ Right.
I've chewed it for years.
I've smoked it for years.
It has like an intensity.
Ann.
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.
What am I doing on this side of the gate?
Say, this is where we came in.
Yes.

The Three Penny Opera had its film premiere in Berlin on February 19, 1931.
It was restored in 2006 for the film's 75th anniversary from the original negative in the German Federal Film Archives.
You gents who
to a virtuous life would lead us
And turn us
from all wrongdoing and sin
First of all
see to it that you feed us
Then start your preaching
That's where to begin
THE THREEPENNY OPERA
All you who love your paunch
and our propriety
There's one thing
you must finally realize
No matter how you try
to twist and turn it
First comes the grub
Then you can moralize
There must first be a chance
for all now poorly fed
To get their slice
Of life's great loaf of bread
How does a man survive?
How does a man survive
By daily cheating
Mistreating, beating others
Spitting in their face
Only that man survives
Who's able to forget
That he's a member of
The human race
Gentlemen
This truth you cannot shirk
Man lives exclusively
By dirty work
Mackie!
The shark has teeth
There they are
for all to see
But the knife
that Macheath carries
No one knows
where it may be
On a blue
and balmy Sunday
On the strand
a man's lost his life
A man darts
round the corner
People call him
Mack the Knife
And Schmul Meier
Is still missing
One more wealthy man removed
Somehow Mackie
has his money
And yet nothing
can be proved
Jenny Towler was discovered
With a knife stuck in her chest
Mackie strolls
along the dockside
Knows no more
than all the rest
Seven children
and an old man
Burned alive in old Soho
In the crowd stands
Mack the Knife
Who's not asked
and doesn't know
And the widow
not yet twenty
She whose name
All could say
Defiled one night
as she lay sleeping
Mackie, what price did you pay
Defiled one night
as she lay sleeping
Mackie, what price did you pay
Excuse me, ladies.
Care to step inside for a drink?
I don't want to be disturbed tonight.
Is Mackie inside?
- How about you and me, Jenny?
- Stop it!
Let the lady go.
Lady?
What lady?
You mean me?
Worry about your own wife!
She's gone off with another guy!
Say hi to Mackie for me.
The best dancer in Soho.
Places on the dance floor!
A full bridal outfit.
In brocade.
Orders from the captain.
He's getting married this morning at 10 past 2:00 in warehouse number 3 in the shipyard on the Thames.
Bring the vicar.
A full bridal outfit in brocade.
Complete home furnishings:
A four-poster bed and rugs, and don't forget a grandfather clock.
Deliver this.
Dress properly.
Don't show up looking like this.
I hope this is the last time he gets married.
Deliver this.
Deliver this.
Deliver this.
MR. J. M. BROWN
CHIEF OF POLICE, LONDON
Grab it, will ya?
It's about time!
Confound it!
One burglary after another?
A burglary at Selfridge's?
Now that's something!
And nobody was caught?
They all got away?
Is that all you have to report, gentlemen?
You don't know me very well.
I'm not chief of London police for nothing.
Ten burglaries every night and no one's ever caught?
How can I uphold law and order if you let me down like this, gentlemen?
When I think of the upcoming coronation festivities, I could... -
If the slightest thing should go wrong... -
Come in! ...- you'll see a side of me you've never seen before... -
What is it now?
- We caught a burglar red-handed.
You actually... caught a burglar?
You have him here?
Bring him in immediately!
Now, gentlemen,
I'll show you how you deal with a fellow like this.
Take your hat off.
You were caught red-handed.
You know this will cost you several years.
You know that in such cases
I am ruthless!
...that I am ruthless and unwavering.
Unwavering.
What's that?
Leave me alone with this man, gentlemen.
What have you... -
Very well. You can go.
No, wait!
Hands up... if anyone's there!
Is anyone there?
There's no one here.
We can hold the wedding here safe enough.
- Bill Lawgen
- And Mary Syer
Last Wednesday
man and wife became
As they stood
side by side at city hall
He wondered
where she got the gown and all
While she wasn't
too sure of his name
You see the moon over Soho?
I see it, dearest.
Do you feel my heart beating, my beloved?
I feel it, my darling.
Wherever you go,
I too shall go.
And wherever you are...
I want to be too
And though there's no license
from city hall
And no altar
covered with flowers fair
And though you may not know
where your gown came from
And there's no myrtle
in your hair
Take the plate
on which you eat your bread
Don't look at it for long
Fling it far
Love lasts forever
Or else not at all
No matter where we are
No, no.
Stay a while, Reverend.
Attention, everyone!
It's ten past 2:00!
Hip, hip, hurray!
- Congratulations, Polly.
- Congratulations, Captain.
Congratulations!
Well, you didn't make much of an effort.
Champagne in wine glasses!
Junk!
It's lovely.
Is all this stolen too, Mackie?
Of course.
Pity we don't have our own place for these nice things.
This is pathetic.
All Scotland Yard was out and about.
And where's the grandfather clock?
No grandfather clock?
Pathetic.
My wife is beside herself.
What bunglers!
I'm getting married for once.
How often does that happen?
Reverend!
I'm so happy you could be here on the happiest day of our lives.
Reverend, this is Miss Peachum, who loves me and wishes to share her life with me.
Congratulations, Polly!
Congratulations, Captain!
Reverend!
Won't you honor us by staying?
I've got... a christening.
Hopefully we'll need you for that pretty quick too.
Shut up!
No dirty jokes in the presence of a lady.
And where's that grandfather clock?
Where's the grandfather clock?
Accompany the reverend.
I do apologize, Reverend.
This area's not very safe.
This way, Vicar.
Careful.
Sorry.
I would have preferred it if you hadn't all rushed to the trough.
We could have used a little entertainment.
I'm hungry, Mackie.
Other people always manage that on these occasions.
Will none of you oblige?
Is anyone watching at the door?
Must I see to everything myself?
Gentlemen... if none of you will oblige,
I'll offer up a little song myself.
I once thought
in my innocent youth
And I once was
as innocent as you
Perhaps I too
would have a suitor one day
Then I must know what to do
And if he's rich
and if he's nice
And if his collar
is white as snow
And if he knows
how to treat a lady
Then I shall tell him no
Then you hold your head up high
And don't let your feelings show
Sure, the moon
will shine all night
But the boat on the river
will stay tied up tight
That's as far as you can go
Oh, you can't simply lie back
You must be cold
and heartless as you know
Or else all sorts of things
Could happen
Yes, there's just one answer... - no
The first to come along
was a man from Kent
He was all
that a man should be
The second had
three ships in the harbor
And the third
was mad about me
And they had money
and they were nice
And their collars
were white as snow
And they knew
how to treat a lady
So I had to tell them
No
I held my head up high
Didn't let my feelings show
Sure, the moon shone all night
But the boat on the river
stayed tied up tight
That's as far
as things could go
Oh, you can't simply lie back
You must be cold
and heartless as you know
Or else all sorts of things
could happen
Yes, there's just one answer
No
But then one day
when the sky was blue
Came a man
who didn't bother wooing
He tossed his hat
on the peg in my room
And I no longer knew
what I was doing
Since he had no money
and he wasn't nice
And his collar
wasn't white as snow
Since he didn't know
how to treat a lady
I couldn't tell him no
I no longer
held my head up high
And I let my feelings show
Oh, the moon
shone as before
But the boat cast loose
and drifted from the shore
That's just how it had to go
Oh, then you must
simply lie back
Oh, you can't be
cold and heartless, you know
Oh, it simply had to happen
There was no such word as
No
Very nice!
Funny!
The missus can sure sing a song!
Very nice!
It wasn't "nice," you idiots!
It's not nice, it's art!
That was wonderful, Polly.
Too good for this trash.
Bad news!
It's the sheriff himself!
Hello, Jackie!
Hello... Mackie.
Dear old Mackie, couldn't you have done this someplace else?
Did you have to take over somebody's warehouse?
It's burglary, Mackie... - another burglary!
Jackie, I'm delighted you've come to your old frienƒès wedding.
My pleasure, my pleasure.
My heartfelt congratulations on this occasion.
Now don't be angry, but I must get back to work.
Polly?
This is
Tiger Brown.
- Chief of London police.
- Mackie, please!
Where haven't we been together?
India, the Sudan, in a hundred battles.
This is Polly.
The former Miss Peachum.
Peachum?
Did you say Peachum?
Is this old Peachum's daughter?
You're making off with old Peachum's daughter?
That takes courage!
Why courage?
She's the daughter of London's beggar king!
My dear lady, it's been delightful, but I must be going.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Brown.
Good-bye, Mackie.
I must get back to the office.
The queen's coronation is coming up, and if anything goes wrong,
I'll be held responsible.
I shudder to think what could happen to me, so I must be going.
Just a moment.
Does Scotland Yard have anything on me in their files?
On you?
Not a thing!
It's all taken care of.
Good-bye, Mackie.
What an awful ladder!
Perhaps next time you might choose a nicer warehouse.
- So that was Tiger Brown?
- Yes.
We have connections with the highest authorities.
Captain, now comes the best part.
- What is it?
- Another little surprise.
Bill Lawgen and Mary Syer
Last Wednesday
man and wife became
Three cheers for the happy couple!
As they stood
side by side at city hall
He wondered
where she got the gown and all
While she wasn't
too sure of his name
You've seen the courtship and marriage of Polly Peachum.
Now I'll show you the power of the beggar king,
or as he calls himself,
"the poorest man in London."
Anyone wishing to take up a beggar's trade in London must have a license from
Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum & Co.
Twenty schillings.
Ten, Mr. Peachum.
Twenty. And 50% of your weekly earnings.
But Mr. Peachum...
I have nothing.
Mrs. Peachum!
Number 314.
Baker Street district.
Get him some clothes.
Outfit C.
Come along, shorty.
My earnings.
What are those?
The five basic types of misery guaranteed to move the human heart and induce in a man that unnatural state in which he willingly parts with his money.
Outfit C.
- Can't I have Outfit A?
- No.
That's the young man of good family who's seen better days.
But I've seen better days myself.
No one will believe your real suffering.
Complain of a real stomachache and you'll only annoy them.
Enough questions.
Just get dressed.
Please forgive me.
Hurry it up, shorty.
I can't stand here holding your trousers till Christmas.
Next.
P-p-please,
I have money for a new co-co-co... -
Polly!
Tell Polly to come down right away.
How many times have I told you that a gentleman must have freshly laundered rags?
Holes are to be burned in and stains made with candle wax.
Those with means to pay are entitled to a uniform that ensures the pity of their clients.
What's that?
Your share of my take.
- Is that all?
- With this stump?
I'm lodging a complaint!
This place is a pigsty, and this is a lousy stump!
There, my friend.
Now you can go work for a living.
Mr. Peachum!
Thugs! Thieves!
Next, please.
...a new co-co-costume!
Where's Polly?
I'll get her myself!
Let her sleep!
- Sleep? At this hour?
- Dear God!
Polly didn't come home?
Good morning!
G-g-good... m-m-morning!
What?
A cane with an ivory handle?
Mack the Knife!
Dear God!
Good morning.
Crook's trollop!
Help me undress.
You'll divorce him!
I love him.
How can I divorce him?
I'll tan your behind!
It won't do any good.
Love is greater than a tanned behind.
That's what we get for spoiling her with dresses, hats, gloves, and parasols!
Mack the Knife! My honest business and a common crook!
Hanging him's the only solution.
Hanging him?
You and your ideas.
Turn him in to the police.
- I don't know where he is!
- I do.
Where?
With his whores in Turnbridge Alley.
I'm very sorry, but there's nothing the police can do.
Really? There's nothing the police can do?
Then what's going to happen to you will be a horrible injustice.
Me?
How so?
How so?
If you don't catch
Mack the Knife and hang him, there'll be a scandal at the queen's coronation that will cost you your job.
An army of filthy beggars will march up to greet the queen.
When they gather before the church by the thousands, it won't be a festive sight.
They're not an attractive crowd.
Not an attractive crowd, eh?
Well, I'll have them run off!
I'll force them to... -
How will it look at the coronation if 2,000 poor cripples must be beaten to the ground?
It will look very bad,
Mr. Brown.
A revolting sight.
You're... you're threatening me!
This is blackmail!
I'll have you taken away,
Mr. Peachum!
Where's my bell?
I'll call to have you taken away if you're ever so impertinent... again.
I'm no criminal.
I'm just a poor man, Mr. Brown.
Look here, Mr. Peachum:
We're all poor men here.
Come, my dear, poor Mr. Peachum.
I'm sure you understand you can only hang a man if you have the man.
You can only arrest a man if you have him.
I can tell you where he is.
A mother-in-law ought to know where her son-in-law can be arrested.
With the ladies in Turnbridge Alley.
The whores in Turnbridge Alley!
What's that?
A man lives by his head
He needs a larger size
Just try it for yourself
Your head
Won't feed a pair of lice
You see, for this existence
Man is never sharp enough
Hence his weak resistance
To its tricks and bluff
So make your little plan
Yes, be a shining light
Then make yourself
a second plan
None will turn out right
You see, for this existence
There's no man
who's bad enough
Still it's nice to watch them
Trying to be tough
Sure, chase your bit of luck
But no need to run fast
Though men always race after it
Luck always runs last
You see, for this existence
Man's demands are just too tough
All his noisy striving
Is self-deluding guff
Item No. 8.
Regarding the safes on Oak Street... only cash is to be taken.
No securities.
Yeah, we're not getting involved in stock fraud.
Jimmy Two... will take command of the explosives convoy.
If he's bumped off, no great loss.
He doesn't bring much in anymore.
You're one to talk.
Just a minute.
Three, four, five gold watches was your take this month.
Not much.
Item No. 9.
Time of the burglary:
8:30, during the coronation celebration.
- Guards will all be at the ceremony.
- And all plastered.
The job's a cinch.
Mackie!
What's the matter?
- You must pack right away.
- Nonsense! What's the matter?
You must leave immediately!
I went to see Tiger Brown, and my father was there too.
They plan to arrest you.
You must pack immediately!
Nonsense!
Come here, Polly.
There's something
I'd rather do than pack.
No, Mackie. Not now.
Brown stood up for you at first, but then he gave in.
Now he says to tell you... -
- What?
There's nothing more he can do for you.
Come now!
I can trust Brown implicitly.
Scotland Yard has nothing on me.
Maybe they didn't yesterday, but today they've suddenly got a whole lot on you.
In Winchester you seduced two sisters, both of them minors.
They told me they were over 30.
Both of them together.
Your father's a fine one.
Is this the thanks I get for marrying his daughter?
Very well.
If I must go, you'll have to take over running the business.
Gentlemen...
I must unfortunately take a little trip.
Now, with the coronation coming up?
Without you, it's like soup without a spoon!
I'm therefore temporarily entrusting management of the business to my wife.
What? A woman?
What about the big bank job?
Shut your trap!
Now, if the bank job goes well, then it's no more picking pockets and street muggings.
It's good-bye to Soho and hello to the big city!
Good-bye, you poor fools.
Good-bye, Captain!
Mackie, don't tear my heart out.
Stay here with me, and let's be happy.
I'm tearing my own heart out, because I must go away, and no one knows when I'll return.
It lasted so short a time.
Is it over then?
Don't forget me, Mackie, in foreign parts.
I won't forget you, Polly.
Kiss me, Polly.
And don't go to those ladies in Turnbridge.
I love only you.
Farewell, Polly.
Farewell, Mackie.
I'm in charge now.
Gentlemen...
I think our captain can depart in full confidence.
We'll pull off that job just fine, won't we, gentlemen?
In first-class style.
Isn't that right... gentlemen?
Well, it's not for me to say, but I'm not sure that at a time like this, a woman is the right man.
Nothing personal, ma'am.
The swine!
You bet it was nothing personal!
Or else the others would have tanned your hide!
Right, gentlemen?
Nothing personal, of course.
She packs a punch, believe me.
Splendid! Our lady captain knows how to find the right word!
Bravo, Polly!
From now on we'll settle accounts every Thursday, gentlemen.
Dismissed.
Jenny, there's someone here to see you.
- Isn't that lovely!
- The queen's coronation gown?
It cost 7,000 pounds.
Imagine the fine underwear a queen can afford.
Why would a queen need fine underwear anyway?
I wonder if Mackie will come by today.
I don't think he'll ever be back.
WANTED!
¬£100 REWARD FOR MACK THE KNIFE
He took away my daughter.
Married her, he did!
Married her?
Last night.
Married her good and proper.
I see.
So if he comes here today, will you signal from the window?
Hey, there! My coffee!
I'll signal.
Good heavens, Mackie!
What are you doing here?
Quickly, now! Mon caf√©
- Haven't you seen the wanted posters?
- Yes, I know.
But Thursday's my day here.
I can't let such trifles disturb my routine.
Hello, Mackie.
Congratulations on your marriage.
Too bad you missed it.
It was A-1.
Jenny, come join us.
Yes, Jenny... come on.
Jenny, read his palm!
Jenny, why that look?
Just good news, please.
Nothing bad.
Mackie... when the coronation bells ring at Westminster, you'll be in a bad way.
My hat and cane.
I'm going.
My jacket!
- Stay, Mackie.
- Who knows when you'll be back.
You can count on it.
Gents, you see me
washing the glasses
And making your beds
without squawking
And you tip me a penny
and I thank you well
And you see my dirty rags
in this ratty old hotel
And you don't know
to whom you're talking
But one day there'll be
a shout at the dock
And they'll ask
"What was that shout?"
And they'll see me smiling
as I wash my glasses
And they'll ask
"What's she smiling about?"
And a ship
With eight sails
And 50 cannon
Will be at the quay
Gentlemen, your laughter
will quickly stop
As walls tumble down
everywhere
The third day will see
the town razed to the ground
Just one ratty old hotel
will survive safe and sound
And they'll ask
"Who's so special that lives there?"
And that night a cry will go up
around the hotel
Folks will ask
"Why was this hotel spared?"
And at dawn they'll see me
coming through the doorway
And they'll say
"So she lived in there!"
And a ship
With eight sails
And 50 cannon
Will lay siege to the town
A hundred men will land
in the bright midday sun
And stealthily step
through the shadows
They'll enter every doorway
Grab every man they see
And clap them in chains
and bring them to me
And ask me
"Which shall we kill?"
And ask me
"Which shall we kill?"
That noon
there'll be quiet in the harbor
As they ask me
"Who is to die?"
And then they'll hear my reply
"All of 'em!"
And as each head falls
I'll say
"Hoppla!"
And the ship
With eight sails
And 50 cannon
Will vanish with me
Jenny, you remember the days before my star rose over this town?
Even though I'm now
Mack the Knife,
I'll never forget you, Jenny.
What more can a gentleman say?
Nothing.
Mackie, you must flee!
You've been betrayed!
Is there still just one way out of this rattrap?
Stop him!
He went out the window!
You were in quite a hurry just now.
I hadn't yet had the pleasure.
Is there someone waiting for you?
She can wait.
I live just over there.
What is it now?
Never mind! Come on!
Peachum!
He got away!
Got away?
His girls helped him escape!
His girls!
Brown is the "girl" in question.
Tiger Brown let his friend get away.
Well, Mr. Brown has "out-Browned" himself.
It's time we start thinking about the coronation parade.
We only just met, and you're already leaving.
Goes with the profession.
Busy, busy, busy.
- Come back soon.
- Of course.
No long speeches.
Time is money.
I'm all yours, gentlemen.
You've seen Mackie's bold and reckless nature.
I'll now show you how, through a loving wife's cleverness, things take a turn that even you wouldn't expect.
The gentlemen of the board.
Gentlemen of the board... one can rob a bank, or one can...
Use a bank to rob others.
...tread the path of a respectable and law-abiding business... as my papa so often told me.
"Polly," he always said,
"Who'd be so stupid as to be a burglar these days when we've got laws?"
And though my husband... -
I mean, our most esteemed managing director... - must hide like a fugitive in foreign parts,
I'm certain he would approve of how we pulled this off!
We bought this quiet, elegant little bank... which will be more profitable than finding a few puny safes... -
To rifle.
Now we'll really get down to business!
Gentlemen, we will remain true to this institution's honorable tradition of building and consolidating the confidence of the pu-pu-public through our integrity and fiduciary trustworthiness.
Bravo! Excellent!
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'd just like to add that our firm can only employ top-quality people.
Street muggings and pickpocketing are for idiots!
Forget the romance of the past!
Life begins in earnest now.
Whoever can't rise to the challenge will be terminated forthwith without remuneration.
Good day, gentlemen.
You can learn a thing or two from her.
This way, Mr. Brown.
Would you like to see him?
- No... for Goƒès sake.
Handle it yourself, please.
Smith... give him something to eat.
A decent meal.
Wine.
Cigarettes too?
Of course!
Wait!
He only smokes cigars.
Give him these.
He won't have time to smoke many more.
Hello, Mackie.
Hello, Smith.
Did Brown have any news for me?
He's very distraught, and just when the coronation parade's coming up.
I say, Smith... you couldn't find any heavier handcuffs?
With your kind permission,
I'd like a more comfortable pair.
Well, we have them in every price range, from one guinea to ten.
All depends on how much you wish to spend.
How much for none at all?
Fifty.
Thanks, Captain.
Now, what would you like to eat, Captain?
What have you got in the canteen?
No, no prison fare for you.
If you'd like, I'll get it from... -
My last supper, eh?
There, Captain.
Now you can move about freely again.
That's for someone else,
Captain.
So, Captain, what would you like for dinner?
Leave it to me if you'd like.
The gentlemen here have always been most satisfied.
DO NOT TURN
A DEAF EAR TO MISFORTUNE
Hello?
Yes, I'll send them right away.
- Group 3 is ready.
- Off you go!
Filch speaking. Good.
The 10th district is ready.
They're to join the fourth at Nelson's Column at 8:00 a.m.
But we've got real cripples.
How can we make it by 8:00?
You must.
VICTIM
OF MILITARY DESPOTISM
The ugliest are to march on the outside... so the noble gentlemen will have a pretty sight to look at.
The royal guard is presenting arms.
Dawn is breaking.
They'll ride right over us!
You've got slingshots.
- What if they shoot?
- Gentlemen!
Gentlemen... at this very moment,
1,432 of your colleagues are marching to pay their respects to the queen.
You too wish to be part of this splendid occasion, you poorest of the poor, who'd long ago have perished in the sewers of Turnbridge if I hadn't spent sleepless nights devising a way to wring a few pence out of your poverty.
For I've shown that the rich of this world have no qualms about causing misery but can't bear the sight of it!
They have hard hearts but weak nerves.
Well, we won't spare their nerves today!
By the thousands we'll tear at their nerves, for our rags do not conceal our wounds!
Gentlemen... do not be afraid!
The queen will not allow cripples to be attacked with bayonets!
Forward!
Stop, Peachum!
Mackie's become a bank president!
Call your people back!
Our Polly's a guest of honor in the stands.
Leave it to me.
Stop!
Back!
Stop where you are!
Back!
Stop! Go back!
Back, all of you!
Stop! Go back!
Come to your senses!
Listen to reason!
So make your little plan
Yes, be a shining light
Then make yourself
a second plan
None will turn out right
You see, for this existence
There's no man
who's bad enough
Still it's nice to watch them
Trying to be tough
I repeat: We must have the remaining ¬£3,000 in cash now!
Without fail!
You understand?
Nervous, gentlemen?
Well, I'm very calm.
But Tiger Brown, our best friend, had him arrested!
That must mean something.
We must get ¬£10,000 in bail to the police chief.
I'll take it!
There's turmoil in the streets.
That's why I'm giving it to our bank's trustworthy servant.
It's 11:00.
Why aren't you at the stock exchange?
Stop!
Turn back!
Listen to me!
Stop!
Using force is pointless!
They'll shoot you down!
Listen to me!
You're marching to your own destruction!
Out of the question!
No visitors allowed here!
Smith, let me go in.
Jenny, I can't be responsible if anyone should see you.
Smith, darling,
I'll only be a second.
I have to see that despicable scoundrel once more.
Mackie and I were close once.
- I know... -
Smith, sweetie, you can come see me tonight.
I really shouldn't!
This slut is all I need now.
- Enjoy your meal, Captain.
- My meal?
No time to put on your face, eh?
You dirty skunk!
How can you even look at me, after all that's happened!
Quiet, you stupid hussy!
Monster! Think I don't know about Suky Tawdry?
Dinner's served, Captain.
Stop that now!
You'll drive the man crazy!
Ah, Smith, my darling,
I love you so.
I'd rather see him on the gallows than in the arms of another.
Oh, Smith, you're such a darling, such a fine, upstanding man.
Jenny, let go!
No, I won't!
So long!
Let me go!
GIVE AND
THOU SHALT RECEIVE
More than 300 beggars are marching towards Piccadilly.
Disperse them!
They broke through the barrier at Baker Street.
The procession's been completely obstructed.
- Arrest them!
- Arrest them all!
Disperse them!
Use clubs if necessary!
Use your clubs!
That's right!
No, you idiot!
They can't club thousands of beggars to the ground... - and on Coronation Day!
You can't be serious!
- What do you want?
- I have bail for Mack the Knife.
What's that?
What do you have?
Bail.
For Mack the Knife.
Mackie?
I mean, Mack the Knife?
Just a moment.
Out of my way.
Hello?
Get me Division C, now!
Hello?
Brown speaking.
Mack the Knife is to be released immediately.
What?
Mack... has... escaped?
Wait!
Now you can go.
Confiscated goods.
Going to the coronation, Captain?
Shut your trap!
I just busted out of jail!
Busted out?
We sent over bail from City Bank for you, our director.
Bail?
For me?
I just told you I busted out!
Really?
Good God!
¬£10,000 shot to hell!
Pipe down! What filthy Soho sewer is my office in now?
What Soho sewer?
City Bank! Piccadilly!
Best part of town!
What? Piccadilly?
City Bank? A real bank?
Yes, sir!
An honest-to-goodness bank!
Take the first right, then the third left.
If you see cops, keep to the left!
No, not right! Left!
I was so worried about you.
They were all after you like bloodhounds.
Did you remember to pretty yourself up every day just as if I'd been here?
All I see are your lips.
I don't hear a word you're saying.
Were you faithful to me too?
You're looking good, Polly.
I'm very pleased with you.
Have you seen the mail yet?
Mackie, don't talk business now.
Kiss your little Polly and swear that you'll never, ever... -
We'd better get dressed.
The coronation celebrations have begun.
The police barrier's broken!
The coronation parade's breaking up!
Crowds of beggars at Westminster!
Pull the shades!
Hello? Anyone here?
Mackie, I'm ruined.
What a scandal!
I'll be sacked!
My days as police chief are over!
Don't worry.
You've come to the right place.
You'll make a great bank director.
How much capital would you like to invest?
Capital?
His bail.
I salvaged it.
Hear that, nitwits?
There's a lesson there.
Come on.
Come along, you old battleship.
Full steam ahead for my whiskey bottle.
Polly... gentlemen... before you stands a man whom the king, in his unfathomable wisdom, elevated high above his fellow men.
And yet this man remained my friend through every storm, and so forth and so on.
But fate moves in mysterious ways.
You all know what I mean.
Today this man comes to me, Mack the Knife, as one friend to another.
There's a lesson there.
Do you remember when you and I were soldiers and served in the army in India?
Yes, Jackie.
Those were the days!
John was there and Jim was too
And Georgie made sergeant
in short order
The army doesn't give a fig
who you are
And they marched us north
to the border
Soldiers live under
the cannon's thunder
From the Cape to Cooch Behar
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
- An unfamiliar race
- Dark or fair of face
They might just chop them up
to make their steak tartare
- Johnny's whiskey was too warm
- And Jimmy thought he'd freeze
- Georgie took them by the arm
- Saying, "Don't desert us, please"
Soldiers live under
the cannon's thunder
From the Cape to Cooch Behar
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
- An unfamiliar race
- Dark or fair of face
They just might chop them up
to make their steak tartare
John is buried and Jimmy's dead
And they shot
poor Georgie for looting
But blood is still blood-red
And the army's still recruiting
Soldiers live under
the cannon's thunder
From the Cape to Cooch Behar
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
An unfamiliar race
Dark or fair of face
They might just chop them up
to make their steak tartare
The poorest man in London and the wealthy Mack the Knife... - shouldn't they join forces?
The poorest man in London is now bankrupt, my dear Peachum, and is just another poor devil.
Today of all days showed me the power of the poor.
With your money and my experience, we can do business, more business than you could ever imagine.
If the poor are so powerful, why do they need us?
Because they don't know that we need them.
Gathered for the happy ending
All and sundry pool their might
When the needed funds are handy
Things will usually turn out right
Though a man
will fight his rival
To fish the muddy depths
In the end
they'll dine together
And consume
the poor man's bread
For some men
live in darkness
While others stand in the light
We see those in the light
While the others
fade from sight
Warden, where does that fellow with the guitar hang out?
Down there, at the other end of the prison.
- I'd like to see him for a while.
- Well, Hart, you know...
I'm the star boarder of this hotel tonight. You're supposed to cater to me.
Yes, I know. But once you leave your cell, according to regulations...
Oh, you can't be too technical at a time like this.
I can't see that it'd do any harm,
Warden.
All right. But just for a minute, remember.
Hart's the name.
Yeah, I know.
I'm glad to meet you, Hart.
Mine's Poole, Larry Poole.
Much obliged for the music.
You sure tease pretty tunes out of that guitar.
Oh, that's not a guitar.
It's a lute, 13th century lute.
Whatever it is, you sure got it locked.
And you got a swell pair of pipes too.
Many's the time I heard you out there in the yard.
It kind of took my mind off things.
The chaplain tells me you're due out of here next week.
Where do you aim to go?
Well, it depends on the wind. You see, with me, when I leave a place...
I get myself a feather and toss it up... and whichever way the wind blows, that's where I go.
Swell. Let me toss the feather for you this time.
Here's a letter I want delivered.
It goes to some people named Smith.
They live somewhere around Middletown,
New Jersey.
I don't know the address.
That's why I can't mail it.
Well, why do you want me to deliver it?
Because you're the only guy around here
I can trust.
Anybody that can sing sappy, sentimental songs in prison... wouldn't double-cross a guy taking his last walk.
It's mighty important that that letter gets to those people.
- Will you deliver it for me?
- Why, I'll be glad to.
Thanks. Gee, that's a load off my mind.
- So long.
- So long.
Okay, folks. Let's go.
Come on, folks.
Six rings for a dime.
A dime, six rings.
Anyone can do it.
Come on, folks, six rings for a dime.
A dime, six rings.
There you are.
Six rings for a dime, folks.
Six rings for a dime.
Step right up and ring 'em and take home a present.
Hold it.
- What are you after?
- Them.
Can't be done.
Here.
Hey, what's the idea?
You see there?
No can do.
- Oh, a wise guy.
- Sister, you see that cop over there?
- Run on over and tell him...
- Now, wait a minute, pal.
Them opera glasses must have gotten there by mistake.
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's your dime back.
My dime? Listen, I've been coming here every day since this carnival opened.
I spent lots of dimes! Hundreds and millions, and I don't want my dime back!
I want those opera glasses!
And those glasses you shall have, unless you want to yell, "Hey, rube."
Well, if she wants them that bad, why, she can have 'em.
There you are, sister.
Thank the nice man.
Thank you, you crook!
Gee, aren't they elegant!
Elegant? They're just the last gasp in binoculars, that's all.
Hey, look. The ground comes way up here.
Look out you don't step on your chin.
- What's your name?
- Larry. What's yours?
Patricia. But my intimate friends call me Sarge.
Sarge. Oh!
Mind if I call you Sarge?
No. You're the most intimate friend
I've got. I'm awfully glad to meet you.
You're not half as glad as I am to meet you. I've been looking all over for you.
Took me almost three weeks to locate you.
Your name is Smith and you live over here on Railroad Avenue.
- How did you know?
- I was by your house this morning.
The people next door told me
I'd find you here at the carnival.
They said to look for a little girl with a red feather in her cap.
Said she had on a brown...
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Oh, no, you don't.
I had to check off 165 Smiths to find you, and I ain't gonna lose you now.
- Are you a cop?
- Do I look like one?
Well, are you an installment collector?
- No, I should say not.
- Then what do you want?
- I got something for you.
- What?
Hadn't we better tell that to the head of the family? Is there somebody else?
My grandpa.
There's just me and Gramp.
I tell you what we'll do then.
We'll tell your gramp.
- If that's okay with you?
- Sure. And you can stay for lunch.
- Gramp's got a nice big ham.
- Why, I'd love to.
Oh, I forgot. Gramp gave me a dime to get a loaf of bread... and I spent it on the rings.
Well, if Gramp can furnish the ham, the least I can do is furnish the bread.
Oops. I'm flat myself.
Madam, I am temporarily without funds.
That's all right. We can eat the ham without the bread.
Oh, we'll get pennies enough for bread.
- Where?
- From heaven.
On a lonely road or sidewalk
It doesn't matter where
I've always felt that I'd walk
Into my love affair
And on that perfect day
I'd say
The breeze runs after you
When you're passing by
It wants to be near
And so do I
The willow bows to you
Forgetting to cry
It waits for your smile
And so do I
All the world's at your command
What wouldn't it do
For one look at you
And I'm that way too
The rose
That you caress
Is willing to die
It loves you so very much
And so
Do I
- Let's do it again!
- Oh, no, Sarge.
You give 'em a little, they throw coins.
Give 'em too much, they throw eggs.
- What do you suppose that means?
- Let's find out!
- Patsy!
- Hey, Sarge!
Wait! Come back here.
- What's this all about?
- That's just what I want to find out.
Come in.
Don't come close to me.
I have a cold.
Okay, I won't.
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.
What were you doing down there in that yard with Patsy?
Oh, we were serenading the world.
Tell me something. What made that kid take off like a rabbit when she saw you?
Guilty conscience.
She's playing hooky.
Bless you. Say, you know that oil of balsam is good for that.
Never mind oil of balsam or any other kind of oil. Answer my question.
What makes you so interested about this kid? What is it?
I work for the welfare department, and it's my job... to look after the problem children of this county.
Oh, is Patsy such a problem?
Problem? I've got 20 to look after... and she's more trouble than all the rest put together.
- Bless you.
- Oh, stop blessing me!
That child's supposed to be in school, and I find her dancing for pennies!
What's the matter with that? It keeps the kid out in the open, doesn't it?
Who are you? I've never seen you around here anyway.
I'm the last of the troubadours.
- If you think this is a joking matter...
- I'm not joking.
Seriously, I'm just a harmless guy, the friend of man.
I envy nobody, and I'm sure nobody envies me.
If I were you, I wouldn't get myself into a temperature over this thing.
- It's bad for your cold.
- Never mind my cold.
- Not too close.
- I'm sorry.
- Are you related to Patsy?
- No, just a friend of the family.
Do you know that she's in danger of being sent to an orphanage?
I've been trying to prevent it, but if this goes on, I don't see how I can.
What's wrong with an orphanage? I was raised in one. It didn't hurt me any.
- It didn't do you any good.
- What's the matter with me?
If you want my opinion, you seem to be nothing more than a shiftless loafer!
You seem to be nothing more than a nosey, meddlesome busybody!
If you'd been raised in an orphanage, you might have learned manners!
I'm sorry, perhaps I was mistaken.
Perhaps you're not really a loafer, even if you do look like one.
Just what do you do for a living?
Oh, I eat, drink, sleep, and I mind my own business.
That's a formula I highly recommend, especially the last part.
Well, here's your money back.
Guess you just don't like music.
Oh, say, I hope that cold is nothing trivial.
- Hello, Gramp.
- Hello.
I see the landlord's been here.
Yes, he came with a couple of men.
They left a little while ago.
Oh, this is Larry, my most intimate friend.
- What's your other name?
- Poole.
How do you do? I'm sorry I can't invite you inside, but we've been dispossessed.
- That's too bad.
- That's all right.
The furniture don't belong to us.
We never have to send it back.
The installment people always come after it.
That's nice of them, isn't it?
Good to see that you're not put out about being put out.
No. It happens all the time.
Sure. We move in one house and stay a while till the landlord puts us out.
- We never pay any rent.
- Of course that's only temporary.
Pretty soon I expect to come into a regular income of $200 a month.
Quite ample for our simple needs.
- Larry's gonna stay for lunch.
- Delighted!
Provided you don't mind dining in the open.
Oh, no, I prefer it.
- Won't you sit down?
- Show him the ham.
- Ain't it elegant?
- Oh, a dandy.
We won it at a raffle.
- Hey, look! Miss Sprague!
- Beat it!
Charming landscape, is it not?
Patsy's very good at finding such places.
Say, Gramp, tell me something, will you?
Does the name Hart mean anything to you?
If you mean the criminal who was recently electrocuted...
- That's the fellow.
- His name does mean something to me.
He is the man who killed Patsy's father.
He gave me a letter for you.
Here it is.
A key.
What's it for?
Read the letter.
No, I haven't my glasses.
Will you read it for me, please?
Sure.
"You know I never meant to kill Smith.
All the time I was in prison
I kept thinking about his family... and how they must have been up against it after I killed him.
So I thought I would leave all I have to the family of this man Smith.
It isn't very much.
Just an old house in New Jersey... that I used to use for a hideout.
I hope it brings you better luck than it brought me.J.C. Hart."
No. No, I could never live in a house that belonged to that man.
Why not? Probably the only decent thing he ever tried to do.
Let him do it.
Poor fellow's dead now.
Look, you've just been thrown out of your house, haven't you?
Well, here's another one all set up and ready for you to live in.
Besides, you have to think of Patsy, you know.
Thank you, Mr. Cow.
There's a postscript here on the letter.
Says the house is...
"on a road off the main highway about five miles out of Middletown."
- Oh, bless my soul, child.
- Oh, dear.
Old McDonald had a farm
E- l-E-l-O
And on the farm he had a duck
E- l-E-l-O
With a quack, quack here
And a quack, quack there
Here a quack, there a quack
Everywhere a quack, quack
Old McDonald had a farm
E- l-E-l-O
Oh, Patsy Smith is a pain in the neck
E- l-E-l-O
Yes, she is
She is, by heck
E- l-E-l-O
With I wanna go here
and I won't do that
And an old feather stuck in her hat
Patsy Smith is a pain in the neck
E- l-E-l-O
- Is that a guitar
- That's a lute
E- l-E-l-O
Whatever it is it's sure a beaut
E- l-E-l-O
- With a...
- With a...
Here, and a... there
Here a... there a... everywhere a...
Larry's got a lute
E- l-E-l-O
- Hey, I know one.
- Is it a good one?
- They seem to like it around here.
- Let's hear it.
Old McDonald had a farm
E- l-E-l-O
And on this farm he had a parrot
E- l-E-l-O
With a...and a...
Did you tear something?
Sounded bad.
Well, here we are.
Partner, I want to thank you very much for the lift.
That's all right.
Glad of your company.
Gee, mister, you can sure twang on that there guitar.
- That ain't no guitar.
- It's a lute.
A 13th century lute!
Well, where's this house now?
It's up there in those trees.
She's staring you square in the face.
You ain't gonna stay in that house?
- Why not?
- Didn't you know that was haunted?
Why sure. We're the ghosts that haunt it. Come, come, spirits.
Giddyap!
Maybe we ought to stop over someplace in town tonight.
We can come in the morning.
Oh, hooey. That Hart probably started this haunted house talk... just to keep people away from the hideaway.
Here. Hey, Gramp, let me get that.
Okay. Come on in.
Join the spooks.
Go on, dear.
Well, come on in.
Nothing to be afraid of.
What's the trouble, Sarge?
I thought you said you were grown up.
- I am.
- You promised you wouldn't be afraid.
I'm not afraid, only... it's awful lonely in here... and I keep seeing funny things in the dark.
- Why don't you close your eyes?
- I do, but it gets worse.
Can I go downstairs with you, Larry?
- What a pest.
- Just for a little while.
- You know you're a nuisance?
- Please?
Why did I ever have to run into you, anyhow?
There you are. Now stay put.
I'll be right back.
Let's stay up all night, huh?
I'll get Gramp's chess board, and I'll teach you how to play the game.
No. What do I want with chess, anyhow?
I got troubles enough.
- What troubles have you got?
- Mostly you.
- Me?
- Yeah.
What's the matter with me?
You were born a female.
That was your first mistake.
All females are troublemakers, one way or another.
They slow you down, and they cramp your style.
Not me. I'm different.
Oh, no, you're not.
Your friend Miss Sprague told me all about you.
Friend? She's the worst enemy
I've got in the whole world.
Never mind about that.
You just hop right in here. Come on.
Gee, this is the first time anybody ever tucked me in bed.
- Would you do it for me every night?
- Every night?
What do you think I'm gonna do, live here?
We could have an awful lot of fun.
Oh, no. You've held me up long enough already.
- I'm leaving in the morning.
- Can I go with you?
With me? I should say not.
I don't carry any excess baggage.
That's the secret of my success.
I won't be any trouble.
Trouble's your middle name. Anyway, you wouldn't want to leave Gramp, would you?
Oh, no, but we could take him with us.
Take him with us?
What are you figuring out for me?
A cook's tour?
You just forget about it.
Close those eyes, and go to sleep.
I can't go to sleep. I'm afraid.
The house is full of ghosts.
- Rats.
- Where?
No, no. There. Now relax.
You know, Sarge...
A long time ago
About a million years BC
The best things in life
Absolutely free
But no one appreciated
A sky that was always blue
And no one congratulated
A moon that was always new
So it was planned
that they would vanish now and then
And you must pay before you
get them back again
That's what storms were made for
And you shouldn't be afraid for
Every time it rains
it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune falling
All over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you
And me
Well, there.
Check.
That means I gotta move my king out of danger, huh?
Sure.
Young lady, something tells me you're trying to pull a fast one.
If I move my king, you're gonna grab my rook, aren't you?
Uh-huh. And I'll have you mated in three moves.
Oh, I guess I'm no good at this game.
- Sure, you are!
- Nah.
You just can't learn in a week.
I've played for years, and besides, you don't concentrate.
- Yes, I do.
- You're thinking of something else.
Nope.
Hey! Wait a minute.
Good afternoon. Patsy seems to have remembered a sudden engagement.
Gee, I'd hate to be somebody that makes children run away all the time.
- May I sit down?
- Don't come too close.
I've got a cold.
You better sit there.
How'd you know where we were?
My own secret service.
Nice of you to take such an interest in me.
I don't take any interest in you, not the slightest.
Then why are you snooping around here?
Why don't you mind your own business?
This is my business.
It's my job to look after Patsy... and I'm not letting anyone stop me, least of all a hobo with a guitar.
In the first place, it's not a guitar.
It's a lute.
Here, take a look at it.
It was made in the 13th century, long before we had any nosy social workers.
Probably belonged to some troubadour.
That's me... a troubadour, not a hobo.
- What's the difference?
- The difference?
A hobo begs for his supper, and a troubadour sings for it.
- How romantic.
- Yes.
- You have a nice voice too.
- Thank you.
- I suppose you eat regularly?
- Mm-hmm. Sleep regularly, and...
I know. Mind your own business.
- Right.
- Well, so do I. That's why I'm here.
Well, then I'm glad you came.
If you hadn't, I'd have sent for you... because there's something you can do for me.
- What?
- You can take this family off my hands.
I ought to be on a boat right now, bound for Venice.
What's Venice got to do with it?
Plenty. I've got an idea they understand a guy with a lute over there.
It's too bad that nobody understands you over here.
Do you know what will happen if this family is left to their own devices?
Oh, I imagine they'll struggle along all right.
Of course if you could convince me that you can support them properly.
- Support them?
- Mm-hmm. Are you married?
No, I'm sane.
Well, have you anybody at all that you have to take care of?
Yeah... me... and I'm not picking up anybody else.
You're not gonna stick me with a kid and an old man.
The first time I met you, I said some things that I shouldn't have... so I came here to apologize.
But I see now I was right the first time.
Hey, my lute!
What's the trouble?
I thought you were my most intimate friend.
Well, who said I wasn't?
I heard you tell her that you don't want me.
Well, I had to tell her something to get rid of her, didn't I?
And I heard you tell her you were gonna leave us.
Why don't you be reasonable?
Look.
How long do you want me to hang around, and why do you want me to?
I've fallen in love with you.
When did this happen?
When you got me these. And I'll give them to you if you'll only stay.
You're the worst pest
I ever ran into.
Come on. Get outta there.
Alley-oop.
Alley-oop.
That's the old sergeant.
Here are the commitment papers for the Smith child.
Yes, sir.
If they'd been prepared weeks ago, you could have saved considerable trouble.
You're quite right, Mr. Carmichael.
See that the child is taken to the orphanage in the morning. That's all.
Get me the orphanage.
Come in.
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.
- I thought you were going to Rome.
- Venice.
Oh, yes, of course. Venice.
Well, I've postponed that, but I've been postponing it all my life... so once more won't hurt.
We have a proposition we want to make.
Won't you be seated?
You bet.
There's no need to hide.
Move your chair out there.
We have a problem, a situation that confronts a lot of people these days.
We want to be let alone.
That's all we ask of the United States,
New Jersey, Union County and you.
If you'll just tell us what you want of us, we'll see what we can do about it.
All I want is to see Patsy properly provided for.
What do you mean,
"properly provided for"?
I mean properly clothed and properly fed... in a home where her schooling won't be neglected... where she won't be subjected to the wrong sort of influence.
Oh. Meaning me.
- If the shoe fits.
- It pinches.
Hey, where are you going?
I won't live with anybody else but you and Gramp! And they can't make me!
Come on back and sit down, or I'll walk out on the whole thing.
As I understand it your chief objection... is neither Gramp nor I is what you'd call regularly or gainfully employed.
- Correct.
- Well.
If I can show you we're engaged in a going business, would that be all right?
What kind?
We went into a little huddle and decided to open a restaurant.
We're gonna call it
"The Haunted House Cafe."
- It was my own idea.
- Quiet, Patsy. Now, listen.
The place where we happen to be living has the reputation of being haunted.
So why not take advantage of it?
We plan to put a lot of signs up and down the state highway.
Yeah. Signs like skeletons.
And we propose to serve chicken dinners at very reasonable rates.
There will be music and songs provided by Mr. Poole here.
A little floor show.
Have any of you thought of a little thing like capital?
Oh, we won't need any... not for chicken dinners.
I have it all figured out right here.
All we need to start is two chickens.
I mean a hen and a rooster.
When the hen starts laying at the rate of only one egg a day... at the end of the first week we'll have seven eggs.
Those seven eggs in turn will hatch, and at the end of the second cycle... there will be 49 chickens.
Oh, Patsy. How many chickens will we have in three months at that rate?
- You see?
It's simply a matter of arithmetic.
There! Are you satisfied,
Miss Sprague?
No.
I still say what about capital?
- What for?
- What for!
Why, for kitchen equipment!
For pots, pans, knives, forks...
We're not worrying about finances. Gramp tells me he's coming into some money.
- When?
- In the very near future.
Any day now.
And regular income too.
How much of an income?
Two hundred dollars a month.
Two hun... From what source?
- The Townsend Plan.
- The Town...
Oh, I see. Well, just for the sake of argument, of course... suppose the Townsend Plan doesn't go into effect until after you've started.
- Then what?
- Your attitude is unfair.
Of course we need capital.
Why don't you let me take care of that?
How? Singing in backyards?
Well, that's my problem.
If we can get away with this thing, is it all right? Will you leave us alone?
Yes. I'll leave you alone.
As a matter of fact, I'd like very much never to have to see you again.
You'd be surprised how unanimous that is.
Come on, group.
Poor, homeless little chickies.
Looks elegant. Looks real nice.
I couldn't have done better myself.
- Looks effective.
- You bet it does.
That'll be $25.
Deliver it, will you, and send me the bill?
- That's cash.
- Cash?
- I'll have to paint one myself.
- Wait a minute!
You've got no license ordering signs without you can pay for them.
You're right. I did wrong.
You keep the sign.
But I don't want it.
I got no use for it.
Well, I do want it.
I've got some use for it.
Say, do you like chicken dinners?
- Well, yes.
- That's our out.
Now, the Excelsior Company is putting up
$1,500 worth of supplies... in exchange for 25% of our business.
Your estimate for the costumes for the waiter and entertainers is only $1,000.
But we're not asking you to take a cut.
We're gonna give you 25% too.
And it's a grand chance to get in on the ground floor.
Ground floor of what?
What's your secretary's name?
Myrtle. Why?
Hello, Myrt? Don't put any calls through here for ten minutes. Right.
Tell me, Mr. Arbuthnot, what do you think of the restaurant business?
Well, people's got to eat.
It's the best business there is.
- Good! You're in it.
- Huh?
Here it is a week.
There ought to be a couple dozen chickens, and there's only two.
- Good morning, Mr. Poole.
- Hello, Henry. Make up your mind?
Yes, sir, Mr. Poole.
But there's a little trouble.
Trouble? Well, speak freely.
You see, I got the boys together... and I told them you wanted us to play the music for you at the restaurant.
- That's right.
- We'd get ten percent of the business.
- And that's where the trouble started.
- Don't you think ten percent is enough?
Yes and no.
Maybe it's enough, and maybe it's too much.
But you see, there's seven men in the band.
- That's counting you.
- Yeah, that's right. Counting me.
And none of us knows how to divide up ten percent by seven.
So if you could just only make it seven percent.
Seven percent?
Henry, it's a deal.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Poole!
I told them cats you'd do the right thing.
Why, sure!
I'll see you later. Yes.
What is the matter with them?
I don't know. I've tried everything, including prayer.
- Are you Mr. Poole?
- Why?
I have a telegram for you.
- Collect?
- No. Prepaid.
Well then, I'm Mr. Poole.
Sign right here, please.
Well.
- I'll tell you what's wrong.
- Yes?
- You see that one there?
- Yeah.
That's a hen.
Yes. I know. I know.
- See that one over there?
- You mean the rooster?
That ain't no rooster.
What is it?
Hey, what's going on here?
We're supposed to open tomorrow night.
I find you gazing at a hen and a rooster!
- Two hens, Mr. Poole.
- Disaster.
We've just discovered there can be no increase in the poultry department.
It's a beautiful time for that to happen. What about tomorrow night?
How are we gonna feed customers with only two hens?
Mr. Poole, when do you have to have them chickens?
We gotta have them the first thing in the morning!
First thing in the morning?
And how many do you say you need?
- Gotta have at least 50.
- At least 50.
How many chickens does each man have to get when you need 50 chickens... and you's got seven men?
Well, if each man got seven chickens, that would be forty-nine.
Forty-nine.
Well, I think we can do it.
- You can?
- Yes, sir.
If you do, I'll make it 14% instead of seven. That's two percent apiece.
- Now I know we can do it!
- Swell.
I'll tell you just how we're gonna go about it.
- Yeah?
- As it gets dark tonight...
There's an old deserted mansion
On an old forgotten road
Where the better ghosts and goblins
always hang out
One night they threw a party
In a manner a la mode
And they cordially invited
all the gang out
At a dark, bewitching hour
When the fun was loud and hearty
A notorious wallflower
Became the life of the party
The spooks were having
their midnight fling
Merrymaking was in full swing
They shrieked themselves
into a cheerful trance
When the skeleton in the closet
started to dance
Now a goblin, he giggled
with fiendish glee
A shout rang out from a big banshee
Amazement was in every ghostly glance
When the skeleton in the closet
Started to dance
Now all the witches were in stitches
While his steps made rhythmic thumps
And they nearly dropped
their broomsticks
When he tried to do the bumps
You never heard such unearthly laughter
Or such hilarious groans
When the skeleton in the closet
Rattled his bones
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
That cat don't want no more of me.
I'm telling you that much.
Look out there.
One and two!
I made a deal to get my meals free.
See the boss.
I don't pay any checks around here.
I'm one of the owners.
I don't know the art
of elocution
I'm no good at thinking on my feet
I make no poetic contribution
Even when you offer me a seat
I've thrown away expressions
one by one
I'm at a loss
And something must be done
When we're in a friendly situation
My conversation
May not be smart
But if we're to have
a perfect understanding
Let's call a heart a heart
There are words
that should be whispered gently
That's evidently
The way to start
If I tell you what my dreams
have been demanding
Let's call a heart a heart
Can I prove how I yearn
Just by the turn of a phrase
Can I keep my control
When all my soul is ablaze
Maybe you would call
a true confession
An indiscretion
On someone's part
But if I'm to say how madly
I adore you
Let's call a heart
A heart
And let's call a spade a spade too.
If your menu had any humble pie,
I'd eat it.
I was wrong, and I humbly apologize.
There's no doubt about it, the cafe is a tremendous success... and I didn't think you could do it.
Oh, I had to. You made me do it.
Did you enjoy your dinner?
- Very much.
- Music okay?
Mm-hmm. It's delightful.
- You like the looks of the place?
- Charming.
Look. If I could show you where we could put this place on a paying basis... so it could provide a comfortable income for Patsy and Gramp... would you be satisfied?
I'd be more than satisfied.
I'd be awfully happy.
Then everybody'd be happy.
- You too?
- Me too.
'Cause then I'd be on my way to Venice.
Why are you so keen about Venice?
Ah, you wouldn't ask that if you'd ever been there.
It's the most beautiful spot in the world.
Why, Venice has got all the postcards you've ever seen whipped to a frazzle.
You haven't lived until you've floated down the Grand Canal in a gondola... especially on a feast day with the colored lights and the flowers... and the people singing and laughing, and guitars.
You know a great deal about Venice.
Were you by any chance born there?
No. I was born in Mukilteo, Washington.
But you've spent a great deal of time in Venice.
No. I've never been there.
But I wanted to go ever since I was a little sprout... but it looked as though every time I got set to go... something happened and sent me somewhere else.
As, for instance, prison?
How'd you know about that?
I checked up. It was for my own information, of course.
I didn't let them know at the office.
I guess you found out what I was in for, didn't you?
Smuggling.
Yeah.
That was on account of Venice too.
See, I didn't have enough dough to take passage on a regular ship... so I stowed away on a freighter... and they raided the freighter before they got up anchor.
Turned out to be a smuggling ship.
Judge wouldn't believe me.
- I guess you don't either, do you?
- Yes, I do.
You do?
Well, come here.
What made you do that?
Oh, I don't know.
I just played an impulse.
I guess I wanted to see what it was like.
It was swell.
Your lips are nice and cool.
- You don't mind an audience, do you?
- Not in the least.
Do you mind if I obey an impulse too?
Not at all.
Good night, Mr. Poole.
Check, sir.
Just skip it, sonny.
I'm one of the big owners of the place.
Say, mister, you better get yourself a new waiter.
I just figured out the checks, and everybody seems to be a partner.
The way it adds up, you've sold 110% of this restaurant!
I agreed to work here for my tips, and there aren't no tips.
The only paying customer was that dame that just left.
She gimme a dime.
Here, you take it.
You might need it.
And here's your ribs.
Might need those too.
Good-bye.
- You Mr. Poole?
- Yeah.
You run this place?
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.
Well, where's your license?
What license?
Don't you know you need a tavern license... to operate an eatin' place in this county?
Drat. Now, how could I have overlooked that?
Certainly glad you dropped in to remind me.
Just what does one of these licenses cost?
$100, and you can't start doing business without one.
Well, naturally.
Say, have you got a card you can let me have?
Thanks. I'll be down to take care of it first thing in the morning.
Okay.
We open at 9:00.
Oh, now looka here. You told me you were gonna stay upstairs.
Oh, I just couldn't stay up there.
When I saw Miss Sprague leave, I just had to come down for one little look.
- Ain't it an elegant opening night?
- You mean "closing night."
Sergeant, you see gathered about you tonight... more deadheads than have ever been collected under a single roof.
And they're all in on rain checks.
The headwaiter just quit too.
When our entertainers find out what their percentage is...
I have an idea they'll also quit.
We got bills up to here.
The tax collector was in to tell me... if we don't get a license, he's gonna close us up.
The license costs $100, and we haven't got a hundred cents.
Gee, what are we gonna do?
Let's dance.
- Madam, you know you dance divinely?
- Thank you. You dance elegant yourself.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Some nice chicken dinners tonight?
See? What did I tell ya?
There they are!
Those are the fellas that stole our chickens!
Come on!
Look out!
The law, gentlemen!
What's the trouble?
- If you let us have a little while...
- You're breakin' the law as it is.
I'll give you only 24 hours to get that license.
There's no work attached to it whatsoever.
And the pay is incredulous... a dollar a second.
Thirty dollars for thirty seconds, twice a day.
Doin' what?
You know, this guy Devlin I was usin' to do these loop the loops, he was no good.
No. In fact, he did me a favor when he got cracked up.
We're gonna get a lot of publicity from this accident.
And from now on, we'll do a world of business. Well, what do you say?
What do I know about death in the afternoon?
Don't pay any attention to that.
That's just the billin'.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, hello, Larry.
What? Over to the fairgrounds?
Patsy and me?
All right. Yeah, surely.
We'll be right over.
It's Larry. He wants us to come over to the fairgrounds.
He says it's a surprise.
Come on. Let's go.
Wait.
- Wonder where Larry is.
- He doesn't hurry, he'll miss the show.
Gee, that's gettin' higher all the time.
- Which one loops the loop?
- The front one.
Okay, I'll ride the back one.
- No. I've got a dummy nailed in there.
- A dummy?
Yes. Listen, you got nothing to be afraid of. It's child's play.
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- Well, who's gonna make the spiel?
Grandpa! Grandpa, look!
It's Larry!
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I take great pleasure in introducing to you... the one and only
Dare Devil Devlin... in the most daring act ever conceived by mortal mind... or executed by man born of woman.
He'll thumb his nose, ladies and gentlemen, at the Grim Reaper!
He will defy death.
The one and only Dare Devil Devlin!
Are you ready?
- No, can't handle it.
- Okay! Let her go!
Larry, are you hurt?
No, I'm all right, Sarge.
I must've stubbed my toe.
Don't worry, kid.
- The hospital expenses are on me.
- Please, get some water.
Hey, Gramp! Come on in!
Well, what's the matter?
What's happened?
Where's Patsy?
She's gone.
They've taken her away.
An officer is on his way to the orphanage now with the child.
Yes, Miss Howard, a most troublesome case.
- I'm glad it's finally settled.
- May I be the first to congratulate you?
Would you mind explaining why you saw fit... to have a hearing about the Smith child without telling me?
We decided we didn't need your help in the matter.
This is my case.
You had no right to go over my head.
I'm under the impression that I'm still the head of this bureau.
That may be, but it's no excuse for what you've done.
You took advantage of the fact that
Mr. Poole is lying in the hospital... to send that child to an asylum.
It doesn't alter the fact that he's a penniless hobo.
No, he's not.
He's a free soul and lives a free life.
I only wish I had the courage to be like him.
That gal did it. She took advantage of the fact I'm in the hospital.
And they left instructions not to let you come to the orphanage.
- That's part of the court order.
- Yeah.
- She took care of that too, I suppose.
- Oh, my boy, please get back in bed.
Remember, you're still in bandages.
Yes, and that's her fault too.
Everything's her fault!
Hadn't been for her, I'd be in Venice now havin' the time of my life.
I regret to have to say this to you.
Up to now you've been a faithful and trustworthy worker.
I know.
You're going to give me the air.
I could do with some air. I never knew till now how stuffy it is in here.
You don't have to run away from me now.
- What do you want?
- I want to help you.
Oh, no, you don't. You hate me.
You've always hated me.
That's why I'm here now.
It's all your fault.
Maybe it's my fault, but it's not because I hate you.
Oh, I wish we could be good friends.
- You couldn't be a friend of mine.
- Why not?
Because you don't get along with Larry.
He's the most intimate friend I've got in the world... and you're against him.
No, I'm not. Mr. Carmichael fired me because I stood up for him.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
And I had nothing to do with you being sent here. I didn't even know about it.
Why, you didn't see me at the court hearing, did you?
Larry always said as soon as he could get rid of you... he's gonna take me and Gramp to Venice.
That's in Italy.
He thought maybe over there they'd leave him alone.
That's the ambition of his life... to be let alone.
Do you know the ambition of my life?
To get you to like me and trust me and not run away every time you see me.
- But l...
- Come closer.
I want to tell you something.
Oh, no, real close.
It's a secret.
Promise never to tell a living soul, especially Larry.
Well...
I like Larry very much.
And I like you too.
I always have.
Oh, Miss Sprague.
- Perhaps he's asleep.
- I'll see.
Oh, dear!
Look, Crowbar, you know all the circus people around here.
You round them up to play a benefit at the orphanage. I'll do the rest.
- Mrs. Howard.
- Good afternoon.
It was so generous of the carnival people... to come here and give this show for the children.
They're having the time of their lives!
Why aren't you down in the yard with the rest of the children?
I wanna stay up here.
The circus people have been kind enough to give a special show for us.
- It'll be starting in a few minutes.
- I don't care.
The yard's full of clowns and jugglers and acrobats.
Bet there's a cage full of wild animals.
I hope they run loose and kill a few people.
There's a golden chariot and performing pigs... and the fattest woman in the world and the tallest man.
I'm sure you'd have an awfully good time.
How can you have a good time when your heart's breaking?
- Hearts do not break.
- That's all you know about it.
I take it, then, you don't intend to come down.
No, I swore I'd never leave this room till they carried me out dead!
Well, good-bye then.
Every time it rains
it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don't you know
each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
Now listen.
I know you got other things to think about... but can't you find some way to get me out of here?
Can't you think of something?
- Be sure that your umbrella
- Can't you...
Is upside down
Get yourself a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want
the things you love
You must have showers
One, two
Button your shoe
Put on your coat and hat
I play a game like that
While I'm waiting for you
Three, four
Open the door
Hurry, for heaven's sake
I count each step you take
While I'm waiting for you
Five, six, my heart does tricks
as I picture all your charms
Seven, eight
You're at the gate
And you walk into my arms
Oh, nine, ten
Kiss me again
Tell me you get a thrill
Just as I hope you will
While I'm waiting for you
One, two
Button up your shoe
Put on your coat
and your hat
I play a game like that
While I'm waiting for you
Three, four, open the door
Now hurry, dear
Hurry, for heaven's sake
I count each step you take
While I'm waitin'for you
Oh, five, six
Now my heart does tricks
as I picture all your charms
Seven, eight
You're at the gate
And you make me dizzy when you're
walking right into my arms
Nine, ten, kiss me again
Tell me you get such a thrill
Just as I hope you will
while I'm waitin'for you
- Hi. Now, here's the plan.
- What plan?
- You're checking out of here.
- Larry! And I thought she was kiddin'.
- Who was kidding?
- Susan Sprague.
She promised she'd get me out of here.
Get you out of here? If it wasn't for her, you wouldn't be here.
That female Iscariot framed you the moment I turned my back.
That's what I thought. But she said she didn't have anything to do with it.
- She even lost her job because of us.
- How do you know?
She was in to see me, and she told me.
- And she said that she... Oh. Oh.
- Well, what did she say?
Well, she made me promise not to tell a living soul, especially you.
- Tell me! Tell me now!
- Oh, it's nothing important.
It's a secret.
Do you want me to break my word?
I'll break your neck if you don't tell me. Come on.
Well, she said she liked you... a lot, an awful lot.
She says the first time she saw you, she fell in love with you.
And the more she saw you the worse it got.
- And she said that...
- Now listen.
If you're lying to me, I'm gonna let you stay in this place till you're 108!
Oh, but I'm not lying, Larry.
I'd never tell a lie.
Now look, here's what we're gonna do.
She ate too much spinach.
Come here.
Come on. Make it fast.
Come on!
Five, six... seven, eight... nine, ten.
That's the man.
Susan Sprague's in New York, and that's the place to find Larry Poole.
Come in.
- Miss Sprague?
- Yes.
- We're from the police department.
- What can I do for you?
Now don't be alarmed. We just came up to get a little information.
- What about?
- We're trying to find a Larry Poole.
Well, what makes you think that I know his whereabouts?
The last thing he said before he left was that he was gonna look for you.
What do you want him for?
What are the charges against him?
Who said there was a charge?
We wanna have a few words with the man, that's all.
I suppose that anything
I say will be used against me.
Not at all.
We got nothin' on you.
It's Larry Poole we're after.
All you've got to do is tell us where he is.
Well, to the best of my information and belief, Mr. Poole is in...
- Venice.
- Venice?
That's in Italy.
Come in.
- Here's your laundry.
- Thanks.
What's that?
That's a map of New York City.
What are all those little pins for?
Oh, that's a long story.
I've got plenty of time.
Well, each one of those little pins represents a backyard.
I'm making sort of a tour of all the backyards in New York City.
- What for?
- I'm looking for somebody.
- Are you a G-man?
- No.
- Who are you looking for?
- A girl.
- When you find her, what'll you do?
- Do you have to know?
But I'd like to know.
You've got me all excited.
Listen, if I tell you, will you keep it to yourself?
Oh, sure.
If I find that girl,
I'm going to get down on my knees... and apologize to her for being such a fool... as to misunderstand her for even a moment.
I'm going to ask her to forgive me.
If you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of backyards to cover today.
The breeze runs after you
When you're passing by
It wants to be near
And so do I
The willow bows to you
Forgetting to cry
It waits for your smile
And so do I
All the world's at your command
What wouldn't it do
For one look at you
And I'm
That way too
The rose that you caress
Is willing to die
It loves you so very much
And so
Do I
Oh, am I glad I found you.
- You know I was down to my last pin?
- What pin?
Wait till I get my breath.
Well, go ahead.
Slap my face. It was worth it.
Oh, don't be silly.
- I've been looking all over for you.
- You've been looking for me?
Gee, I've been looking for you for weeks.
Why, I even put an ad in the personal column.
Larry, you shouldn't be here.
The police are looking for you.
- You've got to leave town.
- Leave town is right.
I'm not going to eat!
I'm on a hunger strike!
I'm not going to eat!
I'm on a hunger strike!
I've lost three pounds in the last two days, and I'll be dead soon!
She's perfectly capable of carrying out her threats.
Mr. Carmichael, I've got my own health to consider.
I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
So they found you, Poole.
Yeah, I decided to come on back and take my medicine.
Patricia, come back here.
- No.
- See? That's what I get all the time.
Now, I want this matter settled here and now.
You've got to take this demon out of my institution.
She's disrupted the discipline, tried to set fire to the place... smashed the furniture, broken the windows... and now it's a hunger strike.
And if I don't die of hunger,
I'm gonna jump out of the window.
I've written a letter blaming everything on you... and I'm going to mail it to all the newspapers before I kill myself!
You see! You've got to do something about this... even if you have to adopt her yourself.
Me? I'd rather resign my job.
Young man... you said you were ready to take your medicine.
It may prove to be bitter medicine, but you've got to help me out.
- Help you out?
- Yes, with this brat.
We've had nothing but trouble ever since we sent her to the orphanage.
Shortly after she came there, carnival people put on a show for the children.
She tore open the bass drum and tried to escape in it.
Since then, she's made life miserable for everybody.
She refuses to go with anybody but you.
- Couldn't you take her off our hands?
- Well... Huh?
You mean to say that's why you had those cops bring me here?
I'm terribly sorry, but you see the desperate situation I'm in.
You're the only one in the world who can help.
And there was no other way of finding you.
Well, I guess you boys know the penalties for false arrest.
Who said you were under arrest?
We were told to find you and bring you here, and we did it.
First, you do everything to put this child in an orphanage, and I'm the goat.
Now you're doing everything under the sun to have her... taken out of the orphanage, and I'm still the goat.
Looks to me like I'm "Joe Goat" around here. Why should I do anything for you?
It isn't for me. I'm only acting in the best interest of Patricia here... this poor little motherless child.
Well, Susan, what do you think?
First of all, I think
Mr. Carmichael owes you an apology.
I do, and I apologize most humbly.
- And you owe Miss Sprague an apology.
- I do.
- Hey, what about me?
- Shut up!
And then I think Patsy should be adopted by a respectable married couple.
Well, what's the matter with us?
Aren't we respectable?
Yeah, what's the matter with them?
Oh, let's eat. I'm just dying of hunger.
Say good-bye to the nice man.
G... Oh. No, never mind.
When I'm waitin'for you
Three, four
Open up the door
Now hurry, dear
Hurry, for heaven's sake
I count each step you take
when I'm waiting for you
Five, six, now my heart does tricks
as I picture all your charms
Seven, eight
You're at the gate
And you make me dizzy
when you're walking right into my arms
Nine, ten, kiss me again
Tell me you get such a thrill
Just as I hope you will
When I'm waiting for you
Hey, hey, hey!
Look out there!
Hey, hey!
Look out! Look out!
Can I help you, sir?
Yes, just help me steady this thing.
Thank you.
Oh, could you give me a little information?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Don't wait up for me.
Please call me when we get to the 18th floor.
Eighteenth floor, sir.
Thank you so much.
If you run into my stomach on the way down...
...kindly have it sent up.
- Mr. Arden.
- Where's Tony Flagg? I wanna see him.
Well, come in here, please.
Dr. Flagg's busy right now, but pipe down and I'll take you.
Well, how do you feel now?
I'm not drunk anymore, Tony.
I'm just dizzy.
All right, we'll unwind you.
Say, Steve, when I went to Switzerland you never drank like this.
How long have you been tight?
Three days:
Yesterday, today and tomorrow.
Because this Amanda What's-Her-Name broke her engagement to you?
- Yeah, for the third time.
- What happened the other two times?
I got stiff.
I hope she changes her mind before you get DTs.
That's why I came to see you, about her.
You came to the right man.
He's straightened out some pips.
We had a dame here yesterday who was in love with her feet.
Sorry, Steve, I'm no marriage broker.
Now, this Amanda What's-Her-Name...
Stop calling her What's-Her-Name.
Her name's Cooper, Amanda Cooper.
I don't care what her name is. To me, she's another maladjusted woman.
She's in perfect order.
She's beautiful, Tony.
That has nothing to do with it either.
Perhaps she's merely trying to escape reality.
Escape what reality?
- In this case, you.
- What do you...?
We all try to escape reality.
We all wanna be something entirely different than we really are.
- When I was a kid, I wanted to be a fireman.
- Sure. I wanted to be a cop.
Remember when we were in college how stage-struck I was?
I wanted to be a dancer.
Psychoanalysis showed me I was wrong.
It's the one way we have of finding out what we really want and why we want it.
I wanna marry Amanda, and I know why.
Perhaps if I psychoanalyze you, you won't wanna marry Amanda.
Well, I don't wanna not wanna marry Amanda.
Easy, Mr. Arden.
You don't have to say everything twice.
- What do you want?
- I wanna marry Amanda.
I guess he wants to marry
What's-Her-Name, all right.
Tony, you've just got to see her.
Why not, doc? She might turn out to be a very interesting nut.
Maybe this Amanda What's-Her-Name...
Cooper!
Maybe she prefers staying on the stage to marrying you.
No, no, no.
She wants to marry me.
Why does she keep breaking off the engagement?
She doesn't know.
She says it's not my fault, it's hers.
At least see her. Maybe you can figure out what the trouble is.
Well, how do you know she's willing to be psychoanalyzed?
Oh, she will if I ask her to.
All right. Tell her to come to my office tomorrow morning at 11:00.
Now, what's her name?
Amanda What's-Her-Name.
- Cooper.
- Yeah.
Memo to Dr. Jones.
Case history 3442, Mrs. Mamie Fletcher.
Dr. Jones, I am turning this case over to you for further treatment.
My observations are as follows:
She's a typical pampered female.
What she needs, instead of a doctor...
...is a good spanking. However...
- Yes, Dr. Powers.
- Dr. Flagg...
...can you come to my laboratory, please?
There's a Miss Cooper waiting for me.
She's another one of those dizzy, silly, maladjusted females...
...who can't make up her mind.
I'll probably find out she hasn't got one.
- I just need you for a moment.
- All right, I'll be right out.
How do you do, Miss Cooper?
I am Miss Cooper.
Well, won't you come in, please?
Thank you, doctor.
I've been looking forward with so much pleasure to this meeting.
I'm sorry, I have to leave you, but if you'll make yourself comfortable...
...I'll be back, and we can have a nice visit.
Well, I'm certain I'm going to enjoy it.
Steve thinks so much of you.
Steve's a fine chap. Yes, indeed.
And very lucky too.
Excuse me.
Memo to Dr. Jones.
Case history 3442, Mrs. Mamie Fletcher.
Dr. Jones, I am turning this case over
to you for further treatment.
My observations are as follows:
She's a typical pampered female.
What she needs, instead of a doctor,
is a good spanking. However...
Yes, Dr. Powers.
Dr. Flagg,
will you come to my laboratory, please?
There's a Miss Cooper
waiting outside for me.
She's another one of those dizzy,
silly, maladjusted females...
... who can't make up her mind.
I'll probably find out she hasn't got one.
I don't wanna be disturbed,
Miss Adams.
Now there'll be no more disturbances...
...and we can have that nice, friendly little chat.
Won't you sit down?
Oh, that's my chair.
Very comfortable.
But I'd planned for you to sit here.
I want you to be relaxed.
I'm perfectly relaxed.
Perhaps you'd better sit there.
Are you always this nervous?
No. Only I usually sit in that chair.
Well, I won't be here very long, and then you can sit in it.
Oh, now... Now, Miss Cooper, first let's get to know each other.
Why?
I have to know your mind as well as I know my own.
Why?
Miss Cooper, you understand the principle of psychoanalysis, don't you?
No.
Well, you do know that you have two minds:
The conscious and the subconscious.
Really?
The conscious mind is the ego.
That's the thing that says,
"I am I, and you are you."
Mine never said that.
Let me put it this way, then.
Back here is a jungle full of the most noble and horrible things.
I don't doubt that.
That's your subconscious mind.
It works all the time, even when you sleep.
It dreams. It never forgets anything.
Is that so?
Your conscious mind lies here.
It doesn't dream, it thinks.
Now, what we strive for is perfect coordination between the two.
Do you understand?
No. And I don't believe I care to.
At first I wasn't sure
I wanted to be psychoanalyzed.
And now I'm positive I don't.
Now, you mustn't put a wall between us,
Miss Cooper.
To psychoanalyze you,
I must interpret your dreams.
What sort of things do you dream?
I don't dream.
- Oh, come, now. Everybody dreams.
- I don't.
I wish you'd please understand that
I'm only trying to help you find yourself.
Well, if I ever get lost, I'll call on you.
Attention, everybody. Having tied on the
shoot-off, Judge Travers and Mr. Arden...
... have decided to break the tie
by a miss-and-out event at single bird.
Pull.
- Lost bird.
- Too bad, Stephen.
You've been shooting as if you'd been on a bender.
I feel as if I had been.
Nice shooting.
Tony, what did you do to Amanda?
What did I do?
Oh, I'm sorry. I want you to meet
Amanda's Aunt Cora. Dr. Flagg.
- How do you do?
- Amanda's furious with you.
What happened?
She wouldn't tell me.
She's a very curious case.
At first, she was sweet and charming...
...then, for no reason at all, she became argumentative.
You should hear what she thinks about you.
- What?
- She thinks you're a quack.
Oh, she does?
Pull.
Very good. Very good, Your Honor.
Your shooting was superb, Your Honor.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
His Honor Judge Travers, Dr. Flagg.
- Judge Travers.
- How do you do?
Well, I beat you today, Stephen.
That makes us even-steven.
Well, just wait for the finals.
- How'd you like my exhibition, Cora?
- Pretty good, Joe, I guess.
Pretty good? It was pretty perfect.
If you could only play bridge the way you play scat.
It's skeet, and besides, you don't play it.
That's what I mean, Joe.
You don't play bridge either.
You're getting terrific lengths with your drives, Dr. Flagg.
Thank you, Mr. MacPherson.
You're very, very encouraging.
It's about time, Mac.
Quack. Have you any suggestions?
Maybe you were hitting it with your subconscious mind.
You know, the one that dreams.
Smack it once with your conscious.
It'll go when I hit it.
What happened to that theory of coordination you were hot about?
- Doing several things at the same time.
- Oh, that.
Murph, set them up.
What's the matter, Aunt Cora?
Did you lose something?
Not that I know of. Why?
You keep looking back all the time.
Oh, I was looking for that Dr. Quack.
Flagg?
Is he coming, Steve?
It seems silly to keep it a secret.
He said he wanted to psychoanalyze you on your bicycle.
Oh, so that's why we came.
I wouldn't mind being analyzed by him on my bicycle.
Or on anything, come to think of it.
Well, well, what luck.
- None.
- Well, Tony, what a pleasant surprise.
Steve, can't you see that Dr. Flagg wants to ride with me alone?
Oh, sorry, Tony.
Want to drop back here with me,
Aunt Cora?
All right, if you don't try to amuse me.
Well?
Will you please tell me something?
Why were you suddenly so unfriendly yesterday?
Quote, " Just another one of those dizzy, silly, maladjusted females...
...who can't make up her mind," unquote.
Well, of course, that was before I met you.
Well, I can forgive you for saying I have no mind...
...but I'm afraid maybe you're right about my being maladjusted.
We're never really afraid of anything we understand.
That sounds as if it makes sense.
Of course, if we know the reason for most fears, we can dispel them.
Very often, fear is just a simple phobia:
Afraid of darkness, afraid of great heights...
...afraid of marriage.
- You better put on your brakes, doctor.
- What?
It's getting steep.
Hey, look out.
Take it easy, doctor.
I can't.
Now, don't show off.
I'm not, my chain's broken.
Please, Miss Cooper, look out.
Doctor, are you all right?
Yes, I guess so.
You win.
- Shall you order now, Mr. Arden?
- No.
- We'll wait for Miss Cooper and Dr. Flagg.
- Very good, sir.
Is this one of your silent treatments, doctor?
Trying to think of some mental prescription that might induce dreams.
Here we go again.
I hate to be persistent, but I'm trying to help you and Steve.
And I have to dream?
Well, it would simplify matters, and it's possible to make you dream.
Well, I'll try anything, if you can guarantee the dream.
Good.
I imagine women find Dr. Flagg very charming, especially girls.
Why, Tony's a doctor.
Amanda's only his patient.
He's all wrapped up in his work, isn't he?
Then you'll eat whatever I order?
To paraphrase, doctor, you're the doctor.
Behold the guinea pig.
Aunt Cora, Steve,
I'm on a diet to dream.
How marvelous. Who's the lucky man?
Miss Cooper is going to dream tonight by eating dream-provoking foods.
Tomorrow I'll explain her dream to her.
I'd eat anything if I thought it would make my dreams come true.
May I recommend the filet mignon smothered with mushrooms.
No, thank you. Miss Cooper would prefer a seafood cocktail.
- Seafood cocktail.
- With whipped cream.
Seafood cocktail with whipped cream?
But not too much whipped cream, just a soup鏾n.
- Soup鏾n.
- Next, I'd like a largish Welsh rarebit.
Instead of the seafood cocktail with whipped cream?
No.
You mean, madame, she wishes to eat them both?
- Yes.
- Double up on the cheese.
- I know something that tastes perfectly vile.
- Good, what is it?
Lobster with gobs of mayonnaise.
- Wonderful.
- Oh, yes.
Instead of the Welsh rarebit...
...and seafood cocktail with whipped cream?
- No, all of them.
- That lobster sounds wonderful.
Bring me an order of that.
Pardon, madame, but that all makes a very bad combination.
Yes, I know.
Now all you need is a good, solid dessert.
May I suggest cucumbers and buttermilk.
- Yes.
- Wonderful.
And a side order of strawberry shortcake.
- Have you got all that?
- Yes.
Seafood cocktail with whipped cream.
A largish Welsh rarebit.
Lobster with gobs of mayonnaise.
Cucumbers and buttermilk.
I think I better go home and go to bed, Amanda.
Oh, no, the fun's just beginning.
Mine got near the end when you ate that second Welsh rarebit.
- Please, let's forget the experiment.
- Don't you feel sleepy, Miss Cooper?
Never felt better in my life.
In fact, now I'm sorry
I had to pass up that second lobster.
Oh, Amanda, please.
Are you sure you're not sleepy?
Not a bit. I'll go mix you some drinks.
Well, as long as your niece feels so well...
...and Steve is obviously not so good,
I think I'd better see him home.
Good night, Miss Cooper.
Good night.
Come on, there's nothing really wrong with you.
It's all in your mind.
Think you're all right and you'll be all right.
Oh, but those cucumbers and buttermilk...
...and lobsters and strawberry shortca...
See what I mean?
Oh, doctor, here's the sedative you asked me to bring over.
Connors, you better go in there, give Miss Cooper a teaspoonful.
- It's very important. Make her take it.
- Miss Cooper, yes, sir.
Steve, maybe we better walk down.
- Are you Miss Cooper?
- Yes.
Dr. Flagg sent me to take care of you.
Well, how nice of Dr. Flagg.
Come in.
What does he think should be done?
Well, I'm gonna give you something that'll relax you completely.
Sit down.
Perhaps we'd better talk this over first.
Now, first,
I want you to have confidence in me.
I have a feeling I'm going to have complete confidence in you.
Well, that's just fine.
I'm so glad you're a friend of Dr. Flagg's.
I have no confidence in strangers.
Dr. Flagg is a remarkable man.
Dr. Flagg always knows what's best.
I can believe that.
Now...
I want you to take just a little sip of this.
All right. What is it?
It... It'll help relax you.
All right, but I'm not at all nervous.
Now, go right in and go to bed.
Cocktail with whipped cream.
A good, solid dessert.
Cucumbers and buttermilk.
Gobs of mayonnaise.
Strawberry shortcake.
Strange how a dreary world
Can suddenly change
To a world as bright
As the evening star
Queer what a difference
When your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are
I used to be colorblind
But I met you
And now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the sky
That semicircle
That was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud
It's a rainbow
You brought the colors out
Believe me, it's really true
Till I met you
I never knew a setting sun
Could paint such beautiful skies
I never knew
There were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes
Aunt Cora, do you believe in dreams?
Certainly. I had a humdinger last night.
If it was a dream.
I had the loveliest time in mine.
Everything happened.
I wasn't so lucky.
Nothing happened.
- Lobster?
- Breakfast, lunch or dinner.
I'm taking no chances.
I wanna pick up where I left off in my dream...
...if I can.
- A big gob of mayonnaise.
- Mayonnaise?
Yes, for the lobster.
In my dream,
I was with the most wonderful man.
Me too. It was so realistic.
- He was all in white.
- Are you sure it was a dream?
Positive. Nothing like that ever happened to me in real life.
Wonder if it's possible to fall in love with a man you dream about.
Oh, I'm positive.
Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Stephen.
Good morning, Amanda.
How do you feel?
- Marvelous.
- Did you sleep well?
- Marvelous.
- Well, good.
I thought I'd drive you over to see Dr. Flagg.
- Marvelous.
- Amanda...
...do you realize you're being repetitious?
I hate to mention that awful food you both ate, but I was worried about you.
Just thinking about it kept me awake all night.
Mayonnaise.
Marvelous.
Tony, it happened. Congratulate us.
- Did you get married?
- Not quite, but Amanda dreamed.
Well, Miss Cooper.
So our little experiment worked.
Yes, doctor, marvelously.
Sit right down now, Amanda, and tell us all about it.
Steve, this is a matter between Miss Cooper and myself.
Why? We're all in on it. If there's anything
I shouldn't know, I ought to know it now.
Women tell their doctors things they don't want anyone to hear.
- I know, but I'm gonna be her husband.
- Especially husbands.
Now, Miss Cooper, tell me all about your dream.
- Did you dream of anyone in particular?
- Yes.
Fine. Who was it?
Oh, I can't.
Now, Miss Cooper, don't think of me as anyone.
Just think of me as your doctor.
You must have every confidence in me.
Oh, I have.
Then tell me all about it.
I can't.
Very well.
Thank you very much.
That's all.
Well, doctor, when do you wanna see me again?
There's no point in seeing you again.
Oh, but you must. I mean...
Well, I'll recommend several other doctors to you.
And no doubt you'll find one in whom you'll have more confidence.
But I don't want another doctor.
Miss Cooper,
I was persuaded by Steve to talk to you.
And from what I see, there's nothing very wrong with you.
Are you sure?
Compared to complex cases, which really need me...
...no.
Oh, what...
Oh, well, then...
...I guess I'd better tell you my dream.
I've had it for 11 straight years.
Tell me about it.
Well, you've heard of Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf?
Yes, I have.
Well, that's what I dreamed about.
You dreamed you were
Little Red Riding Hood?
No, I was the wolf.
What did you do?
I snarled.
And then l...
All of a sudden,
I became Little Red Riding Hood...
...and then suddenly
I was a lot of numbers.
- Numbers?
- Yes, l... I was a radio dial.
Understandable. That's part of your profession, singing on the radio?
Yes. Yes, but you haven't heard it all yet.
It seemed that all night long, there were thousands of people...
...that kept turning me off and turning me on...
...turning me off and turning me on.
Half the time I was singing, and the other half I was advertising.
Then... Then there were voices.
Voices, thousands of voices...
...and then they started to chase me, to persecute me.
- Who?
- My persecutors.
- Persecution complex.
- Yes.
And then...
Then I was running away from them...
...and I was gaining miles ahead of them...
...when all of a sudden,
I turned into a maple tree.
And then I took a shortcut across the stream.
And a huge fish raised itself out of the water and snapped at me.
It was a dogfish.
Then I looked behind me, and thousands...
Thousands of squirrels...
...had jumped the river and like a pack of hungry wolves were rushing at me.
- Oh, I was frantic.
- Yes.
- They were coming closer.
- Yes.
- They were on me from every side.
- Yes.
- From the front.
- Yes.
- From the back.
- Yes.
From all sides of me, their teeth snapping at me.
- I couldn't escape.
- What happened?
They got me.
- Please, could I have just a little water?
- Oh, yes, of course.
Yes, Dr. Flagg?
Dr. Powers, will you please come right over to my office.
Oh, thank you, doctor.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, quite all right. Thank you, doctor.
Then if you'll excuse me,
I'll just be a moment.
- She's wonderful, Steve.
- Of course she is. I know that.
She's a mass of the most horrible neuroses and inhibitions I've come in contact with.
- What's the matter with her?
- What is it, doctor?
I've run across the most beautiful case of complex maladjustments.
- Where?
- In there, in my office.
This is one of the happiest days of my life.
- What did you find, old chap?
- Vulpine complex.
- Child psychosis, a classic example.
- No.
- Yes.
- My congratulations, old chap. I envy you.
- What's wrong with her?
- I'll find a million more.
She's untapped. She's got everything wrong with her.
- You mean Amanda?
- Follow it through.
- How long do you think it'll take?
- Years. Five, 10. We never know.
Will you assist me in my laboratory?
Delighted. I can hardly wait.
Mind telling me what's the matter with Miss Cooper?
Not at all.
She sounds like a textbook case.
Well, how do we feel now?
A little tired, doctor.
But, oh, so relieved.
Now, there's absolutely nothing to be afraid of.
I know that, doctor, because I'm in your hands.
Good. Now, first,
I'm gonna give you an anesthetic.
Well, what for?
It'll effect a temporary release of any inhibitions.
It's not a cure, but I can get an idea of what's wrong with you.
But is an anesthetic necessary?
It's the simplest way.
The effect will wear off in an hour or so.
And meanwhile I can talk to you.
If you want to talk to me, why put me to sleep?
I'm going to talk to your subconscious mind.
It never sleeps. But while under the influence of an anesthetic...
...we very often say things or do things we wouldn't under normal conditions.
Well, if you think it's all right.
It gives the doctor a clue to the patient's personality.
Dr. Powers, this is Miss Cooper, the young lady I just told you about.
This is a pleasure, a great pleasure.
I'll take your things.
Now, if you'll just lie here,
Miss Cooper.
Try to make your mind a blank.
That'll be very easy for me to do, doctor.
Now, just relax.
You mustn't be nervous.
Breathe slowly.
Inhale...
...exhale.
That's fine.
Now, Miss Cooper, when you come out of this...
...I want you to do whatever you want to do...
...and say whatever you want to say.
For the time being, release yourself completely.
You will act wholly on the impulse of the moment.
That'll be all for now.
We'll let her sleep a bit.
Come to my office and tell me all about it.
- With pleasure.
- These unusual cases excite me so.
This waiting's awful.
- Would you like a drink?
- Oh, I'd love one.
No, thanks.
Yes.
Hold on. It's for you, Mr. Arden.
Hello? I mean, hello.
Yes, Aunt Cora.
Amanda? Yes, she's here.
Stop dawdling, both of you.
Tell Amanda to get to that broadcasting station.
All right, I'll get her there.
Tony?
Tony!
Tony.
Amanda.
Amanda. Amanda.
Oh, Tony.
This isn't Tony, it's Steve.
- Go away, Steve.
- Amanda, you haven't time to sleep now.
You have a broadcast in 10 minutes.
Oh, yes, I'm looking forward to that.
Amanda, come on.
All right, but don't rush me.
Oh, Steve, what's that?
Oh, Amanda.
Button, button.
- Oh, boy!
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, Amanda.
- Oh, Amanda.
Amanda, are you all right?
Simply marvelous.
It's a present.
Very funny.
Good day.
- Will you get us a cab, please?
- Yes, sir. Careful.
Taxi. Taxi.
Amalgamated Broadcasting Company.
Take Madison Avenue and hurry.
- Steve, where's Miss Cooper?
- I don't know, she's gone.
She's under an anesthetic.
What'd you take her away for?
- She has a broadcast in 10 minutes.
- She's in no condition to broadcast.
She's not normal, might even act a little odd.
Might?
Thank you.
Oh, that's cute.
Do you mind if I try?
Well...
All right, here.
Now swing it.
- Swing it.
- Like that. Swing it.
Amanda, darling, where have you been?
Don't you know we're on the air in 10 seconds?
Miss Cooper's script.
- Miss Cooper's script.
- Miss Cooper's script.
Here. Here it is.
Nod to the sponsor, dear.
"The Sentela Toothpaste Hour presents its 'Melody Time'...
...starring Amanda Cooper."
Hello, you.
All of you.
"And a distinguished supporting cast.
This is Franklyn Harrison Jr...
...speaking on the Amalgamated Network for Sentela.
If you want a kissable mouth...
...all you have to do is use Sentela toothpaste.
It makes your teeth happy.
Now, before I hand Miss Cooper over to her million listeners...
...I want to give you some serious information about toothpaste.
If you really want to preserve your teeth..."
Use anything but Sentela.
- Miss Cooper, you say the funniest things.
- Oh, thank you very much.
- You're gonna be all right, Miss Cooper.
- Call me Amanda, Tony.
Miss Cooper.
I'm going to sue you for damages.
Don't worry about damages.
Mr. Arden will pay everything, won't you, Steve?
- Why, yes.
- Amanda, what's happened?
Everything, darling.
You should have been with me.
There you are, young lady.
Just a minute, officer.
This young lady's my patient...
That doesn't give her a right to destroy private property.
Now, Mr. Arden will pay for any damage she's done. Won't you, Steve?
Yes.
Are you sure she's all right?
I'll assume every responsibility for her actions.
Well, as long as everything's gonna be squared up...
...there's no reason to arrest her.
Thank you, officer.
Amanda, striking an officer is a very serious offense.
- She didn't strike him, Joe, she kicked him.
- Yeah, and a beaut.
Aunt Cora, please.
I've already explained, judge, that it was largely my fault.
I'm beginning to gather that,
Dr. Flagg.
Amanda, I've known you all your life.
There's nothing wrong with you.
My advice as a friend is to give up these treatments.
And my advice as a physician...
...is Miss Cooper should continue the treatments.
My advice, Joe, is to call the whole silly thing off before everybody gets sore.
Cora, will you please recognize that this is an official enquiry?
Oh, all right, I recognize it.
But it doesn't alter my opinion.
Dr. Flagg, it is not within my rights to prescribe your duties to you...
...but I can warn you that unless these experiments...
...are confined to your laboratory...
...I will hold you responsible for Miss Cooper's actions.
- Have I made myself clear?
- Quite.
I'd like to know something, Joe.
- Well?
- Wait a minute, Aunt Cora.
- The judge has been very lenient.
- He's been a dear.
- Just let it wait for another time, dear.
- Oh, all right, then.
Just wanted to ask if he'd have dinner with us tonight.
I'd be delighted.
There, you see?
Thank you.
Well, Steve, here's to you and Amanda.
Thanks. Here's hoping your treatments will be successful.
In my day, the women didn't have to ask their doctor when to get married.
- You're a bachelor, judge?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Were you ever anxious to dance with a man you dreamed you danced with?
Don't be silly.
I never dream about dancing.
Miss Cooper, Miss Cooper.
I'll tell the gentlemen you're waiting.
Thank you, Henry.
Amanda, what in the world are you grinning at?
Don't tell anyone, but I'm in love.
Well, get the agony over and marry him.
He doesn't know it.
I think you're very nasty to say that, Amanda.
Steve isn't that dumb.
I'm in love with my doctor.
Cora, you invited me to dinner.
Where is it?
Right over there.
You know, I'd like to dance right now.
Don't you think you ought to dance the first one with Steve?
You'd better let me have my own way,
Dr. Flagg.
Just remember, Judge Travers is holding you responsible for my actions.
I'd be flattered to dance the second dance with you.
I'd like to find out who threw that.
I'd give them 90 days.
Dance?
Well, it'll take less time than 90 days.
Well, I was willing.
Oh, Lou, please do me a favor and play another number.
I will, if you will sing it.
All right.
Come on and hear the yam man cry
Any yam today?
The sweet potato that he'll fry
Will be yam today
The little step that you'll see him do
With every yam that he sells to you
It's something that you ought to try
Come and yam
Yam
Come on and yam today
Come get what I've got
It will hit the spot
Get your sweet and hot yam
Raise your hand and sway
Like you hold a tray
When you're on your way
Yam
Come on, shake your depression
And let's have a yam session
There's that long note
One, two, three
Yam
Every orchestra in America
Will be doing the
Yam
I didn't come to do the Charleston
I didn't come to ball the jack
I didn't come to do the Suzy-Q
Or do the bottom they call black
I didn't come to do big apple
I didn't come to do the shag
Well, honey, here I am to do the yam
Because the yam is in the bag
Funny that I should envy a man who should really envy me.
I mean, Tony.
I was really jealous, the way you two danced together.
Steve, I wanna talk to you about Tony.
What's the matter with him?
Nothing. I think he's wonderful.
You don't have to tell me about Tony.
I've known him for years. Swell guy.
Yes, I know.
What I want to say, Steve, is since I've known Tony...
...I'm convinced for the first time that I'm in love.
Are you sure?
Yes. I probably shouldn't have told you like that...
...but I didn't know how else to say it.
Good old Tony.
I knew he wouldn't let me down.
Amanda, I don't know what else to say except, I'll make you a wonderful husband.
Steve.
Tony. Aunt Cora.
- Prepare yourselves for a shock.
- She told you.
- Yes.
- What's up, Steve?
My congratulations, Tony.
You accomplished more in a week than I did in two years.
- I admire the way you're taking it, Steve.
- Why not?
Amanda just told me she's ready now to marry me.
- Amanda's going to what?
- Judge, I want you to marry us.
- Delighted, delighted.
- Congratulations, Steve.
Put that water down.
Henry, champagne.
Champagne for my friends.
- Amanda, come dance with me.
- Mind if I had this dance with Tony?
Good old Tony.
I should say I don't mind.
We'll have plenty of time to dance later on.
Come on, Aunt Cora.
Oh, sit down, Joe.
Hold me close, Tony.
I have something to tell you.
Now, no matter what I say or how it may affect you, smile.
Smile?
And keep smiling.
All right.
Something very unfortunate has happened.
And you're mixed up in it.
It's my fault entirely.
I was trying to tell Steve that I didn't want to marry him...
...because I wasn't in love with him.
Because I'm in love with you.
Smile, there's Steve.
What am I going to do?
I don't know.
Well, I can't hurt Steve, and I just can't marry him.
Of course not.
In the meantime,
I think we'd both better smile.
Sit down, Joe.
You know, Steve, I think you and Amanda should see me tomorrow in my office.
Say about 11:00.
Oh, no. No more treatments.
Let's let well enough alone.
I think we'd better, Steve.
No, Tony, you've served your purpose beautifully.
You've been a scientific Cupid.
I'm afraid I'll have to insist, Steve.
Well, as long as you insist.
And if it'll make you happy, old boy.
Amanda can see you in the morning.
- Good evening, Judge Travers.
- Oh, good evening, Grace.
Oh, sit down, Joe.
The doctor will be right out.
- Morning, Amanda. Miss Cooper.
- Morning.
- Good morning. Hello, Connors.
- Hi.
Well, Dr. Flagg, you were absolutely right to have us all here...
...so you could explain to Steve.
Pity he had to shoot the judge.
I mean, for the finals in the scat meet this morning.
- Mind if I spoke to your niece alone?
- Certainly not.
Connors, escort Miss Cooper to her car...
...and wait till Amanda gets there.
She won't be long.
Don't hurry.
Since Mr. Connors is no longer confused, maybe he'll prove entertaining.
Sure, but I gotta have a deck of cards.
Please sit down, Amanda.
Amanda...
...that dream you told me about, it wasn't true, was it?
No, Tony.
You dreamed about me, didn't you?
Yes, Tony.
And as a result of that dream, you thought you loved me.
Yes, Tony.
Dreams are very curious things, Amanda.
Very often, the dream fantasy makes things seem true to the dreamer...
...when in reality, they have no basis in fact.
When we first met, there was a confusion in your mind regarding Steve.
When you agreed to our first experiment, you felt you could be helped by me.
Now, since we learn to depend on those we are confident can help us...
...it's not at all unusual for that temporary dependence to be mistaken for love.
In your frame of mind at that time...
...you would've fallen in love with any doctor.
That's understandable, isn't it?
What's wrong, Amanda?
I guess that I'm just worried about Steve, that's all.
- Do you still have confidence in me?
- Yes, Tony.
Will you do as I ask?
Yes, Tony.
You just sit here.
Keep your eyes fixed on this light.
Now you're feeling sleepy.
Very sleepy.
Yes, Tony.
Your eyes are growing heavy, Amanda.
Close them.
Close them.
Now you're asleep.
You're fast asleep.
You're in a trance now.
I will bring you out of it shortly.
You will act and be perfectly normal in every respect...
...except that you will have these new thoughts...
...which I am about to put in your mind.
You will remember everything
I'm about to tell you.
Now, repeat after me everything I say:
I love Stephen.
I'm going to marry Stephen.
I love Stephen.
I'm going to marry Stephen.
Dr. Flagg is a horrible monster.
Dr. Flagg is a horrible monster.
Men like him should be shot down like dogs.
Men like him should be shot down like dogs.
I love Stephen. I don't love Tony.
I love Stephen. I don't love Tony.
Tony doesn't love me.
Tony doesn't love me.
Tony doesn't love me.
Tony doesn't love me.
- That's enough.
- That's enough.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
What are you acting so silly about?
You don't love that girl.
Oh, yes, you do.
Who said that?
Your subconscious mind.
You know, the one that never sleeps.
If you had any sense, you'd psychoanalyze yourself and admit you love her.
Nonsense.
What a cluck you are, Tony.
- Why?
- Why?
Because you're so dumb you didn't realize...
...she was crying because she's in love with you.
- You really believe that?
- Certainly.
If you doctors weren't such wise guys...
...you'd forget your textbooks once in a while.
What do you think I ought to do?
Go in there and take back those silly ideas you just put in her head.
Yes, and then what?
Then kiss her, you dope.
I think maybe you've got something there.
I must go to Stephen.
I must drive to Stephen.
All right, but Dr. Flagg told me to stick around...
...so I'll sit in the rumble seat.
Medwick Country Club, as fast as you can make it.
Pull.
Dead a pair.
Quiet. Quiet, please.
Quiet, please.
Please. Please, please, please.
Thank you.
Good luck, judge.
Thank you, Steve. Same to you.
You're going to need it.
Stephen.
I must see Stephen.
- Are you ready, gentlemen?
- Pull.
Dead a pair.
Connors. Of all the silly things.
Come out of there.
Honestly, men are such cowards, hiding like that.
You'll feel better after you buy me a drink.
- Pull.
- Stephen!
- No birds.
- This is no place for you, Amanda.
- From now on, my place is with Stephen.
- Amanda, darling.
Oh, fiddle-fuddle.
He's a horrible monster.
Men like him should be shot down like dogs.
I'm sorry, judge,
I don't think she meant you.
- Stephen, I wanna do everything you do.
- That's fine, but right now I want to shoot.
Sorry, judge.
Pull.
- Amanda, you're wonderful.
- So are you, Stephen.
- Did you see that, judge?
- See it? Those are my birds!
Don't lose your temper.
There are plenty more.
Don't lose my temper?
My best hat, a real Tyrollean.
Amanda, this is no time to shoot hats.
I'm sorry, judge.
Thank you, sir.
Amanda. Amanda.
Men like him should be shot down like dogs.
- Put that gun down, Amanda.
- Amanda.
That's my gun. It's loaded.
Look out, Stephen,
I don't wanna shoot you.
- Put that gun down.
- Put that gun down, Amanda.
- You'll hurt somebody.
- That gun's loaded.
- Look out.
- What...?
- Put that gun down.
- Look out!
Why don't you take that gun away from her?
What's that?
A thing called scat.
They play it with guns.
What's everybody running for?
Probably one of the silly rules.
Please, please, please.
- What's the matter with Amanda?
- She's never acted like this before.
- She's never been hypnotized before.
- Hypnotized?
I put a couple of wrong ideas in her mind.
I've got to get them out while she's in the trance.
Well, get them out.
Shot down like dogs.
Shot down like dogs.
Shot down like dogs.
The gun is empty.
What are we hiding for?
That's right, she's fired both shots, Tony.
- Amanda, I wanna talk to you.
- I'm going to shoot.
- Are you sure that gun's empty?
- Yes, yes.
Oh, it is?
Amanda. Wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up, Amanda.
- Is she out of it?
- Yes.
Dr. Flagg, you and Steve appear in my chambers tomorrow morning.
Amanda, Roland here tells me you had a gun and went crazy.
What are you talking about?
How did I get here? Oh, Stephen.
- Are you sure there's no more danger?
- Yes, she's all right now.
Oh, thank heavens, thank heavens, thank heavens.
There's no reason to be nervous, Tony.
I'll explain to the judge that your treatments have been so successful...
...that Amanda's finally set the date for our marriage.
- She has?
- Tomorrow.
I hate to hurt your feelings, Tony...
...but Amanda's made it quite clear that she never wants to see you again.
She keeps mumbling something about shooting you down like a dog.
I can't get it out of her head.
Steve...
...I've got to hypnotize her again.
- What? For what?
I put those terrible thoughts about me into her head before I realized...
...that I love her.
You what?
I'm sorry, Steve, but I didn't realize until after she had told me that she loved me.
She what?
It's only fair to her...
...for me to remove those unnatural thoughts from her mind...
...and then she can choose between us.
What happens if you don't remove the thoughts?
She'd marry you, be unhappy...
...and go through the rest of her life hating me.
You wouldn't want that to happen.
No, I should say not.
Amanda has to be happy.
And as long as she loves you,
I'll just step out of the picture.
Thanks, Steve.
Just let me handle everything with the judge.
- All right.
- My Tyrollean hat.
- Good morning, Judge Travers.
- How's Amanda?
- She's fine.
- I didn't ask you.
Tell him, Steve.
Tell him the news.
Before anybody tells me,
I'm gonna tell you something.
It's because of my consideration for Steve and Amanda...
...that this case is not being held in open court.
May I suggest, then, that we conduct it as such in here?
Granted.
Sit down, Tony.
Before I begin, Your Honor,
I apologize for any lack of eloquence.
It is with difficulty that I speak...
...because friendships are involved.
My heart is full.
Tony, I want you to answer these few questions, yes or no.
Yes.
Isn't it true that at a dinner party...
...you heard my announcement of an impending marriage?
- Yes, but you see...
- Just answer yes or no.
Your Honor, I am pleading for my own happiness and Amanda's.
This man, with subtle, scientific witchcraft...
...has insidiously tried to worm his way into the affections...
...of my sweet, simple wife-to-be,
Amanda Cooper.
- Sit down.
- And now he has the unmitigated gall...
...to seek to get to her subconscious, as he so aptly puts it, once more.
But I protest.
She has suffered enough. I ask...
No, I demand a court order restraining this gentleman...
...from ever seeing or even speaking to Amanda Cooper again...
...under the extreme penalty of the law.
Granted.
And so, my friends, tomorrow at this same time...
...the case of Amanda Cooper versus Stephen Arden...
...will have been closed.
And I shall take keen personal delight...
...in sentencing you both to life imprisonment:
Marriage.
Sit down, Joe.
Remind me a little later to speak to you about those corny jokes.
Cora?
Joe, you know I don't dance at your age.
- Good evening, Judge Travers.
- Good evening.
- Mind if I dance with Aunt Cora?
- I certainly...
Certainly, he wouldn't.
Amanda, may I have this dance?
No. And if you want to get arrested, just keep on talking.
He's a horrible monster.
I've got to tell her something.
You'd better forget it for a while.
If you can't talk, you can't tell her.
Must you dance
Every dance
With the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him
Since the music began
Won't you change partners
And dance with me?
Must you dance
Quite so close
With your lips touching his face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place
Won't you change partners
And dance with me?
Ask him to sit this one out
And while you're alone
I'll tell the waiter to tell him
He's wanted on the telephone
You've been locked
In his arms
Ever since heaven knows when
Oh, won't you change partners
And then
You may never want
To change partners again
Would you mind if we went outside for some fresh air?
- It's awfully stuffy in here.
- Not at all, sweetheart.
I'm sorry he upset you, dear.
There's no reason we should let him spoil our whole evening.
I think he's contemptible.
Oh, Amanda, don't say that.
Tony's all right.
Except that he's a dirty, double-crossing scientist.
You're wanted on the telephone, sir.
Just take the message, please.
It's a long-distance call, sir.
Person-to-person.
- Come along, Amanda.
- No, I'll meet you in the pavilion.
I'll only be a moment.
- Hello?
- Mr. Arden, long distance is calling.
One moment, please.
Go ahead with Honolulu, operator.
This is Mr. Steve Arden, please?
Yes, yes, who's this?
This is Miss Satsuma Naguchi, please.
- Who?
- Miss Satsuma Naguchi, please.
I would like information about your marriage...
...to honorable lady Miss Cooper.
I am editor "Woman's Column,"
Honolulu Daily Bugle.
Honolulu Daily what?
- Bugle.
- What?
Bugle, you know:
Amanda, may I speak to you, please?
- You certainly may not.
- But please, Amanda.
I'm awfully sorry, Miss Satsumi.
I don't understand a word you're saying.
Not Miss Satsumi,
Miss Naguchi, please.
And if you do not understand, you must be very stupid man, I think so.
I call you up like polite lady to get simple information.
And now you make a big fuss about nothing, I think so.
So I will commence with the beginning.
This is Miss Satsuma Naguchi,
Honolulu...
Amanda, I want you to repeat after me everything I say.
Amanda, Amanda!
Dr. Flagg, stop that.
Stop that immediately.
Amanda. Amanda, wake up.
Oh, Stephen.
Hattie, have you ever been married?
- No, ma'am, but I've been engaged.
- Oh, just as good.
- No, ma'am, it's a lot better.
- Hattie.
I've opened the door for you five times in the last 10 minutes...
...and Steve has caught me every time.
Come in through the window.
Don't let Joe see you.
He's issued a bench warrant for your arrest.
And in case you don't know it, the ceremony starts in five minutes.
- That doesn't give us much time.
- I guess it's too late.
After the trouble we had getting you a marriage license?
But it's no good unless
I can get to her unconscious mind.
That'd take longer than five minutes.
I'd get her unconscious in under five minutes.
I'd bust her in the jaw.
I guarantee she'd be unconscious.
Oh, don't be ridi...
Let's find that open window.
Oh, hello, Steve.
- We just came in through the window.
- Yeah, I guess we're in the wrong room.
Hi, kids.
Get out of here before I call Steve.
Amanda, darling, for what
I'm about to do, please forgive me.
Oh, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.
Hey, doc, duck!
Amanda, darling.
Hurry up, doc, get to her unconscious before she comes to.
Repeat after me:
Tony loves Amanda.
Tony loves Amanda.
Stand up, Joe.

Miss Penny, Miss Vincent wishes to see you.
- [Woman] Miss Penny is here now.
- Hello, Gus.
- Hello, Miss Penny.
- Is my daddy here?
Penny, come here, please.
Penny, I have some sad news for you.
But you'll be a brave little girl, won't you?
- Is it about my daddy?
- Yes, Penny.
- Has anything happened to him?
- No. No, dear, no.
But he's sent for you.
You're going to leave us.
- Are you gonna take me right now, Gus?
Right this minute?
- Yes, Miss Penny.
- I'm gonna live with my daddy at the Riverview?
- Yes, Miss Penny.
On and on, for keeps?
- Yes, Miss Penny.
- Oh, Gus!
Maybe I'd better wait outside.
It's very sad news, Miss Vincent, but I wanna be brave... even though I am gonna miss everybody so much.
- And now I'd better pack. Don't you think?
- Oh, yes.
- It's not polite to keep people waiting.
- No, dear.
Please, may I be excused?
I feel awful sad about leaving you, Miss Vincent.
- Good-bye! [Laughs]
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Miss Burns.
- [Door Closes]
I wonder why Mr. Hale is taking her out of school so suddenly.
They're going abroad, no doubt.
It wouldn't be finances.
His last check is overdue.
Finances? Hardly-- with the Riverview as an address?
- Why, Miss Penny.
- Hello, Corporal.
- Please don't stop me now.
I've gotta find my daddy.
- Wait a minute.
Hey, Penny, come back here!
Fine doorman you are-- Lettin' her go right through the door.
What kind of a doorman you call that?
Hello, Mr. Waters.
I'm back.
Uh, Miss H-- Uh--
[Chuckles]
[Man]
No, no, no. [Groans]
[Shouting French]
Attention.
[Continues In French]
- La porte.
- No, no "la porte."
Attention. Attention.
[French Continues]
- La table.
- No! No!
- [Shouting In French]
- All right. Have it your way then.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
[French]
Je m'appelle Penny.
[French]
- What'd she say?
- What did she say?
Did you not listen?
A lesson we have one week behind.
J'habite ici.
"I live here."
That proves how stupid you are.
- You don't live here and neither does she.
- Don't mind him.
He's all mixed up. I'm the one who lives here-- My daddy and me.
I beg your pardon.
This is my uncle's apartment.
I live here with my mother and my sister and my Uncle Sam. Now, kindly vacate our premises.
Do you think I don't know where I live?
We've lived here three years.
Unless you want trouble with my daddy, you'd better get out and--
I'm more sorry than I can say. I'm deeply embarrassed. Come along, Miss Hale, quickly.
- But why?
- Run along, little girl. Scat! Shoo!
- Daddy!
- I'm taking you to your daddy right now.
- Where are you?
- This is very unfortunate. I apologize.
It will never happen again.
I assure you. I'm very sorry.
- I'm distraught, distrait.
- Daddy!
- Miss Hale, will you please-- Listen--
- Daddy!
Children are impossible these days.
They don't ask if they live in your house, they just tell you.
They walk right in and tell you.
You haven't a moment of privacy... without some child coming in to tell you she lives with you.
Mother, I pointed out her mistake to her emphatically--
- not only in English, but in French.
- In French? Bah!
But why did Daddy move?
He liked our penthouse, and I loved it.
Oh, questions, questions.
Curiosity killed a cat once.
- Your cat?
- Yes-- Uh, no.
And stop saying "our penthouse."
It isn't yours. Not anymore.
- [Dog Barking]
- [Clicking Tongue]
- Kitty.
- Penny, darling!
- Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
- Oh!
Show Miss Hale to her father's apartment at once. Oh!
- That's it, boy. That's it, boy.
- Whoa!
- Come on.
- [Barking]
[Laughing]
[Barking Continues]
Okay.
This is my new job since I've seen you last.
I think it's a wonderful way to earn money-- just playing with dogs.
Yeah, that's what I thought when I took the job.
But everybody's got their troubles, I guess.
Gee, even little half-pints like you.
Now, you got a good, strong chin.
Keep it up, darling, no matter what happens.
- What for?
- Hello, Penny.
Hello, Mrs. O'Toole.
Mr. Hale? Mr. Hale?
Daddy?
- Penny. Oh.
- [Laughs]
- Oh!
- Oh, Daddy! Daddy!
I went up to the penthouse.
A lot of funny people live there now.
No wonder you moved down here.
- Did Gus take you up there?
- Oh, no.
I just supposed--
I mean, I thought--
Gus didn't take me.
Well, he's working for those people now because we haven't any job for him.
- I... sold our car.
- Oh.
Well, then, you and I are gonna have a lot of nice walks together, aren't we?
Oh, sure.
Do you remember--
Do you remember how hard I used to work before you went away to school?
How I was always planning buildings and putting them up?
We had hardly any time at all to be together.
And you were tired all the time.
Well, that wasn't so good, was it?  But it made money.
We had money to live in a penthouse and have a car and Gus and all the others.
But now it's awfully hard to get jobs.
There seem to be enough buildings, so I'm not working... and we haven't so much in our pocketbook.
But you see what that means? It means we have all that extra time to be together.
- That's a lot better, isn't it?
- Sure it is.
But there's one thing
I want to do.
There's one thing
I want to finish.
That's the one building your daddy wants to finish.
- Why?
- I put all my money into it.
A lot of other men did too, because it took a great deal.
Then we had bad times, and a banker came along and took it away from us.
- What's a banker?
- [Chuckles]
Well, a banker--
A banker is a sort of person that, uh-- that keeps things that belong to other people.
- You mean a burglar?
- [Chuckling] Oh, no.
No, darling, not that.
But we're not licked. And your daddy is gonna make that banker understand... that he must let me go through with the deal.
And then we can move upstairs, and you can go back to school.
Who wants to go upstairs and go back to school?
Not me.
I like it here.
There aren't so many stairs to climb, and the rooms are small.
- I don't have to walk around so much.
- [Laughing]
- Oh!
- My legs are so short... it used to wear me out walking across that big apartment.
And it was so high, I used to get dizzy looking down at all the people.
- Remember?
- Uh-huh.
Now it's different.
I can look up.
It'll be fun guessing what kind of people go with all those feet.
And besides, it's about time somebody looked after you.
A man without a woman around the house is quite a problem.

Thank you, Miss Lola.
I'm glad I went away.

Just a minute, please.
What'll we do first?
Go to a movie or take a drive in the park or--
Well, I may not have much time.
I have a man to take care of.
- And you know how much trouble they can be.
- I certainly do.
We'll talk about it later.
Bye, darling.
- Good-bye, Miss Lola.
- [Dog Barking]
Isn't she nice, Kitty?
When she came up to see me at school with Daddy, even Miss incent liked her.
She's okay, but believe me, the rest of her tribe are wacky.
Hey, baby, look. Look what I won on the punchboard.
Whoo, you didn't do bad for a punch drunk.
Yeah. I'm goin' back every day.
Maybe I'll punch out a swing band.
Keep punchin'.
That's what I always say. [Laughs]
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.
- What is that thing?
- That ain't a thing.
It's a sax.

Hey, take it easy.
Old pickle-puss upstairs... is liable to come down here all spraddled out.
[Laughing] Pickle-puss?
Is that what you call Mr. Waters?
Yeah. Oh, but I wouldn't repeat it if I were you.
Why shouldn't she repeat it?
What's the harm in calling a pickle-puss a pickle-puss?
You might give the kid ideas.
You know, you're not exactly up on child psychology.
I ain't down on it.

Retreat now and explain later.

[No Audible Dialogue]
- Uh, Mr. Hale? Mr. Hale? [Clears Throat]
- Yes?
Mr. Hale, I may owe you a debt of gratitude for past favors, but--
- Now what's happened?
- But I am jeopardizing my position... by allowing you to reside here any longer.
- What are you leading up to?
- Your daughter.
She has a capacity for making otherwise sane individuals go berserk.
Now, unless you teach her to respect the dignity of the Riverview Arms... you must go, or I shall have to get a new enginee—engineer.
No, that is final.
Final.
[Door Opens, Closes]
Oh, there you are, Daddy.
I was working so hard,
I didn't even hear you.
Wasn't that funny?
[Laughing]
Penny, what have you been up to?
Oh, I'm just making some fudge. Taste?
The girls at school taught me.
It's the best fudge. Now, you just sit down and wait quietly, and--
And--
Well, you might as well let me have it.
No, sweetheart, not that.
But what have you been doing to Mr. Waters?
Oh, don't let's talk about me all the time.
How about you? I've had my fingers crossed and my feet crossed.
Did that big banker listen to our plan?
He did not.
He wouldn't even see me.
Never mind. If he comes here, we'll throw him out.
We won't be here to throw him out if you don't behave.
Waters will throw us out.
Why can't people be nice to other people?
[ Buzzer Buzzing]
- What's that?
- Wait a minute.
- [Buzzing Continues]
- That's it.
- What's it? What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
Everything is gonna be all right now.
I'm gonna see a man... and when I come back, everything's gonna be all fixed:
Money, job and everything.
[ Knocking]
- Jeff!
- Lola!
Listen, he's all alone.
There isn't a soul in the house.
Well, you're an angel.
- [Man] Come in. Come in. What do you want?
- Good luck, darling.
[Door Closes]
Well, I've never seen you before.
I think it's time you did.
I worked for you for two years.
Oh, yeah?
Did I fire ya?
- What's your name?
- Jeff Hale.
- I think you remember the name.
- Oh, Mr. Hale.
Yeah, the expensive Mr. Hale.
[Chuckles]
Yeah, Mr. Hale, the architect.
Yeah, the man who dreamed of the majestic
East Gate project.
- I worked through Mr. Warner, my attorney.
- Yeah, well, you may have... worked through him, but you got to me... for $10 million!
Yeah, you were the genius that handed me that $10 million lemon!
It isn't a lemon.
If you had vision?
Vision? Don't you talk to me about vision.
Come here.
Here, look at that.
Yeah, I don't need any vision to see that...
but I'll need a lot to see any of that $ 10 million again.
Who let you in here, young man?
If you want the truth, Lola did.
She believes in this project.
- She believes in me.
- And I believe that you are the nerviest rascal... that I ever met in a life knee-deep in rascals.
Using my niece to get in here, feeding her your crack-brained schemes.
- Careful. Remember your stomach.
- You leave my stomach out of it.
You leave her out of it too.
She's crack-brained enough without your help.
She's the sanest one in the family at that.
But they're all Einsteins compared to you.
Come here.
Now, you git.
- Mr. Henshaw--
- Git!
- Jeff, what happened? How'd it come out?
- Awful.
Oh, darling, sit down, tell me all about it.
There isn't much to tell.
I told him, and then he told me.
- But he had an edge.
- And he wouldn't even listen to what you had to say?
Honestly, darling, even if he is my own uncle--
Don't bother. You can't call him anything that I haven't.
Jeff, I know how we can get around him.
- Oh, let's forget about it.
- Oh, so, you're quitting?
I'm not quitting, but what can I do?
Listen, Jeff, I've been handling him since I was a little girl... and I've always gotten what I wanted.
You won't get anywhere trying to fight with him. You've got to go around him.
- Come on. Let's try it my way.
- Just to make conversation, what's your way?
- By way of Connecticut. Come on.
- Connecticut?
- What'll we do in Connecticut?
- Get married.
- Married?
- Don't you see? Once you're in the family... my uncle would have to do something.
- His pride would be at stake.
- What about my pride?
You can be proud when the building's built and people live in it.
- It's a failure now. You can't be proud of that.
- You don't understand.
What good would it do me to get it that way?
Supposing it flopped?
Then look. Married.
Starting out married life in the basement.
But, darling, I don't care where I live if it's with you.
That's what you think now. But you wouldn't think so as month after month passed on.
First, you'd make up with the old weasel, then you'd start calling on the penthouse.
Before long, you'd see no reason why
I shouldn't move up there with you.
So that's what you think of me. That's how much faith you have in my love for you.
I'm trying to be realistic.
Don't tell yourself stories.
Just because you're a quitter, you think I'm a quitter too.
So I'm a quitter?
That's a lovely sentiment.
Nice to know. All right.
I'll prove it to you.
- I'm quitting right now.
- Good. That suits me fine.
You couldn't stand any more good news today.
Mother's little lamb!
Now you go to the playroom, darling.
Be sure and play only with the good little boys and girls.
Be careful of your nice, new suit.
Oh-ooh! Darling!
[Blows]
Haven't you forgotten something?
Oh.
[French]
[Laughs]
Au revoir, mon petit.
Now, don't forget to come back for cocktails—tea, darling.
Mother wants to show you off to her friends.
[Sighs]
- Mow 'em down! Give 'em some more!
- [Gun Clicking]
That's what you squealers always get.
- [Chattering In Agreement]
- I guess that'll teach ya a lesson.
- You can't fool a G-woman.
- "G-man"!
- How many times do I gotta--
- You can't fool a G-man.
Now we'll get the other rat what squealed.
- Who is he, Mugsy?
- [Kids] Not me!
Aw, cut it out, Mugsy.
I had enough the last time.
Pipe the squealer.
- Hey, mug, you wanna play?
- I wouldn't be adverse to it.
- Does that mean he does or don't?
- I don't know.
- Okay, you're the squealer.
- You mean I'm the informer?
You'll find out what we mean. Come on.
We're taking you for a ride. That's what happened to guys what rat on their gang.
Just a minute.
I'll be something else.
- I don't choose to be a squealer.
- Well, we choose you.
[Kids Shouting]
- [Shouting Continues]
- Hey! Hey, stick 'em up!
Hold 'em up!
Stick 'em up! Stick 'em up!
Hey, Mugsy, come up here.
Hold 'em off.
Milton, come up here.
And don't you dare move till you see the whites of his eyes!
Come on, Milton!
Come on!
Aw, hiding behind a girl's petticoats!
[Kids Shouting]
I don't know how
I shall ever thank you.
- Well, let's see--
- You have marvelous courage for a girl.
When I play in that neighborhood,
I have to have.
I trust this is the inception of a beautiful friendship.
- Oh, do you wanna play some more?
- Oh, no.
- Come on.
- That's more like work.
But I can take you up to the playroom.
That's far superior to anything in town.
I know.
I used to play there.
We can have a ripping time.
Tag! You're it!
[Laughing]
- [Squealing]
- I'll get ya!
[Chattering, Laughing]
¶ [Classical Waltz]
Three hearts.
- Three spades.
- Double.
- ¶ [Continues]
- Tag! [Laughing]
- Kids, here's Penny.
- [Continues Laughing]
[Girl] I say, what are you doing here?
Why, I just came up to play with Milton.
Our mothers would never stand for our playing with you.
Miss Hale, you will leave here at once.
- Why, Mr. Waters?
- Miss Hale doesn't belong here.
She's the daughter of our house engineer, and she's not allowed in the playroom.
He can't put you out if I want you here.
Your mother would certainly uphold me, Master Ramsby.
Never mind, Milton.
It's a good thing Mr. Waters came... because I almost forgot.
- I have to help my daddy get dinner.
- [Clears Throat]
[Girl]
She even has to cook.
- Well, at least I'm a good cook.
- [ Kids Murmuring]
And stay out.
- I’m very sorry. It will never happen again. Never.
- [Chattering Resumes]
- Mr. Waters?
- Yes?
I wish to register a slight protest.
Well, you protest to your mother.
[Yelps]
Why--
Your mother--
I will?
I certainly will never--
[Sobbing]
[Sobbing Continues]
What's the matter, sweet?
I--I  got something in my eye.
- It's leaking.
- Hmm.
Let me try and get it out for you.
It'll be all right.
When I was a little boy,
I always found the quickest way... to remove extraneous matter from the eyes... was to put something in the mouth.
Thank you.
Daddy?
Daddy, I think I lost your job for you.
- Huh?
- I was up in the playroom.
I didn't mind what Gwendolyn said.
But Mr. Waters came in, and-- and he said
I shouldn't be there... because I was only the engineer's daughter.
Well, and so you are.
But there's nothing wrong with that. It's--
- It's honorable, isn't it?
- Absolutely.
Daddy,
I just don't understand.
Why is everything so mixed up?
Well, maybe this picture will make you understand. You see all these people:
The farmer, the housewife, the laborer--
Look what they're doing.
They're all pulling... on this one poor fellow,
Uncle Sam.
- What has he done?
- He's done everything he can, and still it's not enough.
He gives and he gives, and he tries to make everything right... but there just doesn't seem to be any end to it.
- Is he the president?
- He's greater than the president, darling.
He's the most important thing in the whole country, maybe in the world.
I don't think it's fair for everybody worrying Uncle Sam... especially when he gives all the money he can all the time.
It's not only money, darling.
He has to find places for people to live... and clothes for them to wear, find jobs.
That's the most important thing.
- How you gonna like that?
- Hmm.
Daddy, it's a wonder somebody doesn't try to help Uncle Sam for a change.
Well, lots of us try.
Well, I hope Uncle Sam doesn't get discouraged.
Don't you worry about that.
He's a tough old bird.
And pretty soon, he'll be back on his feet... stronger than ever, and then watch things boom.
And I'll build the tallest buildings in the whole world, and lots of them.
- Then we'll be happy, won't we?
- Mm-hmm.
¶ [Gus Humming]
- Gus?
- Hello, toots.
Gee, but you're beautiful, just like a repaint job.
Never mind that.
Did you read the morning paper?
No. I only look at the funny pictures. Why?
Well, get a load of this.
[Gus Whistles]
[ Kitty]
You may be lookin' for a job.
And me with the ring almost paid for.
Only 36 more installments.
[Scoffs]
Never mind, baby.
You can always eat as long as I got a job.
- Can I?
- Yeah. Dog biscuits.
Gee, you're a swell kid.
Ooh! Aren't those pretty?
White orchids, the most delicate of flowers.
- How do you do, Mr. Henshaw?
- I'm all right.
- How about a statement?
- No!
- Are you closing any factories?
- None of your business!
- [Reporters Shouting]
- Who's that?
That's my Uncle Sam.
Everybody knows him.
- [Shouting Continues]
- [Penny] Uncle Sam?
Oh.
Call the manager!
Call the police! [Shouting]
- Aren't you gonna help him?
- And implicate myself? Hardly.
Shame on you, fraidy-cat!
It's the only way to save the country.
- [Penny Shouting]
- [Groaning]
- Won't you stay?
- Get outta here, will you? Dash!
Uncle Sam.
Come on, Uncle Sam.
- A lot of reporters. All but a second, l--
- Come on.
- Come on in here. Come on.
- Oh, yeah. Here.
- [Grumbling]
- They didn't get us that time.
- You're safe for a little while, Uncle Sam.
- Uncle Sam?
- There. You'll be all right.
- I'm not all right!
- Oh, Mr. Hen…
I'm only here to help Uncle Sam.
Such impertinence,
Miss Hale.
Uh—Really, Mr. Henshaw,
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
- What have you to be sorry for?
- Uh--
Why, this young lady.
Isn't she annoying you? Well--
- Well!
- Well.
Here, you!
Milton, come back here.
Get—Oh, my nephew!
Huh!
A walking encyclopedia with curly hair, dressed up in fancy pants... and he's supposed to fill my shoes someday.
I guess you get pretty tired of it all.
Don't you, Uncle Sam?
Tired? I am sick of the whole kit and caboodle.
[Scoffs]
It--
- Hey, who are you anyway?
- I'm Penny.
You're Pen--
Oh, here.
- I suppose that's what you're waiting for.
- No, thank you.
- Why not?
- There are too many people taking money from you now.
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Eh?
I'm usually around about this time every day.
If you need any more help, just call, and I'll come.
Good-bye, Uncle Sam.
Keep your chin up.
[Clearing Throat]
- [Electric Clippers Whirring]
- [Dog Barking]
The less hair you have, the better Uncle Sam will like it.
Then he won't call you a curly-haired encyclopedia again.
I can't imagine anything any sillier than trying to please Uncle Sam.
- It can't be done.
- Hold still now.
- Hey!
- My, that works beautifully.
- Do you have to cut 'em all off?
- Certainly.
How can you fill
Uncle Sam's shoes someday... if you wear fancy pants and have curls?
- Let me see how it looks.
- No.
You better wait till I'm finished.
Now you'll only get a general idea.
I've—I've changed my mind.
You must stop this instantly.
- I'm suddenly aware of the grave significance of this.
- [Switches Off]
- Are you a man, or are you a mice?
- No, absolutely, no!
You shall not take off another strand.
Oh, very well. If you wanna look like a little girl...
- it's nothing to me.
- [Dog Barking]
[Sighs]
I hate curls on boys.
But, of course, that doesn't matter to you.
But it does.
In fact... that's the only reason why— why I agreed to in the first place.
If you want to stop there, it's all right with me.
- Penny--
- I'm very busy.
- [Dog Barking]
- You can cut off the rest of 'em.
Well, I'm not sure that I want to.
- But, of course, if you insist--
- [Whirring]
[Dog Barking]
There we are.
Sit back.
- Here, I'll get it.
- This is the first time this has ever happened to me.
- Getting your hair cut?
- No.
Giving in to somebody because I wanted to.
Giving in to a girl.
Giving in to such an attractive girl.
[Chuckles]
It's quite a change, but I think we're gonna like it.
You look, uh, more grown-up.
- There. Look.
- I do look more vigorous, don't I?
Mm-hmm. Just wait till your mother sees you.
Oh, I say, she did adore those curls.
- [Mugsy] Hiya, Penny.
- Hi, Mugsy.
- Who's that?
- That's Mugsy.
[Dogs Barking]
Hiya, bright eyes.
Say, where's the fancy layout you wanna swap me for?
Mugsy's gonna help us.
Just getting your hair cut isn't enough.
You've got to wear he-man clothes too. Right there on Milton.
- They're very expensive, Mugsy.
- Come on.
- I beg your pardon.
- Come on! One buck!
Hey! Hey, wait!
Hey, come back here!
You can't do that!
Come back.
Scram, bright eyes. I wouldn't wear that fancy layout if you give me a grand.
- Then give him back his money!
- You gotta make me.
Take your hands off that woman.
Do you hear me?
- So what?
- So this.
- [Dogs Barking]
- Lead with your left! Go on!
Go on! Get him!
Keep it up! That's right!
I wonder what's keeping Milton?
- I do want to show him off to you.
- I can hardly wait.
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am very proud of him.
It must be the mother in me.
Stop! You mustn't go in there.
- Why, Master Milton, what has happened?
- Shh!
[Mrs. Ramsby]
Is that you, lamby?
- [Waters] Mmm?
- [Giggles]
I'll bring him right up to you.
Well, you horrid little boy.
What are you doing here?
Mater, I'm Milton.
[Wails]
- [Wailing, Moaning]
- [Women Clamoring]
- What has happened, Mrs. Ramsby?
Um, uh, water! Water!
- [Wailing Continues]
Water— Quickly! Sir— Oh.
- [Wailing Continues]
- [Women, Waters Clamoring]
- [Clamoring Continues]
- Quiet!
- What's going on here?
- [Waters] It's Milton.
- The shock was too much for Mrs. Ramsby.
- [Mrs. Ramsby Wailing]
- Is this your work?
- Yes, sir, part of it. But I didn't do his eye.
His curls!
His beautiful curls!
- Take that awful child away.
- Yes. Come along.
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Come into my study, young man.
You too, young woman. Come on.
[Mrs. Ramsby Whimpering]
[Henshaw]
Black eye with your hair cut. Huh!
Now, then, young lady, did you cut Milton's curls off?
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah. Where's his fancy pants?
Mugsy has them on now.
Milton traded him.
That's how he got the black eye.
But you oughta see Mugsy.
We didn't count on the black eye, did we?
- He really looked very good before he got that.
- Hmm.
I— I guess it's an awful shock to you.
You go ahead and get mad if you want to.
I don't mind if you're sour and cross.
Anyone would be with all these people hanging on their neck.
- What do you know about this family?
- As though you haven't... enough troubles with business and the slump and all.
But they can't lick you. You're a tough old bird.
You'll come out all right.
Yeah.
Well, upon my soul.
Here. There's a silver dollar for you... and there's a silver dollar for every black eye you get.
- Thank you, Uncle Sam.
- [Clears Throat] Now git.
[Clears Throat]
Now git!
- [Sighs]
- [Sighs]
- First she gives a sigh and then starts walking again.
- That's love for ya.
Do you think I ought to tell my daddy that she's in love with him so much?
Oh, he'll undoubtedly find out for himself... although we could probably save considerable time if we wanted to cooperate.
Certainly embarrassing havin' a sister goin' around sighing all the time.
I think if she knew how much my daddy thinks about her, she'd feel better.
- Let's tell her.
- [Sighs]
It might be interesting psychologically.
[Clears Throat]
- You tell her, and I'll attend to some other details.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello, Miss Lola.
- Oh, hello, Penny.
If you're waiting for anybody,
I won't stay.
Oh, no.
I'm not waiting for anybody.
In the moonlight and in that pretty dress,
I thought maybe--
No. I'm supposed to be helping mother entertain Mr. Waters.
- But he's in there, and—and you're out here.
- Not for long, I'm afraid.
All right. Tell me what you've been doing with yourself.
I've been very busy taking care of my daddy.
By the way, how is he?
When he's with me, he's—he's fine, but I don't think he's so cheerful inside.
Well, maybe you just imagine that.
Or do you think he has something on his mind?
- I think he's worried.
- Probably because he hasn't any buildings to build.
- I think he's worried about you.
- Oh, Penny, you're just guessing.
- What makes you think so?
- Because he's always asking me questions about you.
- Just like you're asking me questions about him.
- Oh, Penny!
Goodness, you must feel better.
Excuse me.
I've got to find Milton.
- [ Knocks]
- Come in.
- What's wrong up here?
- You're wanted on the terrace.
There's a short circuit.
- What's a short circuit?
- I haven't the faintest idea.
[Laughing]
- Good evening.
- Jeff.
Now, what are you doing here?
- You oughta know. You sent for me.
- I sent for you?
- Well, that's pretty thin.
- Sure, it is. It'd be better if I'd made it up myself.
- I wouldn't have come near if someone hadn't called me.
- Well, before I'd call you, I'd--
I didn't call you, Jeff, but I'm awfully glad you're here.
- Then there's nothing wrong?
- Nothing that a little common sense won't heal.
- [Laughing]
- Excruciating, Mr. Waters. Excruciating!
Milton, where's Lola?
- Why, she's--
- Lola. Lola.
Lola. Lola.
Yes, Mother?
Oh, she's out in the night air again, and it isn't good for her.
But then what kind of air can you get at night but night air? [Laughs]
[Both Laughing]
- [Mrs. Ramsby] Oh, Lola.
- Oh, yes, Mother.
- Mother, you know Mr. Hale.
- Whatever is he dressed like that for?
He— he just came from a masquerade.
Oh. Oh, I love masquerades. I went once as a New England boiled dinner.
- Mother, Penny's Mr. Hale's little daughter.
- Oh. Oh.
Oh, ho-ho. Oh, it's too amazing.
She's such a busy little thing, isn't she?
When she cut off Milton's curls, I was so upset that the doctor had to give me--
Uh, um, uh, what was it, Lola?
- Shots, Mother.
- Oh, yes. Of course. Shots.
And don't they shoot you in the oddest places. [Laughs]
- Well, out of sight, out of mind, don't you say, Mr. Gale?
- "Hale," Mother.
Oh. Heh. Oh, yes, of course. Mr. Hale.
Just like "Hail Columbia." [Laughs]
- Shall we all have something to drink?
Oh, yes, of course.
- Oh, yes.
Lola, you ring for it.
Oh, no, my dear. No.
No. You stay here and talk to Mr. Waters and Mr. "Pale." I'll do it myself.
- Shall we?
- Yes, indeed. [Chuckles]
- You know, I, uh--
- Don't go, Mr. Waters. Stay and play with us.
- [Penny] Yes, Mr. Waters.
We have a new game for you.
- [Protesting]
- Now listen. I-- Now please.
- Come on.
- This is absolutely absurd.
- Oh, now, just come on.
- Sit.
Have you ever played blindman's bluff?
You'll love it. It's a wonderful game.
- Oh, blindman's bluff.
- Now come on.
- Can you see?
- Can I see? Well, of course I can't see.
- No peeking now.
- Now the object of the game is to find Lola.
We'll start you off.
Oh. To find Lola.
Well, it isn't so silly after all, if l--
Now when we say "hot," it means you're close.
And when we say "cold," you're far away.
Come on. Put your hands behind your back.
- Round you go. Come on. Whoo!
- Oh! [Chuckling] Oh, stop! [Laughing]
- There you are.
- Oh, am I dizzy.
- [Penny] All right. Come on, Mr. Waters.
- Am l--
Oh. [Chuckles]
All right.
- Aw, you're cold. You're cold. You're freezing.
- You're cold.
- Am I really?
- Cold. You're gettin' warmer.
[Kids] Warmer. Warmer.
You're hot! You're hot! You're hot!
- You're getting colder, colder.
- Oh, you're freezing. You're freezing.
Cold. Cold.
- Aw, you're colder. You're colder.
- Warmer? Oh, you're cold.
- Cold.
- You're freezing.
- Warm! Hot! Hot!
- You're getting hot.
- You're hot!
- You're burning. You're burning.
- Aw, you're cold.
- Oh, you're cold.
[ Kids Laughing]
[Waters Sputtering]

- Here, old man. Give me your arm. Here. Let me--
- Oh. Oh, thank you.
- [Waters Shivers, Coughs]
- Oh! Well, how did you get in that--Oh!
[Henshaw] Hey, now, what's going on here? What's all this racket?
- I'll catch pneumonia.
- I never saw--
I know it. I know I'll catch--
Well, you see--
I'll catch pneumonia. I know I will.
I'll catch pneumo…You see, the… the children, they wanted me to play, but-- but of course, l--I couldn't do tha--
- It was your--your daughter!
- I'm sorry, old man. I apologize. I--
And it was your--your son.
You see, th-th-they--
- Oh, just look at my clothes.
- Come on. We'll get some nice dry clothes.
- You must have some dry clothes!
- Ah, yes.
- [Chattering]
- You here again? Get out!
- Jeff!
- Daughter, you stay here.
I forbid you to have anything more to do with that rat. Those are orders!
- [Stamps Foot]
- The idea of--
Now see here. You've outshouted this family for years, but you're not going to outshout me.
- I love that man, and I'm going to marry him.
- Over my dead body you'll marry.
- I'm going to marry him if it's over everybody's dead body.
- You won't marry him!
If you'd only listen to him about that
East Gate project, instead of being a stupid old--
- old--old--
- Old, uh, what, my dear?
Oh, I'm sorry, Uncle Sam.
Really I am. But I'm not giving in.
- I'm going to marry Jeff Hale.
- Well, you win.
Uh, you wouldn't be my niece if you didn't have a will of your own.
Uncle Sam, you don't mean it?
You're going to, uh, live in the basement, I suppose?
We won't have to live in the basement if you'll listen to Jeff. He has so much to offer.
All he needs is to have someone cooperate instead of fighting him.
If you'll just do something for him.
- Well, maybe I can do something for him.
- Uncle Sam, you're a peach!
[Sputters]
Some change in tone, my dear.
Yeah. Hello.
Henshaw speaking.
A little matter you can attend to for me, Black.
Yeah.
The pipeline we propose to lay in Dutch Borneo will run from here to here.
What is the terrain like,
Mr. Black?
Well, there's a range of mountains here, and then swamp and jungle.
- Tough going?
- Very tough.
That's why we need a good man to superintend the job.
- How did you happen to pick me?
- You were highly recommended by a friend of mine.
- Uh, cigarette?
- Thank you, no.
After all, the man who carried on with the East Gate project against the odds that you did--
- It's too bad you couldn't go through with it.
- I will someday.
Mmm. I'm sure of it.
In the meantime, here's a job that needs doing right now and will pay well.
- I could surely use it.
- Eh, you're not married, are you?
- No, not yet.
- That's good.
We don't send family men out in that country.
You'll have to leave right away.
How long should the job take?
You'd have to sign up for two years.
Borneo.
Jeff, you can't go. You simply can't go to the end of the world and leave us here.
Do you think for a moment
I want to go?
Oh, it's a grand job, a wonderful chance... but if I had anything half as good here, l-- I wouldn't even consider it.
But you'll have something here if you wait.
Uncle promised to do something.
I don't want that sort of job.
I told you before.
- Jeff, I'm going with you.
- Now, that's the spirit.
You can't go, but-- but just the same, that's the spirit.
You see, they--they won't take a married man on the job.
Oh, but, Jeff, think how long it is, how desperately long.
Two whole years to wait.
I know.
I wanted to tell you.
I'm not asking you to wait for me, Lola. It's not fair.
Now, look here,
Jeff Hale.
- I can't stop you from going, but you just try to stop me from waiting for you.
- Mmm.
Good morning,
Miss Penny.
Corporal, where's Borneo?
Uh, Borneo?
[Clears Throat] Borneo?
Oh. Uh, he's moved up into Harlem.
Borneo isn't a man.
It's a place. Where is it?
Borneo-- Oh, sure.
That's where that big light come from in the sky... nights.
- What light?
- The aurora, uh, "borenalis."
- Everybody's heard of that.
- I haven't.
Well, it's sorta north-- way up north near the North Pole.
- That's where Borneo is.
- Full of icebergs and polar bears?
Yes, ma'am.
Just stick your little nose outside of the door, and you'll freeze to death.
And if the "polo" bears don't eat you, the Eskimos do.
Oh.
- Gus.
- Yeah?
Gus, this is important.
I want a man's angle on it.
- On what?
- Borneo.
Bo-- Now, listen, beautiful.
I'm in a hurry.
So am I.
I've only got a few days.
- Where's Borneo?
- B-- Uh--
It's, um--
It's near Gibraltar.
- Where's Gibraltar?
- Well, I just told ya. It's, uh—It's near Borneo.
Didn't you ever hear of  ‘The Wild Man of Borneo?’
That's it.
Wild men, lions, tigers, swamps, fevers, uh--
Well, I gotta get to work.
- The Corporal said it was full of icebergs and polar bears.
- Aw, that's in winter.
If anyone had lived there for two years, could they ever come back alive?
Not a chance.
Now, you stay right here in little old
New York and let Borneo take care of itself.
But please, you'll do everything you can think of, won't you?
I--I mean, if one thing doesn't work, you won't stop.
- You'll go right on.
- Count on me, darling.
I want him to stay here just as much as you do.
Not quite as much, because, after all... you've got Milton and-- and all, and I'll be alone.
But, Miss Lola... even if he says no a hundred thousand times, you just insist.
If you insist long enough with my daddy, he always gives in... sometimes.
Hey, what are you doing with those shirts?
I have to look them over. You can't go to Borneo without buttons on your shirts.
My socks.
But you've looked them over.
Oh, sure, once, but I have to double-check.
I wouldn't think of letting you go without double-checking.
That's the second time you've rated those socks.
Aren't they double-checked enough?
Well, after all these are socks.
You can't check them too much.
You might find a hole in a sock anytime... and then what would those "Borneonians" say?
They'd say, "Now, what kind of a woman is taking care of this poor man?"
There! Just look at that.
And this is a triple-check.
[Chuckles Quietly]
What you would do a way off in Borneo without me to look after you...
I hardly can imagine.
I don't think I'll pack any more today.
After all, there's no hurry.
We still have two more full days.
- And you might not go.
- What's that?
Anything can happen in two days.
What if somebody did something for Uncle Sam, and Uncle Sam did something for business?
Then you wouldn't have to go to Borneo, would you?
No, I wouldn't have to go, Penny.
But don't you count on it, partner, because it won't happen.
There's no use of our fooling ourselves, is there?

It's termites-- giant termites.

- Hey. Get a load of that.
- Drop your nickels. Drop your nickels.
- What's going on here, sister?
- It's a benefit for Uncle Sam.
- Uncle Sam?
- Yes, Mr. Samuel G. Henshaw.
He's in a very bad way, you know.
- He needs help.
- Samuel G. Henshaw's in a bad way?
Yes, the slump and everybody hanging on his neck. So we're giving him a benefit.

Aw, let go of my hair.
- Then let go of your nickel.
- [Dings]

There's somebody back of this.
It's no child's prank by a long shot.

- Okay.
A plot! But who did it?
Who did this thing?
That's what I want to know.
Who did it?
- Okay.
- Eh? [Mutters]
Yeah. They couldn't bluff me out of it... so now they're gonna try to laugh me out of it. Huh!
Ha! Laugh me out.
Oh, it's an insidious--
- Okay. Okay.
- Diabolical, underhanded scheme to discredit me.
Now--  And why are you standing there like a lot of dummies?
Do something. Get down to the Riverview.
Find out who's responsible for this...
- and bring him in here.
- Okay.
- [Henshaw Growls]
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
Look at that:
"Samuel G. Henshaw."
- Okay.
- Yeah. A cartoonist--
- But where are you taking me?
- Mr. Henshaw wants to see you, young lady.
Uncle Sam?
Oh, that's different.
[Penny]
Daddy!
- We have the guilty party, sir.
- Well, where is he? Let me at him.
[Sputtering]
What's the meaning of this?
- She's the one that got up the benefit.
- Yeah—y—y—
Come in here and sit down!
You git.
- Huh.
- [Door Closes]
[Sighs]
- So you were the one that gave that benefit for me.
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
- So my daddy wouldn't have to go away for two years.
What in gosh-all fishhooks has a benefit for me... got to do with your father going away for two years?
Everything. If somebody helps you, then you help business... then business will help him, then he won't have to go.
- Will he?
- Ye--  No. Uh, y-yes.
Uh, how do I know?
Whew.
[Sighs]
Come here.
- [Hale] You can't take her away.
- [Men Clamoring]
Penny.
- You shouldn't have come so soon.
- I didn't come here soon enough.
Ah, nobody but you would have the nerve... to show his face to me, but now that you're here--
Now, wait a minute, Mr. Henshaw.
I'm sure that everything can be explained.
Yeah. Explained. Heh! Can you explain about headlines-- running a benefit for me?
Can you explain about making me a laughingstock all over America?
- I probably can if you'll let me.
- Yes or no:
- Did you tell this child that
I was responsible for the slump?
- Certainly not.
That I was responsible for business going to the dogs... for my troubles, your troubles, everybody's troubles-- including the blessed fact that you had to go away somewhere for...
…two years?
- Two years.
Certainly not.
Why, Daddy, didn't you say that when Uncle Sam got in trouble, that the people got scared?
- Yes, but--
- And when the people got scared, there was a slump... and when there was a slump, business got bad... and when that happened, nobody built any buildings?
- Yes, but--
- Let her alone.
Didn't you say that everybody ought to get together and help Uncle Sam...
- instead of pulling on him?
- Yes, yes, but let's get back to Mr. Henshaw.
- But I am back to him. He's Uncle Sam, isn't he?
- Yeah--
- Him? Uncle Sam?
- Me? Uncle Sam?
- Aha.
- Oh.
All right then.
Here's the money.
- [Henshaw] Huh?
- [Coins Clatter]
You'll do something about business now, won't you, Uncle Sam?
Mr. Henshaw, I think
I can explain everything now.
What do you suppose
I've got brains for?
And there's lots of it.
And this is only the beginning.
I'll give a benefit every week.
The benefit.
[Gasps] The benefit!

Oh, my goodness!

Throw the key away.
Solitary confinement.
I come.

- [Officer] Take him away, boys.
Come on. Come on.
- Henshaw, are you or are you not closing down your industries?
- Are you liquidating your assets?
- Will you give us a definite statement, Mr. Henshaw?
- Yes. A definite statement.
- [Henshaw] Quiet.
- Okay.
Close down my industries?
Did I ever say so?
No. Somebody's always trying to outguess me.
And you can tell the public that I'm going to triple my present payroll.
- May we quote you, Mr. Henshaw?
- Verbatim.
- [Photographer] Okay.
- And you can tell them, too... that that's the trouble with conditions today.
Somebody starts a rumor, and what happens?
Yeah. We're afraid.
We start running like a lot of sheep.
What we need is that good old American spirit.
And to show you how cockeyed this rumor is...
I'm starting work on the East Gate project tomorrow.
And this is the man that I'm putting in full charge of that worthy project.
He has vision and, uh, courage. Yeah, now clear out.
I've got business to attend to.
- All right. All right. Shoo. Come on.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey. Yeah, Hale?
What is the meaning of this?
It's the good old
American spirit, Uncle Sam.
I thought I smelled gas.
That's three this year.
They haven't even the decency to leave enough for the gas bill.
I wonder why she did it.
She seemed so full of fun.
- They all end up that way.
- No, they don't.
- You're going to go the same way.
- No, I'm not. I'm not afraid of life.
Although I am not afraid of death, either.
Come on. Move on, move on. Come on.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Shall we go somewhere?
Away from this unpleasant house?
It's not always so unpleasant. I live here.
- May I come in?
- Naturally.
Hm.
- Shall I drop in another coin?
- Do I sound like a Pianola?
Almost.
I suppose you are a great musician?
No, but I do know something about music.
Your sweetheart?
I have done enough talking for tonight.
Would you like to make some easy money?
Is there any such thing?
I heard you say that you are not afraid of life or of death.
Now, I have connections, secret, with a certain government.
I need a woman who knows how to deal with men.
- It's against Austria, of course.
- Of course.
I'd like to get some wine.
I suppose I ought to pay for it.
Cigarette?
Hm.
- You're under arrest.
- What for?
Never mind what for. We know how to take care of spies. Come on.
Austria may not care what happens to you, but you certainly do care what happens to Austria. Hm.
- Shall we go?
- Come on, let's go.
Let go!
Beg your pardon, sir.
Give her this.
Tell her to see me tomorrow at ten.
Yes, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
Come in.
Name, please?
I'd prefer not to give my name.
As you like.
- Quite a walk, isn't it?
- I don't mind walking.
I must tell you. I could walk with you forever.
Don't smoke in here, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry, sir.
I took a lot of trouble last night, after I left, to obtain some information about you. Ha!
It took me hours to get dry.
You are the widow of Captain
Ferdinand Kolverer, who died last year.
My husband was killed in action.
As you may have guessed by now,
I am in charge... of the Secret Service of Imperial Austria.
There are times when a man's brain cannot accomplish as much as a woman's charm.
As you demonstrated last night. Ha!
You completely fooled me.
Had me arrested!
You are a clever woman, and a very loyal one.
We lost 40,000 men here, two days ago.
And here, 18,000.
Come here.
Look at those men marching.
Marching into the jaws of death.
Unless I can uncover a certain system of communication with the enemy.
So you wish me to become a spy.
You dislike the word "spy"?
Perhaps I have no right to object to any word.
You haven't. Sit down.
In return for your services,
I shall provide you with a magnificent home, servants, all the money you may need.
What appeals to me is the chance to serve my country.
It is now my duty to point out to you that the profession of a spy is the most ignoble calling on earth.
Lower than anything you may have ever experienced.
And it is dangerous, of course.
I've had an inglorious life.
It may become my good fortune to have a glorious death.
Bring the Hindau file.
This is Colonel von Hindau.
Attached to a chief of staff of our own army.
I have reason to believe that he is a traitor.
But I have been unable to prove it.
He knows every operator in my department.
Ha!
But he doesn't know you... yet!
This is your first assignment.
I am sending you the widow of Captain
Kolverer, who will enter the service as X-27.
She will receive instructions from me.
Yes. Correct.
- May I have this dance?
- May I?
I suppose you are too exhausted playing with balloons to stand up.
Certainly I'll stand up, if you'll hand me my crutches.
I beg your pardon.
Here you are. I might have known you'd be with the prettiest woman in the place.
- I'd forgotten all about you.
- Get rid of her. Sit down.
Not tonight. I've made other plans.
- Haven't we?
- Not too loud.
Well, I don't blame you.
I wish I were in your boots.
Drop me off on your way home.
Shall we?
Hey up!
You have extraordinary luck with women,
Colonel.
I can't complain.
- Can I?
- You shouldn't, tonight. Should he?
Not unless I take you away from him.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hands off.
Don't get excited, Colonel.
Have a cigarette.
Cigarette or no cigarette, you keep your hands off.
Do you want me to?
I don't know.
Let me first see your face without the mask.
One face at a time.
Lucky for you both I'm getting out here.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Fritz, bring the champagne.
Yes, sir.
Will you take off your cape?
Not yet.
Well, take your time.
Take off my glove.
What a soft hand!
You are wanted on the telephone, sir. I am sorry, sir.
It's the head of the Secret Service.
He insists on speaking to you, sir.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Don't stay away too long.
- Hello?
- Hindau? I hope I didn't disturb you.
No. What's wrong?
You know I have been working on a new formula for invisible ink that defies detection?
Looking for something, madam?
Where do you hide your cigarettes?
I want to smoke.
You'll not find any in this house.
My master doesn't smoke.
Shall I send out for some?
No, never mind. It's not important.
Very well, madam.
The champagne is very excellent, madam.
I am certain it is.
Don't get excited, Colonel. Have a cigarette.
What time will you be over?
Ten? Make it eleven.
I don't like to get up so early in the morning.
- Eleven would be better.
- Good night.
I hope she had time enough to look around.
Ha! She won't find anything.
I had that house searched a dozen times.
You like Russian cigarettes?
Yes. This one is marvelous.
Where did you get it?
- Out of your coat pocket.
- Oh-hoh.
- Going through my pockets already?
- Mm-hm.
Would you like a puff?
Not bad. But I think we'd better start on the champagne.
I suppose you've also had the house surrounded.
Yes. I'm sorry, it's my job.
What a charming evening we might have had... if you hadn't been a spy, and I a... traitor.
Then we might never have met.
I don't know to whom I would rather surrender.
My compliments.
I'll wait for your men in the library.
Perhaps that was the best way, for him and for us.
Good night.
I am going after the other man.
Take charge.
- Hello, Marie.
- Hello.
Hello, Marie.
- Hello, Marie.
- Hello.
All bets down.
30 on the red.
Would you mind putting your hand on my other shoulder?
Game.
34 on the red even.
Would you mind changing your tune?
Well, yes, I'll stop.
Perhaps I can bring you a bit of luck,
Captain.
Good luck or bad luck?
Good luck.
Try number... 27.
21 on the black.
27 hasn't a chance.
What will you give me if it loses?
- Anything you like.
- Suppose we start with a kiss?
Push that over onto 27.
I hope it loses.
Ready?
26 on the black even.
When do I collect?
Any time you like.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Let's have a drink before we go.
Two Bacardis.
Do you like to gamble?
I like anything that excites me.
I'm glad you came along.
I was just becoming bored.
That's one of the reasons
I think I could like you.
You excite me.
You know, most people think of death as a very ugly old man.
Thank you, sir.
I think of death as a beautiful young woman wearing flowers.
- Roses?
- Well, she might be wearing roses.
Have a cigarette.
- What makes you think of death?
- Hm. Was I thinking of death?
Two Bacardis.
I have the feeling we've met before.
Have we? When?
When? Let me see, when did we meet before?
Have you ever been wounded?
Not me. Aviators are rarely wounded.
We fly or are killed.
How about that kiss, lady?
Kiss? I was only joking.
Oh, what a charming sense of humor!
Well, good night.
You were no match for this man, who is far too clever to be trapped by a woman.
Your experience was insufficient to deal with him alone.
You had no right to assume responsibility for the arrest of a man who is worth an entire Russian division.
Your plane takes off in an hour.
Be careful with your new assignment.
Good evening.
I've come for that kiss.
You may have been joking about it, but I wasn't.
- Don't you like to be kissed?
- You are so powerful.
Don't you like powerful men?
I am glad you escaped.
Your untimely death might have disturbed my conscience.
Nonsense, it's all in the game.
Had I caught you in my country,
I'd have had you shot without hesitation.
But we're both alive yet, and you can make my last few hours in Vienna very pleasant.
Are you going to leave Vienna so soon?
I'm afraid I'll have to, or give up my profession.
It's become too dangerous.
Perhaps I can persuade you to stay.
I really don't need persuasion.
You're not going to turn me over because of a kiss?
Are you going to shoot me yourself?
Yes, if you leave me no other choice.
Your conscience, apparently, is not going to be disturbed this time.
Stay where you are.
Shoot quickly, or I'll take that plaything away from you.
Stay where you are.
I think I removed the cartridges.
This would have been quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Do you like this masquerade as well as my last one?
- You are still a clown.
- I'm a colonel in the Russian Army.
When necessary, I fly across the line, and play the clown, or the Austrian officer.
I am a soldier, but you bring something into war that doesn't belong in it.
You trick men into death with your body.
Give me a kiss.
You're a cheat and a liar.
Why don't you stay here?
Perhaps I don't always cheat and lie.
If you kept me here another minute,
I'd not only be in danger of losing my life, but of falling in love with you, you devil!
A few thousand feet higher up we might find better weather, but I doubt it.
And now your division is to attack from S-32 to V-29.
Your objective is the railhead at T-18.
That carries us through the fifth day.
On the sixth day, your division, with the 63rd and 74th, attack from N-17 to R-21.
Your objective will be the heights at Q-11 to Q-15.
Any questions?
Does the attack begin on the ninth?
Yes, at five o'clock in the morning.
Four days from now.
That's all, gentlemen.
Come on down here.
Did anyone ever tell you how pretty you are?
Come here.
Fresh from the country, aren't you?
Do they work you very hard in this magnificent establishment?
Are you going to be off duty pretty soon?
You're not going to see some young lieutenant tonight, are you?
Captain?
A major, perhaps?
Then we'll start with a colonel.
What's the matter? You want a general?
I don't care who it is.
I don't want anyone to enter or leave these headquarters without a pass issued by me.
That woman is in this hotel.
- Count ten.
- I don't want to count ten any more.
Count ten.
One, two, three, four, five...
One, two, three, four, five...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Eight, eight, nine...
Ten!
Ah.
Meow!
Me-owwww!
Come on out here.
Come on out.
Oh, she's lost.
Meow!
Come down here.
It's warm up here. Me-oww!
Come down here or get out.
Don't be angry.
All right.
Meow!
- Meow!
- Are you coming down or not?
- Count ten.
- Haven't I counted ten before?
- No.
- One, two, three...
I'm not going to count any more.
I'm tired... I'm tired.
Meow. Meow.
Meow. Meow.
Let me see a list of your maids.
- Who are the maids on the second floor?
- Day maid's Olga. Night maid's Catherine.
Catherine, eh? Is she a new maid here?
Came three days ago.
I change maids all the time.
Can't keep them.
Too many officers quartered here.
- What do you know about Catherine?
- Nothing.
Papers are all correct.
Anything wrong again?
No.
Take your hat off when you talk to a Russian officer, if you know what's good for you.
Corporal, force the door.
Who's been with you?
Office of the Guard!
Get the Office of the Guard.
Have that woman brought to my room.
Now you can tell all that to the Colonel.
Get in there.
Everybody makes mistakes.
And you carry a cat.
It has brought me good luck, so far.
- Do you call this good luck?
- I don't know yet.
Besides, I am not allowed to love anything else.
I like your masquerade.
Sit down.
I'm sorry, I'll have to search you, X-27.
Take your things off.
Is it warm enough in here? Don't catch cold.
Hm. Music!
- Did you write this?
- Yes.
Your own composition, eh?
I don't use invisible ink.
What do you call this masterpiece?
I haven't named it yet.
May I suggest you call it
The Dance Of The Russian Colonels?
Not bad. Shall I go on with my undressing?
I'm in the mood for music first.
- Would you play this?
- If you furnish the piano.
I'll furnish the piano, and the audience.
After you.
I wish I could read notes.
Let me play it for you.
I don't know what this code means.
But I have an idea that each note might mean the death of a thousand soldiers.
My poor composition.
I worked so hard on it, and now it's in ashes.
- I destroy everything dangerous to Russia.
- I'm next, I suppose?
You know the fate of spies when they're caught.
How many more hours does my fate allow me?
You have until dawn.
This is quite a feather in your cap, isn't it?
For three days and nights,
I've had no other thought but to find you.
And now I've caught you.
Isn't it strange I'd give a lot to undo it?
Why don't you let me go, then?
Don't be absurd.
Is there any other wish I can grant?
- Yes.
- What is it?
I'd like to share my last few hours on earth with you.
Do you think you can fool me as easily as you did the adjutant?
I give you my word of honor that
I no longer want anything but to be with you.
It's easy to grant you almost anything.
I think I'm falling madly in love with you.
The more you cheat and the more you lie, the more exciting you become, X-27.
I wish this night could last forever.
It will be dawn soon.
I don't understand why you should choose a road that leads to such a death.
Not a bad death, to die for my country.
It's better than gas or the river.
What has gas or the river to do with you?
Nothing. Now.
Let's not talk of death any more.
This is our last drink together.
What shall we drink to?
- To love.
- To love and excitement.
To love and excitement.
- What did you put into this wine?
- Only a few drops of sleep.
You think you can get away?
Here!
Where are you going? Where's your pass?
Ink's still wet, huh?
I wish I were an officer. Go ahead.
Your plane will leave for Vienna in two hours.
- Name?
- Nikolai Chemochenko.
Division?
Won't talk, eh? Next.
- Name.
- Ivan Petrov.
Division?
Won't talk. Next.
- Name.
- Ivorich Chernovy.
Division?
These birds are a gabby lot.
Next!
Name.
Division.
Next.
Your name?
Won't even give your name, eh?
Division?
All right, sir, as you like.
Bring in the next batch.
Come on, step up.
- Name?
- Hassan Martinko.
Division?
- Name?
- Nikolai Abramov.
Take a look at this.
Division!
Next!
Name, please.
Name!
Well, that looks like a catch.
May I question that officer who refused to give his name?
Certainly. Will you come back here,
Colonel?
You don't remember me, do you?
I've never seen you before.
You have a very faulty memory for a spy.
- You're mistaken.
- How do you explain this, Colonel?
Well, this does resemble me, doesn't it?
When were you on Austrian territory last?
The Russian Army has been on Austrian territory ever since the war started.
Let me have your fingerprints.
This will be your last visit to this country, Colonel.
- Arrange a court martial.
- I will, Your Excellency.
Take charge of the case, Major.
Send in the next batch.
- Will you come with me?
- Yes, sir. With pleasure.
- Name?
- Ivan Turgenev.
- Division?
- Ivan Petrov.
Next?
- Name?
- I don't smoke.
Don't you think that before shooting a spy, we should make him talk?
- You can't make Russians talk.
- I think I can.
I'll give you ten minutes.
Be careful. He's a dangerous character.
- I'll be careful.
- Turn the prisoner over to her, Lieutenant.
Wire headquarters at once, Colonel, and inform them of the capture of H-14, of the Russian Secret Service, and that we are planning to execute him, possibly tonight.
- Will you please wait outside?
- I wouldn't take any chances with this man.
- I'll take responsibility for that. Wait outside.
- As you wish.
You still don't seem to remember me.
It may be good for you that I don't choose to remember you.
Oh, I don't know.
- This gun is loaded.
- What is it you want?
I have ten minutes in which to make you talk.
You're wasting your time and mine.
What would you rather do than talk?
If you don't mind,
I'd rather be up in the air, flying.
Well, my old friend.
He did bring you good luck, after all.
Perhaps.
Come here.
Watch me, and I'll show you how to play with a gun.
I've an even chance now.
I don't know whether I can get away, but there seem to be plenty of planes outside.
If it weren't going to be more exciting out there, I'd be tempted to stay with you.
Hope you're on my side, next war!
Before the sentence, have you anything to say?
No, I have nothing to say.
As a matter of record, tell me why a woman charged with important work should permit or aid the escape of a dangerous enemy, why she should dishonor the service, violate duty because of a casual affection for that man.
Perhaps I loved him.
You can't make me believe you can love a man you've known for a few hours.
That sort of love can be bought on the streets.
I found her on the streets.
You had a chance to redeem your unfortunate life in the service of your country.
Can you give one reason you failed to take advantage of that privilege?
I suppose I'm not much good, that's all.
Will you please stand up?
You have left us no choice in your case.
The crime is treason and the penalty is death.
You will be executed tomorrow morning at dawn.
And may God have mercy on your soul.
Can I help you, daughter?
I am going to face this journey, too, alone.
You have no fear of this death?
It's only another exciting adventure.
A perfect end to an imperfect life.
How much more time have I?
About ten hours.
Could you possibly help me to die in a uniform of my own choosing?
What would you call a uniform of your own choosing?
Any dress I wore when I served my countrymen instead of my country.
I will send for your clothes. Anything else?
Yes.
A piano. One that's in tune.
I will see what can be done.
Fall in!
Is it time?
Will you please follow me?
Are we going to walk together again?
Do you happen to have a looking glass?
Will this do?
May I please bandage your eyes?
I will not kill a woman.
I will not kill any more men, either.
Do you call this war?
I call it butchery!
You call this serving your country?
You call this patriotism? I call it murder!

Walter Santos
-Ah, how's business?
-Swell. It's Garbo.
It'll be even better next week when you play my new
Schnarzan picture.
Ah, what a star!
What a star!
Oh, has the trailer gone on yet?
You'll just about catch it.
Good.
Coming to this theatre soon
The mighty monarch of the mudlands...
SCHNARZAN 
THE CONQUEROR!
Jungle beasts knew his call...
The hidden terrors of the jungle held no fear for...
SCHNARZAN 
THE CONQUEROR!
How exhilaratin'!
Untamed, untouched, untrammeled by civilization.
Nature's forgotten man who couldn't forget the call of nature.
Can't you see jungle woman?
I'm human even if I've got a touch of the King Kong.
Human?
You make me laugh.
Giving them the royal razz.
OK, but underneath this lion's skin beats a heart seething with sentiment.
Oh, I bet you say that to every animal.
Go on.
No.
I don't.
Listen to me, jungle woman.
Don't miss it if you can.
SCHNARZAN THE CONQUEROR!
SCHNARZAN THE DANGEROUS
Coming to this theatre soon
Well, there's one thing certain.
I'm not coming to this theater next week to see that cluck Scharzan.
You can't call my star a cluck.
Cluck, cluck.
There ought to be a law.
You shouldn't allow your patrons to say things like that.
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Knapp,
Schnarzan is slipping.
The public's fed up with those mangy, toothless, moth-eaten lions that he's been fighting with.
You're right.
You're right.
You'll flop with Scharzan.
But the week after you'll mop up with my star.
The one and only Liondora.
Liondora...
That cheap imitation of the great Schnarzan.
What are you talking about?
Schnarzan is a has-been.
Stop arguing, Mr. Goldfarb.
Liondora is a bust too.
He doesn't even use real lions.
I know because one of my relatives played the hind legs.
But if I were you, boys,
I'd go and buy some real, honest to goodness, man-eaters.
Killers!
Give the public a thrill.
That's the only way you'll ever make any money.
Real man-eaters...
Killers...
That's an idea.
The little dream nest in...
THE HOLLOWS
BUMS KEEP OUT
What a game!
What a game!
I trust you scored, sir.
You're darn trustin' I scored.
I hit four goals and three players.
Fetch me my slippers!
Hiya, Knapp.
What a day!
Jimmy, this is getting serious.
Your public is turning away from you.
They say your lions are moth-eaten, toothless and half of them have the mange.
The mange, hah?
Well, they didn't get it from me.
But look.
Something's gotta be done on it.
Look at that.
Right on the front page.
What does it say?
Baron Munchausen arrives in Hollywood tomorrow, with a cargo of wild jungle beasts.
Jimmy, this Baron has the greatest bunch of lions in captivity.
Well, why not get in touch with him and use his lions?
That's what I'm leading up to.
Buddy Goldfarb may have the same idea about Liondora.
Liondora...
My hated rival.
Why not beat Goldfarb and Liondora to it?
We've got to get those lions before they do.
Now...
When the Baron arrives... entertain him the same way you did Bernard Shaw and Professor Einstein.
You mean make the crumb my house-guest?
Exactly!
And don't forget,
The Baron arrives tomorrow.
Then we'll have to work fast.
I'll get a flock of beautiful girls and give him a real African welcome.
Then we'll throw the biggest affair since the "Boston Tea Party".
Jimmy, you're a genius!
You took the words right out'a my mouth.
The great Schnarzan invites you to a Hollywood party in honor of celebrating
Baron Munchausen and his lions.
Don't be silly. Gotta date.
Gotta go to Scharzan's party.
Have to let the bridge game wait.
Gotta go to Scharzan's party.
It's going to be a swell affair.
You'll be the belle of it.
Baron's lions will be there.
The rest is really irrelevant.
Tonight's the night.
Tomorrow...
What a headache.
That's the hell of it.
-Gotta go to Scharzan's.
-Gotta go to Scharzan's.
Oh, is that you my little white dovey-dovey?
How are ya?
Now listen to me you dirty, big, black, snake in the bush.
What's the idea of giving a party and not inviting me? Heh?
-Answer me that!
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You don't have to get sore just because
I kicked you out of my last picture!
You don't belong to these parties!
You get too rough!
Too involved!
That's remindin' her.
Now let me tell you somethin'.
The day I don't play in your pictures any more
Schnarzan will be terrible.
What do you think of that?
You know what I think of you?
You know what you are?
Un stupido animale brutto...
What's that?
You can't talk to me like that!
And that ends another chapter in my love life.
Hello. Here's Joan Crawford,
Mr. Durante.
Not so loud, please.
No answer.
Oh, that Hollywood party...
Yes, Mr. Durante.
Here's Miss Jessup.
-Hello. I can't hear you.
-Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello!
Phone's busy
We're dizzy
It's that affair
He's going

Put on your soup and fish

So let the laughter spring out
Music ring out
Satan sing out
Yeah, man
At that crashing, furniture-smashing
Hollywood Party
Get out. Get out.
Get any!
Hollywood party
Nobody sleeps tonight
Oh, auntie, I hear it's going to be a wonderful party.
I'm awfully glad we came to Hollywood.
Think of it, Harvey.
If you hadn't known Scharzan when he was poor, we wouldn't have been invited.
I knew him when he didn't have a kettle to cook in.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
You're right.
He does look a little nutty.
Lobby!
Oh, I want to thank you for a very nice trip.
Oh... Thank you very much.
Not at all.
I'd love to pick up things for you.
Why didn't you take off your hat?
Oh, I was afraid I couldn't get it back on with that same air of abandon.
Well, where did you go?
Auntie, I...
I lost my purse.
This is Mr...
Harvey, we can't afford to mix with strangers.
If we only went with our friends we'd be pretty lonesome.
Come, Harvey. Come, Linda.
Schnarzan will be furious.
It's gonna be a great party.
Come on.
You know why Scharzan is giving this party?
No.
To get those lions from the Baron.
If he gets them, Liondora, you're through in pictures.
Then I've got to get in that party.
Beat Schnarzan to the punch.
What are we gonna use for money?
-I want a taxi.
-A yellow, sir?
Haven't you any colors beside yellow?
How about a green or a blue?
Oh, I just love blue.
She looks much better in blue.
I wonder who they are.
Oklahoma oil doing Hollywood.
Slug-nutty about royalty, movie stars, titles and that sort of thing.
Pardon me, but do you know where the great Schnarzan lives?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, old man, but I didn't get your name.
Jake.
My name is Harvey Clemp.
I'm the millionaire oil king from Clemp City, Oklahoma.
This is my wife, Henrietta, the Oil Queen.
Henrietta, this is Jake.
How do you do.
That gives me an idea.
Don't worry, Mr. Goldfarb.
I'll crash Schnarzan's party, all right.
My husband is the multi-est millionaire in Oklahoma.
Show the man, Harvey.
A thousand dollar bill.
You can't do that unless you're a millionarie.
They'll recognize you at the party.
Everybody knows Liondora.
Ah, but I will not be Liondora.
I will be the
Grand Royal Duke
Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus
Forfoltu-Varenikos from southern part Europe.
Good old Peloponniesus.
And now I'll ask one of Schnarzan's guests to say a few words.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Robert Young.
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.
Is this a party?
You should see them pouring in with that goofy look in their big blue eyes.
Gorgeous girls...
Brunettes who once were blondes.
Blondes who were once brunettes.
Hello.
And here comes a little platinum.
Hello, Pansy.
That was a girl, not a man.
Hello, Joan.
Oh, is she a dream and you should see that dream walking.
I'm sorry.
I don't know where it is.
And, now ladies and gentlemen, as I was telling...
Said, I don't know where it is.
Lad... Oh, butler...
Would you show this gentlemen the swimming pool?
-He wants to dive in.
-Yes, sir.
-And be sure it's empty.
-Yes, sir.
And now here's to beauty, laughter, romance, music.
On with the biggest party ever given in Hollywood.
Feelin' high
I get home
Well, what's the use
Of feelin' low
Now there's a reason
If you want to know why
I'm in love
And feelin' high
There's a reason
If you want to know why
I'm in love
And feelin' high
Feelin' high
What's the use
Of feelin' low
Off that wagon
On the town
Gonna be up
Never down
There's a reason
If you want to know why
I'm in love
And feelin' high
My friends, I welcome you to my humble domicile.
Tonight, let us throw all transgression to the winds and enjoy ourselves with absolute infernity.
This may be madness to you,
Harvey Clemp, but it's baloney to me.
Henrietta, you astound me.
The place is littered with movie stars and that makes some litter.
Very artistic.
Oh, it's wonderful.
What did you expect, auntie?
Nobility running around.
A duke. An earl. A marquis.
I want to hobnob with mi'luds.
I want to rub shoulders with royalty.
I want a title.
How about
"Came the Dawn"?
Madame...
Oh, this is too too divine.
How too too distingue...
How too too risque.
Sorry, but I didn't catch the name.
I am the Grand Royal Duke
Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus
Forfoltu-Varenikos.
Beg pardon, but I still didn't get the name.
Oh, is very easy.
Is most simplicity.
I am the Grand Royal Duke
Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus
Forfoltu-Varenikos.
Oh, well...
Let it go.
A Grand Royal Duke?
This is the happiest moment of my life.
This is my niece, Linda.
This pleasure is met with for to suffer with happiness.
This is my millionaire husband,
Harvey Clemp.
-Pleased to meet your...
-Grace.
Grace?
A big strapping fella like that?
You care to honor me with this dance?
Oh, no honor at all.
Harvey, don't forget to invite the
Duke to the hotel for cocktails.
By all means.
Oh, is be great pleasure to go to hotel for cocktails and dinner.
Did I say dinner?
May I have this dance?
Well, you'll have to ask my uncle.
May I have this dance?
Well, I'm a bad one to lead, but I can follow.
I guess I'll just drink this one out.
-It's the Baron.
-It's the Baron.
That's what I just said.
Look at them wagons.
That must be the lions.
They all can't be the Baron.
Remember!
I want to give him a royal welcome.
The Baron is to get the Champagne Suite.
You take charge of the left wing.
You take the right wing.
I'll take the dark meat.
This is a holiday
No melancholy day
This is a jolly way
To welcome the Baron
Who came from the Congo today
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
-The Baron's coming to say hello.
-Hello!
Yes, hello!
Hello! Hello! Hello!
Not hello, hello, hello
But halloo.
Halloo!
Say how-de-do
Mit me favor. How are you
Press the flesh old thing or Cheerio
Or say how's tricks or there a hi-de-ho
Wie geitz, my friend
Or mazel tov
Bon jour or any high hat stuff
What a linguist!
What a linguist!
By now you outta know
The Baron's gonna say hello!
A gunna gunna
A great ahorta
Good afternoon
Or is it morning?
Give the Baron an
Afrikaans hello
What's he gonna say?
What's he gonna say?
He's coming here to say hello
Oh, no!
That rootin' tootin' son
Of a gun from Africa
That prevaricating, second to none From Africa
He's gonna say...
He's gonna say...
I'm going to say...
And so we're here.
It has been a long walk but we here.
Schnarzan, I bring you the most ferocious ape ever captured in the middle of Africa.
He is the son of King Kong.
His name is Ping Pong.
And look...
Let papa down.
Pingy, go to Schnarzan.
A chimpanzee!
Is that etiquette?
I'm going to say...
I'm going to...
It's an honor to our nation
To hear your salutation
We have our celebration
In great anticipation
I want to say...
I want to say...
No lions made him shiver
No tigers made him quiver
Down by the Niger river.
Where lions eat your liver
I want to say...
I want to say...
It really is a sensation
A most magnificent ovation
There's been nothing like it before
But I really expected much more
Please...
I only want to say...
He only wants to say...
Then let me say it!
I only want to say...
Hello!
I fooled you!
Oh, hello!
Hello! Hello! Hello!
We are very glad to meet you
And we greet you with hello
Hello! Hello! Hello!
Greetings and salutations, Baron.
Welcome to my poor house.
Well...
Who wants to live in a poorhouse?
Hello, forever
Hello, forever
Hello! Hello! Hello!
I never knew you cared.
Hello!
Look!
Imagine coming to a party with wild animals.
Oh, it's thrilling.
It's like being at the zoo.
-Knapp!
-Jimmy!
Everything is going to be OK.
I gave the Baron the Royal Suite.
That's the idea.
Treat him right, you get the lions and your future's insured.
Now that's what I mean.
Imagine the kick your public will get when they see you fighting a lion like that.
Teeth that can bite.
Claws that can rip.
What a kick when they see you with your head right in his very jaws.
He might break my neck.
There's the thrill of it.
I'm willing to take any risk to make a big picture.
You'll be the season's sensation.
Every newspaper will print your name.
Yeah, in the obituary column.
Let's stroll.
Fixing a cocktail?
You picked a nice night for it.
Careful.
You'll scratch your face.
Rather an informal entrance, isn't it?
That Schnarzan...
He thinks he can keep me away from his party, eh?
That dirty such and such and so and so and this and that...
Those are strong words, stranger.
Wait til I get a hold of him.
I show him how strong I am.
I get a hold of his throat like this.
I'd hate to be in his shoes.
Hey! I kinda like you.
Come here.
Oh, is beautiful...
Is wonderful.
What a night!
What a night!
Oh, the moon is so musk mellow in the fragrance of your head.
Oh, your Grace...
I guess I was just made for love.
Oh, you sweet honey bunch donuts...
You can't be for to hide your feelings when soul is respond to soul.
You have heart. You have fire.
You make me for to burn.
Oh, Grace...
Don't call me Grace.
To you I am just plain Nikolaus.
Nikolaus...
From souther part Europe.
Good old Peloponneisus.
Peloponneisus?
What a beautiful name.
How lovely...
How romantic...
Oh, Henrietta!
You mustn't, Grace.
You mustn't. No. No.
You mustn't call me Grace.
Call me... Call me Nikolaus.
No...
I like Peloponneisus better.
Oh, let me for to grab your lipsky.
No. No. Oh, no.
I... I mustn't.
You could just call me HC.
Well, don't you know any other games but the oil game?
Yes, but I like the old oil game best.
Mr. Clemp, come with me.
I want to show you something.
Yes, my boy.
What is it?
It's your wife.
Well, I've seen my wife.
In fact, I married her.
But, Mr. Clemp, this is important.
Hey, HC... You're not going to leave me here all alone?
Don't go away. I'll be right back.
Read a book or something.
You gorgeous crab, you.
Always filled the cup of happiness for all the people for to drink that.
Yes, that's me.
I can dish it out, but I can't take it.
Oh, Grace. Grace!
That's what I wanted to show you.
Hey, this is going to be good.
He bit her.
We're in a very good position.
I can see everything.
-He kissed her.
-No!
She responds fairly well.
Interesting technique.
Oh, your Grace.
-But that's your wife.
-Oh, yes!
That's Henrietta.
Always improving her mind.
Never before I'm feel such terrifical vibrations as I am feel now.
So top tip, my delirious ducky wucky.
I wonder how I'd do with those tactics.
Oh, Grace.
Oh, so you're back, eh?
Oh what a night...
The moon is so mellow and the fragrance of your hair...
Let me give you what is commonly known as "the works".
What's the matter with you?
Are you going crazy?
I don't seem to have the right purchase.
Still like the old oil game best.
What's your name?
You know, there's something about you I like.
Sure it isn't yourself?
Oh... You got me.
Oh, I think you'll recover.
If you'll nurse me back to life.
Plenty of fresh air and sunshine.
And moonshine.
When the moon begins to rise
My heart begins to beat
Flowery lanes and starry skies
Have made me indiscreet
Love affairs that come and go
Have thrilled me in the past
But though you're not my first love
I'm sure that you're the last
I've had my moments
I will confess
My fleeting moments
Of tenderness
I sang of true love
I played guitars
Then found a new love
'neath tropical stars
This time's the last time
This time it's new
Love as a pastime
For me is through
I've had my moments
My big bad moments
But now my one big moment is you
You've had your moments
I've had some too
In moonlit gardens
On waters blue
I was a siren
At seventeen
A ball of fire
You know what I mean?
But now I've found you
I know that's true
I'll search around you
I'll stick like glue
I've had my moments
My big bad moments
But now my one big moment is you
But now my one big moment is...
-Me?
-You!
I've had my moments
My fleeting moments
-I sang of true love
-I played guitars
Then found a new love
This time's the last time
-I've had my moments
-My big bad moments
But now my one big moment is you
-I've had my moments
-I've had my moments
I've had my moments
I will confess
My fleeting moments
Of tenderness
I sang of true love
I played guitars
Then found a new love
'neath tropical stars
This time's the last time
This time it's new
Love as a pastime
For me is through
I've had my moments
My big bad moments
But now my one big moment is you
-You.
-You.
-He'll sign it without...
-Hiya, fellas.
-Oh, hi.
-What kept you?
I had to work overtime.
How ya doing?
-Swell!
-Oh, great!
-Got the autographs yet?
-Yeah, I got a book full.
-And you?
-If I get another one, I'll have two.
Well, don't worry about it.
We'll have plenty before the night's over.
Oh, this is going to be a big night.
Well, I've got a big book.
-Any celebrities show up?
-Sure.
-What are you? Autograph hounds?
-Yeah!
-Did you get any?
-Yep, I got some.
Let me see.
I got a whole book full.
Look at this.
Will you look at this.
Look at that. Look at that.
-The stars write fast, don't they?
-Yeah!
-You collectin' autographs?
-No...
Collecting photographs.
No, not of you crumbs.
-Hey, there's somebody.
-Come on.
No, no, no, Professor.
Your dissertation refutes every scientific theory.
But, Doctor, please reflect on the profound aspects of the matter and consider the vital points of my thesis.
But, gentlemen.
Your theories are distinctly contradictory.
Are you guys actors or hillbillies?
Come out from under the spinach,
Gable. We know you.
Out of the way, moron.
We are of the scientific world not thespists.
Look, look.
This proves my point.
A perfect specimen of the
Neanderthal Man.
What? That? Oh no.
Look at the measurements.
Look at that. Look at that.
That's the androgynous type.
I can prove it.
The androgynous cranium is always hollow.
Now listen.
No, no no, Professor, you're wrong.
That is the skull of the Anthropedia.
No, that's more like the Anthropedia.
Now, listen.
Ah, the obvious Neanderthal type.
Now...
Now, just note the difference.
Neanderthal!
Anthropedia!
Androgynous!
Well, there you are!
Hey, fellas!
Hey, fellas!
See any prominent people?
There's a lot of prominent people here.
Yeah, Neanderthal!
Who?
Androphobia!
What?
Androgynous!
What, are you kidding?
Hold it!
Okay!
I'll skip this joint.
Mr. Durante is in conference.
He's not to be disturbed.
Well, listen here.
I want to see that pelican face.
See? And, I'm gonna disturb him.
The scientific gentlemen are with him.
They're having their usual
Wednesday night discussion.
Get out of my way, you big telegraph pole.
I've very sorry but the door is locked.
Is that so?
Well, you keep it locked, see, until I get a few more drinks under my belt and when I come back
Schnarzan's goose will be cooked.
What about Mendelism?
But from the Neanderthal man to the Cardiff Giant it has been an absolute theory.
-You are speaking pragmatically?
-Peripatetically.
In spite of all that, you still insist that Huxley's theory is authentic?
Most emphatically, I do.
I differ!
Doing some research work for the Smithsonian Institute,
I was called in consultation by Professor Eberworth.
That emminent philuntrist who had heard what I did for Einstein and his relatives.
Professor Eberworth says...
Jimmy, I need you.
I want to consult with you about a subject which has baffled all the scientists of the world.
Namely, reincarnation.
Not the carnation that I am wearing to my buttonhole. No...
Not the carnation of a king, but reincarnation.
A ponderous question.
Professor Eberworth and me being the only two guys who knows the low-down.
What is reincarnation you mugs, you earthworms, you nincompoops, you chuckleheads?
Last night with my head on my lacy pillow
I was a man dreaming
I was a butterfly.
Sipping the sap from flower to flower just like a little butterfly.
I had butterfly words.
Butterfly desires.
Just a man dreaming
I was a butterfly.
And how do I know now that
I'm not a butterfly dreaming that I'm a man?
Wait a minute!
I can see myself now.
I go way back to Adam.
Adam and his madam.
Boys, I was Adam!
GARDEN OF EDEN
One, two, three, four, five.
There's a rib missing.
They promised me a woman for that rib.
There's something screwy around here.
Where's that beautiful baby doll?
Oh, daddy...
A carbon copy!
I've been ribbed!
Reincarnation works in wonderous ways.
Like in the American Revolutionary days in 1775.
Hardly a man is now alive.
Not even you, old buzzards.
I was!
I was...
Paul Revere!
Paul Revere!
Good old horse.
How many more miles have you got in your system?
I gotta million of them.
Put that underneath your hatta
A man has more lives than a catta
Those episodes in my career are just
A demonstration of three little words
Re -Ink -Carnation
Mr. Clemp, if you make for to get those lions is being terrifical pleasure for to let you produce pictures with me.
Come, come, Peloponnesius.
You don't mean that you'll let me invest some of my money in your screen offerings?
I do better is that.
I let you invest for all money.
Sounds like a good opportunity.
There is the Baron now.
Make him an offer.
Well, Baron...
I'm prepared to offer you
50.000 dollars for your lions.
-Will you take it?
-I take 50.000 for anything.
Beg your pardon, but we haven't met.
I'm Harvey Clemp, the oil king.
Look...
A thousand dollar bill.
You can't do that unless you're a multi-millionarire.
A millionaire!
Somebody give him a slipper.
Quick.
Gracie, move over.
Sit down, will you please.
Some champagne in a glass.
Now, Baron, don't forget our deal is on.
Deliver the lions to the studio in the morning and get our check for fifty grand.
I will.
Thank you.
I'll give sixty.
-I'll make it seventy.
-Eighty.
-Ninety.
-A hundred.
-A hundred and ten.
-A hundred and thirty.
Wait!
You skipped a hundred and twenty.
-A hundred and twenty.
-A hundred and ten.
-A hundred.
-Ninety.
-Eighty.
-Seventy.
Wait, gentlemen.
You're going backward.
We were up to a hundred thirty thousand.
So we were.
I'll make it a hundred and forty.
I'll make it a hundred and fifty and that's all we can afford.
Could I hear a hundred sixty?
A hundred fifty-five?
Waiting.
Could I, please, hear hundred fifty-five?
I'd rather make it a hundred seventy-five.
Sold! Sold to the gentleman on my right for one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars.
I want to congratulate you, Baron.
I think you made a mighty good sale there.
A mouse!
There it is!
Mousey, mousey, mousey.
Nice mousey, mousey, mousey.
-It's Mickey Mouse!
-Oh, Mickey Mouse!
Hey, you!
Let go of my tail!
An impostor!
Stealin' my stuff!
How mortifyin'!
How mortifyin'!
He ain't get the feeling and a guest in my own domicile.
Fightin' words...
My mansion ain't big enough for the both of us.
Okay, pal.
You wouldn't throw me out, would you?
I wouldn't, hah?
Watch me!
-Do something, Mickey!
-Yeah!
Hey, Mickey!
Cut out the adagios and play something to the level of these mugs.
THE HOT CHOC-LATE SOLDIERS
Look at the brave hot chocolate soldiers marching away to war
Followed by more hot chocolate soldiers fresh from the candy store
Look at the band that's going with them look at the drums they've got
Marching in syncopated rhythm
Rhythm that makes it hot
Here they come. Here they come with a candy fife and a chocolate drum
Here they come. Here they come
With their tummies full of rum
Look at those lovely chocolate ladies giving a parting sigh
Tillies and Flo's and Kates and Sadies
Throwing a kiss goodbye
Listen to me, hot chocolate soldier hide from the blazing sun
Don't get too hot, hot chocolate soldier til the battle's won
They're off to fight
The battle of vanilla-roma
Over there
They crossed the springs and mountain tops and through the fields of lollipops
It's war! It's war!
The popguns roar
From planes to strand
And candy hight
They'll bomb the foe
With cracker-jack
They're off to fight
Those great big gingerbread men
And they'll come marching home
Look at the brave hot chocolate soldiers marching away from war
Followed by more hot chocolate soldiers back to the candy store
Look at the band that's coming with them look at the drums they've got
Marching in syncopated rhythm
Rhythm that makes it hot
Here they come. Here they come with a candy fife and a chocolate drum
Here they come. Here they come
With their tummies full of rum
Look at those lovely chocolate ladies waving to greet their men
Tillies and Flo's and Kates and Sadies
Happy as brides again
Listen to me, hot chocolate soldier hide from the blazing sun
Don't get too hot, hot chocolate soldier now the battle's won
Jimmy...
We're in trouble.
Harvey Clemp bought those lions from the Baron.
He outbid me.
Liondora had a hand in this.
The rat!
We've got to get those lion back.
Olhe!
My big bad moments
That's Clemp's wife.
Poor Clemp.
Here's where you come in.
Get busy with Mrs. Clemp.
Do your stuff.
You mean Don Juan?
You're better than
Don Juan.
I'm Don Two.
I got my work cut out for me.
I wonder who it is.
Maybe the Barrymores.
Perhaps it's Garbo.
What do you want?
We'd like to see the Baron.
Baron Munchausen.
What's your business?
Well, you see, sir...
It goes like this.
He bought some lions from us.
And paid us with a check.
Yes and we've been all over town trying to cash it.
Fifty thousand tiddly-winks?
Yes, sir. The Baron told us that a tiddly-wink was worth a dollar and a half in his country.
That is, you understand, at the present rate of exchange.
You guys are screwy!
Now, listen...
If you guys ring that bell again, I'll break your arm off and stuff it down your throat.
Who rang the bell?
I did.
-Are you going to stand for that?
-I should say not!
He can't bluff me.
I'm going to see the Baron if I have to stay here all night.
I'll give him his check and take back our lions.
That's a good idea.
We can get along without his old piddly-winks.
Certainly.
We don't want...
Not piddly-winks...
Tiddly-winks.
Piddly-winks...
Now, if you come ba...
Oh, Baron!
Baron Munchausen!
Don't be rude.
Oh, Baron!
Oh, Baron!
Pardon us, folks.
I've had my moments
I've had my moments
I will confess
My fleeting moments
Of tenderness
I sang of true love
I played guitars
Then found a new love
'neath tropical stars
An infant prodigy.
This time's the last time
This time it's new
Love as a pastime
For me is through
Your stomach notes are beautiful.
I've had my moments
My big bad moments
Rubenstein's melody intact.
But now my one big moment is you
You've got me under your spell.
Please continue but in a lighter vein.
A new style of singing.
What stirrin' words...
What diction...
For posterity.
I've had my moments
I'm convinced.
My big bad moments
You're the biggest thing since Canera.
But now my one big moment is you
I'm gonna take you under my wing.
And develop you.
Do you think my personality and figure will appeal to the public?
You'll know them for a gool I tell you.
You'll be a double feature.
Won't Clemp City be amazed!
Maybe I'll be America's Sweetheart.
You'll be everybody's sweetheart.
Your picture will be on every ash can.
My dream producer...
Ah... Pardon me.
Have you seen Baron Munchausen?
Oh yes.
Many times.
I want some service.
Mr. Durante says, Miss Velez, that if you came to this party you weren't to have anything to drink.
I don't care whatever he say!
I want service!
I know, but he said no more tonight.
I don't care!
You keep out of this.
Oh, so you want to strike me?
Sit down.
I wanna talk to you.
Alright, but make it snappy.
There they are.
How can I ever repay you?
If I've got anything you want, just ask for it.
-Anything?
-Anything.
Then get your husband to give me those lions.
I've gotta get some lions to fight with.
It's my career.
I must find a lion to replace Anatole.
Anatole?
That's Anatole.
I owe my success to him.
He was the first lion I ever conquered with my bare fist.
I beat him to a rug.
Anatole came charging me from behind a tree.
I gave the famous Schnarzan call, and then...
And then, I leaped.
I got him by the throat.
It was me or the lion.
I gave him the jungle jai-jitsi...
And then Anatole was a dead cat.
It was another Schnarzan triumph.
Just another chapter in my memory book.
I have no fear of man, woman or beast.
Just the way of the Durantes.
And after you conquered Anatole, what did you do?
I gave him a chance to rest and then I pounced on him again.
He got immune!
I'm double crossed. Oh...
You, big brute!
I like it on top.
I'll mangle you... from bone to bone.
There's no room for both of us.
Hollywood Party!
Hollywood Party! Hollywood Party!
Hollywood Party!
Going a mile a minute
Hollywood Party
Nobody sleeps tonight
Hollywood Party
Get up! Get out!
Get in there!
Hollywood Party
Nobody sleeps tonight
But now my one big moment is...
-Me?
-You!
Hollywood Party
Hollywood Party
Tarzan,
The Untamed
Jimmy!
Jimmy, wake up!
Oh...
Who is it?
Oh, it's you.
What's the matter?
You frightened me, honey.
I was just dreamin'.
You've been sleeping an hour.
Come on. We'll be late for Lupe's party.
-Come on, dear.
-Jean...
Tell me...
Do I look like a horse's head?
No, Jimmy.
Not like a horse's head.
Come on, toots.
THE END
Don't let it bother you
When things go wrong
If you're glum, just hum
And some good luck will come along
Don't let it bother you
If now and then
You may stumble, never grumble
Count from one to 10
- A frown is a smile upside down
- So turn that frown upside down
And smile
And sing oh-la-la-la
Don't let it bother you
If skies are gray
Learn to grin
And take it on the chin
Then everything will be okay
Oh, it's no use, Guy.
Mine has housemaid's knee.
Don't be discouraged, Egbert.
I think you show distinct tendencies towards terpsichorean excellence.
You think so, really?
You know, as a matter of fact...
...my inner soul has always yearned to express itself in the dance.
- Lf you were I, what would you do?
- Stick to law.
Spoken like a real native.
Do you recognize it?
No.
What? Oh, yes.
Oh, my, Guy, this is an expensive place here.
Guy, in the excitement of changing my clothes on that train...
...I left my wallet in that other suit.
Egbert, what would you do without me?
I mean to say...
I've been in America for several months with my friend.
We're passing through Paris on our way to London. We're taking the boat tomorrow.
I am the proprietor.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm afraid we'll have to mail you the amount of the check.
Well, monsieur, I do not know you.
This gentleman's father is Sir Frederick Fitzgerald...
...the distinguished London attorney.
Yes, and I'm a lawyer too.
You, monsieur?
My friend here is Guy Holden, the American dancer.
Musical comedy and whatnot.
Certainly you've heard of Holden.
Oh, yes, I have heard of Guy Holden.
But, monsieur, have you any means of identification?
Well, you see, we...
Left them in the other suit.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Well, I...
I have it, I have it.
Look here, old chap, if my friend dances like Guy Holden...
...that proves he is Guy Holden, doesn't it?
Go ahead, Guy, dash them off a bit of a minuet...
...or a polka or a schottische.
Now, wait a minute, I'm on my vacation.
I'm not going to do any dancing.
I've heard they make you wash dishes in Paris.
There you are.
That means nothing.
Then you try it.
Suppose you do it over there.
- With all these people around?
- Well, if you are Guy Holden...
...people should not disturb you.
No.
French cooking must make the dishes very difficult to wash.
Guy, never mind.
Thank you.
Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald.
Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Who is it? What's the matter?
What do you want?
- Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Yes.
- Mr. Pinky Fitzgerald?
- Yes.
Pinky? That's the first time
I've heard that one.
Must be from Father.
He's always called me Pinky.
Ever since I was a golden-haired little tot paddling about in pale-pink pajamas.
What do you want?
Tip that boy, will you?
Read that for me.
I'm all involved here, Guy, please.
- Thank you, governor.
- Right you are.
Yes, it's from your father. He says:
"Leaving for Scotland. Stop.
Take charge of office in my absence. Stop."
Good. Father's placing everything in my hands.
But I haven't finished yet. He also says:
"But don't do anything, just sit."
Let me see that.
Why, Pinky, evidently you've been in charge of the office before.
- Excuse me. Can you help me in section D?
- What is it?
- I can't do a thing with her, sir.
- Who?
The lady in section D, sir.
She's an American.
You know how these Americans are, sir.
- When finished, look after that gentleman.
- Yes, sir.
Will you gentlemen come with me, please?
Excuse me, madam, I am the chief inspector. Anything I can do for you?
You most certainly can.
This man wants to mess up my trunks...
...after I've packed the lovely things
I bought in Paris.
I'm very sorry, madam, but we have to inspect all luggage...
...for dutiable merchandise.
Now, madam, how much did you pay for this?
That? Oh, now, how much did I pay for that?
I know I paid an awful lot. But I shouldn't be telling you that, should I?
- Where did you buy it?
- Where did I buy it? Oh, now, let me see.
What was the name of that town?
- Paris?
- Paris? No. No, it wasn't Paris.
- Lyons?
- No. No, it wasn't Lyons...
...but you're getting warmer.
- Nice?
- Niece. Yes, that's who I'm waiting for.
- What?
- Yes, my niece, Mimi.
I sent her a cable to London and told her to meet me here.
- Where is she?
- I'm sure I don't know, madam.
This is the only other place she might be.
Oh, there she is.
Thank you very much.
- Hortense.
- Mimi, dear.
How are you?
Oh, you look perfectly marvelous.
Yes, don't I.
This is my niece, Mimi.
I told you about her.
The poor thing has had her life all mixed up...
...but I've come over expressly to straighten it all out for her.
Madam, we would appreciate it if you'd straighten this matter out first.
Well, what is it you want me to do?
Come with me and we'll make a declaration of all your purchases.
Everything's so topsy-turvy.
Will you put those things in while I lock this?
- These?
- Yes, please.
Would you be good enough to hold this for me? Thank you.
- Did you have a nice trip?
- I had a marvelous trip. I adore Paris.
It's so like Chicago.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
It's such a relief when you're traveling to feel that you've never left home at all.
I shouldn't be long, dear.
Come along, men.
Porter. Porter.
- Oh, porter.
- Sorry, I'm busy, ma'am.
Porter.
Oh, porter. Porter.
Porter.
Porter. Porter.
Porter.
I beg your pardon.
Can I be of any assistance?
Why... Well, yes.
My aunt is in the inspector's office.
Would you call her for me?
- Well, yes, indeed.
- Thank you.
With pleasure.
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.
- So am I.
- So is my aunt.
You know, the one you were going to call for me.
Oh, yes.
Is there anything special you want me to tell her?
Well, you might tell her that my dress is caught.
Your dress is caught.
My, my.
- Locked.
- Yes.
And you want me to call your aunt?
Yes.
You know, a third party might spoil this.
Porter. Oh, porter.
Oh, porter. Porter.
There's no reason why I can't handle this myself.
I pulled a cat out of a well once when I was a boy.
Now, let me see...
- Maybe I should've called your aunt.
- Well...
Oh, I'm awfully sorry. Please take this.
- Please forgive me.
- I'm living in London.
Where can I return this to you?
Oh, I'm stopping in London too.
May I save you the trouble and call for it?
I'd rather you wouldn't.
Well, here's my address.
I'll be waiting to hear from you.
- You didn't say goodbye.
- No, I didn't.
Well, that's wonderful.
That means I'll see you again.
I'll pay it, but I want to know how every cent is spent.
Oh, here you are, Hortense.
I just had the most embarrassing experience.
A man tore my dress off.
My goodness. Anyone we know?
- Hortense.
- Here you are, madam.
Oh, for me? And I do adore fruit baskets.
Oh, isn't he generous.
You shouldn't have been so extravagant.
After all, we've just met, you know.
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Have you time for an encore?
- Sorry, guvnor. My time's too valuable.
- Oh, so sorry.
Don't you want to ask me who sent that, sir?
Oh, I see, the play spirit.
All right, tell me. Who sent it?
The young lady gave me 3 shillings, sir, and asked me not to tell.
Oh, yes. I see.
"And asked me not to tell."
- Guy.
- Yeah?
- Package for you.
- A package?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's my raincoat.
That must be her handwriting.
Let me see.
I used to study handwriting.
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's very neat.
Yes. The O's and the A's are open.
That means extravagance.
Look at the way she crosses her T's.
That denotes temper.
She makes little circles instead of dots.
Dreadful. It's an unfailing sign of vanity.
Yes. Of course, don't let me discourage you. L...
Guy, what is the matter with you?
You seem to be under some sort of a spell.
I am, and for the first time in my life.
What are you looking for?
- Where's the note?
- Oh, no note.
- No note?
- No note.
- Did you talk to the messenger?
- I did.
And he said that she asked him not to tell where it came from.
I wonder if she resented my tearing her skirt.
Well, I wouldn't be at all surprised.
That's the usual reaction.
- What did you do that for?
- She couldn't move.
Sounds very unsporting of you.
Guy, really.
Well, you don't understand.
You see, she... It was an accident.
- It usually is. What's her name?
- I don't know.
- Where does she live?
- I don't know.
My, what an interesting romance.
I was in hopes that she'd send some note with this raincoat, along with her address.
Well, without having the prophetic powers of a seventh son...
...I would hazard that she doesn't want to see you anymore.
Yes. Well...
...I'm going to rush off to the office.
- What are you going to do, Guy?
- I'm going to start looking for her.
I'll find that girl, Egbert, if it takes me from now on.
Well, it shouldn't be difficult. After all, there are only 3 million women in London.
It's just like looking for a needle
In a hay stack
Searching for a moonbeam in the blue
Still, I've gotta find you
It's just like looking for a raindrop
In the ocean
Searching for a dewdrop in the dew
Still, I've got to find you
I'll roam the town
In hopes that we'll meet
Look at each face
I pass on the street
For sometimes I hear
The beat of your feet
But it's just imagination
Oh, it's like looking for a needle
In a haystack
Still, I'll follow every little clue
'Cause I've got to find you
It's just like looking for a needle
In a haystack
Searching for a moonbeam in the blue
Still, I've got to find you
It's just like looking for a raindrop
In the ocean
Searching for a dewdrop in the dew
Still, I've gotta find you
I'll roam the town
In hopes that we'll meet
Look at each face
I pass on the street
Sometimes I hear
The beat of your feet
But it's just imagination
Though it's like looking for a needle
In a haystack
Still, I'll follow every little clue
'Cause I've gotta find you
Hello, hello.
I've been looking for you.
Well, wait a minute.
Please stop. I want to talk to you.
Isn't it peaceful here?
Would you mind moving your car, or don't you want it anymore?
Yes, Guy, it is peaceful, isn't it?
What a shame.
Two perfectly beautiful cars.
In a moment, the air will be full of fenders.
Wait. Would you mind hitting it just about there?
That cigarette lighter never did work anyway.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.
Porter. Porter.
Can't do it.
I guess I'm too economical.
Now there.
Can I offer you something?
Frosted chocolate, Cointreau,
Benedictine, marriage?
What was that last?
- Benedictine.
- No, after that.
Oh, marriage.
Do you always propose marriage as casually as that?
There's nothing casual about it.
I've given it a lot of sincere thought.
Matter of fact, I've lost sleep.
Do you realize I've spent the last two weeks looking for you?
Didn't you get your coat all right?
Yes, but I missed something.
Some little note telling me where I could get in touch with you.
I've got to know something about you:
Whether you're happy, what flowers you like...
...your favorite books and music.
Look, when do I see you again?
Won't you please tell me where I can get in touch with you?
You can't.
I'm staying with friends, old friends.
You'd be much too upsetting. I wouldn't know what you were going to do next.
Well, if you won't give me your phone number, here's mine.
Just wasting paper.
I thought you were economical.
That's better.
May I go now?
All right. But you will try and call me tomorrow, won't you?
I'll be waiting.
I'll be waiting every day.
And then I'll rest up at night so I can wait some more.
I say, old chap, do you mind letting us through here?
Oh, rather. Right you are. Cheerio.
Right you are, sorry.
Awfully sorry, folks. Right.
I bought this in a sporting goods store.
Wait. You didn't tell me your name.
Mimi.
Mimi?
Mimi.
- I'll tell Mr. Fitzgerald you're here, Mrs...
- Thank you very much.
Hortense, it's hopeless.
I don't know why we're here.
Darling, Egbert's a very old friend of mine.
He doesn't know much about law.
It's his father who's the brains.
You know, all of his family spent their entire lives at the bar.
Dear Egbert. He was nearly my third husband.
He would have been, too, but he suddenly left for India on an elephant hunt.
I wonder why he preferred to hunt elephants when he could've married me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ditherwell, Mr. Fitzgerald doesn't seem to recall your name.
Why, what do you mean, he doesn't?
Oh, of course, I've been married again.
He wouldn't know me as Ditherwell.
That was my third husband, my last.
Now, let me see.
What name did Egbert know me by?
Hortense, darling.
I didn't marry in 1929 or '30.
That was the year of the crash. Men didn't know whether they had money.
Well... Well, I tell you just what you say.
You say "peanuts." He'll know.
- Peanuts?
- Yes.
You know, the association of ideas.
Peanut, elephant. Elephant hunt, me.
- I'll tell him "peanuts," madam.
- Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
She said to say, "peanuts."
Oh, did she?
Well, tell her I don't want any.
She also mentioned something about India.
Elephant hunting.
Well, that makes it,
"peanuts, India, elephant hunt."
That doesn't make sense. Horte...
Oh, no. No, it couldn't be.
Tell her I'm not here.
Tell her I'm in conference.
Tell her I'm out of town.
Egbert, darling.
Oh, darling.
Oh, you mustn't mind him.
He's so impetuous.
You do look wonderful, and you look just the same.
The same sweet smile, and the same dear little eyes.
I want you to meet my niece,
Mrs. Glossop.
Mrs. Glossop.
- How do you do, Mrs. Glossop?
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you.
- Thank you. Well, yes. Sit down.
- Sit down.
- Yes, thank you.
I'm here professionally, Egbert.
This poor little thing is married, unhappily married.
Now, isn't that criminal?
It's no crime to be married.
Just shows a weakness on the part of men that women take advantage of.
Egbert, are you proposing to me again?
No, no, no.
Mrs. Glossop, I presume, has a problem.
Yes, I have.
There are so many things in connection with it that I hardly know where to begin.
- Oh, well...
- Sit down, Egbert.
I'll tell him all about it.
You see, she's been married two years and she's scarcely ever seen her husband.
In fact, she never hears from him unless he wants some of her money.
I met him at school.
He was one of my instructors.
Yes, he's a geometrist.
Oh, a geometrist.
- No, darling, a geologist.
- Oh, a geologist.
Well, all right, a geologist.
What difference does it make?
It's all the same.
- You know, rocks and things.
- He threw them?
No, he digs them, he digs them.
Well, have you asked your husband for a divorce?
Repeatedly, but he refuses to even discuss it with me.
Well, you understand that obtaining a divorce in England...
...is a very difficult thing, unless the husband agrees to grant it.
Oh, Egbert, I didn't know you like dolls.
He always had the mother instinct.
Ladies, as your legal adviser,
I would suggest that we resort to a...
- Thingamajig.
- Flagrante delicto.
- Why? Yes, yes, of course.
- Yes, yes.
You know, I had one at my second divorce.
Yes. Of course, Mrs. Glossop...
...the details are very simple.
- A seaside hotel and...
- Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll do anything you say.
And leave the further details to the two of you.
I think really it would be much better for me if you remained.
No, no, run along, dear.
I'll fix everything.
Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, and I feel very comfortable in your hands.
Really? Well, Mrs. Glossop,
I'll work my brain to the bone for you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Now, let's get right down to business.
Oh, Egbert.
I mean the hotel.
I know a very nice one just opening at Brightbourne.
It's the hotel Bella Vista.
Oh, Bella Vista, and so easy to remember.
I had a cook named Bella once, or was it a masseur?
Well, anyway, I'll have my niece drive down...
...and she'll meet you there tomorrow at the Hotel Maryland.
No, no, no, that wasn't it, was it?
But it had something to do with a girl's name.
Perhaps you'd better take this with you.
The Bella Vista. Of course.
That's what I said in the first place, isn't it?
Oh, goodbye, Egbert.
You know, divorces make me so sentimental.
Don't you wish it was ours?
Yes, miss.
I understand, miss.
- Who was it? A man or woman?
- A lady, sir.
- Did she give you a message?
- Yes, sir.
Well, what is it, what is it? Tell me.
It's no use getting excited, sir.
It was the wrong number.
Well, get everything ready. Hurry, hurry.
I'm leaving for the seashore immediately.
What, did another woman propose to you?
Yes, sort of... No, no, no, no.
I've got a case.
- Case of what?
- Oh, dear. A divorce case.
With father out of town, this is my opportunity.
- I'm going to handle it all myself.
- That will be good.
Yes. Hurry, man. Pack my things.
And Mr. Guy's also, sir?
What's he got to do with it?
Of course, a splendid idea.
You've got to come along.
Change will do you good.
You look a little liverish.
It isn't liver, sir. It's love, sir.
I can't leave London.
I'm waiting for a telephone call.
Guy, you're not pining for that girl?
Pining? Men don't pine. Girls pine.
Men just...
...suffer.
Guy, she hasn't called you in over a fortnight.
It's perfectly obvious that she's not interested.
You pulled her gown.
She pulled your leg.
- Maybe you're right.
- Of course.
I never waited two minutes for a girl in my life...
...and here I've waited two weeks for this one.
- Where are we going?
- Brightbourne, a marvelous hotel.
To the Hotel Mabel...
The Margaret... The Nellie...
Confound that woman.
Why did she come back into my life?
It doesn't make any difference.
The change will do you good.
Sea air, sunshine, gaiety, girls.
You're my type
Of a shy type of a beau, dear
Beg pardon?
So let's do things
Well, really.
I'll teach you a few things
Are you talking to me?
Now, who said just what you said
For I know, dear
No, no, I've been reading. Look here.
I'm not bashful
I'm mashful and pashful
I'm beginning to sense that.
When you're near I feel
So let's play house-y
Oh, you make me feel
So Mickey Mouse-y
For a well-known lawyer, at a place like this...
You're sweet and so agreeable
And I feel so gosh-oh-geeable
Do warm me or I'll freeze
And let's k-nock k-nees
You are so bill and coo-able
And I'm so l-love-you-able
Come cuddle closer, please
And let's k-nock k-nees
Is this sort of a game?
They say make hay while the sun shines
It's an agricultural term.
So let's, oh, let's make hey-hey-hey
While the moon shines
My heart's so tick-tock-tick-able
Your lips are so lipstick-able
You know your ABCs
So let's k-nock k-nees
Oh, Guy...
Never mind.
It's so incomprehensible
It doesn't seem quite sensible
And yet I like it
Please, let's knock knees
It's almost hoi polloi-able
And yet it's quite enjoyable
Oh, I'm full of rhapsody
Too many people here.
Tripping, skipping, lightly bounding
- Stop it, knock it
- Really, this is most astounding
It makes one feel so thrill-able
Well, we've exhausted every syllable
I crave frivolity
I've got one. Let's k-nock...
Let's knock knees
Let's knock knees
Hello, hello.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, I've been looking all over for you.
- Just dancing.
- Oh, is that what it was?
This is a marvelous place, isn't it, Guy?
Remind me to come down here the next time I want my constitution undermined.
I think it's wonderful.
Oh, what is the matter with you?
Are you still moping over that same girl?
Why, the world is just full of girls.
I know, I know, but not like her.
She's music.
She's the buzzing of the bees in clover.
She's the rustle of the leaves in the trees.
She's water lapping on the shore.
Yes. She sounds like a series of strange noises to me.
Well, cheer up, Guy, cheer up.
You may chance across her again some time.
I know I will.
And when I do, it won't be chance.
Chance is the fool's name for fate.
What was that last?
"Chance is the fool's name for fate"?
Guy, that's marvelous.
Where did you get it?
Where did I get it?
It's just a line from my last show, that's all.
It's wonderful.
Make a good title for a song.
Chance is the fool's name for fate, my lad
Chance...
Do you mind if I use it? Come in handy, you know, to shoot into a conversation.
Go ahead, spring it on your father.
It may encourage him about you.
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."
I'll have to remember that.
I love the place.
Oh, if Father could only see...
...with what éclat I am upholding the professional dignity of the firm.
Guy, I'm going to stay here and wait for my client.
Without me, Egbert.
I'm going to my room.
- I'll see you later.
- Well, I'll be here.
Pardon, you rang, sir?
Who, me? Why, my dear fellow, what is there here to ring with?
Pardon, sir, that's just a figure of speech.
Well, bring me...
Let me have a...
There. There, you see?
Your figure of speech has made me forget entirely what I wanted.
Could it have been that you required crumpets, sir?
No, no, no. I never ring for crumpets.
Would you be the kind of man who'd ring for a toasted scone, sir?
Scone? Well, now...
No, no, try me again.
Well, then, can you imagine yourself...
...with a hankering for a nice gooseberry tart?
Oh, what an acid thought. Please.
No crumpets, no scones, no gooseberry tart.
Well, that lands both of us in a cul-de-sac, doesn't it, sir?
Of course it does. I knew it would.
You know, I hate to leave you like this.
You, torn with doubts...
...and me with my duty undischarged.
Oh, well, cheer up, old man, cheer up.
It will come to me.
Was it animal or vegetable, sir?
No.
Well, that leaves us mineral, doesn't it, sir?
Now, sir, was it a bit of half-and-half?
A noggin of ale...
...a pipkin of porter...
...a stoup of stout...
...or a beaker of beer?
Tea.
Tea? Well, isn't it a small world, sir?
- Hello, Mrs. Glossop.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Well, well, well.
All ready for graduation day?
Oh, hello, Egbert.
Oh, no. It can't...
Oh, it is. It's a stowaway.
I thought you might forget something, so I came down to help you.
So good of you. Yes, yes.
Now, Mrs. Glossop, before you register...
...I'm very anxious to have just a few last words with you.
- Last words?
- Yes, if you don't mind. Right here.
Thank you. Now...
Oh, Egbert.
Pardon.
Yes. Now...
I have come to the conclusion that to expedite matters...
...it will be necessary for someone to discover you with someone...
...other than your husband.
Just as a matter of form, of course.
Hortense, I don't think I can go through with it.
Now, don't be silly. Get it over with.
Think of Cyril Glossop. Think hard.
I knew that would do it.
Good. Now, the young man is on his way here.
You understand, of course, it wouldn't be technically correct...
...for me to introduce you.
He will present himself to you.
Then we'll need a password.
It's too mysterious and wonderful.
Well, I have the password. I have it.
The young man will say to you,
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."
Shakespeare?
Nothing of the kind.
It's a thing of my own.
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."
Good. That's just it. Yes.
Now, it will be necessary for you to have a name.
A name, of course, yes.
So your name will be Mrs. Green.
Green. I do adore green.
And, you know, the oculists say it's very soothing to the eye.
Oh, Egbert, are you coming with us?
Why, Hortense. Oh, my, no.
You can't remain with her.
This is supposed to be a clandestine affair.
You can't have a clandestine affair between three people.
That's what you say.
By any chance, are you Mr. Tonetti?
Rudolfo Tonetti at your service.
Yes. Well, I am Mr. Fitzgerald.
Mr. Fitzgerald? I am delightful.
I shouldn't doubt it, old man.
I shouldn't doubt it.
But don't you think a corespondent ought to come to work quietly?
Let's have more repose and less Rigoletto.
I am ready for action and I will do a first-class job.
Well, don't be too determined about it.
The lady in question is very sensitive and you must treat her accordingly.
Whichever way the wind, she is blowing, that is the way I sail.
- Yes. Well, sit down.
- Pardon, your tea, sir.
Your life, Mr. Tonetti...
...must be full of excitement.
Full of excitement and full of danger.
- Oh, yes, of course, from the husbands.
- No, from the ladies.
Oh, how interesting.
But, Tonetti, he know what to do.
Yes, sometimes the lady and I have the conversations.
Sometimes I play the concertina.
Sometimes I play the solitaire, but mostly I practice my singing.
At home, my wife do not like me to sing.
Unquestionably, a woman of great perspicacity.
You bet.
You're absolutely sure, Mr. Tonetti, that my client will be safe?
Oh, signor, with me, strictly business.
My slogan:
"Your wife is safe with Tonetti.
He prefer spaghetti."
Now, listen.
- I'll give you the password.
- Yes.
When you see the lady, you must go to her...
...and say, "Chance is the fool's name for fate."
- "Chance is the foolish name..."
- "For fate."
"The fool's name for fate."
Yes. Well, tell me, please, what she mean?
Well, you have to have some method.
You have to... When you...
Who? Oh, never mind.
- Never mind what it means. Just say it.
- Yes.
Now, Tonetti, remember...
...I want delicacy, tact, assurance, finesse.
I have brought everything.
And now, con permesso, I go inside to make the telephone call...
...to tell my wife I am safely arrive.
"Fate is no fooling..." No.
"Chances are a foolish..."
Oh, scusi, please.
"Taking the name of a foolish..."
Pardon, ma'am, can I be of service to you?
I doubt it.
Let me have the menu.
I'm waiting for my niece.
What have you?
Crumpets, ma'am.
That's too bad, isn't it.
Does it run in the family?
Begging your pardon, ma'am, but that's very "whumsical."
- What?
- Very "whumsical," ma'am.
You know, like Sir James Barrie.
You mean "whimsical," don't you?
In a manner of speaking, yes, ma'am.
Why not "whamsical," then?
Pardon, ma'am, but "whumsical" is much more whimsical than "whamsical."
You know, you're beginning to fascinate me and I resent that in any man.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Oh, hello, darling.
I was just going to order.
I really can't eat a thing.
But you must eat. After all, you can't have a divorce on an empty stomach.
What's the matter?
You look as though you'd seen your husband.
It's Guy Holden, the man I told you about.
What have you done?
Sent out invitations for this affair?
Well, I didn't know he was here.
Oh, he mustn't see me.
Mimi. Mimi.
Mimi.
I've been chasing after you.
You mustn't run like that.
- Why not?
- It's bad for my health.
What are you doing here?
- Same as you.
- What?
I came down here looking for pieces of my heart.
Oh, no. Mimi, do you know what I've been doing?
Thinking of you, longing for you, waiting to hear from you.
I haven't left my telephone.
Well, as I remember it, you gave me a London number.
Well, I had to come down here just overnight.
A little business.
Oh, yes, I saw quite a few of them in bathing suits this afternoon.
Oh, no, Mimi. Nothing like that.
Why didn't you at least just leave some message for me?
- I did.
- You did?
But they said that you'd left London.
Mimi, you did call. That's wonderful.
I'd better leave now.
Please don't go.
It's going to be grand here.
They're having a gala on the esplanade.
It's usually pretty terrible.
But think what it will mean to miss seeing it.
It's worthwhile staying down here just to miss it.
Please don't ask me to stay.
All right, I won't.
Don't go. I've so many things to say to you.
Like the beat, beat, beat
Of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock
Of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip
Of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
"You, you, you"
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling
Where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night
Why is it so
That this longing for you
Follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh-such-a-hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment
Won't be through
Till you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
Cigarette?
I still don't know what you're doing down here.
I came down with my aunt.
Isn't that a coincidence.
I'm here with my aunt too. Aunt Egbert.
Egbert?
Yes, Egbert Fitzgerald, lawyer friend of mine.
We're down here on a case.
Aren't you ever gonna stop running away from me?
When two people are destined to come together as we are...
...there's no use in struggling.
Do you believe in that kind of destiny?
Of course I do. In these things there's no such a thing as chance.
"Chance is the fool's name for fate."
You?
You?
Me?
Why, yes, of course it is.
So you're the man I've been waiting for.
None other.
I'll be waiting for you in my room, 216, at midnight.
My dear, it's 12:00.
I feel just like New Year's Eve.
Good luck to you.
Oh, don't leave me.
I can't bear to face him.
He seems so different.
Oh, there's nothing different about any of them except the neckties.
Him, of all people.
Well, aren't you even astonished?
Me? Astonished?
I haven't been astonished since I was 8.
And mind you, I wasn't precocious, just moderately intelligent.
I'll give him the most miserable night of his entire business career.
A locked door between us.
You seem to be going to a lot of trouble for a man you hate.
Could anything be more degrading?
Well, after all, my dear...
...a corespondent must be something of an artist.
He has to have a sense of balance, you know.
Rather like a mountain goat.
Well, I think I'll look up Egbert.
The poor darling must be lost without me.
Oh, you needn't run away.
I knew you were coming here.
- You knew?
- Of course. I'm Mimi's aunt.
I know, but I have relatives myself.
This isn't exactly old-home week, is it?
Well, nothing is ever done without me.
You're not planning to be there.
Well, of course not.
Just a moment, please. You see...
...I don't know Mimi very well.
I wish you'd please tell me about her.
Well, I'll let her tell you.
After all, if she has to keep you here...
...she'll want something to talk about, won't she?
Keep me here?
Well, she has to.
Say, which one of us is crazy?
Well, it's not me.
All of this is a bit of a shock to me.
Well, your being here is a bit of a shock to Mimi too.
Yes, but it's Mimi's own doing.
Well, I think it's much better to have this settled now, at once.
And then the poor girl can start a new life.
A new life?
Brand-new. She's gonna make a clean sweep of the old.
- I see.
- Yes. Yes, and you're the broom.
I'll be right out.
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting.
Mimi.
Mimi, there's something I wanna...
...get straight in my mind.
- Yes?
At first you were so shy and so reserved...
...and then this evening you were...
Well, what was I?
- Lovely.
- Was I?
Yes, but that's not what I'm trying to say.
Well, what are you trying to say?
Well, I'm trying to describe the shock. You see...
Well, that negligee is charming. Charming.
- From Paris, isn't it?
- You ought to know.
You've probably seen plenty of them.
Well, a few, of course.
Of course.
But never one like that.
Oh, Mimi...
- Stay where you are.
- What?
Keep away from me. Now, will you please keep your distance and I'll keep mine.
I want you to sit there.
What's the matter with it?
Now, we're going through with this in a dignified silence.
I'd really prefer it.
It's warm, isn't it?
Do you mind if I recite capitals?
- What?
- Capitals of states.
North Dakota: Bismarck.
Wyoming: Cheyenne.
Ohio: Columbus.
It's lots of fun. I used to do it as a boy.
I don't care what you did as a boy.
Well, I did nothing as a girl so there goes my childhood.
- Oh, Mimi...
- Keep your place.
Oh, scusi, one moment, please.
Give me a name for chance and I am a fool.
Captain. Captain!
Maybe I'm a mistake.
Oh, signora.
Fate is a foolish thing to take chances with.
So are you.
Oh, scusi. You are not the lady.
Stay where you are.
Oh, Mimi, I mean to say...
...I thought that after the few lovely moments we've had together that...
How can you have the impudence to speak of that now?
But I suppose it's just the callousness of your kind.
- My kind?
- Don't think you fooled me for a moment.
I knew what you were all along.
I knew how you made your living.
Oh, I'll admit I'm not proud of it, but I hope to do better someday.
And in the meantime it does bring me in a decent income.
Some people will do anything for money.
It's not as bad as all that.
After all, I bring pleasure to thousands of people.
Thousands?
Yes, tens of thousands.
I bring romance to tens of thousands of shop girls, servant girls...
...stenographers.
- You might spare me, Mr. Bluebeard.
Oh, Mimi, if I would...
Are you expecting someone?
Why, of course.
But not till morning.
- Who is it?
- Hortense.
I better get out of here.
I have something very, very important to tell you.
Oh, dear, if I only could remember what it was.
- It was something about that man.
- What man?
Oh, yes. Are you sure you have the right one?
- Well, he gave me the password.
- Well, I met a man downstairs and he said:
"Fate is a foolish thing to take chances with." I said, "So are you."
Then he said,
"You're not the lady."
Maybe he said, "You're not a lady."
I don't know, my darling.
I was so upset I can't be sure.
Oh, wouldn't it be too awful if I've made a mistake?
Go and ask him.
But I'll have to confess that I'm married and why I'm here.
Well, don't ask him then, but find out everything you can.
But until I'm sure, well, how shall I treat him?
Oh, I don't know. Be feminine and sweet, if you can blend the two.
I really must go and find Egbert again and tell him all about this.
You don't think Egbert is hiding from me, do you?
May I run along now?
Must you go just yet?
Won't you come in and sit down for a while?
I didn't do so well in here.
Well, of course, if you'd rather stay out there.
Guy...
...do you think it was fair not to tell me something of your work?
Well, I've been trying to forget about it.
Well...
...how did you get started in your career?
Oh, I was started by a very well-known actress.
And the thousands and thousands came later. I see.
Oh, well, in a way, yes.
You see, she encouraged me from my very first step.
- Very first step?
- Yes.
Dance step. I'm a dancer by profession.
You knew that, of course.
Do you mind?
Why, no. No, I'm glad.
I'm glad.
You know, you're the most emotionally unstable girl I've ever met.
Scusi, lady. I am fate to take foolish chances with.
Tonetti?
Tonetti.
I cannot find the lady.
I give everywhere the passwords, and everywhere I get the slaps.
Well, I don't under... Oh, by Jove.
I forgot to tell you the lady's name.
It's Mrs. Green. She's in room 216.
And listen, no more prowling around this hotel like a hyena.
And be sure the lady doesn't leave her room before morning.
Tonetti, he stays, do and die, until the detective, she arrive.
That's right, and when the detectives get...
Oh, my word,
I forgot all about the detectives.
Detectives or no detectives,
Tonetti, he gets paid. Tonetti, I am here.
Well, I'll rush up to London.
I'll bring the detectives first thing in the morning.
Oh, dear.
- Egbert.
- Detectives... What?
- Where were you going?
- Why? I'm... No. I was just thinking...
- Looking for you.
- Yes, I've been looking for you.
I have something important to tell you.
Not now. I've gotta rush to London.
No, but I must tell you now.
Yes. Well, what is it?
What is it? What is it?
Well, that's just it.
I can't remember what it is.
Egbert, you're so tempestuous.
You drive everything right out of my head.
I'm sorry, but I can't wait.
- Well, then I'll go to London with you.
- What?
And maybe it will come back to me by the time we get there.
Besides, you mustn't ride alone at night.
I'll bet you say that to every man you marry.
- Oh, Egbert.
- Oh, well, come along, dear. Come along.
Aren't the shadows on the sand lovely?
Yes, they are. Lovely.
And the light on the water.
The edge of the cloud crossing the moon.
Look, it's coming out.
Look, Guy, it's coming out.
It came out.
Oh, isn't it beautiful?
It's a honey.
I wonder what causes that peculiar effect.
That's what I'm trying to figure out.
Mimi, who is that man that just went into your room?
- Man?
- I saw a weird-Iooking individual go in there.
How many men did you invite here tonight?
Mimi, are you married?
- What?
- Is it your husband?
- Husband?
- Yes, husb...
- Oh, scusi, please, scusi.
- What are you doing here?
Chances are that fate is foolish.
Will you please stay here just a minute?
- It's no one.
- No one?
Mimi, who is it? What's he doing here?
Well, he's here on business.
Business?
- Let's look at the moon.
- Not until I throw him out.
No, no, no. You mustn't. Oh, you can't.
Well, then please tell me who he is.
Well, he...
- I am married.
- You, married?
To a geologist.
Oh, then it is your husband.
Oh, no, no.
You see, I'm not really married.
That is, I won't be very long.
I'm getting a divorce right away...
...and he's here to help me get it.
Wait a minute.
Mimi, are you the women whose divorce
Egbert Fitzgerald is handling?
And you thought
I was your corespondent?
Oh, but now how could you possibly think a thing like that?
Well, you said the right words.
What right words?
Oh, scusi, please, scusi.
Fate is the foolish thing. Take a chance.
Are you the corespondent?
Rudolfo Tonetti, at your service.
- You are no longer needed.
- What?
I am taking your place.
Are you a union man?
Are you hired by Mr. Egbert too?
Oh, Mr. Tonetti, you don't understand.
This gentleman isn't to take your place.
He isn't going to stay.
- Then you need me.
- Nothing of the kind. You're intruding.
- Get out of here.
- But, Guy...
Think I'm gonna leave you with an Italian?
He might be a tenor.
Listen.
I was wrong.
- I'm gonna throw him out.
- Oh, but, Guy.
But I have a contract and I sue for damages.
First for my ear, second for my honor...
...and third...
- Quiet, please, both of you.
This is my affair. I'm here for a divorce, and Mr. Tonetti must stay.
Well, if he stays, I stay.
I feel crowded, but that's life.
At last my call, she come.
Scusi, please. I answer.
Hello? Oh, hello, hello, Maria.
Six times I call you and you are busy.
Gives always:
Yes, the busy signal.
Yes, yes, I'm all right.
No, blond.
Just a blond.
Scusi, signora, but I talk to the wife.
She want to know all about the lady.
Yes.
Yes, kiss the kiddies for me.
What?
What? Maria.
Maria, who is that speaking to you?
What?
What do you think?
My little son Rodolfo only 9 years old and already his voice is changing.
Good night, sweetheart.
You stay, you do not stay.
Tonetti does not care.
But no monkey business.
And the lady must not leave the room while Tonetti is on the case.
You mean we're prisoners?
You don't think I'm going to take the lady away?
- I will see that you do not.
- That's awfully nice of you.
Oh, scusi, maybe you like to play some three-handed bridge?
- No, thank you.
- No?
Not a bit.
All right, then I go inside and play some solitaire.
And please remember not to leave.
I watch.
- Guy, I don't wanna drag you into this.
- But I wanna be in it. And from now on.
You know, I don't think it's gonna be so bad being kept prisoner here.
Hello, hello.
That doesn't sound like the prisoners' song to me.
That's not a bad tune.
- What is it?
- It's the newest thing here.
- It's called the Continental.
- The Continental?
I like it.
That's the second thing I've found
I'd like to take back home with me.
Do you know the words?
It's beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring
The Continental
A way of dancing
That's really ultra new
It's very subtle
The Continental
Because it does
What you want it to do
It has a passion
The Continental
An invitation
To moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion
The Continental
Because you tell of your love
While you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your song
Two bodies swaying
The Continental
And you are saying
Just what you're dreaming of
So keep on dancing
The Continental
For it's a song of romance
And of love
You kiss
While you're dancing
That's not a bad idea.
It's Continental
It's Continental
You sing
While you're dancing
Your voice is gentle
And sentimental
You stroll together
Arm in arm
You nonchalantly glide along
With grace and charm
You will find
While you're dancing
That there's a rhythm
In your heart and soul
A certain rhythm
That you can't control
And you will do the Continental
All the time
Oh, can't we go down there and join the fun?
But what if our jailer should catch us?
I forgot all about "scusi, please."
What is it?
An idea, an idea.
Is this one of those?
I think I know how we can get out of here without our friend Tonetti missing us.
This is something
I used to do as a boy.
- I don't care what you did as a boy.
- "What you did as a boy." I know.
This might work, though.
Look, you've got me cutting out paper dolls.
Oh, I see.
Well, I'll go change.
- That's cute.
- That's beautiful.
Come on.
Look, Mimi. There he is...
Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring
The Continental
A way of dancing
That's really ultra new
It's very subtle
The Continental
Because it does
What you want it to do
It has a passion
The Continental
An invitation
To moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion
The Continental
Because you tell of your love
While you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your song
Two bodies swaying
The Continental
And you are saying
Just what you're thinking of
So keep on dancing
The Continental
For it's the song
Of romance and of love
You kiss
While you're dancing
The Continental
The Continental
You sing
While you're dancing
Your voice is gentle
So sentimental
You'll know before
The dance is through
That you're in love with she
And she's in love with you
You'll find
While you're dancing
There's a rhythm
In your heart and soul
A certain rhythm
That you can't control
And you'll do the Continental
All the time
Dukes and lords
Of noble station
Love the new sophistication
Of the Continental
In a Belgian hall room
In the Monte Carlo ballroom
You will see the Continental
In a Paris bistro
Crowded with apache
You will see the Continental
In the best French fashion
Spain and Italy, Transylvania
Norway, Sweden and Romania
Do the Continental
On the dikes of Zuider Zee
The wooden shoes have found the key
To Continental
It's like a fever
It's like a plague
It's swept all Europe
From Moscow to The Hague
You kiss
While you're dancing
The Continental
The rhythm is driving you wild
The Continental
A meter that isn't so mild
You sing
While you're dancing
His voice is gentle, it thrills you
The touch of his hand
The Continental
A meter that you understand
You'll know
Before the dance is through
That you're in love with her
And she's in love with you
You'll find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm
In your heart and soul
A certain rhythm
That you can't control
The Continental
The Continental
The Continental
He's gone. Come on.
- Now, why did you do this?
- I wanted to be sure of you.
- Who is this?
- How do I know?
This isn't my racket. You've been through these things before.
I know, but you've upset my entire routine.
- Find out who it is.
- Yes.
- Who is it?
- It's the waiter, sir.
- It's the waiter.
- Ask him what he wants.
- What do you want?
- Breakfast.
Breakfast. What shall we do?
Give him his breakfast.
No, wait a minute.
- Oh, Mimi. Oh, Mimi.
- Yes?
There's a waiter who says he wants breakfast.
- What?
- That's what he says.
The poor fellow may be hungry.
Clown. That's our breakfast.
I just ordered it.
- That's our breakfast, Tonetti.
- I open it.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you rest comfortably?
- Oh, yes, indeed.
- Put that right here.
- Yes. May I?
- Mr. Tonetti, you sit there.
- Thank you.
And, Guy, you sit there.
You know, I'd like to have breakfast with you every morning.
Yes? Thank you.
I hope you like what I ordered.
You know, I've never had breakfast with two gentlemen before.
I've tried it. It's no fun.
Now, now, when the detectives arrive, we must be very careful.
Oh, I hope they don't arrive too soon.
I've grown to like both of you tremendously.
That's so sweet.
- Guy. Guy, you'd better hide.
- Let Tonetti hide.
She's right. You'll ruin all. Go.
Guy, please.
You want me to be free, don't you?
- I'll hide, but call if you need me.
- Yes, yes.
Go ahead.
- No, not over here.
- Where?
Over there. Anywhere. Just stay...
Coffee, ma'am.
I thought it best to keep it hot for you.
- Guy.
- Yes, dear.
It's all right. It's just the waiter with the coffee.
Waiter, next time you knock, let's have some sort of signal.
Like this, will you?
I can't be dashing in and out, coffee or no coffee.
Oh, I see.
Knock each time.
- I understand.
- Yes, you see, that's it.
Tell me, the gentleman in this case is a scientist, is he not?
A very distinguished scientist in his own field.
A fossil among fossils. A geologist.
- Pardon, but are you discussing geology?
- Always and again.
If you'll excuse me, sir,
I have an unnatural passion for rocks.
Well, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Oh, no, sir, it's a wonderful thing, geology, sir.
Do you know, geologically speaking, this little island of Great Britain...
...is 500 million and 3 and one-half years old?
How do you know it's exactly that old?
Professor Brown told me it was
500 million years old when I first met him...
...and that was three and a half years ago.
- Who was that?
- Professor Brown.
- Professor Brown?
- Yes. He's a geologist.
Him and his wife stopped at the last place I worked.
Do you know, sir, it was Professor Brown who told me...
...that this seacoast around here is really an igneous intrusion?
You know, you're somewhat of an igneous intrusion yourself.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Now, to return to the facts, we...
Is that the way you want me to knock, sir?
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.
I see. Thank you very much.
Oh, what a day this is going to be.
- Well, Mrs. Glossop.
- Hello, Egbert.
Quiet, pl...
Oh, Guy, what are you doing here?
Oh, Egbert, that's what I've been trying to remember to tell you about.
- Oh, was it?
- Yes.
This is my Mimi.
Oh, really? Yes. Well, this is my finish.
- Tonetti, if you have bungled this job...
- Now, scusi, signor, please, scusi.
Now, Guy, get out.
You're messing up the whole thing.
- You brought the detectives?
- Better than that.
I've pulled a supreme coup.
A masterpiece.
I'll bet this will be good.
I have brought Mr. Glossop.
- My husband?
- Yes.
The husband is coming.
Shut up, Guy. You've got to get out.
- No more hiding.
- Oh, please, Guy. You promised.
All right, I'll hide.
But please call if you need me.
- Call anyhow.
- Yes, I will.
Mimi, it was my idea to have your husband here. Wasn't it clever of me?
Oh, Hortense, why did you do that?
Something terrible is liable to happen.
- Courage, I don't think he'll shoot.
- Shoot?
Is somebody going to shoot? Let's wait.
Shoot? Mr. Egbert, never, never have I had to come in contact with a husband before.
I don't think it's fair to ask me to do so now. Where are the detectives?
I demand the detectives.
It's in my contract.
I'm sorry. I can't do anything about that.
He's probably on his way up.
Do something. Do something.
Look amorous. Tonetti, look amorous.
Hortense, look... Never mind.
- Come on, come on.
- Yes, Egbert.
Well, this is too much for Tonetti.
Quick, quick. What shall we do?
Well, Mr. Egbert said try to look amorous. See, like this:
Oh, you just look sick.
Well, try this:
Come in.
Pardon, madam,
I hope I knocked the right way.
- Now you've spoiled everything.
- I'm sorry, sir. I came for the dishes.
Oh, well, the dishes can wait.
- Can't we do something with him?
- Yes, here.
- Go quickly there, please.
- Yes, hide him.
- In the bedroom?
- Yes. Hurry. Hurry.
- Yes, hurry.
- Oh, now, sir, please...
- Hi, waiter.
- How do you do, sir?
- You hiding too?
- Yes, sir. They just shoved me in here.
Now, once more.
Come in.
Oh, Cyril.
Who is this fellow?
This is my husband.
Oh, how do you do?
I'm so very pleased.
You haven't answered my question.
I must confess, he's my...
This object?
No, I don't believe it.
My dear child, he's nothing to you.
He has all the earmarks of a hired corespondent.
That is not true.
She love me and I love she.
Mimi, you amuse me.
I'd never believe it with him.
This...? This hairdresser?
Guy! Guy!
I'm sorry to ask you to do this, but will you kiss me?
I'm not sorry.
Bravo. Bravissimo.
And who, pray, is this new Lothario?
After the divorce, we're going to be married.
What divorce?
Why, aren't you going to divorce me?
Why, no, my dear.
I'm going to forgive you.
Forgive her.
Enough of this nonsense.
Mimi, you pack up your things and come home at once.
At once, I tell you.
Why, you're just a little lamb who's strayed.
And you, sir, are just an ineffectual little puppy.
At last, I've got my chance to throw somebody out.
Oh, no, no, Guy.
You mustn't, please.
Pardon me, ma'am.
May I go now? I've got my work to do.
Yes, yes, go ahead.
Why, how do you do, Professor Brown?
Professor Brown?
How are you, professor, if you don't mind my asking?
Oh, is this your dear old friend, the rock thrower?
Yes, sir, that's him.
That's ridiculous.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
- I never saw this man in my life.
- Oh, come, professor.
Don't you remember all those little chats we used to have about rocks?
You and me and your wife?
No, I do not.
And would you know the professor's wife if you saw her?
Why, of course I would, sir.
Am I Mrs. Brown?
No, ma'am. You're Mrs. Green.
Well, strike me pink.
You see, Mrs. Brown, she was French.
She couldn't speak a word of English.
Why, Buster Brown, this is most "unfossilish" of you, sir.
I've got to catch a train.
- Let me pass, sir.
- I will not, sir.
- Let me pass, I say.
- Never, sir.
Well, well, what happened? Did it work?
Did it work?
Meet the future Mrs. Holden.
Oh, now... Oh, I told you.
I told you.
Father will be so proud of me.
- Egbert and I are going to be married too.
- Yes.
Why, darling, why, what's the mat...?
We were married last night, on our way back from London.
Last night? Were we?
Why, of course, sir, we were.
Darling, I'd forgotten about it.
Isn't it wonderful?
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll hurry back to London to have a celebration.
Oh, scusi, scusi, I'm also very good at parties.
Oh, what fun we were there when they fall
We have a reason that's worth marching for
Not for battle or banner or foe but for girls...
When we're marching we never retreat for we're charging a foe that is swift.
But when we're caught in a swell of the enemy's girls...
Danilo...
For our country will never make war
We have a reason that's worth marching for
Not for battle or banner or foe but for girls...
When we're marching we never retreat for we're charging a foe that is swift.
But when we're caught in the swell of the enemy's girls then surrender to girls...
You may continue.
Thank you, madam.
Madam.
Pardon me, madam for trespassing in your estate and intruding in your privacy.
What do you want?
I come to deliver a confidential letter.
This is very important, Madam.
Madam Sonia if you should ever meet Count Danilo let me tell you he is terrific.
What is this? Count Danilo?
Terrific?
That's what people said.
Danilo? Danilo?
Yes, Count Danilo.
Now, Madam, this is absolutely between you and me.
This Count Danilo is crazy to meet you.
He tried everything.
In fact, he's desperate.
I really feel sorry for the man, but you're such a widow.
Pardon me, Madam, what I mean is you live in complete seclusion and the poor man has no chance to meet you socially.
Well, I'm very sorry.
I never heard of the gentleman and I'm not interested.
Oh, you will be, Madam.
The man is in such a state of man there is no telling what he may do.
Who is this Count Danilo?
Me.
Who wrote this letter?
I.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
An answer. Yes or... when.
If you don't leave immediately
I shall report you to the king.
Oh, please, please.
Let me stay only a little while and you may recommend me to the queen.
It's hard to believe that an officer of the royal guard...
Dares to approach the richest, most powerful woman in the country...
And behaves like a silly young cadet.
It's an outrage.
Now, don't get excited, please.
I am...
Unjust, that's what you are.
Put yourself in my position.
Imagine you saying all those lovely things to me and me wearing your mask.
Wort you spend sleepless nights wondering what I look like?
Well, my situation is much worse.
I haven't slept for months.
Then I think it would be very wise if you leave immediately and go to bed.
And dream about you.
No. No. You're cruel, Madam.
You're torturing me.
Day by day, I've been watching you when you're riding your carriage in the street.
I come up here every night.
I suppose I'll have to call my servant.
They're all bribed.
Do you know I've been feeding your dogs with the finest imported salami just to get quite a glimpse of you and what do I see?
Your lovely little hands, your dainty little feet and yet the most beautiful thing.
Stop it.
Tell me. You're eyes.
Are they blue or brown?
Are you pretty or beautiful?
Gorgeous.
No. This is no time for joking.
I have been in many situations but this is too much.
There's not a window in Marshovia that I haven't jumped out.
I've got around every kinds of band but here I'm block. By what?
By your piece of flimsy material.
Oh, please. Have mercy.
Leave the veil between us, Madam.
Be a nice girl.
My dear Count, I'm very sorry to be the cause of your suffering.
But, no... l...
But unfortunately, we are in Marshovia and I am a widow.
Why don't you throw away this old custom of ours?
And take off my veil.
Yes.
I'd do it in a minute if there is any reason for it or the slightest temptation, but there isn't.
Maybe you can't see me very well?
Oh, yes. In fact, too well.
I'll admit you're very funny but not terrific.
Not even carousal.
Madam, I want you to understand once and for all.
Our romance is over.
Don't count on it any further.
I've tried to bring the moonlight into your eyes but you pull down the shade.
Alright. Forget me, if you can.
Go back to your solitude.
Put on your loveliest negligee and wish yourself good night.
And please, don't include me even in your dreams, will you?
Good night.
Well? I'm afraid not again.
Come, Muska.
No more salami.
A night in romance is underlying done, in vain through my window the moonlight is drawn.
Oh, Viria, oh, Viria, oh, yes, that's my tune.
I love the shepherd who run for the truth.
Viria, oh, Viria, don't leave me alone.
My little, my little love to you.
Viria, oh, Viria.
I'm waiting for love, lonely without thee was I.
Viria, oh, Viria, don't leave me alone.
Love goes to love and my heart is your own.
Viria, oh. Viria, don't leave me alone.
Lonely with only my song.
Lonely without thee.
Good night. Good night, madam.
Oh, just a minute, before I forget. Melissa?
Yes, Madam.
Would you ask the secretary to find out the address of a certain, ah, of a certain, ah, what's his name? Count Danilo.
Oh, Count Danilo lives in Queen's Avenue.
No. 25, second floor, apartment B
Thank you. Never mind.
That's all.
Good night, Madam.
Good night, Madam.
Good night, Madam.
I thought that this day could be the day when my heart would find your love, your love again.
I thought that this day would be the day and my heart would learn to dance dance again.
It was all just a fleeting dream.
Men are not, not what they seem.
And this beautiful day only taught me to regret but tonight will teach me to forget.
I lay await, he's forgetting me.
It was just not meant to be.
And so it is, I must close my book on dreams and I sealed it with regret and forget.
Madam Menosca. Yes, madam.
My new dress. Yes, madam.
Get everything ready.
We're going to Paris tomorrow, tomorrow morning, as soon as possible. Yes, madam.
There's a limit to every widow.
The melody of laughter flowed many times that it flows here many times
Pretty lover, your pearls and your lavander, soon will enlighten the eye of each cavalier.
Around a lei of roses and glances and he glances like romances once again I meant to be melody of love in Paris in the spring.
Who is it?
It's your suspenders, your Majesty
Any news, your Majesty.
Conditions are bad. Terrible.
What do you hear?
Well, you see, your Majesty.
After all, we're a sheep and cow country.
Who's complaining now?
The shepherds.
Ah.
I overheard two shepherds in the street yesterday.
What did they say?
Now, tell me...
The opinion of the shepherd on the street, that's what I want to know.
They say when the richest woman gets fed up in the country and leaves.
Ah. So they're blaming me for everything.
They're even telling jokes about your Majesty.
Are they funny? That's bad.
If conditions don't improve, the shepherds are going to organize
They say there's already some talk of black sheep movement.
Were they prominent shepherds?
Couple of East side shepherds.
Intellectuals? Yes.
Let them talk.
Are you staying out late tonight, darling?
You ought to know how it is these cabinet meetings.
Do you think it will last all night?
Now, please don't bother me.
Too enough to have a widow in Paris to worry about without having a Queen in bed nagging me.
Widow. Widow. That's all I hear.
A king worrying about a widow.
Not a widow. The widow.
The richest widow in the world.
In Europe.
Well, anyhow, she owns more than half of Marshovia.
Do you realize that she is in every cow in the country for 52 percent?
But you belong to me, don't you, darling?
Read this telegraph from our ambassador in Paris.
Widow sensation in Paris.
Fortune hunters are arriving daily. Marriage in the air.
Unless Marshovia acts quickly, fear national fortune goes into foreign hands.
I know what to do but am too old to do it.
Darling, how late do you think you'll be denied?
Now, let me pump this into your head.
You and I are living on her taxes.
If she doesn't come back, if she withdraws her money from the country, the National Bank will close.
The country goes bankrupt.
There will be a revolution.
Then we'll be trampled from our throne.
Ugly. Something must be done.
Something will be done.
And tonight. This is a secret.
The cabinet figures that we have to meet foreign competition.
Therefore, we're sending a special envoy.
A real man who is not too old.
And knows what to do.
Of course.
The man must be charming, irresistible.
So she falls in love with him.
And he brings her back to
Marshovia.
Who are you going to send?
Well, we're considering
Count Gabrilovetch.
Gabrilovetch?
Now tell me.
If you werert married, if you werert my wife, could you fall for Gabrilovetch?
If I werert married, if I have to do over again and have the choice between you and Gabrilovetch, frankly, I'll take you.
That shows you how I think of Gabrilovetch.
He's out.
Who else have you got?
Well, there's Gabrilovetch,
Jerjosh and Mentroloski.
I'll still take you.
Oh, you'll have to do better than that.
That's what I say, but the Prime Minister, he depends too much on his wife's judgment.
But I say no politics at a time like this. Let the best man win.
That's what the meeting is for.
I'm expecting a real fight.
Darling, do you think it will take you all night?
And I could have married the sultars daughter.
Good night, dear.
Please, I beg of you.
Control yourself.
And you, too.
I never shriek, your Majesty.
Walls have ears.
You think your servants hide anything?
Oh. My good name.
Your Majesty, may I make a suggestion?
What is it?
Let's fool them.
Let's make a rich conversation.
Let's pretend to be social.
Right.
I'll take my hat off you, your majesty.
We're having a good time.
Fine. Fine.
That's enough.
Let's not make a big win.
That'll settle the servant problem
Now, let's keep this scandal between you and you and me.
This must be kept out of history.
Not a soul must know.
Nobody. I swear, not a soul.
We were planning not even to tell your majesty, isn't that right?
That's the spirit.
Now listen, you.
Be careful.
A firing squad is too good for you.
Tonight, you'll be taken to the mountains.
First, your ears will be cut off.
I'll attend to you later.
Yes, master.
No. No, Dolores. That's not right
You know well enough that
I have to go down in history as Augment the Great.
And how do you cooperate?
Falling in love with the Captain of the Guard. Oh.
That's hitting below the crown.
You're wrong, Augment.
You're wrong.
I didn't fall in love.
I was defending myself and splendidly, but you came back too early.
You didn't give me a chance.
If you have return an hour later, you'd have found him where he belongs, outside the door.
How does he compare with
Gabrilovetch?
No comparison, but Gabrilovetch,
Zinchovitch together and what have you?
Gabrilovetch and Zinchovitch, but Danilo, no, no comparison.
Dolores.
Yes, Augment.
With my brains and your contacts,
Marshovia can't miss.
Afraid of me?
Ever live in Paris?
Oh, I spent all my holidays there, your majesty.
Oh. So you know Paris.
Do you want some other lass, your majesty?
No. No. I'm a married man.
Are you married?
No, your majesty.
You don't know what you're missing.
Don't I? No, you don't.
Your majesty, may I make a suggestion?
Please.
Let's drop the matter.
Fine. Now listen, my good fellow
You will leave tomorrow for Paris
Oh, thank you, your majesty.
On a secret mission that's right up your boulevard.
Please, your majesty.
How is your French?
Terrific. (French)
Not bad. What does it mean?
Oh, I was just saying something about her majesty the Queen.
Was it nice?
Lovely, isn't she.
Marvelous.
You will leave immediately.
Yes, your majesty.
As soon as you arrive in Paris, you will report to the Marshovia embassy.
Our ambassador, Baron Bafbaf will tell you the next move.
Your majesty, whatever my mission will be, Marshovia, right or wrong,
I'll never forget your face when you walk into that room.
Did I frighten you?
Oh.
Goodbye, my majesty.
Goodbye, my boy.
What's new?
I overheard two girls on the streetcar.
They were talking about you.
What did they say?
They were telling stories about you.
Were they funny?
Well, they must have been.
You see, I don't understand French but the conductor did, so he stop the car and throw them out.
That's Paris.
City of girls on their own private.
I'm going to Maxim's.
But aren't you going to report to the embassy, sir.
Tomorrow morning.
I'm going to Maxim's.
But, sir.
I'm going to Maxim's, where all the girls are queens.
Each kiss goes on the wine list and mine is quite a fine list.
Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo,
Mango, Crucru.
We promise to be faithful until the night is through.
A melody of laughter, loud and many times, that is laugh with many times.
My dear, my friend, my lover and you soon will enrapture the eye of each cavalier.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll be ready in a moment.
Thank you, madam.
Around a lei of roses, wine and dances, manly glances, sideway glances.
Once again, I will...
Gentlemen?
Yes, madam.
What are your plans for the evening?
We'll go to Cait d'Pate to dine, then to the opera.
We should get there at nine.
Then a late supper at the Grand Hotel.
When it's midnight and all is well, then we'll dance, if you're willing.
How mad, how wild, how thrilling.
I'm going to Maxim's, where all the girls are queens,
Each kiss goes on the wine list and mine is quite a fine list.
Close the window.
Oh, why don't you...
I'll stay on at Maxim's until the morning beams, when I am feeling so good be sure
I'm out for no good.
Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo, Mango,
Crucru.
Wake your young man, please do.
Come on.
Don't spare the horses and drive me to Maxim's.
Where is he going?
What did he say?
I think he said Maxim's.
He's going there it seems.
I heard that's where a man can see ladies dance the can-can.
Lolo, Dodo, Juju, or any name will do.
True love is on a thousand and the best one goes to Maxim's.
We can't go to Maxim's.
Not in my wildest dream.
There's nothing shown there and we are too unknown there.
Lolo, Dodo, Juju, Cloclo,
Mango, Crucru, we promise to be faithful until the night is true.
Danilo.
Lulu.
Count Danilo.
Lulu. Please.
Did you say something?
No.
You better not.
Are you looking for trouble?
No Good.
What if I am looking for trouble?
Oh, shut up.
I won't shut up.
Go home, you old fool.
Pig.
Idiot.
Stop. How dare you?
My seconds will call on you, monsieur.
Very well, monsieur.
I wouldn't bother.
Now, listen.
Who is that old goat?
He's some ambassador from, ah...
You understand.
This whole thing is a government secret of the highest importance.
Yes, your excellency.
Well. Tomorrow night, the embassy is giving a big reception in her honor.
Does she see well off?
No. No. No. No.
Is she beautiful?
She owns fifty-two percent of
Marshovia so she is beautiful.
If you like her or not, you love her.
This is called patriotism.
Have you ever had diplomatic relations with a woman?
Oh, well. Anyhow, these are the plans for tomorrow night.
Before you arrive, she must have a very dull time, so that you can shine by contrast
Therefore, for the first half hour
I will entertain her personally.
After listening to me for
15 minutes, she will be completely bored.
Then we dance, after five minutes dancing with me, widow needs fresh air.
Exit to garden.
Now, and now, she gets the big thrill.
I leave her.
She's alone in the garden.
It'll be a moonlight night.
I'll see to that.
I mean, it'll look like it.
And the next thing, you come over the garden wall.
Danilo. Danilo.
How are you? How are you?
Oh, fine.
Danilo.
How are you?
Danilo. Danilo. Danny.
Danilo.
Stay here or I'll kill you.
I don't like her.
I once have a wonderful girl.
Girls. Girls.
It's good to be back.
Mimi, Gigi, Pipi, Fufu.
Do you still have that frightful chauffeur?
With all the cushions.
Good. Juju, Dodo, Miji,
I gained five pounds.
They're all mine.
And Margo.
Margo with the same sweet dimple.
How's your young lady?
Still grouching?
A- ha.
And Gaches, are your garter still blue?
Baby blue.
Do you still cry when you love somebody?
Did you miss me, girls?
Yes.
And I miss you.
All of you, Mimi, Kiki, Fufu.
Oh, it's great to be loved.
Just a minute.
Don't stand in the entrance.
Go over to table fifteen.
Order lots of champagne.
Any Americans here tonight?
I don't know.
Peculiar, ha?
Bother?
Look who's here. Danilo.
There are girls in the wild and its wet.
There's two things that we live to regret.
Let me dance till the restaurant's close.
With the girls, girls, girls, girls, girls.
Where there's wine and women and song.
It is wrong not to do something wrong.
When you do something wrong, you must do something right.
And I'm doing it right tonight.
I say.
Oh, terrific.
Remember, last year?
Do I.
Oh.
Pretty, isn't it?
He gave it to me.
Not bad. Who's she?
She's new here.
What's your name, deary?
Fifi.
Well, Fifi.
Who is he?
Don't you know me?
She doesn't know me.
You don't know him?
No.
It's Danilo.
Danilo? Wait a minute.
Arert you the man who gave me this bracelet?
Oh, listen.
If I gave you the bracelet, you'd remember it.
And besides, he doesn't give any bracelets.
Shall we sit down?
Well, there's not much going on here tonight.
You're Americans.
Are you a banker?
No.
I was just in a mood for banker.
You understand, don't you?
Sure. Sure.
I didn't mean to hurt your feeling.
It's alright. Really.
Not bad. Come on.
Sit down. Waiter.
Yes, madam.
Lots of champagne.
Yes, madam.
You're the freshest Fifi
I ever met.
I am nice Fifi.
How nice?
Not too nice.
Your right eye says yes and your left eye says no.
Fifi, you're cockeyed.
Quite right.
For instance, at the moment,
I'm looking at someone else, and what's more, let go of my hands.
You're charming, fascinating, delightful.
Stop kicking me.
Stop pinching me. That's better.
Now, you're behaving like a gentleman.
Give me back my shoe.
Girls on my table don't look at other men, you understand?
I'm not your slave.
After all, we're living in 1885.
Shut up.
Constantinople.
Number seven.
Where?
To the private dining room
Oh, no. I never go to private dining rooms.
I don't want to act the lady but...
May I put it down?
Please.
And now, Fifi, if you feel in the mood for banker, the door is not lock.
What's the matter?
Great man.
His only mistake was he attacked too early.
That's how I lost Waterloo.
Oh, now, listen.
I want mine to be kissing.
I want to enjoy sometime, but this is absolutely demoralizing you.
First, it's the Turk, now it's Napoleon.
Well, I'll give you Napoleon.
You can have him all night, and see if you can see his head off the second button.
Anything wrong?
Now it's impossible.
I take her upstairs and just when I am about to be nice to her she stops to talk about another man.
Shame on you.
Why, the girl has no etiquette. Come on.
Would you like to dance?
No.
Not a word. Have I hurt you?
Yet I know.
You have not told me, but you hold me for I know.
Words I haven't spoken, yet I know you hear.
Music find your heart's reply
I love you, dear.
Danilo.
Yes, Fifi.
Do you love me?
Certainly. Why not?
Oh, you don't understand.
I mean, do you love me?
Forever.
How long is forever with you?
What a funny question?
Has nobody asked you that before?
Oh, not at Maxim's.
You like Maxim's girls best, don't you?
Of course, I do.
Where in the world can you find girls so beautiful, so charming, who can dance like you, girl, who can smile like you.
Ah, you're wonderful.
And let me tell you something,
Fifi. Stay just what you are.
Have you met a society woman?
Never.
Well, you haven't miss a thing.
You don't like ladies?
Yes. Yes, I like them.
They are nice but they take love too seriously.
They can't enjoy it without bothering about tomorrow.
You mean, they're hard to get rid off.
Right. And the silly questions they asked. Do you love me?
And then you have to lie, yes, certainly, of course.
And then they'll ask you again, do you really love me?
No, really...
Oh. Well, may I ask who you are?
Just one of those women who ask silly questions, and then you have to lie.
Do you still want me to stay?
Oh, I wouldn't let you go for anything in the world.
But, what if I should bother you tomorrow, what if I should be hard to get rid off?
Darling...
Is that all you can say?
No.
A very clear answer.
No, Fifi.
Fifi. That's all you really want.
That's all women is to you.
Your Fifi. You great lover.
Oh, please.
You don't even know what love is.
Please. Please.
Don't spoil this evening.
Spoil this evening, oh no, I won't.
You came here to have a great time, didn't you?
Well, you'll have it.
You won't be cheated.
Kiki, Margo, Cloclo, Marsel.
Now, listen.
Girls, the gentleman wants to be entertained.
Here they are.
All your little tonight and not a tomorrow among them.
Goodnight, deary.
I deserve your scolding.
I should have known better.
Goodbye to you, Maxim's.
I've got to live in dream.
You give me what a splendid, but now the game has ended.
I give you to Zuzu, Cloclo, Margo
Crucru, but I have lost its spirit
I leave Maxim's to you.
I could not believe it all, but that's all widows are given.
And if you're poor ones or the rich ones, we much more attractive that way.
We are a widow, a merry widow, a merry widow, like as before.
Where is Captain Danilo?
He, ah...
Don't lie to me. Where is he?
He left.
He left?
He left.
How long ago?
Yesterday.
You mean he hasn't come back since last night?
Yes, sir.
Oh. Oh. Oh, dear, dear.
What am I going to do with her?
Please, don't kill her.
Forgive her, sir.
I'm sure she can explain everything.
Who?
Your wife, sir.
Who do you think I am?
The husband, aren't you?
I am the Marshovian ambassador.
Oh. Then I must tell the truth.
Yes, what is it?
Captain Danilo left last night and he hasn't come back.
Oh. What will I do?
What will I do?
If you don't mind, sir,
I still say forgive her.
I'm not married.
I'm not looking for my wife.
I'm looking for Captain Danilo.
Where is he?
Your excellency, you may think I'm stubborn, but he left last night and he hasn't come back.
You find him.
You go to every nightclub, every cafe, every... Here.
Here are some addresses.
If Captain Danilo doesn't appear immediately here in the embassy, he'll be court marshaled
Oh, yes, your excellency.
Listen.
Don't you lose those addresses.
No, your excellency.
Captain. Captain. It's me.
Miska, Captain. Miska.
Yes. Your uniform. Uniform.
Uniform for your captain.
Embassy.
Court marshal, captain.
Nice, captain.
Nice, captain. Nice, captain.
He won't let me put on his uniform.
Danilo...
No...
Come on, hush.
Hush.
No... I'm not going to make love to that widow.
Can you imagine ordering someone to make love?
That's the army.
I never heard of such a thing and I've been with the army all my live.
Do you have to marry her, Danilo?
It's a secret.
Don't tell it, Captain.
It's a secret.
If I don't marry her, Marshovia,
Marshovia will be bankrupt.
That's a secret, too.
And I'm not going to tell you.
He'll be court marshaled if he did not go.
Fifi. Where are you, Fifi?
If she really loves you, she'll come back, but she's not a lady.
I once knew a lady who came back twice.
Alright. Alright. I'm not going.
He's going to be shot.
Please tell him to go to the embassy.
No, I won't. I won't.
Maxim's. That's where Fifi is.
I'm going to Maxim's and nothing can stop me.
Yes.
I'm going to Maxim's.
Any news?
No, your excellency.
Is this him?
No. No. No. Didrt I tell you exactly what he looks like?
Yes, sir.
Oh. Just a moment. Don't...
I'm not going to make love with that widow.
Another a cup of coffee.
I'm perfectly sober.
Drink it.
I'm in full possession of all my sanity.
Drink it.
But I'm not going to make love with the widow.
Drink that coffee.
I'm in love with another woman.
Who is she?
I don't know.
Drink that coffee.
No. Drink that coffee.
I'm a soldier. I'm an officer.
My duty is to fight.
I'm willing to die on every battlefield, but I'm not going to drink another cup of coffee.
In the name of his majesty,
King Augment the Second,
Commander-in-Chief of the Army,
High Admiral of the Navy, drink that coffee.
Now, you stay here and face the widow.
And now, we come to the room, madam, where King Augment say to Queen Dolores for the first time, the historic words "I love you".
Please, madam.
Well. What a surprise.
Captain Danilo.
Well, of all people.
How did you get here?
When did you arrive?
Oh, yes, what a coincidence.
What a coincidence.
I thought he was in Marshovia.
And yes, Captain Danilo.
Madam Sonia, may I present my dearest friend, none other than Captain Danilo.
What a pleasure, madam.
It is?
It's small, it's afraid.
Meeting you is the greatest good that would happen to me.
Madam, may I ask a favor?
Shall I lift my veil, Captain?
Oh, no, madam. No.
I don't jump over the garden walls anymore.
Since when?
Since yesterday.
I fell in love with a girl madly, but she disappeared.
And you, madam, are the only one in the world that can help me find her.
Her name is Fifi.
Fifi is no more. You killed her.
After she left you last night, she came home and committed suicide.
She jumped into cold bath, and you'd be surprised, Captain, what a cold water can do.
Just a moment.
Another telegram to his majesty.
Following his accurate statement of happenings.
Copy word. Introduction performed
Widow accused Danilo of murder but was willing to lift veil.
Couldrt understand the rest of conversation as both talked in code, and shhhh...
At the moment, both are standing in the garden door.
If he could only get her into the garden, he whisper something in her ear.
Apparently, something nice.
She gets very angry in fact, she's furious.
She opens the garden door.
She goes into the garden.
He follows.
Victory. Victory. Victory.
I love you, Sonia.
Well, I noticed it last night.
Oh, please. I'm mad about you.
Everybody is.
I've heard it at least a hundred times tonight, and everybody wants to marry me.
There must be something wonderful about me.
What is it that fascinate all these men?
What can it be?
Is it my charm, or my beauty, or do you suppose it's my position?
You mean, your money?
Yes.
I don't know about the other men, but with me, it's strictly your money and nothing else.
I believe you.
I knew you would.
That's why I said it.
If you have told me last night who you were, if I had only know that I had in my arms the richest widow, I'll...
What did you come to
Maxim's for anyway?
Oh, I see. Just like a man, looking for a thrill.
Goodbye, Captain.
A telegram to his majesty.
Just came out of the strawberry.
Big doings in garden.
Overheard whole scene but could not understand a word because wind was against me, and yet...
Telegram, your excellency.
It's from his majesty.
It's in code.
Zizipoff. Get your excellency.
The first word is Darling.
What does it mean?
D...
Da... Da... Darling,
I consider you the greatest idiot in the diplomatic service.
What is the next word, your excellency?
Lilac time.
Lilac time.
Azratevitch.
Yes, your excellency.
Go to my bedroom.
In the cabinet behind his majesty's picture, there's a little brown bottle of poison.
Throw it away.
It's protective measure.
Yes, your excellency.
Read it again, slowly.
I consider you the greatest idiot in the diplomatic service.
A diplomat who does not know what is going on under his very roof is unfit to be under the lower name of Potpot.
It is hard to believe that you are the son of the great statesman, Potpot.
But, Potpot or no Potpot,
I consider you the greatest idiot in the diplomatic service.
Now, listen, Potpot.
Danilo gives secret away to
Maxim's girls, secret all over terrace.
Local Marshovian newspapers read information by telegraph.
Opposition paper will print story tomorrow. Speedo.
Bring forth the marriage or everything lost.
She must be married tonight.
Therefore, act quickly.
Be brilliant, be creative.
Kill umas. Admit nothing.
Deny everything. Avail crisis.
Face fact. Stand fast.
Something lost if we don't do it now.
What are you waiting for. Augment
You still like Maxim's girls?
I love you and only you, darling.
Please believe me.
Danilo.
Ask me anything you want.
All my silly questions?
Yes. About tomorrow, about all the days after tomorrow
Ask me anything, everything.
But please, believe me.
I do believe you because
I want to believe you.
Ladies. Ladies and gentlemen.
I have to honor to announce the coming marriage and the present engagement of the charming Marshovian lady,
Madam Sonia, and our own Captain Danilo, captain of the royal guard.
It's a love match.
How does he know?
How does anyone know except you and me?
Darling.
Captain Danilo, would you be good enough to come to his excellency immediately?
Sonia.
Yes, Danilo?
Would you wait here for me?
Of course.
Your excellency, how dare you made such an announcement.
How dare you.
Do you know whom you're talking?
To the biggest idiot.
You read the telegram.
What telegram?
Here. Here. Read it.
It's unbelievable.
An officer giving away a government secret to a lot of Maxim's girls.
All Paris knows this.
Tomorrow, it'll be in all the papers.
If the widow ever finds out that this is a conspiracy, that the government sends you here she'll call off the marriage, and the next thing she'll take her money out of Marshovia, then where will we be?
You have to marry her tonight.
Act quickly, be brilliant.
Act quickly, meet crisis, deny everything, stand fast.
Something must be done.
Do it. Do it now.
What are you waiting for?
Your excellency. Shut up.
Sonia, you're crying.
I'm crying because I'm happy.
Why shouldn't I be happy?
Sonia.
Yes, Danilo.
There is something, something I must tell you.
Please. Just a moment.
You love me, don't you?
Yes, I do. I do love you.
You don't have to convince me.
I know it, and the Maxim's girls, all Paris, the whole world, everybody knows you love me.
And everybody knows why.
Well, Captain, go ahead,
I'm waiting.
I love to hear you lie.
Have you nothing to say to me?
Nothing, madam, that you would believe.
Goodbye, Captain.
Congratulations.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I wish to correct a misunderstanding.
The announcement of
Madam's engagement has been made without
Madam's knowledge or consent.
I am speaking for Madam Sonia when I said Madam has never entertained the slightest thought of such an engagement.
Madam, there is nothing left to be said.
I shall make no attempt to explain.
I know it's all over.
There's only one thing I want to say before I go.
I love you, Fifi.
Now, what do you expect me to do?
Fall in your arms?
Marshovia has elected the right man.
You're brilliant, Captain, too brilliant.
Sorry, Captain.
In the name of your majesty, you're under arrest.
You leave for
Marshovia immediately.
Well, gentlemen, shall we dance?
Oh, please, madam.
Open the gate for moment, for gay time is in Paris and play time with the man of sincerity, and he tells you he loves you indefinitely.
What a pretty thing to see,
Paris in the spring.
High officer, Captain Danilo.
Widow has lost company.
King denies heart attack.
King denies heart attack.
Yes, sir.
King denies heart attack.
Widows withdraws many from country.
Keep the change.
Thank you, sir.
What are we going to do?
If the widow doesn't change her mind, we can close up the country.
Oh, Dolores, Dolores.
Looks like exile to me.
Revolution?
The cannon just announced the opening of the trial.
Thank you, Gabrilovitch.
In the name of His majesty,
I herewith open the trial of the State of Marshovia versus
Captain Danilo.
Would you be good enough to remove all the livestock in the court room?
Bring in the prisoner.
Bring in the witnesses and exhibits.
In the name of the State,
I accuse Captain Danilo of high treason, failing his duty.
State is going to prove that this man who lives was always was a madness to Marshovia, with no respect for the sanctity of home, not even stopping on garden walls
Exhibit Two.
Now, generals of the jury.
I will prove this Exhibit...
Your honor, I object.
I object this witness being called an Exhibit.
She's an Exhibit.
She's a witness.
She is not. She is.
Objection sustain.
From now on, the prosecution will refer to Exhibit Number Two as Witness Number One.
Your honor, when I read the charges against Count Danilo,
I realize this case concerns me, so I came here from Paris.
May I have the opportunity to testify?
The court appreciates your patriotism, Madam.
Please, Madam.
Madam, will you tell the generals of the jury, in your own charming way, everything you knew about this case.
As I understand it, you are charging the defendant for neglecting his duty and being a traitor to his country
Your honor, you are accusing an innocent man.
He did everything in his power to be true to Marshovia, and betrayed me.
Don't put him in jail.
Give him a medal, a monument, set him as an example.
A Marshovian patriot who stopped at nothing.
He did do his duty.
He used every strategy, every trick.
He lied, he deceive me, he played with emotions, romance, he was willing to break a womars heart just to proceed what he is instructed.
Your honor, may I be permitted to cross-examine the witness?
Granted.
Witness is yours.
So I lied to you.
Yes.
I was playing you games.
Nothing else.
When I danced with you,
I was only thinking of your millions.
And when you took me in your arms
I was following instructions.
Yes.
And when I kissed you.
That's was the biggest lie of all
That's all I want to know.
I'm guilty.
Guilty of treason, failing in duty, of everything you want.
But most of all,
I'm guilty of being your fool.
Once in my life, I lost both my heart and my head.
Therefore, I should be punished without mercy.
Let my fate be a warning to every men, any man, who can dance through life with hundreds of women, and is willing to walk through life with one, should be hanged.
The widow.
Something must have happened to the widow.
What? What? What?
She wants to go to jail because of Captain Danilo.
I think... Quiet.
Racheski, Gabrico.
Yes, your majesty.
My horse.
Yes, your majesty.
Now, are you a friend of the captain, madam?
Not exactly.
A relative?
No.
But you knew him before, didn't you?
Oh, yes.
Well, you wouldn't recognize him now.
He's a changed man.
Did you hear the story about the warders daughter?
No.
Well, last night, the warders daughter brought his supper personally into his cell.
And what happened.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, he's a changed man.
But here we are.
But, he isn't here.
It looks that way.
Don't worry about that.
He always come back.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Danilo.
He's not here.
When do you expect him back?
I don't know.
Well, anyway, tell him there's a big party going on in the womers ward.
I'm sorry.
I was chased by a mouse.
From your estate all the way here to the prison.
What a mouse.
You don't think I came here
To see me? No.
Yes, I came to see you and to leave with you one message.
Tonight, there's a party going on in womers ward. Goodbye.
Your majesty, not even Napoleon could have thought of this.
Thank you.
The plan can't fail.
They can't get out, that's what they're in for.
Now, put ourselves in their place.
We both have a quarrel and now we're locked in.
At first, we don't talk at all, then I'll tell you what I think of you, and then you tell me what you think of me.
Oh, no, your majesty.
I wouldn't dare.
That's right.
Well anyhow, we're in the cell.
We can't quarrel all night and as time passes,
I begin to realize that after all you're a woman.
And above all, I begin to realize you're a man.
Right. And still more, you're a gorgeous woman.
And as for me,
You're wonderful, your majesty.
Thank you.
That's Marshovia.
The minute you go to party, and people can't get out.
Oh, you're not so innocent.
What? You did the whole thing.
Did what?
You bribed the jailer to lock you here with me.
I have to apologize, you didn't bribe the jailer.
It's a conspiracy.
Against both of us.
They want us to fall for each other.
We are threat.
Oh. But this is terrible.
What are we doing to do?
Oh, now, darling. You can't cry.
I beg your pardon. Let's calm down
Let's keep cool. I have it.
Let's fool them.
Let's fall for each other.
That should be easy.
Really? Why should two people who hate each other
Love each other.
Right. Why then? Let's not do it.
We won't.
Let's drink to that.
May our hearts remain as cold as the champagne.
Could be a little bit cooler.
Oh, please.
Any man who can dance through life with a hundred women
And is willing to walk through life with one should be married.
Captain Danilo, do you take...
Yes, certainly.
Of course.
- Roger...
- Roger...
Oh, Roger, you haven't forgotten about the party?
No, but I'm afraid I can't make it.
- But you've got to come. You promised.
- The whole crowd's going to be there.
And besides, I've saved all my waltzes for you.
- We'll make them up next time.
- It's going to be the best party of the year.
- Sorry. Good night.
- Good night.
I've gotta run, Aunt Sophie.
Can you get home all right?
Yes, but I did want you to go to that lovely party.
Good night, dear.
I'll see you first thing in the morning.
- Good night, Professor Heinrich.
- You did very well, my boy.
But your pizzicato - we still have to work on it.
Remember, as more you press, as less comes out.
I'll take care of it first thing in the morning.
Don't overdo yourself, dear.
Why did you have to say that?
His pizzicatos were perfect.
Perhaps, but these young people today, we have to keep after them all the time.
If he's going to be a great musician...
If he's going to be a great musician?
A boy with his talent?
Why, do you know where he's gone now?
To work. In the Excelsior bakery.
Slaving away half the night in order to have more time to practice in the daytime.
- So?
- Yes.
You sawed-off little runt!
Trying to dump your broken-down horn-pushers off on me.
But you didn't give 'em a chance!
I won't get the stink out of my place for a week.
You can't treat me like this!
I'll get the police!
I'll get my lawyer! I'll sue ya!
Don't bring that flute back in here!
Say, you must be kinda hard to please tonight.
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What do you want?
Well, it wouldn't be fresh air in this cute little cottage.
Hey, hey!
They tell me you're going in for music.
Well... here I am.
- What do you play?
- I don't play, I sing.
I've been up at Lefty's for three months.
Well, if you're so good, why ain't you up there now?
Well, Lefty got fresh and I quit.
But I know I'll be safe here.
Sure. You'll be safe here.
Sure. Just as safe as in the crater of a volcano.
Give us a beer.
Hey, I'm gonna knock you right out of your seat tonight.
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- I've got something here that's dynamite.
Brand-new. Nobody in Barbary Coast has ever heard anything like it before.
You must have wrote it yourself.
No, a friend sent it to me from New York.
Just wait till you hear it.
Stell!
Well, for crying out loud! Snapper!
You're a sight for sore eyes, baby!
- Say, listen. Is this getup on the level?
- Sure. I'm seein' the world.
- I'll say you are!
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
Gang, I want you to meet Stella Kirby.
- Hiya, kid.
- Hi, babe.
We went through school together, up to the fifth grade, and boy, could she spell 'em down.
Here, grab yourself a seat, Stell.
Bring us some beer.
You're looking like a million, baby.
- Did you ever learn long division?
- Never even learned short division.
- And I'm doin' all right without it!
- Ain't she a beaut?
Hey, Bill.
- Here are the fellas I was tellin' you about.
- Hiya.
- Did the other outfit show up yet?
- Yeah.
They just got thrown out.
Just wait a minute.
Say, boss. These boys play great.
You oughta hear 'em.
- Tim Dolan send 'em over?
- No, I told 'em to come over.
This one... This one here, his uncle's a cop. A friend of mine.
Mind your own business from now on.
You're paid to draw beer.
- Are you beginners?
- Yes, sir.
- We've all gotta begin sometime.
- We're pretty good, too.
We've been rehearsing for weeks.
Wait till you hear us.
- Why aren't the others in uniform?
- You see, I was dressed for a concert.
Oh, we can hire 'em for you if you want 'em.
Eh, you don't look so hot to me.
But all right. I'll give you a try.
- One piece.
- Oh, thanks!
- Thanks, Bill.
- We're in!
Ooh!
- What's the matter?
- The music.
- What?
- It's gone!
- But you had it.
- I must have left it on the streetcar.
- You couldn't have done that.
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, are you guys gonna play or not?
- Oh, sure.
Here. Take this. It's music.
- Brand-new. Just come from New York.
- Music, you'd better be good.
If they start throwing bottles at us,
I'll meet you boys on the ferry.
- All right, fellas. Just the chorus.
- Hey, I don't get it.
(# tentatively attempts
''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' melody)
What kind of time is this?
Four quarter. Every bar a quarter rest.
It's crazy.
Come on!
That's it, boys. Swing into it.
My music!
The dirty crooks.
- What's the idea of swiping my music?
- I beg your pardon?
Don't pull any of that ''pardon'' stuff on me. You in that monkey suit.
The minute my back was turned, trying to set yourself in here with my stuff, huh?
All right, kids.
That's dynamite. You're in.
- Who's in?
- All of you.
Say, don't hook me up with this outfit.
I came here to get a job for myself, not for this bunch.
It was my music and my singing that put them over.
- Yeah, but listen...
- They don't know to play. They're rotten.
Oh, and I suppose just because you can stand up here and shout, that you know everything about music, huh?
Fight it out among yourselves, but it's all of you or nothing.
Beer on the house for Mr. Alexander and his Ragtime Band.
- My name is not Alexander.
- It's Alexander to me.
Come on with that beer.
- So I don't know music, huh?
- No.
Well, maybe I don't know the tripe they play up on Snob Hill, but I know what they like down here and that's more than you'll ever know.
And if you think that I'm gonna work with you, you've got another guess coming.
Oh, what made you think that I'd want you with my band?
Your band?!
- Oh, give me my music...
- Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is a situation.
Let's try and figure it out.
Oh, I've got it all figured out.
And I don't want any more to do with you.
Is that plain, fancy-pants?
- Always a pleasure to meet a lady.
- You bet it is.
- Say, you were good.
- I know it.
- Let her go.
- Girlie!
Gee, look at what you've done.
Everything's going along swell and you have to start an argument with her.
- That girl's a whiz.
Wait a minute. Let's be reasonable.
Reasonable? Say, what do you think
I am? A half-wit or something?
Don't pay attention to him. He didn't mean it. He was just shooting off his mouth.
Come on back. Let's pretend it didn't happen. We all need the job.
Oh, say, I wouldn't go back there if it was the last job on earth.
I've seen all I want of that stuck-up pain in the neck.
- Yeah, but look...
- Let go of me.
There he goes again, playing my music.
Opening tonight, Alexander's Ragtime
Band! The hottest music on the coast!
And the queen of ragtime, Stella Kirby!
With the finest fish dinner in town!
Opening tonight,
Alexander's Ragtime Band!
Not bad, boys.
These openings tie me up in knots.
I'm shaking like a coochie dancer.
You call this an opening?
You should have seen the outfit I was with the night we opened at the Crystal Palace.
That was an opening.
Hello, Martha? It's Roger.
Listen, I've got to talk to Aunt Sophie.
I'll try. Will you hold the phone, please?
It's Roger again.
I have nothing to say to him.
I'm very sorry, Roger.
She won't talk to you.
All right. Thank you, Martha.
Good night.
Alexander!
- You, Alexander!
- Yes?
Thank you. Professor Heinrich!
- So your name's Alexander now?
- Yes, that's right.
Uh, won't you come in and... sit down and have a glass of beer?
Not tonight.
I just want to know if you're really serious about all this.
Oh, yes. Very.
But Roger, you spent your whole life preparing yourself for something fine.
How can you throw it all away on this... this ragtime?
But I like ragtime. I believe in it.
And besides, I have what I've always wanted: A band.
Won't you stay and listen?
See for yourself.
No. You know your own mind.
You always have.
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.
Hey, come on, come on!
Let's have a little life around here.
- Bring on that girl.
- Right away.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- What do you want?
- I want to see how you look.
Oh, I look swell.
- Do you mind if I see for myself?
- No, come on in. What do I care?
It cost me my last dime.
- Very nice.
- Oh, thanks, Mr. Astorbilt.
But you know, you shouldn't try to cover up your lovely throat with those feathers.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Oh, and look at those flowers.
You don't really need those.
That's just gilding the lily.
Oh-oh.
And look at those ruffles. Now, that might be all right for some skinny little girl, but not for a girl with a gorgeous figure like yours.
- There. Now, see what I mean?
- Hey, wait a minute!
Oh, and the very idea of trying to cover up that beautiful hair!
- There, now.
- Why, you two-by-four snob!
Look what you've done.
You've ruined my dress.
Now, listen to me. You're not dressing for your sailor friends now.
This isn't Dirty Eddie's.
I'm trying to build a band with class and distinction, and I'm beginning right now.
Oh, so you're a know-it-all about women's clothes too?
Well, let me tell you something.
I know how to dress myself and you or nobody else is gonna tell me what to wear.
Understand?!
You're not going up there looking like a comic valentine. And stop shouting!
I'll go out the way I want to or I won't go out at all!
- All right! That suits me too.
- Well, it's good enough for me.
Pickleface is throwing a fit out there.
We'd better hop to it.
- Are you ready, Stella?
- I'm not going.
- Oh, now, Stella...
- Oh, let her go, and good riddance.
I don't want a woman with the band anyway. Come on, Charlie.
Oh, what a sap I was to let you talk me into this thing in the first place.
Oh, I knew how it would end with that conceited...
Well, I'm surprised at you, letting him get your goat. He didn't mean anything by it.
He was just a little excited tonight - new place, a couple of new boys.
- You can't let us down now.
- There you go, sticking up for him again.
Why, look where he threw my flowers.
I should have slapped his ears down.
You can do that tomorrow.
You've gotta sing now.
Pulling out my feathers, and giving me all that baloney about my neck and my figure and my hair.
- Why, I'll see him dead first.
- You're absolutely right.
Don't sing for him. Sing for me.
Why, you dirty dog. Taking advantage of my sweet nature, huh?
That's a girl, Stella.
Just remember the Three Musketeers.
All for one...
Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.
Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.
Three Musketeers, my... my foot.
Ah! There you are, my tender little dove.
We were just coming to call on you.
- Well, I'm in a hurry.
- Stop being a stubborn, ornery female.
You and the maestro are gonna get acquainted.
Say, I know all I wanna know about him.
And no back talk.
Get in there, the both of you.
Take those chips off your shoulders.
You're both all right if you don't expect too much. And remember,
I'm staying right outside the door here, and if I hear any yelling or screaming,
I'm coming back in here and knock your heads together.
Well?
You and I have entirely different points of view, Stella.
But we are grown-up.
I don't see why, with a little common sense, we can't work together.
A simple business arrangement.
Listen. You're out to set the world on fire.
You're all hopped up with the idea that you've got something to give and you're gonna do it or bust.
Well, that's your business. All I want is a job, and one job's as good as another.
As long as I can pay my own way, and you leave me alone.
You have a great voice.
And a great future too.
If you'd only realize your possibilities and try to make something of them.
Say, I'm doin' all right.
I am what I am, and I'm not gonna let you make me over into something else just to fit your plans.
I guess I have been unreasonable, only seeing my side of it.
But all this means so much to me.
This music, having my own band.
Whether we like it or not, we're together.
We couldn't have gotten this job without you, and you probably couldn't have gotten it without us.
So doesn't it seem sensible that we should try to meet each other halfway?
Well, it's all right with me.
Well, now! You see how easy it is.
Something tells me
I'm sticking my head in a noose.
Come on!
- Good afternoon, Miss Kirby.
- Good morning.
Good afternoon, Miss Kirby.
Good afternoon.
Oh, hello.
My, you look pretty.
Another new outfit?
Mm-hm.
But I think it's a little too loud.
It makes me feel like a stop sign.
I wonder if you realize how much you've changed in the last few months?
What do you mean, ''changed''?
Just because I pay more for my clothes and let my hair go natural?
- Well, that may be part of it.
Oh, you mean I'm getting to be a lady.
More refined and agreeable.
You're wrong. I'm just doing it to save myself a lot of arguments.
Oh, sure.
You're the same stubborn witch.
You wear these good-Iooking clothes just for business reasons.
It burns you up to get prettier every day.
It'd just about break your heart if anybody told you you were blossoming into the most beautiful,
- the most charming...
- Why, I'd call him a liar to his teeth.
What's that?
Just a little hit tune I've been working on.
- You mean you wrote it yourself?
- Mm-hm.
- Do you like it?
- Like it?
- Why, it's great! It's got everything.
- Oh, take it easy.
No, on the level.
Imagine you having that in you.
Why, it'll make you famous.
I wrote it for you, Stella.
If it's any good, that's why.
Oh, thank you, Charlie. I'd love to sing it.
Has, uh... His Highness heard it yet?
Nobody's heard it... but you.
Well, say, this is too good to keep.
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.
Stella.
Oh, come on.
What would the waiters think?
All right, fellas. Let's try that introduction now without the brass.
Alec! Alec, look. Charlie's just written a swell new song for me.
What? Holding out on me, huh?
Oh, it's nothing. Probably won't sell more than two million copies.
- Well, let's hear it.
- All right.
- Late again, huh?
- Who, me? I was on the ferryboat...
Now listen to me.
And this goes for all of you.
When I say 2:00, I mean 2:00.
These rehearsals are just twice as important as any performance.
We may be tops in this town, but we haven't even started yet.
Now, if you fellas wanna stick with me, try to get somewhere, like New York, you're going to have to work.
Now, come on, let's snap into it.
Don't forget that this is an opening night.
You've gotta be better than just good.
Cut that.
- Go ahead, Charlie.
- (plays ''Now It Can Be Told'')
Start over again from the beginning, Charlie.
Louie.
Bill.
Take the melody.
You take the counterpoint.
All right, fellas. Let's fake it till we get our orchestrations.
Take over for me, Charlie.
Imagine, you and me like this.
Imagine.
- What happened?
- Don't ask me.
The roof fell in on us.
The minute I started to sing that song...
The whole world stopped for me.
I'm afraid I even forgot to take a bow.
Let me look at you... for the first time.
That's for tonight.
And that's for all the times
I've wanted to break your neck.
And that's for all the times
I've wanted to slap your ears down.
Do you suppose we've been in love with each other all this time?
Me? In love with that awful person with the platinum hair and the loud mouth?
Heaven forbid!
Say, you were no Christmas package yourself, you know.
Oh, darling.
Don't you understand?
I'm an artist.
- Like Pygmalion.
- Like who?
Oh, just a Greek who took a hunk of marble and molded it and polished it into a beautiful woman.
Then fell in love with her.
Then you mean that you've just fallen in love with your... with your...
- Handiwork.
- Oh, that isn't so.
You loved me from the first day you saw me.
Platinum hair, loud mouth and everything.
I guess you're right.
This is the real thing, isn't it?
It's the realest thing that ever happened to me.
- Don't say a word.
- What?
- Hello, Charlie.
- Don't apologize, don't explain.
I know all about it.
I was there when it happened.
I pour out my heart in a song to some dame.
She takes the song and pours out her heart to the boss.
Well, I told you it was a good song.
If you hadn't written it, the little lady and I would have probably gone on through life slugging each other.
- Well, when's the wedding?
- Don't be so practical.
He's just started courting me.
There, go buy me some flowers. The long-stemmed ones that cost $20 a dozen.
- The kind I've never had.
- I will not.
Next you'll be wanting a Kodak, and then a leopard coat, and then a tin lizzie.
- You'll get ham and eggs, and like it!
- Ham and eggs and champagne.
- Champagne for breakfast?
- Certainly. This is a champagne breakfast.
- Good morning. Three?
- Please.
This way, please.
And while we're guzzling it, we'll have to do a little figuring.
- You know who's in town?
- No, who?
Charles Dillingham.
The big boy himself.
Alec, this is the break you've been waiting for.
Yes, sir.
- Bring me a phone, please.
- At once.
This is Mr. Dillingham's secretary.
Who's calling, please?
I'm sorry. Mr. Dillingham is busy.
No, he's not granting any interviews.
But this is a very important matter.
My name is Alexander.
I have a very fine band, and I'm sure Mr. Dillingham would be interested in...
Hello?
Hello?
Well, that doesn't seem to be the proper approach.
Why don't we go down to the hotel, grease a few palms?
Get everybody talking about
Alexander's Ragtime Band:
The elevator boy, the chambermaid, the barber. Din it in his ears.
Oh, but that would only make him suspicious.
I'm gonna get him to the Cliff House if I have to drag him.
You know, those big guys all like to eat.
Give me that phone.
Stella, you're marvelous.
Uh, Evergreen 2435.
I was reading an interview of his in The Post last week.
Uh, hello.
Uh... Mr. Dillingham's suite, please.
But you won't be able to get through the secretary.
I got an idea. 
Hello, may I speak to Mr. Dillingham, please.
Well, then, will you tell him this is Henri?
Henri!
I was for many years the chef at the Astor House.
I used to cook Pompereau Henri special for Mr. Dillingham.
I read he's in town and I would like to fix for him some baby lobsters à la Henri.
- Baby lobsters?
- What's that?
Oh, a chef named Henri wants to cook some baby lobsters for you.
He was formerly at the Astor.
Baby lobsters in August?
Must be first of the season.
Splendid. Find out where he is.
Where am I? Where would I be?
Chef at the Cliff House, of course.
Then I can expect him tonight?
Oh, thank you very much!
Kiss Papa.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'm the guy that did it.
Hey, Davey.
- What did you say?
- I'll lay you ten to one he doesn't show up.
Yeah? You got yourself a bet, brother.
And no welshing.
You welsher.
Hey, boss, how about me doing my number for the old boy?
- That'll land us all on Broadway.
- Yeah. Sitting right on our curbstones.
Come on, let's give 'em everything you got. The clowning can come later.
It's nerves, maestro.
We're about to be discovered.
- Oh, teacher, will I be discovered?
- Yes, right now.
The number 11, boys.
- Oh, but Mr. Dillingham ain't here yet.
- That's the idea. Or that was the idea.
Oh, let it ride.
I've been double-crossed before.
- What are you doing here?
- Listen, Ruby. Quick, lend me ten bucks.
What did you do with that ten
I gave you last night?
Oh, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on. I'll pay you back.
I'd think you'd be ashamed, taking my hard-earned money to lose in a crap game.
Say, you oughta be glad to lend me ten bucks!
Suppose war is declared and I gotta go to the front and get killed in action?
You'd be very happy to know that you were the one who lent me ten bucks when I needed it most.
Stop. You're breaking my heart.
Look, look! Dillingham!
- Oh, boy.
- Oh.
- Good evening, Mr. Dillingham.
- Good evening.
- You won't need a check.
- Thank you.
- Must be...
- He's here! He's here!
The gray-haired man.
- Alex, let's do the new one.
- How about me? I'll slay him.
- Get Stella to come out.
- Ah, Stella.
Frank. Frank!
- Check on those baby lobsters right away.
- Yes, sir.
- And don't forget that whistle trick.
- You got it.
- Any special wine, Mr. Dillingham?
- I'll leave it all to Henri.
- He knows what I like.
- Yes, sir.
(# ''When the Midnight Choo-Choo
Leaves for Alabam''')
Pardon me. Won't you join me?
Oh, thank you, but I'm not allowed to sit with the guests.
Well, I'm Charles Dillingham.
- Mr. Dillingham, the theatrical producer?
- Yes.
Oh, well, I really shouldn't, but... I'm sure
Mr. Alexander won't mind this time.
- I'm sure he won't.
- Thank you.
- He's rising for the bait.
- Leave it to Stella.
- She'll have him eating out of her hand.
Look. Champagne.
- Won't be long now.
- Yeah, she'll be in his lap any minute.
Another crack like that and I'll throw you right out that door.
If he's talking business, why isn't he talking to you? Or is she managing the band now?
Alex will be there when the time comes.
Come on.
All right. Come on. Let's hit it.
Don't let him think we're too anxious.
- You'll like New York.
- Oh, I know I will.
Henri, your chef, is a great friend of mine.
No food like his in the world.
He's cooked me some baby lobsters.
Won't you share them with me?
Oh, no, thank you. Thank you.
Mm! Superb. My compliments to Henri.
Thank you, sir. He'll be pleased, I'm sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must be going.
I've got to tell Mr. Alexander.
Excuse me, please.
Take over for me, Charlie.
- What did he say?
- He wants me to go to New York!
- What did he say?
- He wants me to go to New York!
- New York?
He's gonna make me a star.
Oh, darling, isn't that the most wonderful thing you ever heard?
- Everything you've wanted for me.
- What about the band?
He says he can't use the band right now but I know he'll find a place for you later.
Oh, isn't it marvelous?
I can't believe it's true.
- Pinch me.
Then you really are going?
Of course.
This is the biggest chance I'll ever get.
Oh, that's swell for you, Stella.
She might at least have talked to me about it first.
Not just go and say yes without even thinking about us.
Oh, but Alex, this isn't going to make any difference with us.
We can still be together.
You can come on to New York with me and I know Dillingham will find a place for you before long.
Oh, yeah. That'd just be great.
But you told me over and over again that
I could make something of myself if I tried.
And now that it's happened, you're all burned up.
I should have known better than to expect anything from you.
Oh, Alec!
Well, of all the selfish little tinhorn sports.
You're jealous because he wants me and not you.
- Now, Stella...
- Well, just remember,
I didn't want to go with your band in the first place.
And all that polishing and molding - you weren't doing that for me.
You were doing that for yourself, just because you thought it would help you get ahead.
And now that it's backfired and helped me, you're yelling murder.
- All right. Go on. Get out!
- Alex...
- Go to New York! Go with him!
- Don't think you wouldn't do the same...
Stella!
Alec!
Don't leave her like that.
Go back and tell her you're wrong before it's too late.
Siding in with her again, hey?
I'm wrong and she's right.
Sure. You don't own Stella.
You can't order her around.
She has a right to decide for herself.
She doesn't owe this band a thing.
We're liable to be stuck here for the rest of our lives.
- Is that the way you feel about it?
- Exactly.
Well, then what are you sticking around for? Why don't you clear out, too?
That's a good idea.
Well, maestro, when does Alexander's
Ragtime Band hit Broadway?
There isn't any Alexander's Ragtime Band.
What?
Left... turn.
Left... turn.
Platoon halt!
Just what did you do before you joined up in this man's army?
- I was an orchestra leader, sir.
- Yeah, I was a drummer. We had a swell...
About face.
Left turn.
There ought to be such a thing as being too proud to knit.
- Boy, I'm dying.
- I'm dead.
- What'd happen if we resigned?
- We'd get shot.
It'd be a pleasure.
Of course, if we'd have been smart enough to get in the Navy...
- Listen to this. ''Boom Boom a sellout.''
- What's Boom Boom?
That's a show the Navy's putting on in New York.
Pretty soft for those swabs.
No more guard duty, no more bayonet drill. No more sore feet.
Why didn't we go in the Navy?
- A show in New York?
- Yeah.
Let me see that.
Theatricals? You're crazy.
- I told them it was no use.
- Ridiculous, I said.
I said this wasn't the theater.
They're in the Army now.
- But the Navy did it, sir.
- The Navy.
- They have time for such tomfoolery.
- Besides, they have the talent.
Talent in the Navy? Nonsense!
If you can find talent in the Navy, you can find it anywhere.
Right here in this camp.
All right. Go ahead.
Thank you, sir.
(# ''I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the YMCA'')
- Everybody on stage.
- Everybody on stage.
On stage, you fellas.
- Come on, you!
- On stage, everybody!
If the Navy show can run a week on Broadway, we can run a month.
And we'll do it.
Our train leaves tomorrow at 6 am, for New York.
Attention!
- Colonel Roberts.
- At ease, men. At ease.
Give me a hand.
Now remember, men, when you go on that stage in New York City on Sunday night, the honor of the Army will be at stake.
So give it to 'em, boys.
Give 'em everything you've got.
Let's go over the top and beat the pants off the Navy!
Three cheers for the Army!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Army!
Come on, fellas! You greaseballs.
- Come on, you hobnail heroes!
Come on, get out of there!
- Wake up, sleeping beauty!
- Rise and shine!
- Yeah, I'll go, I'll go.
- Hit the deck! Everybody outside!
(# ''Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning'')
- How about a cigarette?
- Righto, Colonel.
- Get Captain Davis.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, but I've got to see him.
I tell you, it's terribly important.
Well, I'll tell him you're here.
Will you wait out there?
Sergeant, there's a Miss Kirby at the stage door to see you.
- Who?
- Miss Stella Kirby.
Tell her I'm busy.
- Sergeant Alexander!
- Yes, sir?
Assemble your entire company on stage immediately.
- Yes, sir. Corporal! Everybody on stage.
- Everybody on stage!
Everybody on stage!
Everybody on stage!
- Get out of here.
- We're not in this act.
You think you ain't. You're in the Army now.
I said everybody on stage, and right now.
- Everybody on stage, tout de suite.
- Aw, get out. We got 15 minutes.
I said tout de suite.
And them's orders... sister.
I wonder what this is all about?
Men, we cut the first and second scenes out of the last act.
Go right into the finale.
Now, there's a change of business, too.
Instead of going down the side aisles and coming back to center, boarding the transport on the stage as we rehearsed it, at the beginning of the second verse, we march down the center aisle in a column of twos.
Keep right on going to the trucks outside that are waiting to transport us to the docks.
All you men will report to your respective organizations on boarding ship.
Strike this set. Get ready for the finale.
- I know it, I know it. We're going overseas.
- Overseas?
I can't go now.
I'm coming up for exemption next week.
Well, you just write a nice, long letter to Uncle Sam and tell him all about it.
Oh, shut up.
- This is certainly a long intermission.
- Yes, I wonder what's delaying the show?
Program says eight minutes.
More like half an hour.
- Attention!
- Maybe that's it now.
- So long, boys. I'll see you later.
- So long.
Forward... right!
- Goodbye! We're going to France.
- No!
Alex! Alex!
- Alex!
All right, folks. That's all until tomorrow morning at 8:00.
Clear the stage. Everybody except Miss Kirby, clear the stage.
All right, boys.
You can get your picture now.
Please give the boys a picture.
How about leaning against the piano,
Miss Kirby?
All right boys, set 'em up.
Miss Kirby.
All right, boys.
- Thank you, Miss Kirby.
- You're welcome.
- Has anyone a cigarette?
- Will you try one of mine?
- Alex!
- Hello, Stella.
- Well, where in the world...
- I saw your name out front.
Thought I'd just drop in and say hello.
When did you get back?
Oh, a couple of days ago.
- Are you all right?
- Sure, sure.
- Did you get up to the front?
- Oh, off and on.
But you... you didn't get hit?
Oh, this? No, no.
Just a fad I picked up on the other side.
Without my stick, I'd feel completely undressed. No, no. I didn't get a scratch.
Oh, it was all so horrible and useless, wasn't it?
Not altogether. It did me a lot of good.
Made me see what a stupid ass I've been.
Kicked my silly little world right out from under me.
- Will you forgive me, Stella?
- Why, of course, Alec.
- I've never stopped loving you.
- Alec.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
I can't just stand here talking to you.
I've gotta kiss you,
I've gotta put my arms around you.
Alec, please.
You don't know what it's been like, wanting you every second.
You've never been out of my mind, ever.
I don't care what's happened before, and neither do you.
We belong to each other.
- But... don't you know?
- Know what?
Well, Charlie and I have been married for more than a year.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.
No, I... I didn't know.
Stella!
Down here, Charlie.
- Mr. Dillingham...
- Here's Alec.
Alec!
Hello, Charlie.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Say, you fellas put on a great show over there.
Yeah, that's what the Kaiser thinks.
I got as far as Hoboken and they called the whole thing off.
Yeah. I see you've done the songs for Stella's new show.
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks, but... blame it on Stella.
She cracked the whip.
It's been great seeing you two again.
- Well, can't you have lunch with us?
- No, sorry. I, uh...
- I got two fellas waiting out front for me.
- Oh.
- Well, goodbye.
- So long.
Goodbye.
- Well, he hasn't changed much, has he?
- No.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
What did you say Mr. Dillingham wanted?
Boy, have I been busy.
I got ahold of Jim and Dirk and Reagan and the others. We're all set for rehearsal.
We can use the sample room in the basement, but that's not the half of it.
Wait till you see the surprise I got for you.
Uh, Jerry!
Hit it, babe.
- What a pair of pipes.
- Jerry Allen's the name.
How do you do?
- Wait till you hear her put over a song.
- It'll probably knock you out.
It did all the agents.
Out every time I called.
- Sit down, Jerry.
- Thank you.
Well, we're practically set. Alexander's
Ragtime Band back in the running.
- Bigger and better than ever.
- What's all the hurry?
What do you mean, what's the hurry?
We gotta get jobs.
- Why?
- Well, we've gotta eat.
- Why?
- Well... What?
Say, what is this?
Listen, the bankroll is getting thin.
Time enough to worry about that when it's all gone. Here.
Ice?
Here, drink this.
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.
- Do you mind?
- Certainly not. I'm a little cracked myself.
Oh, there you are.
You see, she understands.
She knows that we heroes have to have a little time to adjust ourselves.
A lot has happened while we've been making the world safe for democracy.
Oh, cut it. You know very well those guys won't sit down and wait for you to get in the mood. They'll get other jobs. Then where'll we be?
I'll bite. Where will we be?
Nope, nothing doing.
- Sorry, Jerry, no jobs today.
- Well, that's all right with me.
I'll always compromise for a good steak.
Boy, didn't I tell you that Jerry could put over a song?
That's right.
Well, anyway, it's swell music. It sure has changed, though. It's got a new rhythm.
- Nice and slow.
- Yeah, like syrup.
- And it's sweet and sticky.
- What do you do with a guy like that?
Oh, just relax and put your mind on your drinking.
Stop trying to maneuver him into talking business.
Business? What's that?
You know, the thing you do to take your mind off your drinking.
- Come on, Alex. Doesn't that adjust you?
- Sorry.
- Would a dance adjust you?
- Sorry.
Don't mention it.
Good evening, Mr. Dwyer. Mrs. Dwyer.
- Isn't that Bill?
- Looks like him.
- Bill!
- Bill!
- My goodness! And he's a father!
- What do you know about this!
Say, what are you doing in New York?
- And out with a baby this time of night.
- Oh, nothing.
Say, how are you folks getting along?
You look fine.
Well, the same to you, Bill.
Let's have a look at him.
- Might be a her.
- Oh, not Bill.
- He wouldn't have any feminine offspring.
- I don't think it's much to look at.
''It''?
Why, I bet she looks just like her...
Oh, why, Bill, it's the image of you!
- How old is it?
- Well, there ain't no way of telling that.
- Imported?
- Yeah. All the way from Hoboken.
Right off the boat. Probably scraped off.
You folks have sure been doing fine, haven't you?
I caught your show, Stella.
You've come a long way.
Right up on top.
- And your music's all right, too.
- Thanks, Bill.
Don't forget, Bill. You had a hand in all this, way back in the beginning.
Say, it's funny, ain't it.
You and Charlie over on Broadway and me and Alec down in Greenwich Village.
- Alec in the Village?
- Sure! Him and Davey.
They got a swell band down at Scarbi's.
I got 'em the job. Run across them once when they was broke.
Come on down sometime when you think about it. Ask for me. I'm there every night.
''Bill Mulligan, interior decorator.''
- My nom de plume.
Anytime you feel like you'd like to play with the baby, just give me a call.
- I can be over in about 15 minutes.
- All right, Bill.
- We certainly will. Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Been grand seeing you, Bill.
- Likewise.
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.
Imagine Bill in New York.
And bootlegging.
He's probably making plenty of money at it.
It's kinda funny at that.
Him and Alec and Davey together again, down in the Village.
I thought they were going back to San Francisco.
So did I.
What do you say we drop down and see them sometime, just for old times' sake?
Oh, I'd rather not.
Those old times are over and... there's no use trying to rake them up again.
It never works.
Would you like a highball?
No, just some milk.
All right, I'll get it.
Here you are.
Oh, this is fine.
Make me sleep like a baby.
So will this, if you drink enough of it.
Tired?
- I'm all right.
- Come on, Charlie. What is it?
Well... I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.
Making up a lot of pretty speeches about marriage, life and fate.
Very profound stuff.
But it all seems kinda silly now that
I'm sitting here talking to you like this.
Somehow doesn't go with you.
You're too honest and direct.
Come on. Out with it.
All right.
Here goes.
What do you say we call this marriage off?
- Charlie!
- Mark it up as... experience.
A grand adventure while it lasted.
But let's not spoil it by beginning to pretend a lot of things we don't feel.
You're still in love with Alec, aren't you?
Oh, I suppose so.
I thought I was over it, but...
Oh, I don't know. I guess you can't turn those things off and on.
No. Course not.
That's what I'm getting at.
- Oh, but Charlie...
- No buts about it.
I'm a lucky guy to have had you as long as I have.
I'm grateful for every minute of it.
But I want you to be happy.
Now, now, now, now.
Don't go feminine all of a sudden.
Just keep your mind clear.
Go get a nice, quick, cheap divorce.
I'll make the alimony light on you.
And if you need any witnesses,
I can arrange that, too.
And you two hotheads can pick up where you left off.
You haven't left me with a word to say.
That's good.
People talk too much anyhow.
Now will you change your mind about that highball?
Yes, I will.
And a great, big one.
- Hey, Stella!
- Bill!
What do you know about this?
I've been wishing you would show up.
This makes it unanimous.
- Hey, you look positively handsome.
- I'm dressed up for the party.
- Party?
- Sure. Come on!
- Stella!
- Davey!
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Boy, are you terrific! You look like you were born on Fifth Avenue.
You look pretty swell yourself.
How've you been, anyhow?
Never better. And where's that old son of a gun Charlie?
- I ain't seen him in years and years.
- He's out of town.
Oh, that's a shame. He's the only one of the old gang that's not here.
Well, come on! This calls for a drink.
Attention, everybody!
Our own personal gift to Broadway,
Stella Kirby.
It's like old home week, isn't it, maestro?
Just in time for the celebration.
Won't you sit down?
- Uh, Miss Allen, Mrs. Dwyer.
- How do you do?
- How's Charlie, Stella?
- Oh, fine, thanks.
That's good.
- Stella Kirby!
- Hello, Stella.
- Oh, don't you look elegant!
- Oh, thanks, Ruby.
Yeah, Stell, she hooked me at last.
I like that! After the way you ran after me begging me to marry you!
- You two are married?
- Uh-huh!
Ah, that's what the celebration was for!
Oh, congratulations.
That's not the only thing we're celebrating.
We're all leaving for Europe tonight.
We're going to Paris and London and everywhere.
Yeah, we're just getting ready to get poured on the boat.
- You're leaving for Europe?
- Yep.
One of those horseshoes finally hit us and we landed a contract.
Oh, that's wonderful.
But it's rather sudden, isn't it?
Well, they needed an American jazz band in a hurry, and we were just lucky.
Oh, lucky nothing!
Why, he's got the hottest band in town.
And you should hear her sing.
- You're with the band?
- Yes, I am.
- She took your place. Didn't she, Alec?
- Oh, Jerry's great. One of the best.
Yeah, we wanted to make it a double wedding yesterday, but Alec was too busy seeing about passports.
Weren't you, Alec?
We almost called the trip off after we got a look at our passport pictures.
The boys look like gangsters and I look like a washed-out moll.
Say, a couple of friends of mine from the press want you to give 'em a story about Alexander's Ragtime Band.
Oh, it'll only take you a minute.
They're just sitting right over there and it'll be good publicity for the speak.
Sure. All right.
Will you excuse me?
You better hurry and get your drinking done. We got less than an hour.
Yeah, hurry up, everybody.
- Sorry I missed hearing you sing.
- Thank you.
I enjoyed your show very much.
- How long have you been with the band?
- Ever since they started.
In fact, I was one of the charter members.
Then you must have met Alex soon after he came back from the war.
Yes. He was still in somewhat of a daze from it.
I stepped in and sort of helped him snap out of it.
- That was very fortunate for him.
- Yeah, and for me too.
Let me tell you something, Stella.
There's one swell girl.
Why, everything Alec is now, he owes to her.
You know how Alec is. Moody and funny.
And when he found out that you and Charlie were married, well, after all, that was kind of a sock on the nose.
Why, if it hadn't been for Jerry, he might have turned into a no-good tramp.
But she caught him just in time.
And now look at him!
On his way to Paris!
Compliments of the party over in the corner.
They wanna know if you'll sing a little song for them.
- You know that one you did Sunday night?
- I'm on a vacation.
They're big spenders.
They're sure gonna be disappointed.
- Sorry. Not tonight.
- Oh, please do. I'd love to hear you.
- All right, Bill.
- Thanks.
All right, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Get ''Blue Skies'' ready.
Ladies and gentlemen!
This little lady, before leaving for Paris, France and abroad tonight, is going to favor us with a beautiful ballad one that I know that you'll all enjoy as much as I have.
And that's saying a lot
'cause I've heard 'em all.
So here goes, folks! The one and only, the tops, Miss Jerry Allen!
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a great celebrity with us here tonight.
I want you all to meet her.
Miss Stella Kirby!
Sing!
Come on, Stella, sing!
- Come on, Stella.
Come on, come on!
Come on, everybody sing!
(# ''Pack Up Your Sins
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stella.
Mac, I'm leaving the show.
- You're what?
- I can't continue on.
You're tired.
You've been on the road for ten weeks.
But you're in Chicago now.
We should have a long run.
In another week, you'll feel like a new person.
Oh, no. It's more than that.
I'm only messing things up and ruining the show.
I just can't stay on, I tell you.
But Mr. Dillingham has great plans for you, Stella.
You can't throw opportunities away like this.
I'm an old hand at throwing things away.
Stella, this is something that I can't decide.
Mr. Dillingham will have to do that.
You wait here.
I'm going to get him.
Gesundheit. I'm gonna take you home, put your feet in mustard water and give you a good dose of castor oil.
Over my dead body.
I knew you were crazy wanting to walk in this rain.
Come on, get out of the wet.
There'll be a taxi along in a minute.
Someday I'm gonna take a good sock at you.
Go ahead. Right on the button.
Jerry.
Let's get married.
Have you got a fever?
You sound delirious.
No, I mean it. Now, tonight.
Oh, no, thanks.
You really don't wanna marry me.
You're just trying to avoid the bachelor tax.
- Don't you think we'd hit it off together?
- Course. We always have.
- Then why not?
- Because you're not in love with me, Alex.
I used to think you might be, someday.
But I was wrong.
- You mean an awful lot to me, Jerry.
- I know I do.
But that's not enough to marry on.
Oh, I'm not complaining and I'm not asking for a thing.
When this is over, it'll be over.
There'll be no weeping at the bar, as far as I'm concerned.
Just remember that.
You think much too straight for me, Jerry.
Like the rest of you modern, clever women.
Come on, here comes a cab. You can't talk yourself out of taking that castor oil.
Oh, Mr. Alexander!
May I have your autograph?
Certainly.
It's a shame to bother you like this.
It'd bother me a lot more if you didn't.
- Mine too, please.
- Thank you.
Pardon me, Mr. Alexander, but we're ready when you are for the audition in room B.
Thank you. I'll be right along.
- Whose is this?
- Mine.
That's swell. Good comedy, boys.
- But I want a ballad for Miss Allen.
- We've got a million of them.
We'll be back tomorrow with a ballad that'll tear your heart out.
- Thanks very much, boys. So long.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Will you come in, please?
Well, Charlie. You old son of a gun.
- Hello, Alec.
- Say, this is great. How are you, anyhow?
- Fine. Fine. And you?
- Swell.
Come on. Sit down.
Gosh, I've been reading plenty about you.
You must have had all Europe for a press agent.
Oh, they just happen to like
American music over there.
Don't try to kid me.
I've heard you on the radio.
Good old Charlie.
How are they going, anyway?
Oh, fine. Still pounding them out.
As long as ''moon'' rhymes with ''June,''
I'm OK.
- I guess we're both pretty lucky.
- Yeah.
At least we didn't have to go back to Dirty Eddie's.
Say, remember the night you played the concert on Nob Hill and I lost the music?
That was a great night.
Will you wait a few minutes?
I wanna talk to you but I got some people waitin' outside for audition.
- You're auditioning?
- Yeah.
Then I guess you're the fella I'm supposed to see. I'm one of that few that's waiting.
- Next on the list, too.
- You?
Sure. I got a couple of ballads.
One of 'em's pretty good.
- Oh, great. Let's hear 'em.
- OK.
Ah, gee, I'm glad to see you, Charlie.
Don't think I'm not glad to see you.
- How's Stella?
- I don't know.
- What?
- I haven't heard from her in a long time.
She left town right after our divorce.
Divorce? You and Stella divorced?
Well, sure.
It just didn't... didn't pan out.
I... I knew she wasn't in show business anymore, but...
I thought maybe you and she were leading a quiet life somewhere and raising a family.
No. Not Stella.
You know how selfish she is.
How unreasonable. What a double-crossing two-timer she can be.
Now, wait a minute!
Stella's the swellest girl I ever knew.
She never two-timed anybody.
- So you're still in love with her, huh?
- Well, what of it?
That's all I wanted to know.
Because she's still in love with you.
Same old Charlie.
And you're the same old hothead.
You were gonna sock me, weren't you?
You don't know how close you came to having your ears slapped down.
Seems to me I've heard those words before somewhere.
Well, what are we standing here waiting for? Let's go find her.
I'm sorry I can't help you.
Miss Kirby left the show in Chicago and I haven't heard anything of her since.
- Thanks. Thanks very much.
- Why don't you try Equity?
- They'll know where she is.
- Thanks very much.
Mr. Alexander,
Mr. Dillingham would like to talk to you.
He has a place for you in his new show.
I'm sorry. I haven't any open time right now. Perhaps later. Goodbye.
Tickets, please.
Have your tickets ready, please.
- Yes, Miss?
- Does Bill work here anymore?
- Bill? Bill who?
- Bill. Used to be sort of a manager.
- Oh, you mean Bill Mulligan?
- Yes.
- Why, he owns the place.
- He does?
- Could I see him, please?
- Just wait over there. I'll call him.
Stella Kirby.
Bill.
Oh, you look positively handsome.
- Where have you been?
- Oh. Around.
I've been seeing the country.
And a very big country it is, too.
- What have you been doing?
- Singing.
Cabarets and cafés. Anyplace.
You, Stella Kirby, singing in cabarets?
No. Lilly Lamont.
I changed my name to fit the personality.
When I see some of these phonies making good today and think of you...
Joe, bring us a bottle of champagne.
- No, thanks. I feel more at home with beer.
- Just for old times' sake.
- Seen Alec?
- No, I haven't.
- But you're going to his concert?
- I don't think so.
He'd be the happiest man in the world if he thought you was out in that audience.
He's looked everywhere for you.
- Just let him think of me as I was.
- Oh, that's silly.
You're going to that concert with me.
I got a box.
No, I'm just killing time until my train leaves tonight.
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Sure.
Good. I got something to do, it'll take me about 20 minutes.
I'll come back, and you and I will listen to the concert here, on the radio.
- All right, Bill.
- Save mine.
- Wish me luck, Aunt Sophie.
- Roger, there's nothing to be afraid of.
This is something you've been doing all your life.
Something you believe in.
Just think how proud Professor Heinrich and I are of you, darling.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Where's Alec?
- He'll be here in a minute.
- Here he is.
- Well, here we are.
- It's just like Dirty Eddie's.
- Except the customers have clean collars.
- Well, maestro. It's your night.
- Our night.
The Three Musketeers.
We fellas better get out there.
And don't forget to be good.
Ruby! Ruby!
- Ruby! Stella's back!
- Stella? Where?
- She's over at my place.
- Well, why didn't you bring her?
Don't argue! Now, listen.
When this concert's over, get ahold of Alec and tell him to beat it down to my place.
- I'll hold her there.
- All right.
When Bill... I mean Mr. Mulligan comes back, would you tell him I couldn't wait?
Why, uh... Yes, I'll tell him.
Thank you.
Taxi, ma'am?
Taxi?
I guess so.
- Where to?
- Anyplace.
- Just wanna go riding, eh?
- That's right.
- How about the park?
- Doesn't matter.
Would you like some music?
- Where's that coming from?
- Carnegie Hall.
Alexander's Ragtime Band.
Sure can swing it, can't he?
You want me to turn it off?
Oh, no!
- You may leave it on.
Park's kinda pretty tonight, ain't it?
Sort of springlike.
- Are we still in the park?
- We're just turning into 59th Street.
Nice just cruising around.
You take most fares, always in a hurry, always wanna get someplace.
- Sure you ain't tired of this music?
- No.
Swell music.
That's where it comes from.
That's Carnegie Hall right there.
But I didn't ask to go to Carnegie Hall!
I know, but we gotta get out of the park some way and this is where we landed.
Driver, stop here.
I think I'll get out and walk.
You bet. Nice night for walking.
How much?
- One dollar.
- Is that all? Haven't we...
One dollar even. No more, no less.
- Thank you.
- Night.
- One, please. In the balcony.
- Sorry, miss. The house is sold out.
- Then I'll stand.
- No standing room left either.
Thanks.
- Ruby, she's gone!
- Who's gone?
Stella. When I got back to the place, she'd beat it.
- Well, didn't you leave anyone with her?
- Yeah, the taxi driver and he's gone, too.
Well, of all the stupid, clumsy things to do...
Grand Central Station.
That's our only hope.
You couldn't find her if you stumbled over her. I'll attend to this myself.
Come on. Hop in.
- No, thanks. I think I'll walk.
- Come on! Come on. Get in.
You might as well hear the rest of the concert.
Taxi!
- Grand Central.
- Sorry, lady, this cab's taken.
Oh, for goodness' sake. Taxi!
You shouldn't have done that.
I could have gotten out.
I don't feel like driving anyway.
I wanna listen to the music.
Well, looks like that's the end.
Yes.
That's the end.
You can turn the radio off now... and drive on.
I've heard all that I wanna hear.
You gotta listen to ''Alexander's Ragtime
Band.'' You can't go without hearing that.
But I don't wanna hear it!
Turn it off, I tell you.
- Why don't you wanna hear it?
- Because I can't! That's why.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play ''Alexander's
Ragtime Band'' for two reasons.
One, because I consider it the first, and best, of all swing songs.
And second, because it means more to me than any other piece of music.
Hearing it may take you back.
Playing it takes me back, too.
And so, if you'll forgive me,
I'd like to play this song not only for you and for the people with whom you may associate it, but also for the people, and especially the one person, with whom I associate it.
Did you hear that, Miss Kirby?
- How did you know?
- Oh, I heard you sing many a time.
- And you remembered me?
- Sure! You was great. Listen.
Sing.
Sing.
In Vienna in 1844 nice people neither danced the waltz nor kissed their wives in public nor listened to new ideas
In 1845 came Johann Strauss II and his immortal melodies
We've dramatized his spirit rather than facts of his life because it's his spirit that has lived in his music
VIENNA KK COMMERCIAL BANK
Just a minute, my dear Mr. Strauss... and what's this?
A waltz
Another waltz, I see
Mr. Strauss, your father persuaded me to take you in against my judgment
And what's my reward?
Every time I turn around, there's another waltz printed on this paper
This is all... 
Don't... you don't
You know, those are mine
You've got me a 60,000 golden
And you've got my waltz
And now, get over then... you're fired
Join those revolutionaries... they won't go to work either
No fuss, no frank than serve in the street to start another revolution
Now, Mr. Wertheimer... 
Get out
Thanks for firing me, Mr. Wertheimer
Goodbye, you worms
KK COMMERCIAL BANK
Bless you, son... 
Mr. Wertheimer closed today?
Well, perhaps they run out of money
One half of the bank is still open
The bank is still open... but we're not in it
A nice happy holiday, Johann?
Yes
Yes
Is... is Poldi around?
Ah, he wants to see Poldi... 
Mama, you hear?
Sure... I thought he maybe came to see you
If you please, Mr. Finance Minister
Look what the mailman brought you?
Johann... hello, Johann
Hello, Poldi, what... what are you doing?
What am I doing?
What are you doing here?
This is wonderful in the middle of the day
How did you get away from the bank?
Well, l... I just walk out
Johann, something is the matter?
Is something happening?
Oh, nothing... nothing that
I don't want to happen
What's happening, Johann?
What's happening... ?
I've... I've been fired
That's what's happening
Oh, I'm sorry, Poldi
I didn't mean to yell at you
That's alright
Man has right to yell when he has been fired
You always seem to know when
I'm in trouble, don't you?
Johann, shall I guess what are you doing at the bank?
Alright, you guess I'm writing waltz again
Oh, Johann, don't be rude... there're other banks in the world
Maybe Mr. Wertheimer is going to give you another chance
But I don't want another chance
I'm glad he has fired me
Now I'm free
Who's free?
I am... free to do I've always wanted to... free to write music
I quit the bank
You quit the bank?
Hm
But your Papa wanted you to become a banker... to have a career
You call banking a career?
Do you know what career is?
Have you heard of Mozart, Schubert and
Beethoven?
They had what I call a career
Did they make money?
They made glorious music
Yes, Papa, that's right... they made glorious music
Yeah... I heard their music
Johann, if you want to write waltz... you write waltzes
And I play them... 
I play them the way
I always felt they should be played
I'll organize my own orchestra
But how?
You don't have a penny in your pocket
Oh... musicians don't play for nothing
Oh, they don't, do they?
Poldi darling, you don't know musicians
Well, I know 50 men who are willing to... now you just wait
Kienzl
Yes?
Kienzl, what do you love the most in the world?
Huh?
Well, sometimes a girl... most times a goulash
No... you play violin... don't you love your violin?
Yes, but a good beef goulash with... 
Alright... would you like to play in my orchestra?
When you have an orchestra?
If I have an orchestra, would you like to play in it?
Well, if you had, you mean for nothing?
But of course for nothing
Is it permanent?
Sure
That's a nice one when you're taking... you should take it to the park
Yes, that's a good idea
Look, Kienzl... do you know Dudelman who plays violin?
Hm
And Albert and Duffman?
Where we could get them?
We could get them easily... they jump at a chance like this
Is this the nice way to entertain your sweetheart?
Sweetheart?
He doesn't know if I'm standing on my head or feet
He's so mixed up with his troubles
And I don't blame him
Is this the way to look when a young man comes to see you?
You know, Poldi
Sometimes it's good for a woman to make a man think about something else beside the troubles
How do you think I finally got your Papa?
Keeping his mind on apple strudel
Now remember... be in my house at 2 o'clock on Sunday
See, listen... 
I got a cousin who works at the tea shop
What does he play?
A piccolo for nothing... 
I'd recommend him too
Bring him along
There you're, Poldi... there's true musician for you
Money doesn't mean a thing to him... he never even thought of it
Johann, whatever career you choose... profit will be the very highest
Poldi, you do believe in me, don't you?
You know I do
I could kiss you for that
Yes, Johann
Poldi, you know what?
What?
Popofinger... Hans Popofinger
He's out of the job and he's the best double bassoon player in old Vienna
Oh, Poldi... what'll I do without you?
I don't know what you're doing with me
Hey, Mr. Strauss... 
I have an aunt who plays harp
Bring her too
But she's 72 years old
Just put her on the wheelchair and bring her along
CASINO DOMMAYER:
DEBUT OF JOHANN STRAUSS
AND HIS ORCHESTRA
Excellent
I hope that dropout bank's job is still there
Shh... 
You have a wonderful son, Mrs. Strauss
I warned him
I'm sorry
So am I
But don't take it much too hard... young Strauss
You know Beethoven was not a success either the first time he waved his baritone
But gentlemen, I thank you very much
There's some goulash in the kitchen on your way out
Boys, open the windows and start your cleaning
Ladies and gentlemen... the performance is over
I'm very sorry, but the Dommayer is to close early tonight
But I just paid for ticket and call for a concert
Let's have it
We'll be glad to refund the money... but you see the performance is over
But we don't want the money
We want the music and the performance is not over
Just a minute, please... 
I'm Aucust Dommayer, owner of
Dommayer's Casino and the performance is over
And I'm Fritz Cellist, the first tenor of the Imperial Opera and the performance is not over
I don't care who you're... the performance is over
The performance is not over
The performance is not over
Hey, what are you doing there?
Leave the windows open
The whole neighborhood might as well hear it for nothing
Do you have any special wish, Madam?
Anything
Now let's play... let's play <Artist's Life>
Now the goulash will be burnt
But it's Carla Donner
Who's she?
Carla Donner
Carla Donner... the famous opera singer
The coach is ready, Madam
Yes, thank you... what time is it?
About 9 o'clock
We must go
Bring him along to the Hall of the
Palace tonight
He might amuse us
Us?
What a stink she is
Guess most people will see us
No extra charge
For nothing they'll listen
Now the <Polka>, you worms
And play as you never play before in your life
For Vienna
Each man must have a hobby... his own kind of hobby
I want beer and girls
I'm fond of girls and beer
But me, I like to stay up and keep my spirit way up
In a girl I found... 
And songs that sound... 
Sound like anyone you hear
Every night in the beat... every beat and every hymn... 
What has happened?
Look, Strauss... 
I'm afraid I'm not very elegant in these clothes
Don't worry
Thanks to Carla Donner... others are welcome to town for dinner in any clothes
Look at our friend Hofbauer... why do you think he's here?
Hofbauer?
Do you think he's born in that dressed shirt?
But he's the greatest music publisher in Vienna
He's still Hofbauer
Where's Miss Donner?
I don't see her
She'll see you when she wants to
Fritz, I'm so glad you're here... take me to supper at once
May I present the young composer of great talent... my friend Johann Strauss... 
Mr. And Mrs. Hofbauer
Oh, how do you do... ?
What nice eyes
Come along, Fritz... we'll know each other better
Young man, come along
Patrician, baritone and now male's contralto
I'm honored, Mr. Hofbauer
Oh, Hofbauer... you know me?
I'm Hofbauer and you... your name?
Strauss
Struass... 
My wife is a lovely woman... a lovely woman
Are you a guest here... yes?
Madam Carla Donner was good enough to invite me here tonight
Carla Donner?
Oh, you watch your step, young man
As far as Carla Donner is concerned... 
Yes?
Come home with the... well, you know aware to the wife's suspicion... Who are you... ?
I'm a composer
Composer?
Who published you... Shayahara?
Oh, mark my word, young man
If it's not in the print by Hofbauer... it's not even music
Mister... 
Strauss
Strauss... I never heard of your music... never heard of it
You'll hear it perhaps tonight... from Madam Donner herself if you have no objection
Oh, I have no objection at all, Mister... 
I don't care what your name is... 
I don't care
Smith... Rudolf Smith
Rudolf, goodnight... 
My dear young man, if you... well, it's the young man from the casino, Mister... 
Strauss... Johann Strauss
Madam, I can't tell how... how grateful I'm
You're so kind to invite me tonight
Mr. Strauss... Prince Butarka
How do you do?
Mr. Strauss is the most exciting player in Vienna
After I finish my little wine... will you please?
I'm sorry, Madam... 
I didn't mean to interrupt
You did me a favor
Now you can do me another favor
Anything, Madam
Will you please get out of my dress?
Get out?
Oh, I'm so sorry
I have no idea... I seem to be caught
So soon?
What... Madam?
I can simplify everything
But Madam, your gown, l... 
Now tell me... did he ask you to bring along some of your music?
Yes, Madam, I have a piece here... pardon me
Oh, how nice
'Knowing you that you want me'
Did you write the lyrics yourself... 
Mr. Strauss?
Yes, Madam
A lovely idea... you know we're going to explode a little bomb on ice
I'll sing it
But Madam that... this is a waltz
I know it
You think it's wise?
All these people, I mean your friends... maybe they won't think it proper
It's time to change their minds
Oh, I see you've already met
Yes, Mr. Strauss, will you give this to the leader of the band there?
Yes, Madam
Are you going to sing a waltz here?
I'm going to sing it, but first you've to announce
Now... Carla?
Now, Fritz
A waltz... 
Ho... 
Where's Madam Donner?
Oh, she's down there with the musicians
What's the idea coming to us... even invited musicians?
Huh, they even invited music publishers
Ladies and gentlemen... I've been asked to direct your attention here
Madam Carla Donner has graciously consented to sing for us
We won't let them know it's waltz
When we go on to a quarter time, we let some stalemate and lift some eye brows
If they lift too far... you've to protect me
I can protect you from everything, but... 
But what... Madam?
Tonight I bring you a new song from a new composer, Mr. Johann Strauss and I hope his music will attract you as it does me
He's impostor... an impostor
He tells me his name is Rudolf
Bravo... 
Bravo, Madam
Madam, I can't hardly speak
I don't think the song will be sung again
It'll never be done so beautifully
Well, the piano alright?
I'm afraid it's tone a little bit hash
I've never heard of it, Madam... believe me
Then there's a new one here from Munich
Would you like to try it for me?
Of course, Madam
What a relief... 
I like quiet room, don't you?
Yes, Madam
Now let me see where's the... 
There's no piano... quiet rooms don't have pianos
But they have wine
Someone who was very thoughtful... wine makes up music
Thank you, Madam
Are you disappointed there's no piano?
No, Madam
Are you unappy... to be alone with me?
Oh, no, Madam... it's only that... that I can't hardly believe all the other times aren't real
Other times?
I mean... at the opera when you're always way down below on the stage
But when your voice came after me... you were wonderfully close... 
I mean... 
And we're alone together?
Last time you sang <Norma>... you're the only one there... you and l... and the greatest voice in the world
The only composer I ever knew was fat little man with bald head
Well, I never know further I'll be any kind of composer or not
All I know is when you first walked to the Dommayer's at the night and
I played to you
You should know I played to you
And just now when... you sang my waltz before everybody
I'm more alone with you than ever
More alone than now?
Sorry for being late, Carla... 
I've an order from His Majesty... he's troubled sometimes
Darling, you must be worn out
Tony, this is the lovely young man... he's a composer
He and I have been along together for years, haven't we?
This is our host, Count Hohenfried... 
Mr. Strauss
He was up in the balcony and
I was on the stage
As a matter of fact, we're practically sweet-hearted
Perfect, really?
I heard you sang a waltz too... another one of your Bohemian evening
... - my darling?
Tony... why?
I defense... I imagine
Thank you
The usual fee for musician I believe is 10 golden
You can't insult my composer... his performance is brilliant
Very well, 50 golden
Oh, I'm ashamed of you... nothing less than 100 golden
Alright, my dear... 100 golden
That's more like it, honey
Thank you, Sir
But might need it for another necklace
As a matter of fact, I owe you 10 times as much what I've learned here tonight
The performance is great, Madam... 
I hope you were amused
Poldi, what are you doing here?
Yes, well... I don't know
What do you mean 'you don't know'?
I'm so foolish
I'm so sorry... it's just silly
I got just a funny feeling when you went away with the gentleman in Dommayer's
And then suddenly I know, l... 
I thought you were in danger
I'm so silly
Of course, here you're perfectly a grown up man... perfectly alright
I could drop some puddles on the sidewalk
Poldi, don't you dare drop puddles on the sidewalk?
Johann
I'm a lucky fool, Poldi
I never knew I've had this much in your heart
You always are
Don't forget to turn off the light
Oh, I was just about to arrest her, officer
Don't you see how guilty she looks?
I wish my wife looks guilty as that
Oh, Johann, now I really could drop on the sidewalk
POLDI AND JOHANN
Now... sit down
Sit down, everybody
Now comes the speech
Fine, yeah... who can talk without wine?
Well, who can talk without cake?
Thank you, Madam... 
I just take a little piece
Oh
My friends, I should like to propose a toss
I'll make it short, my friend
Kienzl is about to eat the cake
As for Johanrs happiness, that now has beautifully and for all times in Poldi's care
I had met 100 of young men, but never had I met finnier young man and finnier musician than Johann Strauss
Oh, that's lovely... so sweet
Johann... speech
Yes... come on
Go on... say something
That's there... say just a few words
My darling wife... 
My dear mother... 
My new Mama and Papa... 
My dear colleagues... 
Yesterday Kienzl was a baker and the baker is a colleague today
Yes, and tomorrow who knows... maybe a baron or a king?
Don't laugh... 
Revolution is not so far away... my friends
All he thinks is about being a baron
He forgets what we're fighting for is constitution... representation... free press and free speech... 
Sit down... go on, Johann
Tonight I find even more than happiness and more than our success together
And believe me, you can't find it in the rich palaces
You can't find it in hard cover the gold bracelets or... behind the falls of painted laughter
You can't find peace in the deep quiet breath of living there because that I know... 
I know because I've found it here tonight in my wife... in my music and in my friends... 
Bravo... wonderful
Excellent... 
I mean perfect... I mean bravo... 
Bravo
Yes, thank you
Mr. Hofbauer... the music publisher
Mr. Hofbauer?
Yeah
Good evening, Sir
They told me I could find you here
They told me you just got married
Yes, Sir
Well, don't worry
We're once in a while... we're both in the same goal together
I mean we're in the same boat together... same boat together
This is my wife
Oh, how do you do... ?
You know your waltz has created quite a big splash
Well, it's not so big splash... it's just a mild splash
I had a few offers
By the way, I have a contract here for you to sign... sort of a wedding present
Johann... a contract?
Do you have quill pen?
Yeah, I'll get it
That's 1,000 golden for a year for your waltz
1,000 golden a year?
Oh, Johann... who said you can't earn money writing a waltz?
I always believe in being generous to young composers
Here, just sign here... sign here
I'm sorry, Mr. Hofbauer... but this is not enough
Not enough?
Are you joking?
Here go on... sign
No... 
I mean it... the golden is down
We're headed for an inflation... the discount rate might go to 20%
Oh, no, not 1,000 golden a year... but 1,000 golden for each waltz
I write in a year
What?
You must be mad... you must be crazy
Call me somebody... he has a fever
You know I must spend money for exploitation... exploitation
It's 1,000 golden for each waltz or nothing
Oh... 1,000 golden
Well, say we're... compromise
I'll give you 500 golden... 500
1,000 golden
Well, 750 golden
1,000 golden
1,000 golden?
Alright... 
Here... 
I don't expect you to write a waltz or 2 in a year, don't we?
Here are 6 to start with
Oh... 6,000 golden
He's a music rapid for you were no Mr. Hofbauer
Fine piece of appreciation... 
Everybody should be proud love to sing
Hofbauer publication, even Carla Donner Carla Donner?
I don't care who sings them... 
Vienna will sing them

A Waltz by Johann Strauss
Vienna loved Strauss waltzes and listened to new ideas
It clamored for the right of man to govern himself and so one day Strauss wrote a march
DOWN WITH TYRANNY
GIVE ARMS TO THE STUDENTS
Hey... it's Johann
It's the Palace of Hobenfried
Whose palace?
Hobenfried
I know that place... let's charge
Wait
Well, it's my fiddle player
Are you going to walk out during the game again, Mr. Strauss?
Take her away
Now, wait a minute... she's not an enemy
She's a singer... she's an artist... just like ourselves
She's one of us... that's why she's here
She's our Goddess of Liberty
Just a minute, gentlemen... 
I'm a singer, yes
But a goddess... damn that
You should stick to your music... 
Mr. Strauss
Carla... 
I'll take care of her
Carla
Now stop shouting, you fool... it's trouble enough there
I'm not afraid of the rebels... 
I'm not one of them
If they find out she's your friend... they'll tear her to pieces
I suppose she's sick of with the common fiddlers
Yes, you're kind of responsible for all this
You mean you aren't?
If I have my saber... 
Well, you haven't got any
Now you listen to me
She was about to be mobbed in the carriage when I came in a nick of time
Open the door, Hobenfried
Oh, no... you don't
Just a moment... release him, who are you?
My name is Strauss, Johan Strauss... not your humble servant either
Now if you want some good advice... don't poke your nose out that way
The mad musician, Sir
Oh, I see... an artist, a musician
And just what's your part in the revolution, Mr. Strauss?
I wrote the song <We March To>
See, and just why are you rebelling... 
Mr. Strauss?
Why... ?
Because... 'tyranny oppressior has been written in the banners there... can't you read?
And how are you oppressed, Mr. Strauss?
Oh, never mind that
Now if you know what's good for you... you'll sneak out the back way
You're impertinent, Sir
And you're a stuffed shirt and your face annoys me
Yes, Captain?
The situation is under control now... all the rioters have been arrested
And arrest this man too
I'll see you again some time
I ask profound apology in my house... 
Your Highness... 
The incident doesn't occur, Hobenfried
Thank you, Sir
And now, we must go immediately
With your permission, Your Highness... I must... there's someone in distress
I'm sorry, Hobenfried, there's empire in distress
I'm just trying to tell you that she has nothing to do with this
Shut up... come on here
You idiot... 
I happen to be Madam Carla Donner of the Opera
Yes... I know
Goldilocks... you're Goddess of Liberty
Go ahead
The farmers must be very happy
Halt... remove the barricade... 
Dudelman... Kienzl, Dudelman
Johann
Kienzl, what's on your mind?
Kienzl, for the last time... what's on your mind?
For you, Kienzl
Hurry up... come with me
Which way did they go?
Down the street, get them back... come on
After them
I can't go like this... where can we go?
Come with me
My shoe
Your what?
You, oh... I'm afraid it's not safe here
No place is safe with you... 
I want to go home
Where do you live?
I won't tell you
I'm not taking any more chances
Alright... you stay here
I won't stay here... give me my shoe
Your what?
Yes
Madam, if ever there's a man regretted his kindness,
I'm that man
You... kind... ?
Coachman
Have you 2 heard there'll be a revolution?
Maybe... Harrison Street, No.8
I bet you haven't heard... it had been barricaded
Well, l... can you reach Yusa Estate Casa?
How long have you 2 been here?
It's barricaded too
Is there any place in Vienna you can go except around this block?
Well, yes... 
There're always the Vienna Woods... a lovely ride
Now, will you decide, Madam?
Frankly, I don't care
I don't care where I'm and where I go or whether the sun will rise again or whether I'll live or die... 
I just don't care
The Vienna Woods
The Vienna Woods... get up, Rosy
What time is it?
Where am I?
Good morning
If you knew how pretty picture you've made... 
2 little babes in the woods sleeping in each other's arms
Where are we?
Where you want to be... in Vienna Woods
And it's only 6 o'clock in the morning and you still have a long and beautiful day ahead of you
You haven't helped me
Amen
Come on... my Rosy
GRINZING GARTEN RESTAURANT
You won't believe it, but we composed the whole thing in one day with only 20 minutes over lunch
What do you mean 'we'?
I mean 'we'... 
Mr. And Mrs. Strauss, me and Rosy
Alright... I'll keep an ear open for sour notes
If there's any sour note and it's the flaw,
I beg you to leave it out
Such a time for revolution... just when
Johann Strauss himself drops out of a clear sky and leave my own restaurant on Sunday for nothing
Yes, right... these Viennese are coming to a revolution on Sunday
Such a thing won't happen in my time
Quick, Cafniya... go see the lady left her hat on the carriage
Maybe this is it?
Come to see it's... here it's
Thank you
What a beautiful hat, Mrs. Strauss
What did you say?
I said it's a beautiful hat
Oh, yes
Oh, please... let me do that
Excuse me, Mrs. Strauss... but I know these artists
I've been there to one for 30 years
Cafniya used to play the accordion till the children broke it
Does your husband have a temper too?
Terrible
But I guess it's won'th it
It must be wonderful to be the wife of a man like Johann Strauss
Yes, it must be wonderful
Oh, it's so beautiful, Mrs. Strauss... what's the name of it?
What?
Oh, it's called... it's called
<The Tale Of The Vienna Woods>
Oh... 
I thought of you ever since that night
And you walked away, proud and angry
Carla... I'm married
Oh... but you're here now with your arms around me
Carla, we must face this
No... don't you see?
It was meant to be like this
Everything had brought us together... the night... the woods and the music... 
It had been so sweet and so dangerous
The revolution... the revolution is over
We've got a new Emperor... 
Duke Franz Joseph a young wonderful Emperor and a new Constitution
Look at them
Kienzl, Dudelman... how did you get here?
We've been released... everybody is released
Did you have... a pleasant escape?
We have a charming escape... thank both of you gentlemen
You're welcome, Madam
Now that you're free
You can play for us, Johann, can't you?
Oh, no... Kienzl
Yes... hey... listen everybody
This is our Strauss... our leader
He's going to lead our march
Will you forgive me, Carla?
Sure
Madam Donner?
Yes, what's it?
Count Hobenfried is outside, Madam
He has been searching everywhere for you
I'll tell him you're here
Wait... take me to him
Carla, I've been so anxious
Tony... you're always so kind to me
I'm sorry... I'm not going back to Vienna with you
Why not?
I can't leave here now
Strauss is there?
Yes... 
This is not like you, Tony
I'll run back with you... shall we go?
The palace
To my house
Long live the Emperor
Kienzl... will that be the new Emperor?
Yes... have a new wonderful face
Well, I didn't think so yesterday and
I told him so
You do what?
Ah, Mrs. Strauss... is Johann here?
Did he get my message?
Oh, he must be full of marches after the revolution like this
I'll tell him you're here
Oh, I thank you
Alright... boy, let's go
Good morning, Mrs. Strauss... good morning
Come on, Kienzl
Mr. Kienzl, please... I've been promoted
'You told me you loved me when we were young one day'
Remember when you told me, Johann?
That's the most beautiful day of my life
Please, Poldi... I'm very busy now
Johann, you must take time for your coffee
Alright
'You told me you loved me'
What makes you think of it now, Johann?
Poldi, can't you see I'm working?
Why ask a silly question like that?
I write a song as it comes to me... out of... out of my inspiration... out of everything... out of heaven knows what
I guess so, Johann... drink your coffee before it's cold
Cold?
It's scolding
I'll cool it for you
Johann, don't you think you should lie down a while?
You must be tired after being out of night
What are you driving at?
Can't you see I'm working?
Why should I be tired?
I worked before, didn't I?
Oh, Johann... I won't disturb you anymore
Now you're hurt
No, I'm not hurt
You are
No, it's only... Johann, you're so crossed since you come home
You didn't... 
I don't expect you to kiss me if you don't feel like it
But you didn't talk to me
Johann, what's the matter with you?
You're imagining things, that's all
I think it's you ought to lie down... you're pale and tired
You know I can't sleep when you're not at home
Now, that has got to stop
Why can't you sleep when I'm not home?
It's only natural for a wife who can't sleep when her husband is out... in danger maybe
Why do I talk about things like that?
You're not going to stay out anymore
We don't have revolution everyday... thanks heaven
What does revolution have to do with it?
The revolution is the only thing that can keep a man out once in a while?
Things happen to a man
Things... you can't foresee anything
Besides, I'm not your slave... not your prisoner... and we're not chained to each other
Don't shout at me, please
If you've something on your mind... if you've something want to tell me... tell me
But don't shout at me
If you don't want to tell me, you don't need to make excuses for yourself
You don't need to act like this
If you want to stay out at night... you're free to do so
But you must leave me free to worry about you if I like
You must respect my feelings
To be the wife of Johann Strauss is not a little thing
I've tried to be won'thy of it
I'm very proud of it
I won't let anyone shout at me for your sake as well as mine
Forgiver me, Poldi
I always seem to be shouting at you
I don't know what's the matter with me
I wouldn't change you... nothing on you... not even your moods... your temper because I know you must be like this to be you
Alright then, let's go away
It'll be better... better for both of us
Let's forget we ever saw Vienna
Forget Vienna?
L... I mean... there're too many distractions here
But we live here, Johann
We live in a lovely new home and all our friends
Don't you want to travel?
Don't you want to see the world?
Of course, I do
If you... so... 
Alright then, darling... that's settled
Now you start packing your things and
I'll make the arrangements
We can't just pack up and go
We have a lot of things to attend to
No, nonsense
Then we go without attending to them
Poldi, when you think of going... that's the time to go
But Mr. Hofbauer downstairs and boys... 
Oh, they are... fine
Come on... let's go
I'll tell them we're going right away
Ah... Strauss
Kienzl, will you stop that for a minute?
You wrote it
Alright... I'm sorry
Well, Poldi has something say to you
Huh?
Go on, Poldi... tell them the good news
Good news?
Right
We're going to leave Vienna
What?
Immediately
What for?
What's happening?
Why are you leaving?
Why he can't leave Vienna if he wants to?
Vienna is not the world and he doesn't owe Vienna anything
Vienna owes him more than it can ever pay
What becomes of me... ?
Why the fuss?
Why are you all upset about?
The musician ought to travel
Poldi and I have made up our minds
It's all as well... we'll be back someday
Yes, we've planned it, that's all
After all, we never had our real honeymoon
By the way, did you get my march?
No
What do you mean?
Didrt you get my message?
I haven't got a march
What have you got?
Nothing
Nothing?
Yes... there's a new piece you've composed
Yes, Poldi, it... but it's not ready yet
Look here, Strauss
Has Shanon made you some offer?
Remember you have a contract with me for everything you write
Mr. Hofbauer, you know he won't do a thing like that
If he doesn't want to play... you mustrt urge him
I never urged him... just temperamental, that's all
He wants to be temperamental... but he took my 1,000 golden... 
For every golden... alright, I'll get it
Johann, you have it in your pocket... here
Yes... go ahead, Kienzl
Sure... let's start
Alright... let's take places
Come on... sit down, boys
Come on, don't keep waiting while you listen
He keeps waiting
You keep waiting
All I have to do is waiting
You don't have to wait, Mr. Hofbauer
Vienna is a free city, you know
Oh, I see
The whole world is waiting for this waltz
Why shouldn't you wait?
Yes, you should... that's right
Bravo... 
Carla
Madam Donner
How do you do, Madam?
It was beautiful, Mr. Strauss
Thank you, Madam
I have great news
You've been commissioned to try another opera in the Imperial Theatre for me to sing
Oh, wonderful
Madam, you're incomparable
Cheer, everybody
Well, Johann, aren't you pleased?
Yes, of course, Madam... of course
Madam, will you permit me?
Poldi, this is my wife
I'm very glad to know you, Mrs. Strauss
I've been very anxious to meet you
This is an honor, Madam... thank you, you're very kind
I'm very grateful, Madam, but... 
I can't accept
We've made our plans... we're leaving Vienna
What's the matter, Strauss?
Are you insane?
Johann... for all our sake
You must persuade him, Mrs. Strauss
This is no time for pride, isn't it?
You're right, Madam... this is no time for pride
You must stay, Johann
You mustrt miss an opportunity like this... without considering
To write an opera for the Imperial Theatre, this is what we... what you wanted all the time... what you've dreamed for
A NEW OPERA
Shall I put this away, Mrs. Strauss?
Poldi darling, maybe you'll change your mind
No, Mama... out the dress away, Anna
I don't want to nag you, Poldi
But after all, you really belong there
What will people think?
Mother, please... I'm too excited
I'm so happy here with you and we can pray for him with all my heart and thoughts
After the performance, we can celebrate
I believe that carriage is stopping in front of our house
Yes, it is
Johann has sent for me
Be careful... be careful of the stairs... 
Poldi
I'll open the door, Anna
Is Mrs. Strauss in?
I'm Mrs. Strauss
I'm Count Hobenfried
My husband isn't here
I know... could I speak to you for a moment?
Come in, Sir
Thank you
I shouldn't detain you for long, Madam
Thank you, no... 
Perhaps something what I've to say is known to you l... Madam, I'm in love with Carla Donner
What's that you want to speak to me about, Count Hobenfried?
Madam, for some time now,
Madam Carla and your husband had... had been infatuated with each other
During all these weeks of rehearsals... they've been together constantly and... 
I don't understand one word you're saying
You don't know what all Vienna is... forgive me, Madam
I understand what you feel... 
Count Hobenfried
But you're mistaken
There's nothing wrong, I swear
I give you my word
You know, of course... there's always this rumor
Madam, for your sake,
I'd not presume for the sake of mine
But for his sake, you should stop this at once
I've no right in this matter, Madam
You're his wife... you have
She'll destroy him
They'll destroy each other
She's the woman of violent feelings... strange whims and irresistible impulses
Mr. Strauss is not for the man to cope with this extraordinary person
He'll be ruined
I beg you
Madam, you must face the facts unless you're willing to surrender
What I can see is so dear to you
You compelled me and controlled me to say what I don't intend to say to anyone
You had told me nothing that is not known to me that isn't known to me for some time
I lived all these weeks for... the knife in my heart
I'm content to live here for his sake
It's the better way it must be
I'm sure there was anything to be done he'd have done it
I'm sure he suffers as much as I do
Mrs. Strauss, Madam Donner leaves after the opera tonight for tour of Europe
The situation between them... 
I advise you to act quickly
What'd you have me do?
Fight
What everyone wants to live in this world, he has to fight for... like the beast of jungle
This crisis arrives between people even carefree, but profoundly
If you want to keep him... if you want to save him... don't leave it in his hands
You must fight
I thought my love fought for me
I thought he needed me and that was enough
It's not enough
You'll lose... 
Don't say anymore, Count Hobenfried
Will you excuse me?
All this humiliation... 
You never humiliated yourself... 
Count Hobenfried
I've the greatest respect... the greatest
Who was it, Poldi?
Poldi, what's the matter with you?
Who was it?
Why don't you say something?
What time is it, mother?
It's quarter to 10
Poldi, what happened?
What's the matter with you?
First I dress up
Do you think I could get there in time for the finale?
But if you hurry, you might
But what come over you?
Now suddenly you make up your mind
You're quite right, mother
I'm going, of course... I'm going
I have to go
Johann offered me not have to go before, was it?
Ha... why those people do such a crazy thing?
You'd better lie down, Poldi
Lie down?
There's no time to lie down, mother
This is the time to fight... fight to this beast
All Vienna knows
There's nothing to hide... nothing
Help me, mother... quickly
Quickly
I'm frightened
Oh, there's nothing to be frightened of mother darling... 
There's nothing to be frightened of
I'm going to the opera, that's all
I'm going to the opera to Johann
I knew there's something
Love is no good, mother darling... for women like us
That's for the other kind... for women who take... for women who steal... for women who have no hearts
If you've no other competence, leave it
Can't they, mother?
My jewels?
Where are my jewels?
I have as much right to wear my jewels as she
From now on, I'll never go out without my jewels
Poldi darling, if you really don't want to go to the opera, you don't have to
Maybe I upset you
Now you're too excited
No, mother... I'm not excited
I was for a moment, but not anymore
The performance won't end without me
I'm also bound to... a big part, you know
I'm bound to be the star of Johanrs opera, not that woman
She is not stealing anymore
And in his heart, Johann will be glad
Bravo, Strauss
The world is at your feet tonight
My world is beside me... we belong together
I always know it
I know it now
I'll go with you to Budapest tonight
Darling, in 2 hours we'll be in the Danube
Oh, Carla... you were wonderful
Thank you... hurry
How do you do, Mrs. Strauss?
Well, what do you think of Strauss tonight?
Did you ever see him so magnificent?
He's going to Budapest with you tonight
Yes, my dear... he's going with me
We might as well face it, don't you?
He loves me and I love him
There's nothing, not anyone can do about it
You can't... I can't... he can't
Yes, I know that
If I were you, I'd have spared myself from this embarrassment
I'd ask you to give a message for me
I know he won't leave without... without explaining everything
That would be difficult for him... for us both
Tell him there's no need of it
Tell him he's quite free
He needs not to worry about me
Will you tell him that?
You're very unselfish or unexpectedly clever
For charity, I like it
Believe me, Madam... 
I know it sounds silly
But if his happiness is with you... 
I think I love his happiness more than
I do him
You probably deserve him more than I do
But he's going with me
So don't ever fool yourself to sacrifice again
Happiness is in your own heart... not in someone else's
I found that out
I think you'll feel differently after you've been with Johann for a while
You see... Johann isn't like other man
If you hurt him, you might as well kill him
And you've to watch him carefully... so he doesn't fall off the horse in the street
And if you don't take care when he's working, he'll starve to death
Poldi
Poldi... I want to talk to you
They told me you were here
Yes, I came here to congratulate
Madam Donner
Johann, you're wonderful... you both are wonderful
Did you see the audiences?
Everybody was excited
One hand clapped so hard and nearly fell off his box to the orchestra
I must go now, l... I must find my parents because they get lost in place like this
You know Mama and Papa
Wait a minute, Mrs. Strauss... you can't run away from this
He won't go without talking to you
Johann, she knows... I'll continue waiting in my dressing room
Poldi, l... 
Johann... you mustrt... I understand
But Poldi, I must tell you... call the man is called what you'll
Oh, Johann... why did you torture yourself?
Why didn't you tell me early?
You always come to me when you're in trouble
Why can't you find someone won'thy of you?
I had... I've been happier than most women in their lives
Everything comes to an end... everything
And the world goes on just the same... even when we die
Poldi
Don't talk anymore, Johann... everything is the way it should be
Yes, he is here
Please... 
I've bought the ticket to the
Danube Boat Sail for Budapest tonight
Remember, if you've anything written... give me the first call
Don't forget that, Madam
Keep an eye on him... you know those Hungarian women
I do my best... goodnight, Johann
Goodnight... Poldi
I must pack except for his music
I don't know what to do with his stanza
He leaves everything for the last minute... goodnight
Don't worry, I'll attend to everything... goodnight
Mrs. Strauss, permit me to congratulate you
You must be the happiest woman in Vienna tonight
Goodnight
Congratulations
Goodnight
Mrs. Strauss
Goodnight
Oh, Mrs. Strauss... goodnight, Mrs. Strauss
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
What are you thinking about?
Oh, l... I was thinking the first time we were in carriage together
Remember the old coachman?
And the star is hanging over on his harmonica
And Rosy... remember Rosy?
His old white horse
Yes... and he claimed it understood everything he said
Have you ever been on the Danube?
Of course, you have
Yes, but not this way, Johann
I never have... when we were crazy youngsters
We used to stand on the bank and throw rocks on the boat
Bad little boys
I remember... once the police caught us and... and Poldi cried because she thought... 
Well, we... we nearly went to the jail
Well, here we're
Yes, here we're
Oh, the night is so beautiful
Yes
Shall I take your baggage?
Take only these 2
Yes, Madam
Carla?
There's another horror between us in the carriage
It'll always be so... goodbye, Johann
Something difficult and honest had to be said
You just like you to say
There's the wave we call again
Now I know why part of my heart will always love you
It has only been away from you
I can be content so little with your heart
Vanity... thy name is woman
And the earth and the blood of life itself is vanity
Remember me, Johann
All the days in my life
Are you listening, Johann?
You wrote it for me, didn't you?
Every note and every word
Give it to me... will you give it to me?
It has always been yours
THE BLUE DANUBE:
Waltz by Johann Strauss Jr.
THE IMPEREIAL PALACE, VIENNA
43 YEARS LATER
Your Majesty... Mr. Johann Strauss
Johann Strauss?
It has been a long time since I've seen him... 
50 years, isn't it?
Well, perhaps it's a trifle less... 
Your Majesty
Ask him to come in
Mr. Johann Strauss
Mr. Johann Strauss
Mr. Johann Strauss
I knew you once, Mrs. Strauss
Your memory is very great... 
Count Hobenfried
With your permission... now, remember, Johann
Yes... I know
Take 3 steps into the room... bow from the waist... be courteous... respectful... modest... I know
I shouldn't trust him, Madam
You see, with the reputation you have... my sweetheart
Now then... go
Come... cut out that nonsense, Strauss
It took me a long time to have an audience to you, didn't it?
But finally I succeeded
Your Majesty, l... 
You were always on such excellent term... werert we?
Tell me... is there still anything about me that I'd annoy you?
No... Your Majesty
I think you called me a stuffed shirt
And without thinking further,
I think I was a stuffed shirt
We were very young then, Your Majesty
And now you're king of Vienna
I don't know what Your Majesty means
Oh, you don't?
Well, come with me, Johann
I'll show you what I mean
This can't be happening to me
It could happen only to you
Vienna is giving you the love that you gave Vienna
Ladies and gentlemen, it is very gratifying to Ms. Green, it is very gratifying to the management, to listen to such heartfelt appreciation as you have just expressed.
You all know that this is the last appearance of Ms. Green, of our Harriet, on this or any other stage.
She'll be back on the stage in two years, sure as I'm breathing.
Whether in two years or twenty, they always do you know it's like a favor.
To celebrate this unique occasion, the last appearance in public of our favorite, before
Cupid snatches her from our mitts.
As I was saying, Ms. Harriet
Green, to celebrate this unique occasion, has consented with her company to sing the song that first endeared her to you, to me, to all of us.
Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a
Bow Wow.
Thank you.
? I love my little cat, I do
? It's coat is oh so warm
? He comes each day with me to school and sits upon the form
? Then teacher says why do you bring that little pet of

? Because daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow

Maudie.
She's actually waving to me.
It's the old structure look at that.
The old walrus, I'll throw him a fish in a minute.
What are you going to sit with him for?
Oh a hundred reasons.
You know it means I'm going out of your life forever.
That's one of the reasons.
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow
? I've got a little pet and I'm very fond of that
? But I'd rather have a bow wow wow
Ladies and gentlemen I want to cry, but I mustn't because
I don't want to look horrid the last time you see me.
Nonsense, you look wonderful!
I would rather leave you all at this moment, the moment when you love me most.
I would never like to grow old before your eyes.
You'll never grow old Harriet Green.
Evergreen.
As you all know, tomorrow
I'm getting married, and what more can I say except that
I'm marrying a kind and a splendid man.
? For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow
? For he's a jolly good fellow, a toast to all of us
? A toast to all of us, a toast to all of us
? For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow
? For he's a jolly good fellow, a toast to all of us ?
Hip hip.
Hooray!
Hip hip.
Hooray, hooray!
Oh Shropshire Isn't it touching, I've got a lump in me throat.
Maudie, do you know why I'm attracted to ya?
No, now tell us, go on.
Because you are figured like an hour glass, and that intoxicates me.
Hourglass, oh.
Hourglass.
Have some more San, you'll need it if you want to boil that egg, huh?
You've made me the happiest man in the world little woman.
Oh, clever, cheers.
Maudie my dear, you are
Harriet's understudy, are you not?
Yes I am, or rather I was.
If she doesn't turn up at the wedding, someone's gotta take her place haven't they?
I don't know, I suppose so.
Maudie, will you marry me?
Don't say this is so sudden, because it would be a wooping big lie.
Oh really, I'm not good enough for you.
Shropshire, the pleasure's mine.
Mine too, and damn the county.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to present to you the future Lady Shropshire.
But this may mean that I may never grace the boards again.
London will never get over it.
A treat ladies and gentlemen, a treat never before seen on any stage, the future Lady
Shropshire will sing a duet with the future Marquis of Staines.
Harriet do you really think we ought to, I mean remember our positions.
Orchestra, orchestra.
? Why I wouldn't leave my little wooden house for you
? I've got a lover and a good one too
? What might happen there ain't no knowing, if he comes
? Around so you better get going, woo
? I wouldn't leave my wooden little house for you ?
Come on now, come on, all together.
? I wouldn't leave my little wooden hut for you
? I've got a lover and a good one too
? What might happen there ain't no telling
? If he comes around, you better get going ?
I beg your pardon, I have to leave.
I love you all, goodbye.
What's the matter?
Cab please.
No dear, you must stay behind and look after our guests.
But I--
Hawke will see me home, goodbye.
Ms. Green's apartment.
This is peculiar.
I'm very sorry miss.
It's all right Hawke, I felt all along it was too good to be true.
Where is he?
11 Mock Street Heckney, should I tell the driver?
Hi Cabby, 11 Mock Street Heckney.
Right you are lady, at your case, if you say so.
My darling long lost girly.
All right Hawke, you can wait for me downstairs.
I thought I'd seen the last of you this time.
You really mustn't be so pessimistic about the future my love.
Spent all the money I gave you?
I'm afraid so.
How?
And our little daughter?
In a place where you will never find her.
Well George...
My ship got in this morning, and the first thing I read in the paper was you are going to be a Marshonest, congratulations.
Very sweet of you George.
He's a millionaire, isn't he?
Well little girl we're in clover.
We?
You and me.
I see.
Good thing I never married you eh my love?
Or else this would be bigamy.
Are you coming to the wedding George?
You bet.
You wouldn't like me to give you away, would you?
Ooooh.
Harriet you must go on with this marriage.
And be blackmailed by you for the rest of my life?
Oh I'm a reasonable man,
I'd ask for a little and I'd cheer off.
After a price, and unfortunately you'd cheer back again.
Oh no George, I'm not so keen on marriage as to let myself in for that.
But this means everything to you.
Perhaps it does, but my own peace of mind means still more.
Harriet, this is a chance of a lifetime.
For you, yes.
Oh it's no use George, I'm sick of having you hanging around my heels, and if I marry
Staines it'd be a thousand times worse.
Oh lovely how can you say such things about me?
Besides, your engagement's been announced.
If I thought you were going to turn up like this I wouldn't have dreamed of going on with it.
But you must go on with it, my dear it's a gift.
And think of the poor Marquis, how could you be so cruel to him, break the young man's heart, they say he's as sensitive as they make 'em.
And if you let him go why he's liable to throw himself in his own battlements, and his blood will be on your hand.
You can't go to Heaven branded as a murderess.
Hawke, I've made up my mind.
Go up and tell him that
I've left the stage.
Tell him that I am not going to get married, but I'm going to clear off and go back home to South Africa.
And me, aren't I coming with you?
No Hawke, you're going into the country to bring up
Harriet Junior.
Couldn't you bring yourself to take her with you?
No Hawke, her father stands for too much that has been miserable in my life.
My life is going to be my own from now on.
You'll bring her up beautifully
Hawke, I'm sure of it.
Harriet, Harriet my love, you must listen to reason.
She would've made such a lovely Marshonest.
Don't I know it.
? I wouldn't leave my little wooden house for you
? I've got a lover and a good one too
? What might happen there ain't no knowing if he comes
? Around so you better get going, woo
? I wouldn't leave my little wooden house for you ?
Good luck dear.
Thanks darling.
Cut, cut, yeah yeah, what's all this about.
I'm all right really, I was a bit overworked from my last job, that's what it is.
And when was your last job?
About six months ago, but today's my lucky day.
Had any breakfast this morning?
I'm dieting.
That was terrible boys, terrible.
I'm going to send you home to your mothers soon.
And keep work, there's nothing to laugh about.
Charlie, let her go, one two.
No.
Yes Mister.
Vivvy Abbington would like you to go to lunch with her on
Friday.
Oh take a note of it.
Yes Mr. Ben.
I wanna see those girls.
Skirts up.
Mr. Ben have you decided on the blue carpet or the pink for the ballroom scene?
I want red.
Yes Mr. Ben.
Now tempo, tempo!
Would you give me a rehearsal group Mr. Ben?
No.
Yes Mr. Ben.
Stop, stop everybody, stop.
This is a nice time for one of my chorus ladies to turn up in the morning isn't it?
Yes Mr. Ben.
Don't you get enough sleep?
What do you think Mr. Ben?
Keep quiet everybody, from the commencement Charlie, one two.
Stop, it is ordered, stop.
Rest up 15 minutes girls.
Mr. Ben what about these other girls?
I don't wanna see anymore girls today.
All right Mr. Ben.
Sorry ladies, no more auditions today.
Now what is it?
I'm livid.
You look a bit off what the hell's the matter with you?
Am I supposed to be your young and glamorous leading lady or not?
Supposed to be, yes.
And didn't you promise me some really good publicity?
I was tight at the time but I did yes.
Well listen to this?
Ms. Marjorie Moore, the well known divorcee, that's a great help for God's sake, celebrated her 35th birthday very quietly in her tiny Knight's
Bridge flat with a little tea party.
Fish me Mr. Thompson, go on fish me Mr. Thompson!
Mr. Thompson!
Mr. Thompson!
Mr. Thompson!
Here I am Mr. Ben.
How dare you.
What do you mean by this?
I'm not sitting anymore today!
How dare you say I'm 35, the whole world knows I'm 28!
It's a new idea of mine, truth in advertising, besides it says in the theatrical who's who that you're 38.
Oh.
And how dare you describe this lady's flat as tiny, it is enormous.
Well you know it better than I do sir.
What does he mean by that?
We'll let that pass.
I thought it might be good to suggest that Ms. Moore has simple tastes.
And as far as the public's concerned, Ms. Moore's flat isn't in Knight's Bridge it's in Mayfair.
Yes Mr. Ben.
Don't you realize that what this theatrical profession wants to put on it's feet is a new and original idea, can't you think of something startling and original?
I have Mr. Ben, I though of it this morning while I was cleaning my teeth.
What was it?
Couldn't we suggest that
Ms. Moore had all her jewels stolen?
Marvelous.
Get out.
But Mr. Ben--
Get out!
Ooooh.
Where's my chair?
Damn Ms. Marjorie Moore, oh sorry.
It's all right.
I don't know you from any
Johnson, but there's something
I'd like to get off my chest,
I'd give anything in the world to boil Mr. Leslie Ben in caster oil.
So would I.
Can you afford the caster oil?
No, can you.
No too bad, but good morning.
I have good news to tell Mr.
Pryde, the Lady Shropshire is here.
Oh, yes your honor, miss, but he's with Mr. Ben now.
Mr. Ben?
Oh I knew him well.
I said nobody was allowed in here while I'm with Mr. Ben.
Oh but Mr. Ben knows me so well.
God bless it's Maudie.
Maudie is one of my names, but really I'm Lady Shropshire.
Hm, you haven't gone grand on us by any chance have you?
And what do we owe the honor of this visit Lady Jabaja?
Shropshire if you don't mind.
Well as you read in the papers I am widowed.
But the rumor that my husband left me in an acute state of mortgage is quite untrue.
Sounds rather rude to me.
Really.
But I have begun to feel, now how can I put it, the desire to return to the old profession.
What?
You never at the foot light.
Do you mind telling us what the big idea is Lady
Shropshire?
Oh Les it's like this, see
I've been studying grand opera and I thought well for old time's sake, I'd like to give you the first chance of presenting me.
Charming of you.
Can you play that.
? Na na na na na na
? Ah ha ha ha ha ha a ha ha ha
Maudie, you've moved us strangely.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
I thought you were a publicity man.
So did I, so I was, but
I've decided to go back to the stage again.
How nice.
You couldn't get me to touch that damn publicity record not with a barge pole.
I haven't got a barge pole.
Oh clever aren't you.
Nothing new today folks.
They always say that, I'm going to wait.
Well if you'll take a chance, so will I.
And here am I one of the greatest showmen in the business prepared to spend any amount of dough on the public and I'm stuck, I can't bring them in.
And I've got to watch the man that runs the Picture Palace down the road turn away from his, and why?
Because he's got something really good to show them.
Now I've got to have something that will make them sit up in their seats and rub their eyes, oh for a stunt.
Have a cup of tea, we can talk about old times.
Oh, for a stunt.
A stunt?
A really marvelous publicity stunt, so daring and original that it'd make old Ben go down on his knees begging me to go back to him, gosh, what a triumph.
But I thought you'd finished with the whole damn record.
So I have, still.
Oh I'm so tired of looking for a job.
Am I seeing things?
What's the matter, are you ill?
It can't be Harriet Green.
I'm afraid you've made a mistake, my name is Harriet
Hawkes.
The voice is the same, oh I'm going off my nut.
You're not Harriet Green's daughter by any chance are you?
I'm afraid you're mistaken, I'm, my name--
Well what do you know about that?
And I thought I knew all there was to know about Harriet
Green.
Her daughter, well well.
Do you mean the famous
Harriet Green of the olden days?
Yes, oh but that was before your time.
I remember the door, the top, the champagne, suppers.
And you're her daughter.
Oh please, I told you my name is Hawkes.
What's the matter with you?
Don't talk to me I'm giving birth.
Really, what is this world coming to.
Who is that young man.
I don't know, but I think he's awfully silly.
I've got it.
I'm going to put you at the top of the tree my girl by a stunt.
By a stunt that will make
Leslie Ben's hair stand on him, a stunt that will put Hitler and Amy in the shade, a stunt that will make all of London cue up to see you my girl.
Did you hear me say nothing new today.
You're wrong old man, gosh how wrong you are.
Come on, let's go to lunch, I don't know who's going to pay for it, but come one let's go to lunch.
Mr. Leslie Ben.
What the devil do you mean by this?
Oh you two knew each other, how nice.
We do not.
Oh but you must meet, such a clever young man Leslie, and a great friend of mine.
Mr. Ben, Mister, what did you say your name was?
Thompson.
Now Ms. Maudie, I thought
I came here to talk about old times.
Oh did you?
Of course you did, and while you're here, I'm going to show you the greatest idea ever presented.
A chance that comes to a man only once in a lifetime.
? When you're young, it's always spring and light as a happy
? Song, how many laugh at her and sing as we all along
? Though the years go rushing by and spring is a memory
? Life will always be the same sweet song to me
? When you've got a little spring time in your heart
? You can knod at all the wintery winds that blow
? Though December comes your way don't worry about a thing
? And the buttercups come peeping through the snow
? You will be young you'll be loved your whole life through
? Just as young and more in love than at the start
? And each happy thing will be Evergreen and as sweet as
? A blossom in June
? When you've got a little springtime in your heart ?
Harriet Green.
Well?
Good Lord.
Remember you of anyone Duckie?
It is Harriet Green.
Of course it is.
Her daughter?
Yes.
It isn't anything of the sort, it is Harriet Green, you said it yourself, it is Harriet Green.
What are you driving at?
A stunt, the biggest you've ever heard of.
Well go on.
I don't know, I'm not so sure I want to talk about it after your extraordinary behavior to me yesterday.
Oh drop that for the love of Mike.
Well my idea is that from now on this girl becomes her own mother.
Impersonate her mother.
Yes, that's the idea.
You're all mad.
Oh don't go Leslie, don't go.
Just clever, objections please.
But her mother died years ago.
In South Africa, and there's nobody who was interested, nobody realized it, next.
Do you realize that her mother was a very great artist?
I know I could do it Mr.
Ben, if only you would give me the chance.
And don't forget I was her mother's understudy.
And I was her dresser for years.
And I remember all the little ways of her.
We could teach her.
You bet.
Do you seriously mean that you think you could persuade the British public that this girl is a Harriet Green of times?
Well, we persuaded you she was two minutes ago, and you knew her mother well.
You are no fool Mr. Ben now are you?
Yes, no, I only believed it until I remembered my dates.
Do you realize if this child's mother were alive today she'd be about 50 years of age.
Good Heavens of course I do.
Oh but damn it, this kid looks sixteen.
Well of course she does.
Well?
Meet the star that will never grow old.
What?
The idol that brought the look of the age of 16.
What charm the use of 1934?
By looking like sweet 16.
Meet the miracle of the age, Ms. Harriet Green.
? If I give into you
I'm giving into myself ?
Now Harriet come along, I'm gonna show you how your mother always finished her numbers, come on.
Like this, big smile.
Yes, but that must come out more and these must be down.
You've forgotten this one Madam.
Oh yes, she always did that.
How lovely.
Isn't it touching?
Oh I can't go through with it, it is indecent to go about pretending to be my own mother.
Oh but Harriet, you never saw your own mother so to speak.
I'm sure if she knew she'd be ever so pleased that you're keeping her memory green and not meaning any funds either.
Come on Harriet, be a big girl, one one two.
Oh all right.
? If I give into you
I'm giving into myself
? If you shatter my resistance
Lovely deary.
Just like her mother.
? I know it may be wrong but that would never have hold
? And against my better judgement I fall
? I am weak, now you can go and bring your speak
? And I hear no one grin oh hush
? It's not my fault if I am tucked away on your shelf
? I am giving into myself ?
That was lovely deary.
Oh give me a hankie.
You could never sing like that, they'll think you've been taking some monkey glands to make you young.
Besides Harriet, you look so lovely dressed as your mother, all the boys will fall in love with you as they did with her.
Now listen kids we only got three more days for rehearsing.
Good morning.
Morning.
Quiet.
I wanna get a polish on.
Now you watch your tempo, and you're very ragged.
And listen kids for Heaven's sake look as if you're enjoying it.
? I'm the only doctor who can cure your ills
? No funding medicines, no bitter tasting pills
? I have a magic pure and simple as can be
? I just prescribe this sweet little melody
? Tinkle tinkle tinkle, what if the raindrops sprinkle
? Tie a little bell to your dancing shoes and the sun will
? Shine
? Tinkle tinkle tinkle, what if the stars wouldn't twinkle
? Tie a little bell to your dancing shoes and stars will
? Shine
? When you moan and groan in trouble comes around
? Heave my miles and miles of very happy sounds
? Tinkle tinkle, what if the raindrops sprinkle
? Tie a little bell to your dancing shoes and stars will
? Shine
Now listen old man, you can't keep us in the dark all the time.
You've got to know something, tell me, is Harriet Green rehearsing today.
No.
Is she ever gonna rehearse?
No.
Is anybody ever gonna see her at all?
No.
Thanks so much.
You're welcome.
Morning.
Hello.
Ben's a grand old trainer.
He's not that bad.
And what about Harriet Green?
Oh, come with me up in the box, I'll give you a really grand story.
Not at all bad kids.
Leslie, Harriet's ready, she got to run through a rehearsal with you.
Right, now everybody go to your dressing rooms and on no account must anybody come onto this stage.
Now come on kids get on with it.
We'll be just in time to see it all.
When are we gonna see this old hag?
Time will show.
Time will show in her figure too I'll bet.
See you on the first night boys.
Now Tommy, see that the critics get their drinks in the second half.
Oh naturally.
Yes I got an idea that the second half's a bit weak.
As usual.
Oh will you stop walking about everybody.
This is a quick change not a skating rink.
Now Harriet there's nothing for you to be nervous about.
You know what's at stake?
I put every penny I've got into this show, if we don't make good tonight I'm absolutely ruined.
Everything's on your shoulders.
I've done everything I can.
? When you're young it's always spring and life is a happy
? Song, how we love it yeah, and sing as we're all along
? Though the years go rushing by and spring is a memory
? Life will always be the same sweet song to me
? When you've got a little springtime in your heart
? You can love with all the wintery things that blow
? Though December comes your way
? For you the buds will sing and buttercups come peeping
? Through the snow
? You'll be young and in love your whole life through
? Just as young and more in love than ever before
? And these happy things will be evergreen
? As the sweetest blossom in June
? When you've got a little springtime in your heart
? And each happy thing will be evergreen as the sweetest
? Blossoms in June
? When you have a little springtime in your heart ?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press please have a little patience, Ms. Green is not so young and is easily tired.
The excitement of her great triumph last night has exhausted her.
She wishes me to apologize to you for the delay, she will be with you in a few moments.
Oh there you are.
My dear you look beautiful, are you ready?
Yes.
I'll conduct them in.
Has a romance played a big part in your life Ms. Green?
Oh yes, but the 20th century isn't a patch on the 19th.
Do you think is more becoming than they used to be.
Yes, but red flannel had it's moments.
How old do you feel Ms. Green?
As old as I look.
Do you remember Merican Knight?
As if it were yesterday.
Were you Ms. Green?
Oh no, I've always liked my men to have the upper hand.
Did Glaston ever say anything interesting to you Ms.
Green?
Well, it was not so much what he said.
What is your greatest ambition?
To have the same effect on your grandchildren that I had on your grandfathers.
Clever, thank you so much.
You know why she wears that high collar don't you?
No.
To hide the scars.
Scars, has she had her face smashed?
No, lifted.
And is your husband still alive Ms. Green?
No, he died in South
Africa three years ago.
Really, what of?
Old age, he was a good ten years older than me you know.
Have you any questions of a more general nature?
Have you any children Ms. Green?
Oh really, please.
Come Ms. Green give us a break, look what I did for you this morning.
Oh, how charming.
Oh, excuse me I must go consult my general manager.
What are you trying to palm off on me.
A most interesting news, this should get us a long run.
Maudie.
Now that's in the second act, and that's in the third, and oh you must publish that one.
That's the scene with the comic, remember?
This'll be ten years not three.
Listen Leslie, keep your hair on.
We're the only four in the know, and who else is going to find out?
The Marquis of Staines.
My mother's old fiance.
My dear, amazing, not a year older, not a muscle changed.
This is the most touching moment
I've experienced since you consented to marry me.
Let me see, why it must be quite the odd years ago.
Don't you remember?
Is it such a dreadful shock?
Have I changed so much?
My dear old Staines.
Maudie.
How this does take one back.
Why it's quite shaken me.
It's quite shaken me too.
Me too.
And me.
You don't know what a shock it was to me when I got your letter that night.
By the way you never told me in that letter was the child a girl or a boy.
My dear boy, how foolish of me not to notice the resemblance.
Yes yes, I'm delighted to meet you, delighted.
And I must congratulate you too my dear, a splendid champ.
Thank you.
And if you have half the beautiful nature your dear mother has, you'll be a model son.
I was wrong, this means 20 years not 10.
Do you think we better go and confess?
After all none of us realized it was a crime.
Ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law.
There's no earthly reason why anybody should find out is there, author of my being.
So you really think we're safe, offspring?
Oh safe as houses.
Simple see there's you and me, and Maudie and Leslie.
Who else is there to know?
Oh.
Hello deary.
What are you doing in my room?
The porter let me in.
Well I'll let the porter throw you out.
Here, here Harriet, don't you know me, I'm your long lost husband.
You mean your my...
Do you mind if I open the window?
Not at all my dear.
So long as you don't give me the air.
Well little girly, we're in clover.
We?
Yes, you and me.
Won't you introduce me to your boyfriend?
He's not my boyfriend.
No I'm this lady's son.
Oh an only child eh, it may interest you to know young man the last time I saw you I distinctly remember you as a little girl.
No you don't.
I do indeed I remember quite well, I never could make up my mind which one I wanted, a boy or a girl.
Just goes to show.
Are you my father?
No chap, but I'll tell you what I am, if you're this lady's son, then I'm your grandpa see.
Now there Harriet, you say you're glad to see your dear old daddy.
I'm delighted.
I must run along, one or two calls to make.
What calls?
Well I just thought I'd barge in on the Marquis of Staines and have a chat about the old days when he was in love with your mother.
Oh no you don't.
He may remember to pay me a little sum that he lent me some time ago.
How much?
Oh it isn't much it's 200 pounds, I'm a reasonable man and as long as I can keep body and soul together that's all I ask for here below.
Thank you sonny.
Pleasure's mine pop.
Well goodbye til our next meeting Harriet Green and son.
Harriet Green and son.
Harriet Green and son.
What an idea.
Good morning mother, good morning sir.
Good morning my boy.
I just fixed up the most marvelous picture contract for you, best bit of waning I've ever done.
Splendid.
Well I must be off to the club, late already.
Think it over my dear, think it over.
How would you like to have a stepfather, what?
A step what?
He's asked me to marry him.
Ha ha.
What do you mean ha ha?
Another of my schemes hashing out.
You've been expecting it?
Expecting it?
Engineering it.
I see.
Can't you see the marvelous publicity angle of it?
Just as we're starting in on the show too?
You mean I ought to accept?
Course, later on if you like you can call the whole thing off, wouldn't break the old boy's heart, it's only a sentimental idea of his.
And suppose I were to fall in love, to take a fancy to a man of my own age.
Shh, do be careful my dear.
Well it has been known to happen you know.
Well it mustn't happen in your case old girl.
And don't you call me old girl.
And if it's any news to you as my publicity agent, I'm not only going to accept the
Marquis, but I'm going to go through with it to marry him.
And we can sit by the fire and talk about the good old times for the rest of our lives.
It's not like Harriet to be late.
She's never been late before?
That doesn't prevent it being excessively irritating that she is today.
You're very pevish today young man, what's the trouble?
Come on, tell Auntie Maudie.
I'll tell Auntie Maudie to mind her own business.
Oh what a very rude thing to say to a lady.
Would it be?
Thank you.
You're late.
I've been driving around the park with my fiance.
Oh not the damn Marquis.
Don't be such a damn snob Maudie.
Oh I like that coming from you, when you worked the whole thing, you knew you did you naughty boy.
That was a publicity stunt.
And publicity's everything, believe me, isn't it
Mr. Thompson?
Oh you.
Now kids, give me a romance.
Now here's the spot for it in the show.
Now in this number here, you're chased.
I'm in your pursuit, you're very coy.
You the pursuer got that?
Right, now in the first little ta ta ta, I want a kiss.
Very coy again, then in the second ta ta ta, a more passionate kiss, and at the end of the refrain, you're abandoned.
All right.
? As you drum in here you I ought to fear you
? Rather than think you ran
? But I can't assemble, it makes me tremble merely to touch
? Your hand
? Though we're under conditions I'm so glad
? No proper apprehensions have I had
? All of our transgressing seems such a blessing in my bed
? Dear dear this is much too nice, it won't happen twice
? Dear dear do you think we should
? Dear dear this is all so quaint and I'm not a saint
? Dear it's too good to be good
? No love scenes on movie screens compare with the one
? We've staged now
? With the urge completely to merge you'd think we were
? Both engaged now
? Dear dear one is made from two
? Which of us is you
? Dear it's too good to be true ?
Get ready for your first kiss kids, you missed it, all right carry on.
Watch it there's another kiss coming, oh dear.
Give me romance, come on.
Look happy, there, smile.
Now this is where we kiss.
And hold it while I fade out the lights.
Well if that's romance kids, it's lousy.
Harriet Green and son, there's a limit to family feeling you know.
Oh there you are my boy, I want a word with you, will you excuse us my dear?
Certainly.
Has your mother told you?
The marriage, oh yes, yes, congratulations.
Oh thank you my boy, thank you, I knew you'd be delighted.
Now I have a little proposition to make to you.
It'll be sometime before the details in my marriage to your mother can be simple.
Now with her age I don't like to think of how frail she is, living alone liable to be accusted by the first newcomer who might be deceived into thinking she's a young girl.
So what do you think I've done?
I've taken a charming little house for the two of you so that you can look after your mother.
Oh, well that's very kind of you but we couldn't, could we?
No, we couldn't possibly accept a house from you.
It's lovely, oh it's beautiful.
I'm delighted you like the new house and I hope you both sleep well on your first night here.
Now goodbye my dear, goodbye.
Goodbye my boy.
Goodnight sir.
Dear old gentlemen, isn't he?
Why didn't you think of one of those great ideas of yours to get us out of this one?
Well after all, it's grand publicity.
Mr. Thompson if you mention the word publicity again I will scream.
You seem to think I exist to give you a state in the papers.
Is there anything in the world you care for except publicity?
Well it's my job, and I'm ambitious.
And you'd sacrifice everything for that, wouldn't you?
Good evening my children,
I hope I don't intrude.
Not at all, it only needed you and the day's complete.
As a matter of fact my boy I'm shy of cash.
I thought as much.
So if you would let me have 2, 300 pounds.
You've had 1500 from us already.
So I have, but I've got a lot on my conscience.
I'll let you have the money tomorrow, now get out.
But my daughter, my only daughter.
I'm a reasonable man as long as I can keep body and soul together that's all I ask for here below.
In your state it's not safe to let you have the money.
It's not safe not to.
Not a word, I'm a man of the world.
Now come on come on.
Well, there should be some good publicity in that.
I'm rather tired, I think
I'll wish you a good night.
Goodnight.
Won't you have a cup of tea.
Thank you.
I can't sleep a wink.
That's funny, neither can I.
My tea's hot.
That's funny so is mine.
I never sleep in a strange bed.
Neither do I.
You know Harriet, I don't think this stunt is treating you fairly.
Oh I don't know, it's brought in a lot more money than I ever thought I'd have, a career which I've always wanted, a charming fiance which I'd always hoped for, and a dear little son which I never expected.
Goodnight.
? The world little because a miracle has brought my lover
? To me, though it's another place, his face I see
? At night I creep in bed, but never sleep in bed
? Just look above in the air
? And do my sweetest joy, my boy is there
? It is my prince who walks into my dreams and talks
? He dances overhead on the ceiling near my bed
? In my fight through the night
? I try to hide in vain underneath my counter pain
? There's my love up above
? I whisper go away my lover it's not fair
? But I'm so grateful to discover he's still there
? I love my ceiling more since it is a dancing floor
? For my love ?
And I hope that I may still remain the public's most obedient.
I've got a great idea.
You have, cough it up my lad.
I think it's just the way to finish things off a sort of marvelous finale.
I suggest that Harriet Green vanishes.
Vanishes.
Into thin air?
No no no, to South Africa.
I see, on the day before her first night, why?
Because she's tired of it all.
Yes well we don't want her to be tired of it all.
Have you seen the box office receipt.
Now wait a minute, she vanishes, and three weeks later, her young and beautiful daughter arrives in England to console her mother's heartbroken public by taking her place.
You see, she's been studying singing and dancing hard.
On the belt I suppose.
Yes.
No, do you realize what this means?
Impersonation fraud, we've been lucky enough to get away with it up to now, now we've got to go on with it.
Well suppose I tell them it was all my idea.
This young man's crazy Harriet, do you know what's wrong?
Yes, I think I do.
Don't you see Harriet, Harriet
Green the star disappears and the daughter comes to England.
I see.
And you go to South Hampton to meet your sister.
My sister?
Oh Lord yes.
Oh Lord my sister, oh Lord my sister.
It's the excitement, that's what it is, he's been overworking.
Suppose we do follow up that idea of Tommy's.
Suppose we do, then everything gets found out.
Exactly how many of us would be for the--
High drum?
Yes.
Well you'd be first, impersonation and fraud, and then
Tommy for posing as your son.
What about you and Maudie?
Well of course if you'd like to have it that you took us in the same as Staines and the public, I suppose we get off without a blood or a scratch.
I see.
Ah my boy, did you get it.
What would you do if I didn't give you this money?
I'd go straight to Scott and
Yard and give the whole game away, that's what I'd do.
Is that a promise?
It is.
Hey.
Darling, thank you.
Now you mustn't get too tired tonight my dear.
I won't.
Darling, come here a minute.
I've got something to confess to you.
Don't tell me you've kept all my letters.
No, no it's something much more serious than that.
Look at me closely, is this the Harriet Green you loved years ago?
Well aren't you furious at being taken in like this?
I haven't been taken in,
I knew the minute I saw you.
I remembered your mother better than most people you know.
But why did you let us--
Because I admired your plaque.
Because I like the look of your young man, because I wanted you to get away with it, and because you're Harriet Green
Junior.
Come on my dear, I'm sure it's gonna be a most exciting first night.
I have a feeling it is too.
Well that went over all right Tommy.
? I've been a prisoner locked in a jail
? Love held the only key ?
Here my girl.
What are you doing here?
Never you mind, I'm here and I want my money.
Ms. Green it's your quick change.
? I want a wonderful feeling to be free, really free
? So over my shoulder goes one hair
? And over my shoulder goes two hairs
? Why should I cry above
? I'm free at last and I'm in love
? Over my shoulder goes three ?
Of course I know the young man was only having his little joke with me this morning when he wouldn't give me my money.
So he didn't pay you?
No he didn't, so I've come to you.
After all daughter, I'm a reasonable man as long as I can keep body and soul together that's all I ask for here below.
What would you do if I didn't pay?
Well I'd go straight to Scott and Yard and get the whole game away that's what I'd do.
Is that a promise?
Yeah.
Mr. Ben, Mr. Ben.
Oh what's the matter, what's the matter?
What's she doing?
I don't know, she's never done it before.
She'll never do it again.
I can't believe it.
That isn't Harriet Green.
I don't believe she can do that at 60.
She's a fraud.
Now you know what I've been dying to tell you for weeks.
A woman of 60.
Put your house lights up and bring down that curtaiin.
What's the matter, put out the houselights stop the orchestra.
And what are you doing on my stage?
Nothing, it was by mistake.
She's not Harriet Green, she's a fraud.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'm not gonna make a speech,
I'm just going to appeal to you as the sporting British public.
Give us our money back.
Who's baby are you?
We've been had.
You've been had, how about me, I've been in love with her for weeks and had to go about calling her mommy.
But she's not Harriet Green.
I know that my friend, but let me tell you something, she's the daughter of Harriet Green.
She hadn't got a job, she was hungry, a few of you here may know what that means.
But she had the talent she had inherited from her famous mother, the talent that has charmed you tonight.
Now be honest ladies and gentlemen, it has charmed you hasn't it?
Now ladies and gentlemen, this girl got a chance to prove that she had it in her to be a star.
She wanted you to take her to your hearts, do you blame her?
No.
Some may say she tried to defraud the public.
I respectfully ask you to note that phrase which is of imperative importance.
Defraud the public, that means surely to promise something, to take payment for same, and then to prove yourself unable to fulfill that promise.
In plain English my Lord, unable to deliver the goods.
Well ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is my case that this young lady could not possibly have defrauded the public, because she delivers the goods and I so prove it.
I call the prisoner.
You are charged with defrauding the public by impersonating your mother, the late Harriet Green.
What is your name?
Harriet Green.
You see my Lord.
Proceed, proceed.
What is your profession?
I am an actress.
And your mother?
She was an actress.
Who was?
Her mother my Lord, the late Harriet Green.
Who was Harriet Green?
Silence in court.
Harriet Green my Lord was a famous stage star.
So you've been singing several songs of your mother's reportou.
Yes.
You sing them as well as she did?
Well, it's rather difficult for me to answer that question.
My Lord in my submission it is a question of facts for the jury to judge.
Exhibit A please.
I have here my lad a phonographic reproduction of one of the late Harriet Green's most famous songs.
I submit that this is not admissible evidence.
In the case of Smith vs.
Smith 1914, to the King's bench my lad, page 493.
Was allowed to prove his statement by demonstration of his art my Lord.
Hear the evidence.
? When you're young it's always spring
? And life is a happy song, how we care and sing as we go
? Along, though the years go rushing by
? And spring is a memory, life will always be the same
? Sweet song to me
? When there's spring in your heart
? And the wintery winds that blow
? Buttercups come peeping through the snow
? And you love your whole life through
? And in love
? And each happy thing will be evergreen as the sweetest
? Blooming in June
? When you've got a little springtime in your heart
? When you've got a little springtime in your heart
? Over my shoulder goes one hair, over my shoulder goes
? Two hairs, why should I cry
? I'm free at last and I'm in love
? Over my shoulder goes three hairs
? Over my shoulder goes four hairs
? Over my shoulder goes it all ?
This is all I ask for here below.
? When you've got a little spring time in your heart
? You can love the wintery winds that blow
? And the memory will be evergreen when the spring time's
? Coming through
? When you've got a little spring time in your heart

- Oh, good afternoon Miss Morrison.
- How you do Mrs. Perkins?
Nice and pretty all this, isn't it?
That one little Mary dancing over there, the one in the blue dress. Cute, isn't she?
- Yes.
- I was queen of the May once..
Don't look it now, do I?
Kip...
You mind if I sit here beside you?
Oh, of course not
Miss Morrison, I'd be very glad.
Hardly expected to find you alone on a day like today.
No? Well I guess a fellow likes to be alone sometimes.
- Where's Barbara?
- I don't know.
- Somewhere around I guess.
- You guess?
- You and she haven't quarreled, have you?
- Oh, no.
No, nothing like that.
There's one of those
New York singing teachers in town and... she's been having auditions.
- Sort of takes up most of her time.
- She didn't tell me about it.
Yeah, this fellow says that if she went to New
York and had her voice trained he could...
He could make her an opera star in about seven years.
You know, a career, success and all that.
- She won't do it.
- I think she will.
You see, her folks aren't standing in her way.
Just me.
I wouldn't worry too much about it if I were you Kip.
- It'll all work out, you know.
- Thank you, Miss Morrison.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Well, here we are.
- Oh, it was such a beautiful drive.
Oh, you enjoyed it, fine, I'm so glad.
- There.
- Hello Barbara.
- Hello Miss Morrison.
- I was wondering where you were.
Well I, oh
Miss Morrison, this is Mr. Bulliet.
- How do you do?
- Miss Morrison.
I've missed you these last few days.
When you coming over to see me?
Very soon, I've lots of things to tell you, I may be going to New York.
Oh, how exciting.
Miss Roberts has an extraordinarily promising voice.
We're going to try to make a star out of her.
Oh, that is exciting.
- You must tell me all about it child.
- Later this afternoon?
- Yes, I'll be home all day, you stop by.
- Thank you.
- Good day, Mr. Bulliet...
- Yes, good day Miss Morrison.
Good day.
Who was that?
Miss Morrison? Oh, she's a darling, she lives next door to us.
Nobody really knows anything about her.
Her cupboard is rattling with skeletons, eh?
Not really, she's a very sweet, sheltered old lady.
Well, I've be leaving Mr. Bulliet.
Thanks so much for the drive.
That's quite all right my dear, glad to have you.
Morning.
There you are, I was wondering what had happened to you.
I only walked as far as the maypole on the green.
You haven't made yourself tired walking all that way?
No, no, no.
- Of course not.
- I'll make you some nice, hot tea.
You shouldn't have gone, you know, not today.
May day seems almost the same as any other day...
- sometimes.
- Yes, yes.
I'll get the tea.

I've heard enough,
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
But Kip, you don't understand, you just Ben pig-headed.
All I know is that I can offer you a home and my love, like keep in comfort.,
That's not good enough for you, I'm sorry.
And I'll be as pig headed as I darn well choose.
- I have the right to a career.
- Sure, you got a right to a career.
And I got a right to a home and wife but that can go hang itself, can't it?
All right.
Go ahead and have your career.
See how far it gets you, I'm through.
Well, I'm through too and I never want to see you again.
I, I don't want to see you again either, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Barbara.
Oh...
I think I'm going to cry, you mind?
Oh, there, there, child.
It really isn't as terrible as it seems, you know.
There...
But I was right, wasn't I? I was right.
You mean you never want to see him again?
No, I never meant that.
But I'm right about going to New York, aren't I?
Why, I regret it all my life if I didn't.
That's what he won't see, why won't he see it?
How can he be so selfish?
Perhaps it's because he loves you child.
- Couldn't love me and talk to me like that.
- Oh, I think he could.
If losing you meant losing everything else too.
Oh, it isn't that. It's just selfishness.
He doesn't want me even to have a chance.
Can you understand Miss Morrison?
I want to try, that's all.
I just want the chance to become a famous singer like, like Tetrazzini or Jenny Lind or... or Marcia Mornay.
Yes...
Yes, I can understand.
- But I can understand other things too.
- What other things?
I've never talked to you about myself, have I child?
No I...
I never talk to anyone usually, but...
I'm going to talk to you about myself now.
You see...
I was Marcia Mornay.
You...
Yes...
Many, many years ago.
I was very young.
It's Paris...
In the court of Louis Napoleon...
Oh Nicolai, I'm beginning to feel nervous.
- For no reason.
- For every reason, I'm frightened of kings.
- Louis Napoleon is an emperor.
- Same thing.
Not at all, kings descend from kings.
Louis Napoleon descended from little corporals, there is a difference.
- Oh, you see, I'm still nervous.
- You mistrust my judgment?
Oh Nicolai.
I present my singers at court... when they are fit to be presented at court, neither before or later.
You're walking too fast.
- It's undignified.
- I feel undignified.
Getting sticks.
Now, what do I do when I'm presented to the emperor?
- Curtsy.
- Nothing else?
- You mistrust my sense of etiquette too?
- No Nicolai.
Mademoiselle Mornay and monsieur Nazaroff.
After hearing you at the opera the other night... we're all impatient to hear you sing again mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle Mornay is deeply honored your majesty.
Would mademoiselle care to rest herself a few moments...
- after her journey from the theater?
- Oh, thank you your majesty.
Shall we waltz?
I do anything wrong?
Curtsy was a little stiff, only the empress noticed it.
- Oh, I feel much better now, thank you.
- Naturally.
So that's his latest protegee or is protegee quite the right word?
- There is another.
- I don't envy her.
- I hear he drives his singers unmercifully.
- Oh no, not all the time.
He can be very human.
- What?
- Yes?
So I hear.
You see that gentleman a bubble with gaiety over there?
That is Trentini.
The great composer? Oh, Nicolai.
Sounded almost naive.
Now, if Trentini wrote an opera for you, you would become immortal.
Oh but, do you think he would write an opera for me?
No, not without persuasion.
- Mademoiselle Mornay.
- See that you sing well.

If I may pay you a sincere compliment mademoiselle Mornay... you are the first singer I've met in years... that did not open the conversation by asking me to write an opera for her.
Thank you very much.
You know, I'm afraid I must claim credit for that.
It was I who told mademoiselle Mornay you had retired.
- You did what?
- So Patellli told me.
- And who told Patellli?
- You mean it's not true?
It is not, I haven't the slightest intention of retiring.
Oh, a relief.
- When did Patellli tell you this?
- Oh, let me see, I...
I've gone to him to commission an opera for
Mlle. Mornay, it must be nearly a week ago.
- So you admire Patellli's music, eh?
- I think it will live.
- So will mine.
- Oh longer, far longer sir.
But... when genius is hard to approach, one is forced to approach Patellli instead.
Quite.
- Is he writing this opera?
- So he gave Mlle. Mornay to understand.
Treacle, he writes treacle.
Mlle. Mornay needs a composer to serve that voice, not a ballad scribbler.
- Mlle. Mornay, another compliment.
- Oh, thank you signore Trentini.
You want quality, inspiration... not tum tum tum, tum tum tum.
You need a, a Schubert a Mozart a...
A Trentini?
- You are too kind.
- I give honor where honor is due sir.
But then, don't give it to Patellli.
And deprive mademoiselle of her opera?
Other composers write operas beside Patellli.
But not by request, for example you, sir.
I have not yet been requested.
Then on behalf of Mlle. Mornay, may I ask you to write her an opera?
I would be honored.
Thank you signore.
Oh, Nicolai, Nicolai, I'm so happy.
Ellen, I'm to have an opera written specially for me by the great Trentini.
- Oh mademoiselle, how splendid.
- It isn't wonderful? An opera by Trentini.
By Trentini...
Oh Nicolai, I can never, never thank you.
You, you've been so kind, so patient, so... so wonderful, I can hardly believe it's true.
Oh, I can't believe it's really true.
It... it'll gradually penetrate.
Oh, you remember when I met you that day in New York?
How you told me if I obeyed you, you'd make me famous.
And how I laughed because I didn't believe anyone could.
Oh Nicolai, Oh, Nicolai...
How could you know then what I was going to become?
I was so plain and gawky and I know I croaked when I sang.
Marcia...
- Come here.
- Yes, Nicolai.
- Do you realize what tonight means?
- Yes, I think so.
- Means my share of the work is over.
- Oh no, Nicolai...
You've worked, you always obeyed me.
You've let nothing stand between you and your career, you deserve your success.
During all our association,
I've never once come into your private life, have I?
- No.
- I've never demanded anything of you, have I?
No, you've been very sweet Nicolai.
You've been half afraid I would, haven't you?
Now and then I've seen it in your eyes... wondering when the lightning was going to strike.
- No Nicolai.
- You were right to.
After all, I've trained other women and demanded things of them.
You knew all about it.
I owe all of my success to you, I always will.
If there, is any way I can repay you?
There is.
Poor Marcia, I'm asking a very high price.
I want to marry you.
- Oh Nicolai...
- You've only to say yes or no.
I know you don't love me, now... but I love you.
Well? Which is it?
Oh, I should be very happy to marry you.
Oh Ellen, I was worried, it's quite late.
Yes, I know. I'll be along in just a few minutes.
Ellen is right, you've 3 hours' sleep to make up young lady.
Ellen, close the curtains and don't wake mademoiselle till midday tomorrow.
- Oui monsieur...
- Oh, not as late as that.
You're singing tomorrow night.
By Jove, it's tonight now.
What sort of voice do you think you'll be in?
After the alarums and excursions of this evening.
I may not wake you till just before the performance.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Dear Nicolai.
- Oh Ellen?
- Oui mademoiselle?
Ellen, I'm going to be married.
Why, that's very nice Mlle,
I'm sure. May I congratulate you?
Thank you.
- Aren't you surprised?
- No mademoiselle, I rather expected it.
- I hope you'll be happy.
- Thank you.
It's really a tremendous compliment, isn't it?
I mean, he's such a great man.
Of course, I'm a little confused about everything.
So many things have happened at once.
Singing for an emperor and having an opera written specially for me and now this. I...
I sort of can't make anything seem real.
I'd just go to sleep and forget all about it till tomorrow, otherwise you'll be tired.
But I'm not the least bit sleepy, I...
I feel restless and, and unsettled and...
Oh I...
I want to do something to bring me back to my senses.
- Ellen...
- Oui mademoiselle?
- Give me a dress.
- Whatever for?
I'm going out for a ride, just a little ways.
I must get some fresh air to make me wake up.
- What sort of a dress?
- The brown moire.
Ah, oui, oui.
But mademoiselle, do you think monsieur Nazaroff would approve?
Oh, but he needn't know,
I only be gone a few minutes.
He'd be furious if he finds out.
- Oh, you won't tell him Ellen darling.
- What happens if he finds out for himself?
Oh mademoiselle, there's no sense in what you're doing, it's, it's silly.
Yes, I know, I know but I keep telling you, I'm only going a little way.
I only be gone 10 minutes at the most.
I simply must get away by myself Ellen, just for once in my life.
- Driver.
- Where to madame?
Just keep driving until I tell you to turn around.
- Just anywhere?
- Yes, just anywhere.
It shall be so, giddup Jemmy.
- Have you had a quarrel?
- What?
He'll have cooled down by the time you get back.
Oh yes, yes, I hope so.
- Oh driver, driver...
- Had enough?
- Yes, yes. Take me back home please.
- It shall be so.
Jemmy, Jemmy, come back.
Don't worry ma'am, don't worry, don't go away.
I'll be back in a minute.
Jemmy, come back do you.
I'm mad at you, why you do this?
Come back, I'll kill you.
Jemmy...

- No, not all at once.
Well, then I'll tell you again when I get my breath back. You're the most beautiful...
No, don't trouble. I think I can remember it.
It's no trouble. Who are you? Where you come from? Will you be in Paris long?
May I see you tomorrow?
- No.
- No.
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Why not?
I'm a prima Donna.
- And you don't like prima Donnas.
- Nonsense. Why, I adore prima Donnas.
Oh, yes?
If there's anything I like before and above everything else it's a prima Donna.
Any of these fellows will tell you.
Hey fellows, don't I adore prima Donnas?
Yes.
There, you see? Now, may I see you tomorrow?
Ecoutez mes amis, it's mademoiselle Marcia Mornay, the singer.
Yes, I saw her last night at the opera.
Marcia Mornay?
Let's have a song.
Come on, let's go have a song.
Belay, haul off, give the lady air.
Where are your manners, you blocks, you stones, you senseless idiots.
- But we want a song.
- But mademoiselle wants privacy.
Back to your old sofas and cheeses, you termites.
I saw her first.
- The thing is now become intimate.
- Thank you.
- I'm glad I have a champion.
- Mademoiselle, you have an adoring slave... a protector, a worshiper who would give his life for you.
The least you can do is to have supper with him.
No, I'm awfully ashamed but I'm afraid I'll have to refuse.
Give me one good reason why.
Well, I've just had supper.
I couldn't eat another.
I'm crushed, humiliated.
Also a little offended.
What about a small ration of bacon and two eggs? No.
About, one egg?
La belle dame sans merci.
Will you have supper with me tomorrow night then?
- I'm singing at the Opera.
- After the opera? Before the opera?
Lunch, have lunch with me.
You can't shake your head at that too.
- I can, I must...
- I see, you don't like me, eh?
Oh, but I like you very much and I like your voice too.
Oh, but really you have a wonderful voice, really but...
Well, I, I'll just be awfully busy during the rest of my stay in Paris.
I really can't see you again.
Oh, just for a few minutes,
3/4 of an hour for lunch tomorrow.
I've a real Virginia ham... if you're a true American, you can't look a gift ham in the frill.
Oh Noah, lost your ark?
- There's my cabby, I really must be going.
- I'll see you to your coach.
Oh no, please. Please, I'd rather you didn't.
You're not going mademoiselle.
We can't let her go, can we?
No, not without a song, eh?
- Then I'm never going to see you again?
- No.
Will it matter to you if I die of a broken heart?
Oh, you won't.
I'm in a terrible hurry, good night.
Thank you so much for taking such good care of me.
Come to lunch tomorrow.
- Oh, but I can't, besides I, I...
- I'm Paul Allison.
And I live on the top floor of this house.
I'll expect you for lunch tomorrow and I won't let go of your hand till you say you'll come.
Oh well, it won't do any good, quite impossible, I promise you.
- Let go of my hand please.
- Not till you promise to come to lunch.
Virginia ham, promise?
Why, I can't.
- Please let go.
- No.
Oh Mr. Allison, I may get into terrible trouble through all this.
- Not till you promise.
- Oh driver, home please.
It shall be so, Jemmy..
Really, really, this has gone far enough now.
- Let go of me, please let go.
- Not till you promise.
- Oh Mr. Allison, get off.
- I won't let go till you promise.
Let go of my hand.
Will you hurt yourself. Do be careful.
- Promise?
- Yes, yes, yes. I promise, I promise.

I ask you.
With humility and tears in my eyes, I'm asking you.
How do you expect me to train your voice when you come home at this time of the night?
- I mean, of the morning.
- Night.
Morning, the sun is already rising.
You bad boy.
You, you, you drinking in low haunts.
Making fun with strange ladies.
Will I ever put you into the opera when you play such, such shnookety gooks.
Mit your voice, eh?
I ask you, how do you expect me to do it?
- How do you expect anyone to do it?
- I don't.
There you got it, there you are putting your thumbs on it.
You, you, you ain't got ambition.
You ain't got application.
You are fooling about it, ain't it?
Honestly Paul Allison, you are breaking my heart.
- That's what I am.
- Oh, but Archipenko... guess who's coming to lunch.
Guess who? Now we're going to play games, eh?
- Marcia Mornay.
- And another thing I want to...

Oh I, I seem to have...
Well, I'll have to throw the money to you from that window up there.
- That'll be all in all ma'am.
- Thank you.
Oh Ellen...
May I ask for an explanation.
If there is one?
I'm sorry, I've been very foolish, forgive me.
- Where have you been?
- I went for a drive in a cab.
- With whom?
- With no one.
- With whom?
- I'm not lying.
That was a very sane and rational thing to do at this time of night, wasn't it?
Oh Nicolai, please try to understand.
I was excited, overexcited and happy I...
I couldn't sleep, I only intended to drive a little way so I could sort of... think things over and calm down.
And then there was an accident, the horse broke loose.
I had to wait in the cab until the driver caught him.
That's what happened, honestly.
Well, the driver's still downstairs, I didn't pay him, you can ask him if you like.
I'll go down and pay him.
- How much does mademoiselle owe you?
- 40 francs.
She, she tells me you've had an accident.
Yes, the harness broke and Jemmy ran away.
But it's always happening monsieur, think nothing of it.
I...
Never, never mind about the change.
He's coming back now.
Oh mademoiselle, I implored you not to go.
But I haven't done anything I shouldn't.
Was he very angry?
He didn't say anything, he just stood there, waiting. He never moved once.
- Forgive me.
- Oh, it was nothing.
- You had a right to be angry.
- I had no right whatever.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Hello Paul.
- Hello.
You wish you were going there tonight, don't you?
- Well, don't you?
- I am going.
- So am I.
- Got your tickets?
- Not yet.
- Oh, then you're not going.
- The house was sold out days ago.
- I'm going in the gallery.
Have you seen that line of people waiting?
It's halfway around the opera house already.
Tell me, is Mornay really as great as they say?
Oh, what a voice she has, what a voice.
There's never been anything like it.
I've got two seats in the front row.
Front row?
And what a trouble it took to get them.
Hey, waiter.
- Monsieur?
- Here.
Here they are. My friend, all the money in Paris wouldn't buy those two tickets.
You wish you'd booked early now, don't you?
- Your change monsieur.
- Oh, yes.

Oh, excuse me.
This is August Archipenko,
Mademoiselle Marcia Mornay.

- Oh mademoiselle, what an honor.
- I can only say what an honor.
- Thank you.
Archipenko is my maestro.
He try to make an opera singer out of me.
Yeah.
Professor of music... from the Weingarten University mit experience in Munich and Salzburg and proud... possessor of 7 diplomas.
- But no pupils except me.
- Yeah.
- How do you like our little suite?
- Oh, I like it.
It sort of reminds me of when I first started.
Oh, but you haven't seen it all.
Well, over here, the view from the balcony embraces the Tuileries, the Place de la Concorde, the Louvre and the backyard of the local milkman.
We see him watering the milk every morning.
- But I can't stay Mr. Allison.
- Ah, no?
I really only came because I didn't want to break my promise.
I'll have to go right along.
But I'm awfully sorry.
- Oh, but we...
- Oh, is all for me?
Yeah, we got a Virginia ham too.
- Ham?
- Yeah.
And eggs.
Eggs?
Ham and eggs.
Awfully sweet of you.
You, you couldn't just stay for 10 minutes, could you?
It wouldn't take that to have everything ready.
- Well?
- Could you?
- Just 10 minutes?
- Not another second, Archipenko.

Excuse please, I was just a little bit listening, I didn't want to disturb you...
Makes you kind of homesick, doesn't it?
Oh no, I, I don't have time to get homesick.
But you would like to go back sometime, wouldn't you?
- Oh, sometime yes.

Oh no, you mustn't, I mean... with a voice like yours, you, you really should stay here and become a great singer.
That's just, exactly, explicitly what I am always saying, aint it?
Oh, I don't want to be an opera singer.
But, don't you like to sing?
Oh, I like it all right when
I'm happy about something... or when I sang to you like I did then.
But mademoiselle, he ain't got ambition, he ain't got application.

- Anything.
Don't ask to see me again, ever.
- Oh, I won't promise that.
- Oh, but you must please.
I can't very well explain but...
I shouldn't have come here in the first place.
Then why did you?
Well, I told you I didn't want to break a promise.
- Is that all?
- Yes, yes. Oh, please try to understand.
It's been lots of fun and I've loved it but it's all over now, it's finished, bye.

Sir, kindly step aside, you are causing a disturbance.
I am going to have you discharged for this.
Come on Mimi, we find the manager.

Will you get out of my dressing room at once or must I call an attendant?
Oh, no, no, no. I'll go.
I only came to tell you that...
I think you sing more beautifully than I thought anyone ever could and to thank you.
- I told you I didn't want to see you again.

Well, now you've seen me.

Oh, don't be absurd, you know it's ridiculous.

I'll go if you come to Saint-Cloud tomorrow.
I can't, I mean, I don't want to.
Won't anything make you go?

Who is it?
Monsieur Nazaroff wishes to know if you will receive the critics in 3 minutes Mlle.
Yes, yes I will.
Now you must go. I mean it. You really must.

- Yes, yes I will.
- I'll call for you at 10 o'clock.
- Oh, for goodness sakes, don't do that.
- I'll meet you there.

- Yes, yes. Only go, go.
- Right.
Go.
If you gentlemen will excuse me for a moment.
- Oh, I beg your pardon, sorry. Excuse me.
- Not at all sir.
- I'm afraid I was in your way.
- Oh, no, it's my fault.
I'll see if mademoiselle
Mornay is ready to receive you.
Who was the visitor?
Oh, just a silly young man.
He wasn't troublesome Nicolai.
He'd been out front and wanted to see me so he could talk about it afterward.
Wasn't important, really.
The critics are outside scratching at the door, shall I let them in?
- Well I...
- Remember... these critics are the people who count in your life from now on.
They fill the orchestra seats for us, silly young men... only fill the gallery.
Yes Nicolai.
- Monsieur, are you not coming to the fair?
- Sure.
- Where's your sweetheart?
- Oh, she's coming.
Good, you can't have any fun without a sweetheart.
Thank heaven, I was afraid you weren't coming.
I know, I couldn't get away any earlier.
Ellen, take the carriage and wait over there somewhere.
Lovely.
Oh yes, but I was mad to have come.
Look... until we leave, you are going to forget who you are and... what you are and everything else except it's May day... and the sun is shining and we're going to have fun, eh?

- Do you love him?

- Do you love him?

Oh Paul, Paul, it shouldn't have happened, I shouldn't have let it happen,
But was such fun, so exciting and...
I kept hoping it would end like that and not like this.
Can you forgive me?
I find it hard not to, the way things are.
Paul, I want you to know this.
I'm not just marrying him because he's good and kind... and because he needs me.
There are stronger ties than that, you see... everything I have, everything I am, I owe to him.
Even being here today, even meeting you the other night.
He's made all those things possible for me, all of them.
When I first met him, I was nothing.
Nobody believed in me.
I'd even stopped believing in myself... and yet he gave up everything, his whole career, all his other pupils... just so he could guide me to success.
That was 4 years ago.
In all that time, he's never stopped believing in me.
In all that time, he's never once broken a promise.
Nor failed me.
That's why I can't fail him now Paul.
Even...
Even for something I want far more.
I understand.
I met you too late.
Yet something inside me won't let me believe it.
Please Paul... let's, let's just remember this day.
We will Marcia.
One day to last us all the rest of our lives.
It will, it will.
I'll always love you dear.
And I'll always... remember you... and your song.

Bye.
Goodbye.
Mr. Nazaroff, we greatly appreciate your having selected our hotel.
Not at all sir, we've always been very happy here..
- Genaro.
- Si, signore.
- Adolph.
- Ja.
See that madame's broth is prepared immediately.
I trust that this suite will prove adequate and satisfactory in every way.
- Yes, very nice.
- Madame's room is through here.
Whatever you may wish will be attended to instantly.
Thank you very much.
Gentlemen, tell, tell the press they needn't wait.
- We no interview today.
- Very well.
- Fanchon.
- Yes sir?
Where's the board of directors from the opera house?
Well sir, I had arranged with the hotel management...
I'm sorry sir, but the gentlemen haven't arrived as yet.
They were to met me here,
I'm accustomed to punctuality..
- See what's delayed them please.
- Certainly sir, at once.
- It's a very pleasant suite madame.
- Yes, they all are.
Wish we'd stay in one place long enough so we could take a house.
I'm tired of hotels.
I'd like a hot bath Ellen, you ask them if they'll arrange for one please?
Oui, oui, madame.
We'll have to leave for your official reception in an hour.
I've left word you're not to be disturbed till we go.
Thank you Nicolai.
Mary.
The gentlemen from the opera are late.
Doesn't really matter.
You don't have to see them at all, as a matter of fact, I'll attend to them.
Thank you Nicolai.
- You tired, after your voyage?
- Oh, not very.
Wish we didn't have to go to that reception though.
Oh, so do I.
Oh, by the way, you'd better wear your jewelry, they'll expect it..
All right.
- You glad to be back in America?
- Oh yes.
You don't exactly show it.
Do I have to?
When I'm not on parade?
Poor darling, you are rather tired, aren't you?
Oh, I'm sorry Nicolai.
I'm just not awfully excited about anything, that's all.
I'm sorry.
I should've remembered that, that excites you less than anything else.
Why do you say things like that, Nicolai?
I don't know.
Have no right to, have I?
After all, you've been a perfect wife.
You've been faithful and loyal, obedient and affectionate.
In the face of all that, it's unimportant, I suppose.
Never once, in all the years that we've been married... have I ever felt I completely possessed you.
You've no right to feel like that.
I know, all I regret is... it's made me love you too much.
Come in.
- The directors from the opera are here sir.
- Tell them I'll be with them immediately.
Very well.
I wouldn't worry too much about it Nicolai.
Your bath will be ready in a moment madame.
Thank you.
- Will you be seated gentlemen?
- Thank you.
Oh Mr. Nazaroff... it's a great pleasure to welcome you and madame Mornay to New York.
It's a very proud day for us sir, a very proud day.
Very generous of you to say so sir.
Now, we have here the contracts, the arrangements, and all the other formalities to be observed.
I think you'll find them quite in order.
- Traviata?
- Yes, Traviata, yes.
We sold out the opening night already and the booking for the season is exceptionally high.
Our advance publicity has been out two weeks, entire supporting cast is been contracted.
And the scenery and costumes are almost complete.
So, you see, we've not been idle Mr. Nazaroff.
No, far from it.
In fact, you've gone to enormous pains to cast, dress and advertise an opera... that madame Mornay has not the slightest intention of appearing in.
- Not Traviata?
- Not Traviata?
- But the cast is been signed.
- The scenery is cost $1,000 to date.
- Yes, and all the costumes.
- Traviata is a beautiful opera.
- We decided on it after long discussions.
- But without consulting madame Mornay.
But naturally, we took it for granted that you'd...
Which is so unwise.
What opera do you suggest then?
- Czaritza.
- Czaritza?
Czaritza.
But Czaritza has never been presented here before.
Quite, but Trentini wrote it especially for madame Mornay.
What could be more perfect for her opening in New York?
But Czaritza needs a baritone.
We have no baritone important enough to sing opposite madame Mornay.
I'm afraid that is a slight exaggeration.
We have a very efficient baritone in Paul Allison.
- Perhaps you may know him Mr. Nazaroff.
- No.
I've heard him spoken of to his credit, as a matter of fact...
Madame Mornay will be quite satisfied to have him sing with her.
But he's not well enough known to the public.
The public will be there to hear and see madame Mornay.
I'll get in touch with Paul
Allison when I leave here.
Thank you.
Then that concludes the discussion gentlemen.
- Where's madame?
- She's in the bath.
- Marcia?
- Yes?
I've arranged the details.
You open with Czaritza.
- 4 weeks rehearsal, starting this afternoon.
- Will that be time enough for them?
It'll have to be.
- Who they got for Petrov?
- Paul Allison.
Paul.
Well...
- Couldn't they get someone better known?
- Why should they?
Nothing to worry about dear, he's got a very fine voice they tell me.
I've heard of him before.
Don't want to hurry you, but we got to go straight on to rehearsal after the reception.
The hour is drawing close.
Yes, yes, yes. I'll be there.
See, half an hour late.
She think we got nothing better to do... than to kick our heels all day long in this blasted barn?
Drown all prima Donnas, I say.
If I were president, that's what I'd do.
I'd drown all prima Donnas and replace them with the choir boys, they're punctual.
- You called the rehearsal for 1:30.
- Well?
- It's just 1:30.
- 2 o'clock.
Well, what I said about drowning all prima Donnas still holds good.
Permit me madame Mornay, May I present Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Abrams.
- How do you do?
- You gentlemen of course know Mr. Nazaroff.
It's a great honor madame, a great honor.
Very great honor, yes.
- Now, if you are ready for rehearsal madame.
- Oh, quite.
Permit me to introduce our stage director.
Madame Mornay, Mr. Rudyard.
- How do you do?
- I am honored madame, deeply honored.
- This is Mr. Nazaroff.
- Your servant sir.
- Our conductor, signore Pugliemi.
- How do you do?
Signore.
And now madame, Mr. O'Brien, may I present the cast to you?
Of course.
This is Mr. Paul Allison, our baritone.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
It's an honor madame, to sing with you.
Thank you...
Very much.
Mr. Nazaroff, Mr. Allison.
- How do you do sir?
- How do you do?
And this is our basso, Mr. Dubrovsky.
- Enchante madame.
- Merci bien, monsieur.
- Excuse me Archipenko.
- Mr. Archipenko to you, if you please.
Hello. Hello. Good afternoon, good afternoon.
My dear Paul, I'm awfully sorry I'm a little late.
How do you do?
Oh, madame, how wonderful to see you again.
You know, all these years I have been saying little prayers for you... because on account of you giving Paul the incentive, the ambition, the application.
You remember that day Paris...
When I was a student in Paris several years ago... madame was kind enough to encourage me with my career.
That's the truth, from that day on, he began to work.
Mr. Rudyard, will you begin rehearsal please?
Oh yes, yes, of course.
- If you please Mr. Archipenko.
- Excuse me.
If you please.
Places.
On account of the chorus, we'll begin with the last act.
- Madame Mornay, you are familiar with yours.
- Yes sir.
Personally Mr. Nazaroff, I'm delighted you insisted on Czaritza instead of Traviata.
You know, it's just the chance young Allison has been waiting for.
Yes, I'm sure it is.
If you please.

Good boy, good boy.
You've never had such a reception madame.
It was wonderful, I heard the director saying it's the greatest success they've ever had.
Ellen...
I'd like you to take a message to Mr. Allison for me.
Tell him...
Tell him not to do anything until I see him tomorrow morning, I'll come to his flat.
Well, go on. Go, hurry, hurry.
Madame will see no one.
Postpone our press reception till sometime tomorrow.
Yes sir.
Tonight you surpassed even yourself.
They're referring to it... as a living emotion.
Whatever it was... it was extremely effective.
Thank you.
Was a great deal that you never thought important enough to tell me, wasn't there?
Very little.
Very little?
Yet it stood between us for 7 years.
And I brought you two together again.
It has its humor, hasn't it?
Or doesn't it strike you as being particularly humorous?
Nicolai, I'm very tired and confused.
Will you wait till we get back to the hotel? We can discuss it then.
Very well.
Thank you.
Oh madame, you were glorious, glorious.
- Wonderful, simply wonderful.
- Thank you.
We're having a little reception at Delmonico's and...
- I wondered if madame isn't too tired...
- Most charming of you sir.
As a matter of fact, madame is exhausted.
I'm taking her directly back to the hotel.
- I'm very sorry Mr. O'Brien.
- Oh, please, please. I quite understand.
- Some other evening then, perhaps.
- Yes, thank you.
Mr. Allison... permit me to thank you for a most magnificent performance.
We are deeply indebted to you for your indispensable cooperation.
- It's for me to thank you sir.
- Not at all sir, not at all.
Good night.
- Good night madame.
- Good night sir.
Good night.
Supper is ready sir.
Now...
Suppose we find out exactly how we stand?
Nothing could've stopped this happening Nicolai.
I never realized what a terrible mistake I made when I left him.
I, I thought then that
I had to keep my promise to you... after all you'd done for me, I tried to forget him.
I tried to put him out of my mind but I was never able to.
And now tonight, I, I realize that...
I love you more than anything else in life.
But I can't go on living without him.
- So you wish to be set free, is that it?
- Oh Nicolai, yes.
Yes Nicolai.
Nicolai...
Very well, if that's what you really want...
I won't stand in your way.
Good night.
It's very late and you're tired.
It's time you were asleep madame.
It couldn't have happened any other way.
You've nothing to reproach yourself with.
Now go to bed madame.
I'll stay with you until you fall asleep.
- What's that?
- Just a door banging.
When things happen you never thought could happen... something inside won't let you believe it.
You...
You'd have to keep on repeating to yourself it's true.
A door banging? Well, who...
Nicolai? Nicolai?
- Ellen, Ellen, Ellen...
- Yes, madame?
Get me a cloak quickly.
I'm glad you've come here.
I suggest we get this over as reasonably as possible.
We will.
I'm giving Marcia her freedom.
And you yours...
Mr. Allison.
What have you...
Paul, Paul...
Paul, no...
No.
Paul, Oh...
No...
That day...
Did last me... all my life.
Don't cry, Marcia...
You won't be lonely.
I'll be close.
Always...
Paul...
Oh, Paul...
So that's why I live here alone.
Where nobody knows me, except Ellen.
Poor Miss Morrison.
Marcia.
I only told you to help you decide about Kip.
I found Paul too late.
But you and Kip have the whole world ahead of you...
- If you want to take it.
- Oh, I do.
I've been such a fool about Kip.
Thank you so much.
And I'm going to come see you much more often.
Then you won't be so lonely.
That's very sweet of you.
Oh, there's Kip now.
Thank you for helping me.
I'll never forget it, never.
- Hello Kip.
- Hello.
- Came by to apologize.
- I'm sorry too.
I've been... thinking things over.
Well, I haven't any right to stand in your way like that.
Oh Kip...
I, I came by to wish you luck in New York.
Thank you.
I'm not going.
- Not going?
- No.
Oh, gee.
Gee, that's swell.
Well...
It's time you came in, it's turning a little chilly and you let your tea get all cold.
I'll only be a moment or two.
Yes, yes. I'll make you some fresh tea.

Go on, take a card, any card at all.
Now look at it.
Put it back.
Ace of spades.
- When did you change the act, Pop?
- I didn't. He did.
He did?
Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned.
Wait a minute, take a bow.
No, you take it. I got to get married.
Come here, they're applauding you.
They like it.
Lucky.
Now what?
- I want to reason with you, if I can.
- But you already did.
Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know?
It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it?
I hate to see you leave show business.
A man with your talents...
My talent is gambling, Pop.
Hoofing is all right, but there's no future in it.
I want to spread out.
I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky.
I know I'm going to miss you, Pop.
Is he staying with us, Pop?
No, he's made up his mind to get married.
How do you like that?
Letting his marriage interfere with our career?
We shouldn't have played his hometown.
It was a bad move.
Bad for us and bad for him.
Local boy makes bad.
- Father, has he come yet?
- No, and it's all very much as I expected.
Hi, fellows.
- How do I look?
- Marvelous, colossal, splendid.
Wait a minute. You're not going like that.
Of course. Big church wedding, girl's family very social... whole town there.
I guess it doesn't really matter, just a hick town.
What doesn't matter?
- Last year's trousers.
- Last year's trousers?
No cuffs.
- No cuffs?
- No cuffs.
Whoever heard of cuffs on these?
Are you serious?
Don't be ridiculous.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- Wait a minute. Let's see that.
- What do you think of that?
- You know, you're in a hurry and...
Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone.
Just a minute. I'll answer it for you.
It will only take about five minutes.
Let us have your pants.
- Hello.
- Hello, John. Will you hurry?
Tell him the minister is here.
Margaret's been ready for an hour.
We're all waiting for him.
All right, I'll tell him.
- Who was it?
- It was the minister.
He said to take it easy.
He'll be about a half-hour late.
- Good.
- You see, there's plenty of material.
- I'll take them down and have them fixed.
- No, you don't.
Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes.
- You want two cuffs on them?
- Yeah, one on each leg.
And hurry up. Tell him
I got to have them back right away.
While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport.
I'll get seven.
- The next man.
- That's it.
- Any word?
- They say he'll be here any minute.
You know, I told Margaret this would happen.
I always say, marry in haste, repent at leisure.
The young man is now one hour and 25 minutes late.
That isn't exactly marrying in haste.
As long as I am living, and longer...
I have never seen cuffs on pants like these.
What's the matter, can't you make them?
I can make anything... but I would rather not be wrong than right.
I'm paying for cuffs and I want cuffs.
No. 10 times...
20 times, no.
Can't you understand?
Look, here, let me show you.
Do you see any cuffs there? Not one cuff.
Thousands of no cuffs.
Here, look these over. You see? No cuffs.
Millions of no cuffs.
No cuffs.
More than that, positively not one cuff.
Why not?
- I want to speak to Mr. Garnett.
- Speaking.
- Here he is, sir.
- Let me talk to him.
Say, listen, you, the guests are all going home and...
I'm the happiest man in the world because the wedding is off.
And furthermore, if you ever come to this house again...
I'll break every bone in your body.
Do you understand that?
- Red, is that call for me?
- No, it's my dame.
Okay, sweetheart, and a great big juicy kiss for you.
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my dough back.
- Give us a roll.
- Here it comes...
You ought to marry those dice.
Marry? Holy cats! What time is it?
- Pop, my pants!
- You've got them on.
Oh, yeah.
Wait a minute!
You're not going with all our dough.
I got to get married.
I'll bet you the bankroll you don't get married.
That's a bet.
No cuffs.
The tailor says those kind of pants shouldn't have cuffs.
What?
Nice fellows!
Hello.
Where's everybody?
Why, the guests have all gone, sir.
Did you wish to be announced?
Just let me get my hands on that young man and I'll strangle him!
You leave him to me. I'll take care of him.
No, maybe I'd better surprise them.
He can't do a thing like this to a daughter of mine.
This is my affair, you keep out of it.
I'm your father and I'll settle this as I see fit.
We'll be the laughingstock of this whole town!
So...
Here I am.
Young man, why didn't you appear for your wedding?
I thought you'd ask me that.
Don't stand there like a statue.
You said you were gonna do something.
Well, do it.
What are you gonna do?
Don't you dare touch him.
- Why don't you do something?
- I will.
I will, but...
Pardon me, I think I'm in the way.
- Perhaps you two would like to be alone.
- You stay right where you are.
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- I had a feeling you weren't.
I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000.
- How about twenty?
- Not for $20,000.
- Twenty-five.
- Not for...
Say, young man, where could you get $25,000?
By dancing?
And there's another thing... coming back to your own hometown in a dancing act.
I'm going into a new business.
Only this afternoon I made $200.
Yes, that's why I was late for the wedding.
That makes it a little different.
I'm not consenting to your wedding... but I always admire any young man that can make money.
It shows character.
- That's too kind of you, sir.
- Not at all.
Then Margaret and I can get married?
If you go to New York and work hard at your business... and if you are successful... you can come back here and ask me for my Margaret.
Oh, Daddy.
And in all probability
I'll be very happy to give her to you.
Right, sir. Thank you, sir.
John, dear.
You'll come back soon, won't you?
That all depends upon the stakes, the stocks...
Goodbye, my son.
Thank you, father-in-law.
I'll say goodbye again because we'll both be waiting for you.
Hurry back, dear.
I feel that I'm a little to blame in this.
You know, I didn't realize what a bright, upstanding young man you were.
And I don't care how big the city,
I feel confident... you're going to be successful.
Thank you, sir.
Lucky, couldn't I go with you?
I'm afraid you'd try to be a good influence on me.
No, honest I wouldn't.
I'm terrible bad when you get to know me.
Then I wouldn't want you to come with me.
One to New York, please.
- Whose money are you using?
- Yours, thank you very much.
But our money belongs to us again.
What's the idea?
Remember our bet?
You see, you didn't get married.
- I'll pay you later.
- No.
All aboard!
- But I've got to get that train.
- You mean you had to get it.
You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter.
I'll flip you for a ticket to New York.
I don't want to go to New York.
He doesn't want to go to New York.
Goodbye, Lucky, old boy. So long.
- Goodbye, Lucky.
- See you later.
Give my regards to the folks, will you?
Say hello to Aunt Lucy.
So long. Goodbye, Lucky.
Lucky, here's your suitcase.
Here's your toothbrush.
Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke.
- Well, take the quarter.
- No, sir, not the lucky one.
Wait a minute. I'll get a smoke.
I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please?
Thank you.
How careless of me.
I left my cigarettes at home.
Then you won't need the matches.
I'm afraid that won't work, unless you have a needle and thread.
Excuse me, have you change for a quarter?
Thank you very much.
You shouldn't have done that just for me.
I could've gotten along without them.
- You hold it.
- All right.
Looks like a jackpot.
Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick.
I beg your pardon.
You probably think I'm silly.
Yes, I'm afraid I do.
Just a moment. That quarter,
I wonder if I could have it back?
This isn't getting you anywhere.
You don't understand.
I'm not trying to get acquainted.
All I want to know is...
It's all my fault, too.
I'm awfully sorry.
Yes, I know.
You've been trying so hard to avoid me.
All right, give it back.
- Give what back?
- The quarter you stole from my purse.
Come on, will you?
Hand it over or I'll call a policeman.
I haven't got it.
I gave it to you at the cigarette machine.
- Officer.
- Come on. Let's go, will you?
No, wait a minute.
What seems to be the trouble?
Good morning, sir.
Officer, this man stole a quarter from my purse. Make him give it back.
Now, miss, does he look like a man who would steal quarters?
- That's just what I said to the lady.
- Imagine...
I don't care what you think he looks like.
I know he stole my quarter.
Now you run along, sister... before I run you in for disturbing the peace.
But, Officer, he took my...
That'll be enough.
Run along now, you're obstructing traffic.
Why, you Cossack.
Officer, you had no right to speak to that little girl that way.
I suppose you're going to tell me what my duty is.
Not at all, but...
Listen, guys like you pay me to protect them from screwy dames.
That's fine, but in this instance
I'm sure you were wrong.
So now I'm wrong.
You ought to thank me for what I've done.
- All right, thank you.
- All right.
What did you say?
I said, look out for the great big ditch.
Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it?
In front of the cop?
I would've been accused of stealing it.
Give me that.
Wait for me.
Miss Carrol!
Hello, kids.
No wonder this school is losing money.
Everybody late every morning.
Any more dilly-dallying and some of you will lose your jobs.
Yes, and that goes for you girls, too.
Anybody would think
I had nothing else to do, but nothing.
One would.
Miss Anderson, good morning.
If you're late again, you'll be fired, too.
That's final. I have nothing more to say.
That's good.
- Is that you, Mabel?
- I don't know. Tell me, is it?
- Kind of sounds like you.
- That's a load off my mind.
I'm never sure these days.
- Did you see a young...
- Visitors make the pupils self-conscious.
Would you mind waiting a second, please?
Thank you very much.
Miss Anderson, come quickly.
Please.
He's hissing at me again, the swan.
And good morning to you, too.
- Are you interested in the dance?
- I came here to see if I...
All the world loves a dancer.
To know how to dance...
Is to know how to control oneself.
Thanks. You saved me a lot of breath.
Our course is $45.
But the first lesson is given free... to see if the prospective student has any real aptitude.
That's why our school is so successful.
We never refuse the $45.
- I mean...
- You never let a pupil get away.
I understand.
We don't fool anybody.
Have you any preference as to the type of instructress you'd like?
Yes, I have.
I'd like one that comes to about here.
And if she had red hair, that would be a great help.
And a cute little nose.
She might be able to teach you to move your feet.
Miss Anderson, my dear. Good morning.
Me, too.
- Mr. Gordon, this is Mr...
- Garnett.
How do you do, Mr. Garnett?
I'm delighted, I assure you.
- The young man would like a trial lesson.
- Of course.
I think Miss Carrol might please him.
Of course, Miss Carrol.
Come this way, will you?
She's one of our best instructresses.
You're a very fortunate young man to learn to dance...
- to move...
- To flirt with Terpsichore.
Yes. What?
How do you do?
Do you mind if I wait here?
- No, help yourself.
- Thanks.
I mean to the chair.
Miss Carrol, this is Mr. Garnett.
This is Miss Penelope Carrol.
We're all so fond of her here, we just call her Penny.
Penny, dear.
- This is Mr. Garnett.
- Penny.
Miss Carrol.
Mr. Garnett is very anxious to learn how to dance.
So you won't always be stepping on other people's toes.
- That's very good, isn't it?
- Yes, that's very good.
What kind of dancing would you like to learn?
What kind have you got?
- Sap.
- Sap dancing?
- No, she means tap dancing.
- Tap dancing, of course.
You see, we have tap dancing... and ballroom dancing and aesthetic dancing.
If it's all the same to you,
I'll take a little of each.
A little of each, yes.
Miss Carrol wants to know what kind you'd like to learn first?
Whichever takes the longest.
Go on, begin the lesson.
You must learn to walk first.
Now start with your right foot, please.
- No, your right foot.
- Sorry, I'm left-handed.
Right, left.
Miss Carrol, I'm sorry about your quarter.
But you see, Penny...
If you're trying to annoy me, you're succeeding.
I know you don't care about dancing.
But I do. All the world loves a dancer.
Don't you?
Right, left.
- This is fun.
- Now you turn.
Start again. Right, left.
If you don't get out of here,
I'm going to lose my temper.
If you talk like that, I'll call a policeman.
- Why, you...
- Officer...
"Our young ladies are sweet-tempered, patient and understanding. "
You're doing splendidly.
I don't think you need me here any longer.
I know I'm leaving you in good hands.
Lovely hands.
You know, that's the most marvelous trick
I've ever seen a magician do.
You mean the one with the four aces?
No, the way you made my club sandwich disappear.
Who, me?
My dear young lady...
You'd better take a club sandwich out of this hat.
Are you accusing me of eating your sandwich?
You might begin by taking that piece of lettuce off your necktie.
One, two, three. Turn.
Let's try it again from the beginning.
One, two, three. Turn.
- I'm getting it, aren't I?
- Yes.
Again.
One, two, three. Turn.
Now you've got it.
I can't teach you anything.
All right, I'll show you again.
Remember, three steps to the left... three steps to the right and turn.
One, two, three.
Listen, no one could teach you to dance in a million years.
- Take my advice and save your money.
- Miss Carrol.
How do you think this school can exist if you turn away applicants?
- You're discharged.
- But, Mr...
Get your things and go.
- But I...
- Get out.
That's quite all right, don't you worry.
I'll find you another instructress.
You stay right there.
So this is the way you treat your customers?
I certainly don't treat them to sandwiches.
Get out of here.
Miss Anderson, what is the meaning of this?
What's gotten into everybody this morning?
My sandwich got into him.
You're fired.
Okay, swivel puss.
It might interest you to know that I've also discharged Miss Carrol.
You've discharged Penny? Why?
Why, for no reason at all. Please see her.
But she said she couldn't teach you anything.
She was trying to flatter me.
She's the most wonderful little teacher I've ever heard of.
Miss Carrol, I want to show Mr. Gordon how much you just taught me.
No, never mind.
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this.
It's an interesting experiment.
How did you say that last step went?
Shall we try it right through?
Won't you sit down, Mr. Gordon?
Wait!
Sheer heaven, my dears, sheer heaven!
- Is she still fired?
- Fired?
You took me too seriously, both of you.
Just you wait there for one moment.
Hey, he got her job back for her.
Wasn't that swell?
What one man can do, another man can.
All right, Al. Thank you.
Now listen, I've just made an appointment for you for a tryout... with Mr. Simpson, the owner of the Silver Sandal.
The Silver Sandal!
That's wonderful, isn't it?
It certainly is.
Penny, you wear your white lamé gown.
That's how I see you. You in white, and Mr. Garnett here in dinner clothes.
- Dinner clothes?
- Yes, certainly.
You'll do it? You'll be there?
Now do you think I could disappoint you?
I'll be there.
You are still fired!
Pop, you can pay the cab.
- Have you got change for $10?
- I have.
Thanks.
Here you are, buddy. You keep that.
Now I don't want you to worry about losing your job.
I'll take care of you.
Yes, but I'll take care of my own $10.
Wouldn't you like to double it?
Sure, I love to gamble if I'm sure I'm going to win.
- The trouble is, you lose sometimes.
- No. We always win.
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
That's fine then.
I'll telephone you when I'm ready.
- All right.
- Where do you live?
- Right here.
- Since when?
Since from now on.
How am I going to get a dinner jacket for tonight?
Don't worry about that.
Look, I borrowed this from Mabel.
You're marvelous.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I want to get suite for myself and Mr. Cardetti, please.
- Something at about...
- Just about...
Yes, that's about enough.
Doctor, would you mind rushing down to the docks... to see if our trunks have passed through the customs yet?
Just a moment.
You may need my verification.
- What size chest?
- Chest?
You mean that little chest.
The one in the hold?
Yeah.
- That chest is 36 inches.
How long do you intend to stay with us?
That'll be entirely up to you.
Did you get a dinner jacket?
No, I went broke trying to win enough to buy you one.
- What am I going to do?
- Now don't worry.
I got you the swellest looking outfit you ever saw in your life.
Where is it?
It looks like a perfect 36.
I want you to meet my old friend, Eric...
What's your name again?
My name is Eric Lacanistram.
I met Eric in the gambling house.
He lost all his money, too.
I lost all my money, too.
- Eric just loves to gamble.
- Really?
It's in the Lacanistrams' blood.
Yeah, he'll play you for his necktie or his shirt or anything he's got on.
Well, I'll toss you for the whole outfit.
No, I'm off pitch and toss.
The Lacanistrams' game is piquet.
Has been for years and years and years... before the conquest and then after the conquest... for years and years and years.
In fact, we've been playing piquet for years... and years...
- But I don't know piquet.
- Don't worry, I do.
Yes, Al. All right, goodbye.
If we're not at the Silver Sandal in 10 minutes, the tryout's off.
But 20 minutes ago,
Lucky said he'd be here in five minutes.
He's said that for the past hour.
I'm gonna go get him.
I wish you would. I feel like a fool.
But you are.
Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six and twenty-seven.
And that's piquet, Mr. Garnett.
Pop, you certainly did show me how to play piquet.
You're doing fine.
Fine? This fellow will have my skin in a minute.
Come in.
Penny!
Listen, Penny. Look, Penny.
Listen, let me explain.
The clothes that I had before...
When you're talking to a lady, you should take your hat off.
Your petticoat's showing.
Keep up the good work, boys.
The public is with you.
Mabel, will you get down from there and stop being ridiculous?
Maybe you're the one that's being ridiculous.
For a whole week you've been sulking at him for something that wasn't his fault.
I suppose it was my fault.
It's your fault that you're missing the tryout that Lucky arranged tonight.
He's only doing it for you.
You're not so smart, letting your stubbornness... interfere with the very thing you want.
I like being stubborn where he's concerned.
It must be love.
How could I fall in love with a common gambler?
When a man takes a little quarter... and builds it into a bankroll that would choke a horse... and makes my little $10 grow into hundreds...
I'd call him an uncommon gambler.
Come in, comrade.
You, outside.
My card.
You're a big success.
She's willing to arbitrate.
I told you it would work.
Mabel, will you tell that fellow to get out of the hall and stop annoying me?
No, you sit down.
You just hold your ground.
Yes?
Hello.
- Penny.
- You'd better get out of here.
All right, I will.
However, before I go, I want to tell you that maybe I was wrong the other night.
But I didn't know it at the time.
- So now you know.
- Yes, I do.
Goodbye.
Wait a minute.
Maybe, in a way, I might have been wrong.
No, this one is on me.
Listen, Lucky Garnett, there's no use arguing.
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
All right, goodbye.
Lucky, wait a minute.
This concludes the Ricardo Romero
Romantic Melody Hour.
You know, I don't like that fellow.
- He's very nice.
- That?
You have no reason to dislike him.
You don't even know him.
It's true, but when I dislike someone for no reason...
I always find it more enjoyable.
As a matter of fact, he's asked me to marry him several times.
Of course you laughed.
Or does he make you lose your sense of humor?
- Ricardo.
- Hello.
I want you to meet Mr. Garnett.
He's going to dance with me tonight.
How do you do? I played that last number especially for you.
Thank you.
Now I know him and I still don't like him.
Beautiful, isn't it?
- What is?
- The music.
What music?
- The music they're playing.
- Yes.
What made you think of it?
- Think of what?
- The music.
I don't know.
My mind was wandering, I guess.
You as scared as I am?
Don't be nervous. It's only a dance.
It's nothing to worry about.
That's right. Don't worry at all, my dear... because you're not going to dance.
Because there isn't going to be any music.
But, Ricky, you promised.
I promised you could dance anytime you want, alone.
I'll dance with Lucky or not at all.
That's what I said, too, not at all.
Good night.
Come on, we'll see about that.
- Mr. Simpson?
- Hello, Garnett.
Will you please tell Romero that he has to play for our dance?
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Romero's played his last tune for me.
- But you said that...
- I know I did.
But I lost his contract last night playing cards.
He's now the property of Dice Raymond.
Orchestras usually play for somebody.
This is the first I've heard of anybody playing for an orchestra.
- I guess there's nothing we can do.
- Wait a minute.
Do you think we could interest Raymond in another game for that contract?
I doubt it.
He's always wanted Romero's band for his club... but he's a gambler.
Where is this Raymond's place?
Thirty-sixth floor, Club Raymond.
Thirty-six.
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hello, Ricardo. Looks like a big night.
Because where Ricardo Romero goes, the others come.
Here goes everything on the red.
Will you excuse me for a second?
I think I need a bit of fresh air.
- I can't stand the strain.
- Wait a second.
Twenty-seven, red, and third dozen.
This is no strain.
Please, don't be angry.
I want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm awfully sorry if I hurt you... but I didn't want to see anyone else dance with you.
It makes me jealous.
Jealous?
Because...
I love you.
You have a very funny way of showing it.
On the red.
I want you to look at this new fellow.
He's taking me, and fast.
Say, if that hits for you, you'll have just exactly enough.
Enough for what?
Why, enough to go back and marry Margaret.
What? Wait a minute. No bet.
Seven. The red wins, and the first dozen.
Pop, you're a pal.
In fact, you're more than a pal... you're a partner. I'm going to cash in.
So you won enough, you're going to leave us.
Yes, winning more money doesn't interest me.
Boy, you like to gamble.
I'll cut you once, double or nothing.
- No, thanks.
- Scared?
You have a contract with Romero, haven't you?
I'll tell you what I will do.
All my winnings against his contract.
No, I win the orchestra...
I keep the orchestra.
Scared?
You're on. I'll high-card you.
Tony, bring a fresh deck.
Keeps them on the ice.
You're covered.
Shuffle.
- Cut.
- After you.
King of spades.
Wait a minute.
Let me, will you?
Sure, let the old boy cut.
Ace of spades.
Excuse me, boys,
I got to go and get a double sundae.
Maybe we play for this orchestra again someday.
Thank you, Mr. Raymond.
Pop, cash in for me, will you?
Okay, give us dough for these, will you?
Maybe we can have that dance after all.
- How?
- Look, I just won Romero's contract.
- That's a nice orchestra you have there.
- Just about the best.
- The leader's the same as the orchestra.
- It's awfully nice of you to say that.
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to play something for us...
- if you don't mind.
- But I do.
I'm afraid you'll have to because, you see,
I now own you.
What do you mean, you own me?
He just won you at the gambling tables.
I see.
Congratulations on winning such a valuable piece of property.
Thank you.
Now will you play your waltz for us?
No. If you read the contract carefully... you will see I don't have to play after this hour unless I want to.
So you won't play?
You're right. I won't play for you.
I see.
That's all, boys.
Ladies and gentlemen, my favorite maestro, Ricardo Romero...
has very kindly requested that Ms. Carrol and I dance to his newest composition...
the lovely Waltz in Swing Time.
- Wait a minute. I didn't say...
- Look, he wants to be coaxed.
What's the matter, Ricky, old boy, you bashful?
My pal.
This is the moment I've been waiting for.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- I'm going to get Pop.
I'll get him. I mean, I'll do it for you.
Sit still.
What's the matter with Lucky?
He seems to have something on his mind.
You mean something else besides you?
I don't know. I only get to see him at the rehearsals or with you and Pop... or when somebody else is around.
Don't worry, darling. I'm going to see that you get a break this afternoon.
Say, whose idea was this, anyway?
Going to the country on a day like this.
It was Mabel's, but she's made it mine.
Listen, you got to do me a favor.
No matter where we go or what we do, don't leave me alone with Penny.
What's the matter, ain't you in love with her?
You wouldn't pin me down with a question like that, would you?
I see. Why, that's fine.
Why don't you tell her?
She's too sweet a kid, and besides that...
I can't go on like this without her knowing something about Margaret... and I haven't got the nerve to come out and tell her, that's all.
You don't have to go back to Margaret unless you get $25,000.
Yeah, I know.
So you haven't got it.
So you don't have to go back.
Yes, but it's more than money.
I'm in a fine spot.
- I'm going to take care of this.
- Pop, no.
- You better lay off gambling for a while.
- But I don't want to lay off.
- Hello, Lucky.
- Hello, Mr. Simpson.
I was looking for you.
Have you seen the improvements?
The decorators are working day and night, and when we're through... the Silver Sandal should be the finest place in town.
And with you and Penny dancing to Romero's music... we're going to clean up.
Yes, but I'm not sure I can stick around.
Yes, you can.
But you must. Look, if you're not satisfied with the terms...
I'll make you a half partner.
I'll give you 50%. That should make you about $30,000 for the season.
My advice is to take 25% and be on the safe side.
Let me see.
25%, that would give me $15,000.
You're right. Not over 25%.
- Is it a deal?
- Sure.
Right.
Remember what I told you about not leaving me alone with, you know...
Would you say he was crazy, or am I?
I wouldn't say.
What's the name of this place we're going to?
The New Amsterdam.
I used to go there in summer as a kid.
You know, before the war.
Which war?
If this is the New Amsterdam,
I'd hate to see the old one.
I hope there are no wild animals around here.
I'm cold.
I think maybe... we ought to go home now.
No.
Edwin, you come with me.
I wanna show you where we fished through the ice.
I thought you said you only came here in the summertime.
Well, I'll show you where we didn't use to fish through the ice.
I think they want to be alone.
I don't know what for.
It's lovely, isn't it?
Come on in.
It's a bit drafty, don't you think?
Well, we seem to be here, don't we?
Let's sit down.
- Won't you be too cold?
- No.
I like being off alone like this.
You're not alone, you're with me.
Then I like being off alone with you.
I am a little cold.
Flap your arms.
That'll restore circulation. Look.
Makes me feel warmer already.
I doubt it.
Come on, try it.
It's good for you, you see?
You know, if some people saw us like this, they might think that we were... that we liked each other.
Yes, they might.
It's funny how we met, and all that's happened to us since.
The way we've been sort of thrown together and everything.
As if it were all meant to happen.
It's quite an experience.
It's more than an experience.
It's sort of like... a romance, isn't it?
Yes, as we say in French, la belle romance.
A swell romance.
You know, you ought to be wearing galoshes.
I think we'd better go home.
You're not really angry?
No, disappointed.
Don't be that way. You're too nice.
- You're nice, too, sometimes.
- Only sometimes?
There are times when I can't make you out.
When you're so aloof.
So I'm aloof, am I?
Come on and play.
He wants to play.
I see.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
I'm the one that got the snow in the face.
You know something, snow tastes just as bad as water.
Will you please try to square me with Mabel?
- What about?
- About making Lucky stop gambling.
She's sore at me.
All right, I'll try and fix it.
You see, she doesn't understand the real reason.
Now you try to explain to her... that if Lucky gets $25,000 ahead... he has to go back and marry that girl.
What girl?
- The girl he's engaged to. You see he...
- Pop.
Look, I've decided to throw all restraint aside.
Don't bother me anymore.
Now, where were we when Pop interrupted us?
As I remember it, you had just called me aloof.
No, it was a laugh.
Seems to me I was just going to do something about it, too. Yes, I know.
This is Ricardo Romero bringing you lovely music...
from the starlit heavens of the new Silver Sandal cafe...
on the gala night of our grand reopening.
Everybody's here.
- My, it certainly is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.
You know, Edwin, we mustn't let these kids break up.
Their future depends on it, and so does mine.
And once we O'Neils have tasted diamonds and furs, we never forget it.
I can't get over Lucky giving me this bracelet.
Imagine me with a real diamond bracelet.
You know, Pop...
Well, the old slitch.
Now listen, girlie, don't worry about me.
You know, I often talk to myself.
You see, I'm my own grandmother, and I have to keep the old girl interested.
It's very lovely, Ricardo.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't.
- Please. It would make me so happy.
- Hello.
I was just asking Penny how can I keep my mind on the music... if she dresses like that.
You'll just have to get used to it.
That's part of my plan.
You know, sometimes I should be left alone.
Always.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Where's Lucky?
How should I know?
- He doesn't interest you?
- No, he doesn't.
Hardly at all.
I suppose it doesn't interest you that he was supposed to marry that girl... as soon as he got $25,000.
Well, why doesn't he go back?
Because he doesn't want to, and you know it. He's given up gambling.
Certainly looks as if he's trying hard to go back to her, doesn't it?
What am I supposed to do?
Why don't you go up and give him a great big kiss?
Don't be silly. I wouldn't do that... even if I wanted to.
You mean you haven't got the nerve.
- I've got nerve.
- But not enough.
Yes, I have.
Not enough for that.
I've got enough nerve to do anything.
You know...
- I think you have.
- I know I have.
Well, why don't you go ahead and do it?
You do and I'll stand on my head.
All right...
I will.
Come in.
How do you like my dress?
Why, it's nice.
You like it?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Wait a minute.
I think it's wonderful.
The skirt's nice...
- and the sleeves are nice.
- It's a cape.
The cape is nice... the back is nice... your hair is nice... and you...
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Lucky, you're on next.
- Am I?
- It's nice.
- You like it?
- I certainly do.
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Bojangles of Harlem
I beg your pardon, have you seen Mr. John Garnett?
You mean Lucky?
I mean John.
No, I haven't. Either one of them.
Hello, fellows.
You don't want to...
No.
Clever?
Well, sit down.
- Have a drink. Make yourself comfortable.
- Enjoy yourself.
- So you do card tricks?
- Sure, that's my specialty.
I used to make my living doing this stuff.
Lucky.
John?
- I don't know where he is.
- I'll just wait for him.
All right, just make yourself comfortable.
There she is.
- I don't know where it is, do I?
- No, you could not.
Can that boy shuffle.
Ace of spades.
Outside, sister. Come on.
Well, thanks, fellows.
Where's Penny?
I've got to see her right away.
- In her room.
- You're staying here.
Perhaps I won't.
What's on your mind, Dice?
I come to play you for the orchestra again.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
When we high-carded,
I thought the game was on the level.
It was.
What about this guy? Seems like he knows a good deal about handling cards.
Now listen, Dice, that game was on the level.
No, it wasn't, Lucky.
He pulled a cold deck on you, and I palmed the ace of spades on him.
It was a nice friendly little game, wasn't it?
Okay, Dice.
- We'll use my deck.
- And I'll shuffle.
Lucky, don't be a sucker.
Ten of diamonds.
King of clubs.
Okay. Simpson, give him the contract.
Come over anytime and listen to Romero, free.
John, where have you been?
I've been looking for you.
I wanted to tell you how wonderful you were.
I'm glad you liked it.
Thanks, Margaret. I'm glad to see you.
Lucky, we'd better get ready if we're going to do the dance.
There isn't going to be any dance.
There isn't going to be any dance?
Lucky lost the orchestra back to Raymond.
We're finished.
Lost the orchestra?
But you said you weren't going to gamble anymore.
You promised.
What did you let him do it for?
You told me he wouldn't gamble anymore...
- because he'd have to go back and marry...
- Penny, please.
- This is Ms. Watson, my fiancée.
- How do you do?
Hello.
Why don't you laugh? It's all so very funny.
I don't see anything funny.
I do.
- John, dear, I...
- Margaret, look...
I've got so many things to straighten out.
Do you mind if I call you at your hotel tomorrow?
Why, no, of course not.
Good night.
Please don't feel bad.
You've still got me.
Of course, I ain't a young and pretty girl.
I ain't even a girl, but I'll stick.
I'll never leave you.
Hello.
You can be the first one to congratulate us.
I'd like to talk to Penny, please.
All right, if you want to, but it won't do you any good.
Ricky, please.
All right, I'll be waiting for you in the car.
Yes?
I'm sorry, Penny.
I'm sorry, too.
- I've been trying to figure this thing out...
- It's all decided now.
For always?
Yes.
I'm going to marry Ricky when he takes the band to Bermuda in the spring.
I'm sorry I lost my temper a while ago.
- You had every right to.
- No, I hadn't. No right at all.
I thought you had.
Goodbye.
Never mind.
I just want to wish you good luck... and all that.
And all what?
Whatever you want.
Does she dance very beautifully?
Who?
The girl you're in love with.
Yes. Very.
The girl you're engaged to.
The girl you're going to marry.
I don't know.
I've danced with you.
I'm never going to dance again.
Will that be all, miss?
I think so, yes.
May I come in?
Hello, John, dear.
Hello, Margaret.
I didn't expect you. Please come in.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I'm so glad you've come, John.
I've been so worried.
There's something I must tell you.
You poor boy.
John, I don't want to add to your worries...
- but I've got to tell you that...
- No, please, let me first. You see...
I don't know how to say it.
Read this note. It explains everything.
I'm going back home tonight and then...
Don't read it until after I've gone.
But you can't go until you know how I feel.
I know how you feel, but my feelings...
- Margaret.
- I'm sorry.
- Do you mean this?
- Yes, John.
I can't marry you.
- You don't love me?
- No, I'm sorry.
Gee, that's swell.
Swell?
I mean, who are you going to marry?
It's in there.
Charlie Shaw. What do you think of that?
We used to call him Goofy Shaw.
He isn't goofy anymore.
No, of course not, now that he's gonna marry you.
You see, I've known him so much longer than I've known you and...
Yes, but why didn't you tell me last night?
I wanted to, but when I finally got to you, you seemed to be in a lot of trouble.
- I was.
- Well, I didn't want to add to it.
- You wouldn't have. You were the trouble.
- I?
Yes, you see, I'm in love with that girl you saw.
You mean that goofy girl?
Yeah. No, she's not goofy.
What do you mean she's...
Was she angry at you because of me?
Yes, isn't that marvelous?
- And what are you laughing at?
- I don't know.
Come on, let us in on the joke.
- We've just...
- Thrown each other over.
You know, I know just how you feel.
I've been divorced a couple of times myself.
I'm glad you're taking it so good, Lucky.
I can take it, Pop.
Because I've got to tell you that Penny and Romero... are getting married this afternoon.
- What?
- Yes, laugh that one off.
Now do you think you can tell me?
No.
How did he look when you told him I was getting married?
- Did his face fall?
- Kind of.
I stopped looking when his chin passed his arches.
They were laughing so hard that all I heard them say... was that she had broken her engagement with him.
Stop talking about him when you know I'm going to marry Ricky.
I is sorry, gentlemen, but it's just like I told you.
Mr. Romero ain't seeing nobody today.
He is getting married.
- He's getting married.
- Is he?
Of course he couldn't see anybody today.
- I should say not.
- Out of the question.
The most ridiculous thing.
That's what I always say.
Hello, Ricky.
Hello, Lucky.
Or perhaps you should call me lucky today.
Excuse me, boss, here's your baggage checks... and all your clothes are on the boat.
It's going to be such a wonderful wedding.
Raymond has been very nice and turned over the entire place to us.
My own orchestra is going to be there and play.
I made a special arrangement of the Wedding March myself... and we have a group of specially selected guests to attend the wedding.
What are you laughing at?
Those trousers.
What's wrong with them?
Why... no cuffs.
Lucky, what are you doing here?
You see, I...
- You just came to laugh at my wedding.
- No.
I'm laughing because there isn't going to be any wedding.
Yes, there is.
No, there isn't.
You wait here.
So there you are. Where are my pants?
Well, what about the wedding?
There isn't going to be any wedding.
Then you're going to marry him?
Yes, I guess so.

[ Bell Clanging ]
Now that's the third time she's run away from me
It's disgraceful
It's unbelievable
Why do you give me nothing but trouble?
As soon as you're born, your mother runs away
You're going to be married, and your bride runs away
It's nothing but run, run, run!
- If only it hadn't rained
- What has the rain got to do with it?
In the sunlight, in the moonlight, nothing could stop her
- But other women run away too
- But after the wedding
That's different
That's all right
Why didn't she wait that long?
Any decent girl would have waited that long
Ah, but not she
She is different
- Ohh - [ Groans ]
- She is wonderful Ohh!
Oh, why did it have to rain?
[ Guests Murmuring, Chattering ]
Your Grace, the guests are getting very excited
They want their presents back
What? Oh, no
The presents will not be returned
The Liebenheims have never returned anything
Your Grace, may I suggest perhaps a few words of explanation?
Very well Very well
Go and explain it to them
[ Murmuring, Chattering ]
- Shh!
- [ Murmuring, Chattering Ceases ]
[ Clears Throat ]
Uh, ladies and gentlemen you are all here today to attend the wedding of two charming, delightful people
And now you're surprised to see me standing here alone
To tell you the truth,
I'm surprised myself
[ Murmuring, Chattering ]
No, no, no, no Please
You -You must not despair
I promise you this wedding will take place
[ All ]
Ahh!
N-N-Not today, but, uh, someday
[ All ]
Ohh!
No, no, no, no
You must not doubt me I will find her
I will find her even if I have to search the whole world
And I will bring her back
Nothing can stop me
I will bring her back even if I have to drag her
I have a nasty temper though I keep it in control
For, after all
I really am a simple-hearted soul
He's a simp, he's a simp
He's a simple-hearted soul
But when my seeds of kindliness have failed to bear me fruit
I then become, I must confess a nasty-tempered brute
He's a nas, he's a nas
He's a nasty-tempered brute
And now I've stood enough
I have to treat her rough
And show her I am capable of caveman stuff
She'll love me and like it
When I start the strike it will not be tenderly
[ All ]
What a man!
I'll win her, the sinner
By Harry, we'll marry
And she'll propose to me
[ All ]
Gorgeous, isn't he?
My papa tells me
I have charms galore
[ All ]
Ahh!
And I have never had complaints before
We'll sail away soon and on our honeymoon
-  She'll love me
- She'll love him and like it!
-  She'll love it
- Love him! Like it! Love him! Like it!
[ All ]
She'll love it!
Countess, please
[ Sighs ]
Whew The narrowest escape
I ever had
Five more minutes, and I'd have been married
[ Shivers ]
I even had the wedding gown on
But fortunately it didn't fit
And suddenly I realized it was fate
The dressmaker had saved the day
Oh, think what I owe that dressmaker Mmm!
I owe him for the dress too!
- But, Countess -
- Oh, I know I know what you're going to say
I owe everybody
And here was my chance
Here was a chance to marry a man who had everything a woman desires
He's rich, he's wealthy and he has nothing but money
And how we could use it
And how!
Come in
Are you the lady who jumped on this train after we had started?
Yes, and I shall complain about it
Trains don't go until I get on them
Oh! [ Chuckling ] Oh, pardon me
I've just come from a wedding
It isn't any of your business where I've come from
Pardon me, madame
May I take the liberty of asking where you are going?
I don't know
I haven't the slightest idea
Can't you make a suggestion?
Well, we go to Vienna
- Mmm
- Monte Carlo?
- Monte Carlo?
- Yes, madame
Two tickets for Monte Carlo
Yes, madame
Monte Carlo
Monte Carlo!
Bertha, how much money have we left?
- Only 1 0,000 francs
- That's enough
With this 1 0,000 francs I'll win my freedom, my happiness at the green tables
Let's see The first day
I'll win, uh, 50,000 francs
- But, Countess -
- No, no, no, no That's enough for the first day
But on the second day I'll take the 50,000 francs and win 1 00,000
And on the third day 1 50,000
And then 300,000
And then I'll start!
I'll smash the bank
And that means millions Millions!
Listen, here's a puzzle
And believe me, it's hot
She comes from a wedding
She has nothing on
She's left her husband behind
She has no ticket
She has no idea where she wants to go
And she goes to Monte Carlo
How old is her husband?
Too old!

If I only had your luck
Tell me, how do you do it?
Nothing to it
I have a system that can't miss
If I happen to be standing beside a brunette, I bet on red
If I'm standing next to a redhead,
I bet on black
But suppose you're standing next to a blonde
What do you do then?
[ Chuckles ]
I ask her where she lives
There's your blonde
Well, why don't you go and speak to her?
- Don't tell me you're afraid
- I am
And for the first time
I don't know what's the matter with me
But I must have some excuse
If only she'd dropped something,
I - I could pick it up
If she only had a little dog,
I could get him to bite me
I've got it
You shall introduce me
- But I don't know her either
- That's the whole idea
You go up and speak to her, she's very insulted then I come up and slap you in the face twice
Oh, no Oh, no
All right, then Once Go
[ Slap ]
Go and introduce yourself
Fifty francs, please, madame
Merci, madame
She is superstitious
[ Chuckles, Clears Throat ]
Uh, don't strike, madame
If you want any luck, you must stroke - stroke caressingly
Naturally, not my back, madame
No luck to that
But the back of my head -
Stroke my hair and see what happens
Magic, madame
From then on, magic
Everything you touch will turn to gold
Millions at your fingertips
What? You don't want to?
All right, madame
But I warn you - fail to do this, and you'll have no luck
You'll lose everything
You'll come out a beggar
But don't blame me when it's too late
Armand, if she wins now -
[ Giggles ] the rest'll be easy
- Bye-bye, old boy! [ Chuckles ]

Give me a moment, please
A moment, please
One word, one smile
One thrill
Fill me with ecstasy
And speak to me
You should, you must
You will
I never knew
That one like you
Could bring me to
My knees
Lift me
And let me rise

Please

She's, uh, the Countess Mara, isn't she?
Quite right Countess Mara
Lives at the Palace Hotel
Third floor Rooms 300-3 25
Entrance: 306
- Where do you live, may I ask?
- At the Palace Hotel, of course
Uh, formerly I lived at the Grand Hotel but she insisted that I move to the Palace
Well, you know what one will do to please a woman
[ Both Laughing ]
Especially when she's so beautiful
Beautiful?
That hardly describes her
You have no idea how she looks How could you tell,just seeing her on the street?
- Of course
- [ Both Chuckling ]
How does a woman look in the morning?
That's the time to tell
You should see her in her negligee
Her neck and her shoulders -
[ Gasps ]
And that lovely blonde hair
But there's only one drawback- she has no money
- What do you mean?
- She has no money at all
Well, one can't live on fresh air
You've said enough!
Do you know what you are?
Oh, no, I'm not, I assure you
For pity's sake, speak low
I'll do whatever you want
Only be quiet Otherwise, I'll lose my position
Your position?
Who are you?
I'm a hairdresser
The personal hairdresser of Countess Mara
- Her hairdresser?
- Yes, sir
[ Laughs ]
Well! This is getting interesting
Now you won't do anything against me?
On the contrary
I'm delighted to meet you
- We must see a lot of each other
- Yes
We -We have mutual interests
[ Laughs ]
- We, uh -We must exchange ideas
- Yes, of course
- We -We must become friends
- Oh, yes
But there What am I saying?
[ Laughs ]
- We are friends!
- Yes, of course we are!
- Friends [ Chuckling ]
- Armand
I want you to meet a very great friend of mine
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Yes
[ Laughing ]
- Who is he?
- [ Chuckles ]
- You don't know who he is?
- No
He is her hairdresser
[ Chuckles ] and I -
[ Giggles ]
I am his very best friend
[ All Laughing ]
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Count Rudolph Farriere
I'm delighted to meet you
My name is, uh -
Just call me Paul
[ Laughs ]
Just call him Paul
[ All Laughing ]
Paul?
Here's a lucky devil and I surely envy him
For his store of inside information
He is in his glory when a lady wants a trim
Work to me is like a recreation
[ All ]
Oh, boy, what an occupation
Why waste away your youth
Searching for the naked truth
Why attend a college
Get your knowledge
Trimmin' the women
Ha!
Who needs a lot of Greek
To caress a lady's cheek
Couldn't you contrive it while in private
Trimmin' the women
Now, if you care for beauties
-  Be a beauty specialist
- [ Chuckles ]
He caresses ladies' tresses
And they never resist
But why ply another trade
Barbers pet and yet get paid
You could make a sort of indoor sport of
[ All ]
Trimmin' the women
[ Chuckles ]
Come here
[ Chattering ]
Why try to figure out
What this world is all about
Never mind the great books
Fill your date books
[ All ]
Trimmin' the women
Shy guys and those who feel
That they have no sex appeal
Get a lot of chances for romances
[ All ]
Trimmin' the women
No hairdresser ever
Has to lead a double life
Now, he can pet a cute brunette
And still be true to his wife
But why sigh and yearn so much
For the skin you love to touch
Satisfy the craving finger-waving
[ All ]
Trimmin' the women
Ahh!
[ Laughing ]
I've just heard a puzzle!
It's a hot one
She jumps on the train
She comes from the wedding
The husband is not with her
She is not dressed
She has no ticket
She doesn't know where she wants to go
And she goes to Monte Carlo!
How old is the hus -
[ Doorbell Buzzes ]
- Oh, you are the new hairdresser?
- Brand-new, mademoiselle
You may come in
Try and keep me out
I hope the countess will like you
Paul has told me everything about her
I know exactly what to do
That isn't what counts The thing for you to know is what you mustn't do
Don't ever try to tell her stories
Don't mention gambling
Don't talk about money in any way
In fact, don't talk at all
I understand
And remember, the countess is very strict about this - never flirt with chambermaids
- I never do
- Quite right
But to avoid any future misunderstandings -
[ Giggles ]
I am not a chambermaid
[ Both Chuckling ]
Still, I - [ Clears Throat ]
I never do
Now I will announce you to the countess
Bring her in
I am ready
How do you do?
- How long have you been a hairdresser?
- Oh, a long time, madame
I have served many, many ladies
- Where did you work?
- At home
I mean, uh, the - the ladies always came to my house
Oh, yes Yes, of course Yes
- Uh, naturally, there'll be no more of that
- I realize that
You are in my employ now and you will devote yourself entirely to me
Only to you, Countess
- And I hope it will not be a job for a day
- That depends entirely upon you
Then I'm sure it will be at least, uh -
[ Chuckles ] a week
Who knows?
Maybe for months
Maybe for years
Uh, who knows?
- By the way, what's your name?
- Rudolph
- Rudolph?
- Yes Rudolph
Rudy!
I don't like that name
I don't ever want to hear it again
Oh, but don't worry
It's not your fault
Let's see
I shall call you, um Paul
Just call me Paul
Rudolph!
Yes, Countess?
Didn't I tell you your name was Paul?
If you ever answer again to Rudolph, I'll -
[ Rhone Rings ]
Hello? Yes? Who?
Who do you wish to speak to?
Rudolph?
Paul For you
Thank you, madame
Pardon me, please
Hello, this is
Paul
Paul!
[ Chuckles ]
No Paul
R-U-D-O-L-P-H
Paul!
Yes! Paul is here too
What we want to know is, how are things going?
What?
You are not alone
[ Laughs ]
He's not alone!
You can't speak?
Oh, I understand
Yes, well, I'll ask questions and you just answer
Yes
[ Chuckles ]
Yes Yes!
No
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I hope so
[ Laughing ]
Good-bye
See you tonight
My servants don't receive phone calls here
- Please remember that
- Quite right, Countess
And please don't ever make engagements without asking me first
And you will not have this evening off
You will stay right here
Thank you very much, Countess
You're making yourself much too prominent
[ Crashing, Thudding ]
-[ Man ] Bags
- Yes All right Yes
Excuse me, madame
My baggage has just arrived
Well, don't unpack yet
I'm not at all sure I'm going to keep you
So far you've done nothing but make me nervous
Now I'd like to see what else you can do
Cut my hair
Haircut à la Marotte
The countess said " à la Marotte''?
Yes, yes À la Marotte
À la Marotte
Oh! [ Chuckles ]
À la Marotte
Of course
How silly of me
À la Marotte
[ Laughing ]
[ Both Chuckling ]
[ Rudolph Continues Chuckling ]
And that's what you call a haircut?
Are you insane?
Yes, madame! Oh, Countess, please forgive me, but I can't do it!
To cut that beautiful, lovely hair would be nothing but cold-blooded murder
- You're discharged!
- Oh, please, give me one more chance!
I'll do anything!
Countess, please forgive me!
- I'll do anything you say I promise -
- I want you to leave this house
Rudolph!
Rudolph!
Raul
[ Groaning ]
Ohh
[ Whirring ]
I don't ever want to see you again
I want you to leave just as soon as you've finished
- Please, Countess
- Immediately
- And I'm not going to change my mind
- Give me one more chance
Please, please, Countess
Please, please stop bothering me!
Oh, I'm so nervous I could scream
- Oh, I have a headache
- Headache?
Oh, yes
And it's all your fault
No, no No, don't do that
Don't do that No
No, no, no, no! No!
No No No
Ohh Ohh
Ohh!
Oh, that feels good
Ohh!
Oh, that feels even better
[ Moans ]
Oh
You must have electricity in your hands
Oh, I never felt like this before
Gorgeous!
Of course you'll stay
Thank you, madame
And whatever I call you -
Paul, Rudolph, or Rudy- whenever I call you please come
Countess, even when you don't call me, I'll come
Madame, you inspire me now
Just try and fire me now
This is something new to me
It's hard to understand
I don't know what you do to me
Whatever it is
It's grand
Since we met today
I feel that I'm in wonderland
I can't explain
The way I feel
Whatever it is
It's grand
I've never known a more delightful
Headache remedy
It's just as good for broken hearts
And housemaid's knee
If my head should ache tonight
I'll need a helping hand
It may be wrong
It may be right
[ Giggles ]
[ Both ]
Whatever it is
It's grand
[ Typing ]
Honorable Countess if your account with us is not settled by tomorrow night -
Countess Mara, Palace Hotel
Dear Countess
we are sorry to inform you--
[ Typing ]
Rudolph! Have you gone completely out of your mind?
No! Nothing like that
I just happened to mention
I was a good driver and the next day the chauffeur was fired
- And what do you think of this?
- What?
Yesterday I served her breakfast and instantly two lackeys were out of a job
In other words, I'm driving her car, dressing her hair waiting on her
Just wait till she fires her maid
No, sir!
It's an insult, sir!
Not a chance!
You can't bribe me!
And if you ever ask for the lady's address again, I shall call the police!
Good-bye
See you later
Get out of my way!
Countess, you wanted to see me about something very important
Rudolph, I'll have to discharge you
Sorry
But I'm not going
And it won't be so easy to get rid of me either
Why, I - I never expected this I -
I've given up everything for you
The little business of my own I -
I've lost all the ladies I used to work for
My whole life has been arranged to suit you and now, for no good reason at all, you want to kick me out
I know I know
Everything you say is true, but -
Well, I -
I simply can't afford to keep you any longer
[ Doorbell Buzzes ]
Will you please open the door?
- What do you want?
- I want to speak to Countess Mara
Lots of people want that
[ Doorbell Buzzing ]
- What's the big idea?
- Please, sir Won't you listen?
Get out I don't want to waste time mucking about with you
Your Grace What are you doing?
Please come in, Your Grace
Your Grace will excuse this?
He is a new man
He has no idea who Your Grace is
You'll get to know me
Rlease, Your Grace
Yes
Yes
[ Laughing ]
Helene
Do you know who that is?
That's her fiancé
Duke Otto von Liebenheim
[ Chuckles ]
Looks dumb, doesn't he?
[ Giggles ]
Do you know why?
Because he is dumb
Otto, I left you three times because I wanted to be fair with you
But sometimes if one is in trouble enough, the best intentions go up in smoke
Especially if one has all kinds of bills no money, and the hotel invites you to get out
No place to go
Well, in a moment like that, one's not very responsible
One's liable to get the most terrible idea
All right Marry me
Otto, if I were to promise to do so now, it would be only for your money
And you dare tell me that right to my face?
Yes I do
Oh, you are so different!
Where is there another woman in the world who would marry a man only for his money and tell him so?
Splendid
You're beautiful
I'm rich
You buy, and I pay
You tell me everything and I'll forgive you
It will be the happiest marriage in the world
You're really very nice
I wish I could love you
You'll love me and like it
I'm wealthy but healthy
-  And I'll be true to you
-  What a man
My income is nearly a million pounds yearly
But we could struggle through if I cared for you
I'll build you castles, dear beyond compare
I fear you're building castles in the air
-  Imagine our thrills
-  Ah, but when you see the bills
-  I'll love you
-  And like it
I'll love it
I'll love it
[ Whistling ]
She'll love me and like it
She'll love me and like it
[ Vocalizing ]
Good man
You shall stay with us
Rudolph
I think I'll be able to keep you after all
Countess
I - I'd like to tell you a secret, but - but I'm afraid you might fire me
- What is it?
- Well it's not so easy to explain, but I -
- but I'm not -
- You're not what?
I'm not poor
As a matter of fact,
I have quite a nice little fortune
Now, if you would allow me,
I'd only be too delighted -
How dare you insult me
How dare you
Oh, please
Please don't send me away
You've misunderstood me
I only wanted to offer you some advice
Now, we're in Monte Carlo, aren't we?
Very well Now here's what I mean:
I didn't make this fortune dressing hair
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, no
- It was inherited
- Inherited?
I mean, uh -
I inherited, uh from my father-
[ Chuckles ] all my luck at gambling
I was not so fortunate
I never won in my life
Countess, won't you let me play for you?
Just once?
- No, no, no, no
- I have a system that can't fail
Don't tell me
I don't want to hear about it
- What is it?
- [ Chuckles ] I'll tell you
If I stand beside a brunette,
I bet on red
If I stand beside a redhead,
I bet on black
But what if you stand beside a blonde?
[ Laughs ]
Well, when I stand beside a blonde, then it makes no difference at all
Red or black, black or red, nothing can stop me I always win
All right
- We'll go and play tonight
- Yes
But -
But how can I go to the casino with my hairdresser?
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, Countess Please don't worry
No one at the casino knows I'm a hairdresser
My clothes are upstairs and when the countess goes out with me tonight everyone will think that I am the count
- Go and get dressed
- Yes, my countess
- [ Knocks ]
- Come in
I don't need you anymore
You don't look like a count
So much better
My last thousand francs
My happiness will be at stake, Rudolph
My whole future is in your hands
Because I feel the urgency
Of your supreme emergency
Madame, I cannot and I will not fail
Come good or evil take my all

Should any doubt come
Wait for the outcome hopefully

Wait and see
We'll have a happy ending
-  If I will keep

Depending
Always
In all ways
On
-  You
-  Me

Would the countess like anything to eat?
No, thanks
We've dined
The countess has lost one of her buckles
Must have lost it when we were dancing
But the countess wanted to play tonight
Oh, yes
That's what we wanted to do
But Duke Otto was there, so, of course, that made it impossible for us to stay
Well, we had to do something
So, we went out and looked around
Bertha, you've no idea how beautiful Monte Carlo is
The park- simply divine
And the promenade - like a walk in the clouds
And as far as you could see, not a soul
And so we sat down close
Very close
Uh, you see, I felt so cold
Yes, there's a very strong sea breeze tonight
Yes Quite right Quite right
A very strong sea breeze
And when the countess felt so cold?
Well, uh, finally I became so -
I became so chilly
I didn't want to take any chances
What's the use of catching a cold?
And so I told him,
"Rudolph, we mustn't wait any longer
You go back to the casino alone and play for me''
And so he went
And now I'm waiting for him to come back
Oh, I wish he were here
[ Knocks ]
I don't need you anymore
Come in
200,000 francs
How dare you
That will be all for tonight
Give me a moment, please
A moment, please
One word
One smile
One thrill
Let me enfold your charms
Within my arms
You should
You must
You will
I never knew
That one like you
Could bring me to
My knees
Lift me and let me rise
To paradise
For just
A moment
Please
No more
I implore
Leave me till
Tomorrow
Always, in all ways
Until you agree
I will continue
Striving to win you
Wait and see
We'll have
A happy ending

This lock must be out of order
I'll tell Rudolph
Rudolph? Why Rudolph?
He's so good at so many things
He'll fix it
I found it last night on the floor
The countess must have put it on the table, and the sea breeze must have blown it off
- [ Chuckles ]
- It's all right It's all right
The countess will pay Rudolph now, won't you?
- Mm-hmm
- He hasn't been paid since he's been here
And he works so hard
He even works overtime
And now that we can afford a chauffeur and a lackey again
I think we ought to hire them
And, Countess, really, if I were you
I wouldn't let my hairdresser do anything else but dress my hair
- Good morning
- Morning
Fix my hair, please
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I -
I thought this morning would be different to this
I expected to tell you something very important
- I'm not curious
- Something about myself
Something that - that ought to concern you
I told you to fix my hair
- Helene -
- Please
Of course I appreciate what you've done for me
I never was in such a situation before, and you got me out of it
Please don't think I'm not grateful
Naturally you must know that
Why, last night I was actually carried away by it
And now, uh, let's forget it
Just a minute
I don't understand
Do you mean that I'm to forget that -
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, no Not a chance
I couldn't forget it
And I won't forget it
If that's the case,
I'll have to return the money
Here
Now I want you to leave at once
So you can send me away like that just as if nothing had happened
Well, that's pretty good
Do you know what I thought last night?
I thought you loved me
Can you beat that?
One often does things at night one regrets the next morning
Yes And maybe ashamed of too, hmm?
Please Now, won't you try to understand?
After all, there is a little difference between us
The only difference between us is that you're a woman, and I'm a man That's all
Oh, I'm afraid not
I happen to be a countess
Yes, and I'm a -
I'm a hairdresser
All right I am a hairdresser
Yes, that's me, and what of it?
Now I'll tell you something else
I fell in love with you because
I thought you were the perfect woman
Now I know you're only a conceited countess and not much of a woman
And to me you're not a man at all
What's this?
I'm not a man?
No, not in my opinion
[ Laughs ]
Well, we'll see about that
All right
Now I'm not a man
- Come here!
- Open the door, and leave the room
Move another step, and I'll call for help
Let go of me
Take your hand away
You brute
I'll scream so everybody will hear me
Oh That's what you get for being nice to your servants
Good-bye
And now, madame, forget all about this as you will, no doubt, by nightfall
I have already forgotten it

- No I -
- [ Mouthing Words ]
Just one moment, please
Hello?
Are you looking for a hairdresser called Rudolph?
Mm-hmm Tell me
What does he look like?
Oh, he looks marvelous
[ Chuckles ]
I see
What? Oh, you want your hair dressed to go to the opera tonight
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I don't know him
I'll send you another hairdresser
What?
[ Chuckles ]
You don't want anybody else
[ Chuckles ] Oh, but, madame, we have lots of good men here
Hmm?
[ Chuckles ]
There's no one like him?
Oh, madame, that's just your personal opinion
Yes
Well, if nobody else will do,
I'm afraid you'll never get to the opera
Good-bye
Helene, it's 8:00
The opera will begin
Helene, the opera has begun
Will you please stop making me nervous?
You know I can't go until my hair is dressed
But, darling, you look so beautiful the way it is
Nonsense And that shows how much you know about women
All day long I've worn myself out trying to find Rudolph
- Other men would appreciate that!
- B-B-But, darling -
Will you please do me a favor?
Go to the opera I'll join you
I promise I'll do everything I can to find Rudolph
And when you do find him -
Oh, when I do find him
I'll never let him out of my sight
How dare you leave without asking Countess Mara
If it happens again, I'll fire you
just a minute
Is he your hairdresser or mine?
Oh, go to - go to the opera
Immediately!
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
Very well, darling
I'm too nervous
She's very nervous
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
Take your time
Rudolph
Rudy
[ Thuds ]
Do you know that I've been looking for you all day?
So they told me
- And do you know why?
- Madame wants to go to the opera
No I don't want to go to the opera
No? Then there was no need for me to have come
- Oh, yes, there was
- Madame, I'm here for one reason only: strictly business
- So -
- Madame what you have done to me shall never be forgotten
But business is business
I had made up my mind never to enter this room again
But when I heard you were going to the opera, I said to myself
" Rudolph, here's your chance - one you can't afford to lose''
Madame, as a hairdresser
I have the greatest interest that you see this opera tonight
What do you mean?
I'll dress your hair as I've never dressed it before
You'll be so beautiful, you won't know yourself
And when you sit in the box with
His Grace, Duke Otto von Liebenheim all Monte Carlo will look at you
All the ladies will envy you and say,
"Who is this great artist
" who can make a woman look as beautiful as that?
We must find him''
And they will
I'll see to that
You mean I'll be an advertisement for you?
Yes, madame
- So that all the ladies will come to you?
- Yes, madame
- The blondes?
- Yes
- The brunettes?
- Yes
- And the redheads?
- Yes, madame
Oh, no!
[ Sobbing ]
This is the way I'm going to the opera
Yes, and I'll show myself everywhere
In the balcony, in the orchestra, on the staircase, in the lobby
And when anybody asks me who did it,
I'll tell them you did it
[ Sobbing ]
I'm going to ruin you

- [ Chattering ]

- Have I missed very much?
- Oh, no, no Only the first and second act
- I'm glad your hairdresser-
- Please don't mention him
I don't want to hear another word about hair or hairdressers
What's the opera about?
I asked you what the opera was about
It's - It's all about a - a hairdresser
Well, I - I can't help it
I-I didn't write it
- Do you want to go somewhere else?
- No
What's the matter with this hairdresser?
Oh It's a silly story, only possible with music
Imagine a lady falling in love with a hairdresser
That's possible even without music
Things like that happen every day
I should say so
Tell me, uh, d-did - did she marry him?
Oh, no She had no idea he was a hairdresser
- She's only just found it out
- Then, uh, what did she do?
- What could she do?
- She threw him out, of course
She'll regret it
Such stupidity
Oh, yes She'll discover her mistake
But then, of course, it'll be too late
It's always too late then
Think of a woman falling in love with a man, then throwing him out
Well, there's no good end to that
Shall I tell you how it ends?
She'll marry a duke
It serves her right
[ Stick Thumps ]
[ Orchestra Resumes ]
- Is that the woman?
- Yes
I don't like her
She isn't even pretty
And look at the way she's dressed
[ Chuckles ]
And this woman has the nerve to throw a man out
She's crazy
Lady Mary, tell me
Should he come back to you what would you do?
What would you do?
The same as before
I'd drive him away

Tell me, on your word of honor, are you a hairdresser?
[ Chuckles ]
No
- Who are you?
- Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Count Rudolph -
- Farriere
- Yes, madame
Oh Oh
[ Chuckles ]
- I feel just as foolish -
- Yes, madame
I mean, I - I mean, I feel just as foolish as the woman in the play
Yes, madame
- Count Farriere
- Yes, madame?
Rudolph, can you - can you ever-
Your Highness, can you forgive me
There is nothing to forgive
Being a lady of propriety
You just obeyed the dictates of society
But this I know
You never really
Loved me
So, fare thee well
So, fare thee well
My lady
Fair
[ Sobbing ]
Poor woman
[ Applause]
I don't like that ending
I like happy endings

Beyond the blue horizon
Waits a beautiful day
The sky will smile upon me

I see a new horizon
Our life has only begun
Beyond the blue horizon
Lies the rising sun

Autumn 1935
Autumn 1935
In the world of Shanghai's underclass.
Xiaohong. Come here.
What do you think you were going to do?
Such a mature girl, with a wild spirit.
- What song do you want to hear?
- Anything is fine.
How about the "Song of Four Seasons", OK?
- Fine...fine, whatever.
- OK, OK.
Springtime has arrived and green fills the window.
Under the window the maiden embroiders a pair of mandarin ducks.
Suddenly a ruthless blow
Splits the ducks apart
Summer has arrived and the willow fronds are long
The maiden drifts south of the river
The wind and sun is fine on the south and north parts of the river
But how can it compare to the green sorghum of home?
Autumn has arrived and the lotus flowers are fragrant
Each night the maiden dreams of her home town
Waking up, she doesn't see her dad and mom's faces
She only sees the bright moon in front of her window.
Winter has arrived and the snow is wide and vast
Winter clothes are mended and sent to her husband
Flesh and blood built the length of the Great Wall
I wish I could be Meng Jiang of those days
That girl is really not bad.
You really like her?
- Yes
- I know the string player. Ah, Old Wang!
Yes, Old Chen...thank you.
- When did you get here?
- Please sit.
- Thank you.
- This is Mr. Gu.
- Oh, ah...
- That's right, the Mr. Gu.
Ah, I've wanted to meet you for a long time!
Mr Gu really enjoyed your song girl.
Oh, really? I'll call her over here.
Xiao Hong, come here.
- Greet Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.
Really not bad!
Sit, take a seat.
- Hey, Lu.
- Hey, you scared me there.
- Whats up?
- You're such scaredy pants!
- You're half done?
- Yea, half done.
Nice smell.
- Hey boss, how's business?
- So-so.
OK, OK, enough shaving heads already.
Let's go to my place and have fun. Hurry up!
OK, OK.
I'm going out for a while.
Give him a careful shave..
Do a good job. You don't want to hurt a person's head.
Peaceful Lane
- Monster, you scared him to death.
- Baby, don't be afraid.
The little darling heard your trumpet from far off, so he knew you were on your way home.
Is that so? What a good baby!
Look, are Uncle's Chen's foreign clothes nice?
They're ugly!
Look, does Uncle Chen look like a foreign soldier?
Do I? Baby, I'll do some military drills for you to see, OK?
Just watch me!
One, two, one, two.
Attention!
Little darling, let Uncle Chen hold you.
I won't hold him... I won't.
Let me kiss him.
Don't let him kiss you. He's got bad breath.
Don't let him kiss.
He's got bad breath, isn't that right?
She's gone downstairs.
The landlady seems to have a little thing for you.
'He's got bad breath, don't let him kiss you, don't let him.'
Ugh, lots of little hairs.
- Chen, how does she know if you have bad breath?
- Get out of here!
Like a foreign soldier indeed! Would a foreign soldier have only this much left of his shirt?
OK, enough already. If you can't talk, then try not to talk so much, OK?
- Chen, He's found a picture.
- Let's hang it up
- OK, but let me write something on it first.
- That's OK, I'll write.
Bring me a brush.
In the saying "Have prosperity shared,
Have difficulty beared", how do you write "difficulty"?
Idiot! Can't even write the character for 'difficult'. I'm coming.
One, two, three. Three idiots!
- Let me do it.
- OK, You do it. together... shared.
Have... difficulty
Difficulty...difficulty...difficulty...
Difficulty...difficulty...
Wang, how do you write the character for difficult?
Isn't 'difficulty' easy? It's about the same as the character for chicken.
One side looks like the character 'beauty', as in talented scholar and beautiful maiden... and the other side is like the
"hai" in Shanghai. Oh, no...
Its like the "jin" in Tianjin... no, that's not right either.
Slow down...
'Difficult'...'Difficult'
It's on the tip of my tongue.
Now I remember.
It was in yesterday's paper.
The nation faces difficulties, so everyone must stand up and take responsibility.
Here it is.
See, look here, isn't this half of the character beauty in 'talented scholar and beauty'?
But, that's not half of the 'hai' in Shanghai and it isn't half of the  'jin' in Tianjin.
It's the 'Han' half of Hankou.
Although you got the place wrong, you knew the character.
"Have prosperity together shared,
Have difficulty together beared"
Good. Here, take it.
Hey, look, a wireless telegram for you!
Be quiet. Hide.
Time for some tricks!
Xiaohong!
Look.
See how dirty it is
Such a big girl. You can't even do something as little as this.
All you know how to do is eat!
What do you think of what I was just telling you? What do you think?
Haven't I told you already?
I don't have any.
Lao Lao, your temper is back.
You know as well as I do how Gu has deals going on all over Shanghai.
It wasn't easy to get a chance to meet him today.
I should go have a drink with him and become friends. Right?
Come on, quick, give me the money!
Just like a ghost!
Skulking around without making a sound.
Not even a simple 3 tile straight!
Old Liu, you go ahead and play for me.
I might as well go home to sleep.
It's enough to drive one crazy.
Wait up! Why do you run away whenever you see me? I did nothing wrong to you.
It was just that we weren't careful enough and the old lady found about us.
She was jealous, she beat you, but what could I say about it, don't you think...
You two are up to your tricks again.
No wonder I lost money.
Shameless bitch!
You leave with an empty pocketbook and come back empty too!
Shameless bitch! Get lost!
You and I are of the same heart...
To the ends of the earth, oh, to the edge of the sea
I seek, oh, seek the soul mate who understands my song
This little sister sings...
and her man plays along
You and I are of the same heart
Aiya aiya...
You and I are of the same heart
Toward the mountains of home, oh, I gaze to the north
Tears, oh, tears wet my robe sleeves
I long for my lover man even now
My man, oh, through hard times our love runs deep
Aiya aiya...
My man, oh, through hard times our love runs deep
In life, oh, who doesn't...
treasure their youth?
This little sister is like a thread, and you are the needle
We're threaded together and we'll never part
Aiya aiya...
We're threaded together and we'll never part
We're here, we're here.
Very handsome; like a young man under twenty.
- Enough already.
- Really, it's true.
- Finished?
- Finished.
Xiao Hong, let's go.
I'll take you out for some fun.
- OK?
- OK.
- Any tip?
- No.
Bastard.
One dan of rice for one yuan!
Two dan of rice for one yuan!
 One dan of rice for one yuan!
Do you want to buy?
Will you buy if I drop the price?
Two dan of rice for one yuan!
What other dishes will you have?
Bring a sauteed tripe, chicken fillets, and stir fried shrimp.
Anything else?
- Bring it out and we'll see.
- OK.
Go. Get lost!
I saw it, I saw it with my own eyes.
After they bought the fabric, they went to a restaurant for some snacks.
I followed them up there too, until the waiter chased me off.
I saw Xiao Hong, she was really happy.
When that fatty gave her some cloth at the foreign fabric shop...
...she was also very happy.
As soon as I saw that fatty,
I knew he was up to no good.
That's why I had Ah Bing follow him.
See, my eyes weren't wrong when I saw it!
Enough already!
If you can't speak, then shut up.
- What do you want?
- Look.
Xiao Hong!
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!
- You shouldn't have...
- Why shouldn't I have?
- Let me go!
- I won't let you go!
- I'm going anyway!
- Ok, if you go, make sure you never come back!
Let go! Let go...
What are you doing?
Put that down. You can't drink anymore!
Just let me be.
I'm too upset now. Just let me be.
No way. You're not much of a drinker.
You've drunk too much.
Put it down!
Do you hear me?
Chen...
Let me be!
If you don't want to drink then don't.
Leave me alone. You...
Look at yourself.
You're already drunk.
Come here.
Come here.
Xiao Hong, there's a customer calling.
Why aren't you coming?
Come here!
Are you ignoring us? You...
Chen...
I told her to come down, so why won't she come down?
- Chen!
- I just want her to come down.
- I want you to come down and sing.
- Chen!
Oh, right, right, right.
Xiao Hong, the guest asked you to come down and sing. Didn't you hear?
What do you want sung?
How about "Sing-song Girl at the Ends of the Earth"?
Come down and sing. Quickly!
Private Rooms Upstairs
To the ends of the earth, oh, to the edge of the sea
I seek, oh, seek the soul mate who understands my song
This little sister sings, and her man plays along
You and I are of the same heart
Aiya aiya...you and I are of one heart
The mountains of home, oh,
I gaze to the north
Tears, oh, tears wet my robe sleeve
This little sister longs for her lover man even now
My man, oh, through hard times our love runs deep
My man, oh, through hard times our love runs deep
He's upset.
It's nothing to do with you.
I'm sorry.
- No need to see me out
- That's OK
- I don't want to impose on you
- Come back again for fun
- Go back in
- Go back in, I'll escort him out
There's something I forgot to ask your madam about just now.
Please come in!
Madam...
There's something I want to talk about with you, but it's awkward.
But since I just had some wine, so I don't care if I make a fool of myself.
Since you've shown me so much respect, here's a little money for you to go shopping
- Stay a while, sit down.
- No hurry.
I need to go to the Carefree Palace.
- You stay.
- OK
Sister, what can we do?
Ask him?
I don't want to.
No, I don't want to.
Which bastard is there?
You?
Lucky for us you still have time to look us up.
Or are you looking for that piece of pretty fabric?
Xiao Hong
OK, OK, Xiao Hong, I'm sorry.
Xiao Hong, forgive me.
OK, OK, Xiao Hong. Don't cry,
Xiao Hong, don't cry.
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Please take it out on me, OK? Xiao Hong.
It's all my fault.
Xiao Hong, don't cry. Xiao Hong.
Don't cry, Xiao Hong.
Xiao Hong. Xiao Hong.
Xiao Hong, answer me!
You don't hate me, do you Xiao Hong?
I hate you.
If my sister hadn't made me come,
I would have never come to see you again.
Your sister?
Was it your sister who sent you over here?
That man who took me to buy fabric and out to eat that time, he came to our place again today.
He was talking about me in mom's room.
I heard everything they said.
I also saw him give some money to ma.
They're selling me for sure.
- He gave her money?
- Money?
Don't worry, Xiao Hong.
There's still time to figure out a way out.
Come on, come here.
Sit down here.
We'll help you think up a solution, OK.
But now will you treat me a little better?
Give me a smile...give me a smile...
You won't smile? OK then...
Hey, take a look!
Madam tried in court.
'Daughter' sues madam, with client as backer.
So we could sue too!
That's just what I mean.
But how do go about suing someone?
I'm not too sure about the details either.
That makes it harder.
Hey, look!

- What do you say we go see this one?
- OK, let's go see him.
Are you feeling better?
- That wasn't much of an illness anyway.
- OK, you come with us.
But how can we go like this?
No problem. I can wear my nice uniform.
I'll say that I work at the Customs House.
And me...?
You...
Take this cloth and say say you're a chauffeur.
Yes, you're my chauffeur.
Look, she's laughing.
- Laugh, laugh, laugh
- I didn't laugh
You didn't laugh?
Does he look like my chauffeur or not?
Look, we're already standing above the clouds!
- This is really paradise.
- That's for sure.
Paradise seems hotter than it was at home.
Warm alright.
Mr Bao is in.
Please have a seat.
Have you come to file a complaint?
No, we've come to sue.
Filing a complaint means to sue.
Yes, yes, we've come to file a complaint.
So what is the problem?
He's my chauffeur. He...
There's someone in his family...
Not my family!
Yes, right, it's his...
...one of his relatives, who...
Not one of my relatives either!
Well, then who is it?
It's about a, a neighbor.
I'm sorry, but according our practice, we charge five ounces of silver for an hour of consultation, fifteen for a legal document, one hundred to arrange for a hearing in court, and five hundred for an appearance in court to represent a case.
I think perhaps you need to reconsider.
Five hundred ounces of silver?
- How much money is five hundred ounces of silver?
- Damn, it costs money to bring a lawsuit!
I hadn't thought of that.
Five hundred ounces of silver.
Damn, it costs money to bring a lawsuit!
I've never heard of this before.
So what do we do now?
Don't panic. We'll think of something eventually.
Escaped Criminal Apprehended
Hey. What about this idea?
Xiao Hong
- No, no, that's not a good way.
Silly, you have us, so what are you worried about?
- And we have lots of friends willing to help out.
- That's right. We have lots of 'brothers-in-arms.' 
Quick. You go back first, and a little later, we'll help you escape across the 'bridge' across the alley.
OK, go back.
It's no good. This plan is no good.
Don't worry. If anything goes wrong, we can find our 'brothers' to help us out.
They'll help us out for sure.
Escaping...
...means she'll be living together with me!
Don't cry.
Go along with them.
They're all good people.
They'll never treat you bad.
But what about you, sister?
Me?
They all dislike me.
They look down on me.
I know.
Why don't you come with us?
No.
You're the one who's always out playing cards and now you want to blame me?
Do you really want a man to take care of domestic affairs?
Don't put on airs with me. Your ambitions don't make us any money.
When I gamble, it's with my own money.
And you're the one who's been teaching that girl to sing and taking her around to the wine houses.
She's your responsibility!
Fine, fine, let's not waste our breath on this anymore.
Are you thinking about moving over to my side?
Our place is better, you know. We face south and the rooms are bigger.
It's strange but last night those two scoundrels moved out on the sly.
No conscience, them. But that trumpet player is a nice man!
What trumpet player? I've never seen him.
Don't pay any attention to that. You ought to be asking Xiao Yun about this. She must know.
Otherwise why would she want to go across the lane.
Ask her. You'll see if I'm right or not.
Cheap slut!
No wonder you...Stop right there!
Where do you think you're going? Get in here!
Then I'll be off to tell Old Gu...
Close the door!
Come here!
If you don't tell me the truth,
I'll kill you right here and now.
Take off your clothes.
Did you hear me?
Take off all your clothes.
Quicker!
Old Gu, would you like to eat a snack after your bath or have something to eat now?
Hungry again, huh?
- Is Mr. Gu here?
- He's here. Just arrived.
Mr. Gu. So you're here.
I've been looking all over for you.
It's terrible!
That little girl of mine, Xiao Hong.
Last night, she suddenly ran away.
She ran away?
- Is it almost done?
- Just about, almost done.
- Forget it! I can't stand sitting here anymore!
- But I'm almost finished.
Xiao Hong, look what I bought you.
I know you'll like it, look!
Give it to me! Don't curl my hair!
- When did you get this? Why didn't you tell me?
- I've been carrying it for the last few days.
Wang, how come you're always pasting newspaper on the wall?
This broken down old wall,
I can't stand looking at it.
What do you think we should give to Xiao Hong?
I think, I think I'll give her a comb.
- What about us?
- I hadn't thought of that.
Xiao Hong, here's a comb for you.
- I don't want this broken old comb.
- Hey, why don't you give her your earring instead.
- OK
- I don't want this earring.
But it's not intended for your ears.
Put out your hand.
This is our engagement ring!
Congratulations!
Quick, let's have a wedding celebration!
Hey, it's not done yet. Why don't you drink it all.
You...come on, drink up!
- Xiao Hong, you drink more too!
- Oh. But I'm dizzy...
No matter. Who'll drink for Xiao Hong? Who?
Old Wang, why don't you have a drink for her?
Well, why do you sit there and not say anything?
- I've already drank a lot.
- That's right. Old Wang is so happy tonight.
I've never seen him drink as much wine as he has tonight.
- Let's all be happy!
- I...
- OK, enough already.
- Don't stop him. Everyone's so happy tonight...
Let him finish his sentence.
I...uh...want Xiao Hong to...
...sing a song.
That's the best thing you've said in your life!
Xiao Hong, go on, sing.
No, I'm dizzy. I don't want to sing.
- You must sing. I'll go get my instrument.
- Slow down. Do a magic trick for me then I'll sing.
Good idea, bravo!
Make way! Make way! Let me sit here.
Good.
This is the real stuff, no fooling around.
Here's another one.
It goes in this eye, it comes out from here.
Now, go in!
Is that the real stuff or fooling around?
That one was called 'Silver Flying Away'
Do another one! Do another one!
OK, I'll do another one.
What's that one called?
- That was called 'Silver...'
- I know, I know, I saw this in the paper.
Massive exports of silver last month
It's called 'silver coming out of the mouth'
Correct.
"Massive export of silver!" Hey, get your Daily News, hey, get your Shanghai News...
There's no business.
What am I supposed to do?
We don't care if you don't have any business
You still ought to give us what you owe.
If you don't pay, how will my children eat?
Look, I even pawned my earring.
We could certainly feed another mouth.
Xiao Hong misses you a lot.
Why don't you run away too?
I think you should run away too.
I don't understand you.
And when night came and it was so quiet you couldn't hear a sound... except the wind outside the windows sighing.
The room candle light flickered.
It was just then that... the ghost came downstairs...
All you could hear from the stairwell was a series of thumps.
Sister!
Did they send you here?
Sister, here's some cool water.
- Chen, how could you...
- Shut up!
- She wasn't...
- Shut up!
I don't care why she's here, but she shouldn't come sneaking over here in the middle of the night.
She shouldn't be sneaking over here where we live.
How did she know we live here anyway.
Who told her?
You must have told her.
Does this woman live here?
Does this woman live here?
Yes.
I wasn't asking you!
What do you say?
Yes.
Sister, I'm going to go cook some rice.
They should be coming home soon.
Oh? You're home already?
Look, my new dress is finished.
Oh. It's pretty. Very nice.
What? You're going upstairs?
Oh, well, the wall up there is broken, so I wanted to cover it up with newspapers.
- Do we have any paste?
- Yes.
I bought you some medicine.
From now on, you don't have to live the kind of life you've been living.
Xiao Hong!
I can do that trick too.
I made up a new trick.
Do you want me to show it to you?
This cup if full of red wine...
...and that one is full of green wine.
How about your rent?
Oh, right. I still have a dollar on me, why don't you take that?
- One dollar isn't enough.
- Well, then, I'll give you more tomorrow.
OK.
Did you get their rent?
Yeah, he gave me one foreign dollar.
Foreign dollar? Idiot! 
What were you thinking, taking a foreign dollar?
- Foreign dollars aren't any good anymore.
- Foreign dollars aren't any good?
Your crazy. Foreign dollars aren't any good?
You must be joking.
You don't get it. From today forward, anyone who uses foreign dollars could be prosecuted.
- Prosecuted?
- Give it to me. I'll give it back to him.
Mr. Chen, can you exchange this for a paper bill?
What for? It's not as if foreign dollars are made of bronze.
No, foreign dollars aren't any good anymore.
Didn't you hear about it?
No good anymore? You're joking.
Then give it back to me.
- Do you have paper money?
- No.
OK.
My hands are killing me, I can't move.
I need to cook the rice.
Don't worry. I'll make the rice appear in the glass.
- I don't believe it.
- You don't believe it? Then close your eyes.
What was that noise?
It was the landlord.
He says, he says foreign dollars aren't any good anymore.
Foreign money no good?
Foreign money...
How did you get upstairs?
Why are you home so early?
I...
Damn! Does That must mean rents are going up again?
- Who was that talking?
- That was the boss of the barber shop next door.
I was just looking for you.
What about your rent?
Are you planning to pay or not?
- Who are you?
- I am the rent collection agent.
- It used to be someone else.
- There's been a change in management.
I'll be the collector from now on.
You must pay the three months of rent that you owe within three days.
If not, we'll request that you vacate.
Within three days?
- Damn
- Boss, what's the problem?
Why such a temper this time?
OK, OK. You'll have to hurry up and find jobs elsewhere. We're closing up shop here!
Closing? Closing?
- Closing?
- Closing?
Closing.
Don't. Don't cry.
Take this.
I have a way to prevent your boss from having to close.
You two come with me!
Hey! Quick, come on in!
Big sale going on here!
Quick, come on in!
Big sale going on here!
Hey! Two heads shaved for the price of one!
Hey! Shave a big head and get a small one free!
Let me through. let me through.
Here's one with hair!
Let me through.
Come on inside! Sit down!
It's very inexpensive.
I didn't come by to have my head shaved!
I came to see the boss, not get my head shaved!
Big sale, very inexpensive!
Bastards! Let me go!
Don't talk. Don't talk. Big sale today.
It's very cheap.
Bastards!
You'll be done soon.
The way they shave people is just like catching a pig.
We'll be done in a moment.
Don't worry. With us three shaving, you'll be done in a flash.
Help! Help...
Bastards!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Damn...Damn.
I'm sorry!
Damn
Damn...Damn.
For Rent
I've already found out where they live!
So have you seen that girl inside?
I haven't seen her exactly, but she has to be there. 
It couldn't have been a coincidence that the day she disappeared that little devil moved out too.
Moreover, I noticed a long time how that devil and Xiao Hong sometimes carried on...
Mr Gu, what do you think we should do?
Just say the word and we'll take care of it.
OK, let's go have a look tomorrow.
Damn.
What should we do? Those two haven't come back yet either.
I've finally found you out! 
I'm asking you, where is Xiao Hong.
Tell me!
Tell me!
Quick. Tell me!
Cheap slut!
Hold on a second. Put that down.
You want to kill me huh?
Well, I'll kill you first!
Tell me, where is she?
Right. We should go up and have a look.
Keep an eye on her, Old Gu.
Old Gu!
She must have escaped that way.
Cheap slut!
Old Gu...Old Gu!
Old Gu?
Old Gu! Could it be that he's setting us up to take the fall?
Think about it. Am I right or am I wrong?
- Don't try to stop me!
- Don't do it!
- Why not?
- What are you going for?
- I'm going to fight.
- Is it worth it?
- What do you mean by that?
- Is it worth fighting for that kind of woman?
- What are you saying?
- Is it worth fighting for that kind of woman?
Old Wang
I'm sorry.
Chen!
Chen, where do you think you're going?
I'll...I'll go find her for you.
Calm down!
This isn't some kind of game.
Xiao Yun! Xiao Yun!
Are you injured? Xiao Yun!
Quickly!
Old Wang is back!
Quick! You all look after her and I'll go find a doctor.
Ah! Sister!
Xiao Yun.
I'm sorry.
We all share the same miserable fate.
What does forgiveness mean anyway?
Sister!
Don't be sad, Xiao Yun.
Rest easy.
Wang has already gone to get you a doctor.
A doctor?
Old Wang?
Old Wang is a real friend...
Old Wang... 
Is that him coming back?
No, that's not him. That's just the policeman on the night beat.
- Old Wang will be back any moment now.
- Police?
Police? What's he coming here for?
To arrest people?
To arrest me?
To arrest him?
- Arrest him! ... Arrest him!
- Xiao Yun
- Xiao Yun.
- Let him go.
- Xiao Yun
- Let him go.
It's OK, nothing is happening, Xiao Yun.
Your eyes are playing tricks on you, Xiao Yun.
Release him.
Release him.
He's a good man.
He helps poor people.
Ants.
Ants.
Sister!
She's gone to sleep.
Are you tired?
Not enough money. The doctor won't come.
Mingxing (Star) Film Company Production
The story is set in Paris around 1 930
I don't mind being kept awake, but at least tell me why you're all so merry.
You haven't heard!
They haven't heard!
They haven't heard the events
So we'll tell the story to you.
You may think it all nonsense
Though every word is true.
Can you give us an explanation?
You want an explanation? Very well.
We'd be happy to relate the whole story
Since everything here is now hunky-dory
But to explain how it all came to pass
Father Time would have to change his way.
So be patient and have yourselves a glass
And let's go back to early today.
So be patient and have yourselves a glass
And let's go back to early today.
And let's go back to early today.
Leave us alone, pal.
Shut up, you fool.
What is it...
What do you want, Beatrice?
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
Excuse me.
That girl seemed annoyed.
Is she your girlfriend?
No, she's a neighbor.
She's a dancer. She's quite nice.
But she didn't know I was doing your portrait. It surprised her.
You're probably wooing her.
Not at all.
We're just sort of engaged.
Why do you bother with Michel?
You always run after him.
You love him.
Well, that's your business.
You always wait on him.
I promised to mend his old jacket.
I was bringing it back.
It's too old to mend.
Anyway, I've had enough.
Sure, he's a nice fella.
He's my friend.
I can't badmouth him. But still...
He's short, not good-looking, and he has a big nose.
But you're so soft on him.
Me, soft on him?
- Who is it?
- The butcher.
The gentleman's not in.
Oh, no? Then just tell him if he doesn't pay his bill today he'll have to answer to me.
I'm wise to people's tricks when they're flat broke.
When you can't pay, you don't go shopping. Thief!
Him, a thief?
Don't give me that!
You're the one who owes me.
How can you accept that?
Ignore him. He'll go away.
Forget your floozies and find a job.
Bum! Good-for-nothing!
If you don't like it, come on out.
Loafer!
I'll have your furniture impounded.
It's better not to answer people like that back.
Why don't you just pay the man?
Because I'm hard up right now.
But not for long.
I'm expecting some money.
How annoying.
It's the third time we've been interrupted since I arrived.
No way to see the fellow.
They're awful people, these artists, these doodlers!
He owes me 2 months.
And 2 months' rent!
Let me get my hands on him.
I was just upstairs.
He wouldn't open the door.
Same here.
Don't worry. We'll have his furniture impounded tomorrow.
I'll be here with this gentleman.
We'll impound.
Enough is enough.
This has gone on too long.
Going, Wanda dear?
Look at how you're dressed!
Relax, I'm the boss now.
Here, pal...
Why the get-up?
Because it's your turn.
Why should I play the servant alone?
Get off my back. Wait a minute.
Close your door when you entertain your mistresses.
But Beatrice...
You let her insult me!
No, Wanda, don't go.
You're being ridiculous, Beatrice!
Wanda, listen!
I'm sorry, dear.
I'll finish your portrait tomorrow.
You'd do better to pay the milk maid.
Quiet, you old bat!
Scoundrel!
Murderer! Artist!
So there you are!
And now, young man, you can pay my bill.
And mine.
You owe me, too.
And my bill.
Enough, gentlemen!
I don't settle bills in stairwells.
There's a lady present.
Your business doesn't concern me.
I'll leave you to your friends.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, my dear.
Good day, gentlemen.
That's enough!
I won't stand for your penny-pinching manners.
The nerve!
Penny-pinching manners, us?
- Stop, thief!
- He's on the run.
- Stop, thief!
- Catch that one.
He went that way, he'll come this way
Stop, thief!
Stop that man, I say!
What are you doing here?
Please, young lady, not a word.
You come into my room, take that jacket...
Young lady, let me ask you one question. Just one.
Do you enjoy the piano?
- What?
- I can tell you do. Come here.
Who's after you?
Are you in debt, too?
Why are they after you?
Listen, child, you've just done me a great, great service.
If ever you need a helping hand, count on me.
Grandpa Tulip.
23, rue des Vieilles Haudriettes.
Are you done playing?
Why?
I have to run out the door.
Then I won't keep you.
Would you mind if I kept the jacket?
But it's not mine.
It's worthless.
Let go!
Will you let go of me!
- I'll put the cuffs on you.
- Leave him to us.
Let go!
You're hurting me!
- He's not our man.
- He's not?
What d'you want?
Will you pay us?
Will you pay us?
Will you pay?
We'll count to three.
We'll count to three.
One...
Two...
Three...
Yes!
What's got into you?
Read this.
One of us is a millionaire.
- Millionaire?
- That's right, fella...
- What's the matter?
- Look.
NO. 27 009 WlNS
1 MlLLlON FLORlNS
The Dutch Lottery!
We bought tickets.
Who won, you or me?
The tickets!
What's this nonsense?
Is it you? Or me?
Listen, please!
The tickets!
You noted the numbers.
My notebook.
Is it you? Is it me?
Answer me, dummy!
I don't know. Take a look.
Let's make a deal. Whether it's you or me, we split it, okay?
No way, old man.
If it's me, I keep it all.
See how he is?
This joke's gone far enough.
You'll see.
- Split or no split?
- Not a cent.
Okay.
Well?
Dammit!
It's me. Say, what's a million florins come out to?
It comes out to... Iots of millions.
I don't know how much.
Imagine that! Imagine that!
This is terrific! Aren't you glad?
You'll all be paid tomorrow.
How do we know you have this ticket?
A good point.
Come with me. You'll see.
Gladly.
Upwards, upwards, to the light up there.
We'll see if his claim is true
If the painter is really a millionaire.
The baker...
The butcher...
The grocer...
The dairy maid...
We shall bear witness to his virtue.
Do you remember where I put the ticket?
No, I don't, old man.
What a dope! Beatrice has it.
Darn! She's out!
Stay here, old man.
Watch the door till she gets back.
My fortune's in this room.
I can't show you the ticket now.
It's in there, all right, but it's locked. I have to wait.
Look, we'll come back later.
No. I insist on showing it to you.
You'll see it soon enough.
Some port, gentlemen!
Don't worrry.
I'll go fetch a bottle.
Bring a dozen, while you're at it.
A dozen? All right.
And some pastries.
And champagne.
And then...
I'll leave it up to you.
So long as it's quality stuff.
Have no fear. I'll be right back.
Gentlemen, please, take a seat.
Millionaire! Millionaire!
Who?
That beggar, that bohemian?
The fellow in the studio.
The one who's behind in his rent.
He's become a...
Millionaire!
The one who never pays?
What a lucky fellow!
He'll be paying me now.
Sure, it's easy when you're a...
Millionaire!
The million's been won!
Get your lottery results!
Who? Michel? He won what?
Enough money to burn.
Gentlemen, to his health!
Miss, you're needed at home.
It's urgent. Come with me.
What for?
Dunno. They just sent me.
What happened?
You can run along.
I'm parked just outside.
Is Michel here?
Police.
- Where?
- That fellow.
- You sure?
- I think so.
What do you want?
Why... nothing.
What are you doing here?
I came to...
Who are you?
Who am l?
I am Ambrosio Sopranelli.
Tenor at the New York Met.
Tenor?
Prove it.
Sing!
Don't shoot. I'll sing.
Do you sense the courage
That now sustains my arm?
Do you see my visage
Which betrays no alarm?
O angel mine,
All danger I shall decline.
O angel mine!
Goodbye, Michel.
Goodbye, my love.
Michel, here comes Beatrice.
Quick! Open up!
- What is it?
- I'm a millionaire.
- He's gone crazy.
- He's right.
Open up, quick!
My million's inside, you know.
The jacket, Beatrice. The jacket.
Yes, the jacket.
What for?
My lottery ticket's in it.
Oh, my God! I don't have it.
You don't have it?
Where did it go?
Here you are, and thank you.
And if you want to hear me...
I'm at the Opera Lyrique.
You forgot your cane, sir.
Why return his cane?
To pinch his watch.
They were chasing him, you see...
I gave him the jacket... so they wouldn't recognize him.
I don't know... it was an old, beat-up jacket...
I didn't think...
You didn't think, you didn't think.
Don't think.
No mistake about it.
It's gone for good.
Go on, fella.
Don't panic.
You can't tell them what happened.
Go out there.
Put on a happy face, and laugh.
Fake it. Go on.
In the name of all the tenants here, so proud to know a millionaire, accept this bouquet of flowers and may your happiness be ours.
Didn't the man who took the jacket leave a name or address?
Yes, but I forgot it.
There was so much confusion...
But I think... it was like the name of a flower.
Something like Grandpa Rose.
Grandpa Tulip.
I'm sure of it.
And his address?
The address, I don't know.
A smile, sir. More.
Tilt your head a bit...
The bouquet...
That's it.
Imagine, this picture will be in all the papers tomorrow.
Smile. More, more.
Just a little bit...
Smile a bit more. To the right.
Hold it right there. Smile.
That's it.
It didn't come out. Sorry, sir.
But isn't there a way to find his address?
Tough luck.
Grandpa Tulip should be enough.
It should be easy to find a Tulip in Paris.
Look, I'm going to give
Michel a hand.
Wait a minute...
Smile. Smile.
That's it.
Does she have any clues?
No, nothing.
No, no. This can't be!
Look here, I want to do something for you.
I have some contacts. If I find the ticket, do we split it?
Split it? No, we don't split it.
Then go look for your ticket.
If you call that friendship...
Why did you ask?
It was just a hunch I had.
Oh, why not!
I have nothing to lose now.
It's a deal?
However I manage, if I bring you the ticket, we split the million.
It's a deal.
Word of honor?
Then you're on, pal.
Don't hold your breath.
Tulip...
I'm so sorry.
And we needed the money to get married.
That's out of the question now.
Why?
Forgot already? I'll never forget.
But you'll find your million.
Oh, so what.
I remembered the thief's name.
I told Prosper.
He went off to find him.
Prosper? The bastard!
So that's it.
What's the name?
Grandpa Tulip.
Oh, why bother!
I'm not going to start chasing after this Tulip fellow.
23, rue des Vieilles Haudriettes.
That's Grandpa Tulip's address.
Good heavens!
We are the foot soldiers of inequality
We take back the spoils of social injustice
And under the watchful eye of the police...
...watchful eye of the police
We redistribute wealth and private property.
At ease.
Gentlemen,
I almost got arrested today.
The police are on our trail.
We must be careful.
Anyone on guard outside?
Yes. Young Laborde.
Good. Let's get to work.
Are you Grandpa Tulip?
What can I do for you?
I'm Michel Bouflette.
The owner of the jacket.
What jacket?
The jacket a young lady lent you this morning, when you were in bad straits.
I'm here for the jacket you borrowed from me.
But it was worthless.
This man was wearing a superb jacket.
I followed him in the street,
I went into his shop and bought the jacket.
A great artist must pay attention to the slightest details.
I'm all set to sing "The Bohemians" in this costume.
Alone are we,
O beloved!
My watch! My watch chain!
But why sell the jacket to a singer who's going to America?
How should I know?
He said it was for a role.
A role?
Do you know his name?
We bought his watch.
So what if you did?
It may have his name inside.
Exactly.
The watch, son.
Good idea.
You're Crochard, alias The Tulip.
Me?
Who's watch is that?
Just what I'd like to know.
Don't get funny with me, buster!
Take him away.
We are the foot soldiers of legality
No bandit can escape the police
Our arm upholds the scales ofjustice
In the name of public virtue and private property.
Gentlemen, this jacket business looks very suspect to me.
I sell it to a singer, and another man comes to get it back, upon which we get a police raid.
So tonight we go to the Opera Lyrique and we get that jacket.
Michel, Michel, how can you sit there?
When will you be a millionaire?
You won't stop the clock by whining
The meter's running, the price is climbing!
Victory was there for you to hold
Somewhere yourjacket's flying
With a pocketful of gold
Mr. Prosper Benevant?
Report to the station.
Why?
They arrested a man who claims to know you.
He lost his papers.
We need you to identify him.
I'll be right down.
Ambrosio Sopranelli.
Ambrosio... Sopa...
Sopranelli. The singer.
I'm singing tonight at the Opera Lyrique.
I'm off to America to sing my repertoire.
Repert...
Carmen, Paillasse, Rigoletto.
That watch meant a lot to me.
I'm sure Grandpa Tulip stole it.
The police does its job.
Here's your watch.
And here's Grandpa Tulip.
- Is this yours?
- lndeed it is.
So you bought my jacket.
The one Grandpa Tulip wore.
But it's mine.
So you admit to being Grandpa Tulip.
No, no. But this man...
Are you or aren't you
Grandpa Tulip?
Then be quiet.
Be quiet.
No, I'm trying to explain...
It's important to me.
Excuse me, but the watch is mine.
The jacket is mine.
Everything is mine.
The jacket's mine.
Take them away.
My jacket! Let go!
My jacket!
Don't let it get away!
May I go?
Sit down.
Prosper, quick!
The guy there. Sopranelli. He sings at the Opera Lyrique tonight.
He's got the jacket. Go get it.
At the Opera Lyrique.
What is it?
Sir, here's the person for the interrogation.
Fine. Go fetch this Tulip fellow.
Just a moment, sir.
It's all right.
So, sir...
Will you release my fare?
Wait outside.
Wait, wait...
And the meter's running...
I can't help you.
Can I go now?
Sit down, you!
Do you know this gentleman?
Me?
Not at all.
Is this a joke?
I never saw him before.
Never saw me before?
Sure, I saw him a moment ago when he was making a fuss...
It's the first time I saw him.
He's known me for over 20 years.
That's a lie. I don't know him.
You don't know me?
You don't know me?
No, I don't know him.
No one asked you.
- Can I go now?
- Sit down.
Hey, you, do you realize what you're doing?
You bet, I do.
Why are you doing this?
Can't you guess?
No, I can't.
This morning you said we'd share the million if I found the ticket.
This way I'm sure to get it.
As promised.
I'm going to break your neck.
I'm going to break your neck, you hear!
Don't forget your hat.
You louse! You gangster!
You bastard! You'll pay for this.
Can I go, sir?
You're free to go.
Prosper, what have you done?
Prosper, what have you done?
As a friend, you're no paragon
Let your conscience confess
That your friend is in distress
Prosper, what have you done?
Best not to give another thought
To the remorse your acts brought
Don 't let it get the better of you
Instead of trying to make amends
Go spend a moment or two
With a charming lady friend
I don't understand this.
So you'll get the million?
The thing is...
Not quite.
It's like this: Michel and l each have a claim on the ticket.
But Michel's in trouble, so he'll get whatever I give him.
It all depends on how generous I want to be.
Then you're a rich man.
Yes... not yet... but very soon I will be.
I'm so happy... for you.
Prosper, how can you dare?
Let the voice of virtue declare
See your friend, see his state
The jacket's gone, the hour's late,
The proud fighter has not a prayer
Prosper, how can you dare?
It's him!
This is Michel Bouflette?
You'll vouch for him?
So swear we, he's the millionaire.
This is Michel. Yes, it is.
So swear we.
So swear we, Mister Commissioner.
No law can make us forswear.
We, his friends, shall set him free.
So swear we, so swear we.
So swear we, Mister Commissioner.
This is Michel. Yes, it is.
So swear we.
It's about time.
You have to pay up.
That's enough!
Wait at my place while I run over to the Opera Lyrique.
Not me. I want my money.
If you want your money, you have to drive me.
I'm not used to working this way.
I can't buy gas with promises.
- It's for the bouquet.
- Just a second.
Get out, sir! I've had enough of this jacket business.
Just when I'm about to sing.
- But I only wanted to ask...
- Get out of here!
When would you like these ladies to throw you the bouquet?
At the end of Act One, after the love duet.
Make sure it's in my direction.
Did you understand?
You can count on us.
So, you're one of my greatest admirers?
Oh, yes.
You're so handsome in that costume.
Wait until you see me with my beard.
Look.
Tell me, child, why don't we speak after the performance?
Come to my dressing room after the final curtain.
Oh, certainly, Maestro.
Nothing could make me happier.
See you later.
What is it, child?
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.
How sweet.
You're in the ballet?
Yes, I'm dancing.
I've heard you sing so often.
Then you'll be delighted to hear me on stage.
You're so charming.
Would you mind if I watch you put on your makeup?
Well... of course, take a seat.
She's irresistible.
You have such a nice voice.
You haven't heard anything yet.
Just wait...
Oh, yes, I know.
But it's still so pleasant.
She's so charming.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Would you pass me the jacket there, child?
Here. Here.
Thank you.
Isn't she adorable!
Will you come see me after the performance?
Who is it?
- On stage.
- Coming.
They're waiting.
Coming. So you'll come?
Coming?
Excuse me, I'll be right there.
Until later.
- Did you get the ticket?
- I couldn't.
Why not?
Someone was with him.
I saw the jacket.
Hello, Michel.
Working for Prosper now?
- Not at all.
- Nice work.
- But I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
I get the picture.
Who are you? Thief!
Let me out of here!
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
I might be her brother!
I might be her father!
- What are we waiting for?
- Madame Ravellina.
I won't be kept waiting.
That's not the costume!
That's the "Bohemian" costume.
But we start with the love duet.
That's right.
No one told me.
On stage, madame.
We're locked in!
Let us out!
Let me go!
On stage!
Quick! Quick!
Now it's my turn!
I refuse to change.
What are you doing backstage?
But you can't!
The public's waited long enough.
Because of her.
What?
Sopranelli waits for no one.
I won't stand for criticism.
- But your costume!
- I don't care!
- What will the audience think?
Leave them to me.
He's mad.
The management will hear of this.
Alone are we at last tonight
All else to their slumbers have gone
Alone are we in the failing light
Side by side upon this bench of stone
We are free at last to speak openly
Far from the crowds, the city's blare
Far from the world and its agony
Truth is what we find here
What sorrow clouds thy sense?
O heart, what is my offense?
O pity, see how I grieve
Yes, great is my adversity
There is no balm, no reprieve
Thou lovest me not,
I who love thee
Heed not thy jealous heart
Nothing shall keep us apart
We are alone in the forest
This blessed place is our shrine
Let your hand in my hand rest
And our fingers forever entwine
I lack the force to resist thy pleas
I feel so weak when thou art near
Let me gaze into thine eyes
Let thy love be all most dear
Let us forget sorrows past
Let us sad thoughts outcast
Let the Spring now sow its pedals
In the furrows of thy hair
Our pain shan 't our love unsettle
The breeze on this night so fair
Carries off our coupled sighs
Far away toward distant skies
In the forest deep are we alone
What care we of fortune's sting?
When Heaven to us opens its throne
Pure gold do the moonbeams bring
When the Earth is graced from up Above
The night is sworn to secrecy
Cradled in eternal love
Alone in the forest are we
Why do you keep stroking your beard like that?
I believe we've met before, child.
Think hard.
Grandpa Tulip.
Don't count on me for any more jackets.
The troubles I've had over that!
Look, sir, you promised to help me.
All I ask is: give me my jacket back now. I must have it.
You'll have your jacket, child.
There's not a minute to lose.
- Honest?
- Yes, go on.
- You promise?
- I promise.
I'll get it?
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen...
THE BOHEMlANS
Opera in three acts
Give us the giddiness
Give us the caress
Of a ravishing mistress!
That's our only happiness!
We are alone, O angel mine!
Join me beneath the scented pine.
What sight do my eyes take in?
What! Laurence in this place of sin?
Impure girl, get thee hence
Or my wrath shall chastise thee!
I laugh at your violence!
She laughs at his violence!
They fight! Make haste!
They are crimson-faced!
Anger takes its toll.
We must keep them apart.
Assassin of my heart!
Ravisher of my soul!
Mother, thy face I descry.
Son, I hear thee cry.
I die.
You die.
He dies.
O tragic demise!
Heavens, he is dead.
What is this I hearest?
Laurence, hear me now.
Hear me now, my dearest.
Now even the stars do bemoan
This life by my hand bereft.
Of my last friends, none are left...
But what care I for remorse
When I love thee.
Thou lovest me!
Till death do us part!
You again! What do you take me for?
I told you to move on.
I've been around the block a dozen times.
I'm waiting for my fare to come out.
He's got to pay me.
Here he comes now.
Next time I'll hit you with a ticket.
Where to now? The police station?
Not the station. You can spend your life there. Home!
Home? Where's home?
You were waiting there this morning.
Will I get paid this time?
Sure, sure, you'll get paid.
- It's about time.
- You tire me out.
I tire you?
I just want what's coming to me.
Michel, Michel, how can you sit there?
The meter's running, the price is climbing.
With a pocketful of gold.
The jacket!
It was on the roof.
That's great!
Not a word! Not a move!
Shut up!
- This can't be!
- Don't, Michel, stay here!
After them, you idiot!
They're getting away.
After them? That's a good one.
And stop a bullet?
No. Pay the fare and that's that.
Goodbye and good riddance.
Or else I'll take you to the cops.
There are too many guys like you.
Risk my life for an honest living?
I've got a wife and I might have kids some day. I'm a future father.
If you don't want to pay, say so.
I'll take you to the cops.
I heard you. Thanks.
No, you didn't hear.
I cooled my heels...
- I haven't a cent on me.
- Then don't take taxis.
Look for yourself.
"Look for yourself."
Where?
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
Give us the giddiness
Give us the caress
Of a ravishing mistress!
You ought to be glad.
We did things right.
That's for sure.
Tell me, are all these folks creditors?
Not all of them. They're neighbors.
They brought friends to see you.
How nice of them!
Driver, have a glass of champagne and some cake.
Sure.
Say, mister...
Who's this fellow I've been driving?
He's flat broke.
Who's paying for this?
What a question! You are.
- Me!
- It's natural.
So it's me.
- Aren't you glad?
- Sure I am.
That's more like it.
A million?
Then why wouldn't he pay his fare?
He didn't have his lottery ticket then.
But he has it now.
We should ask to see it.
Sure. You'll see.
Do you have the ticket?
That's just what I was saying...
- Well then...
- Come on.
- Don't keep us waiting.
- Let's see it.
What?
The lottery ticket.
The million.
Oh, you want to see the...
Well, then, I'll show you the...
Your attention...
Gentlemen, I have some news.
Some bad news.
We aren't always masters of our fate.
Is Miss Beatrice here?
No, that's enough, please, leave me alone.
I kept the ticket in a jacket, and this jacket...
The jacket!
But the jacket's empty!
This is the end. The jacket's empty.
Explain the problem to me.
The ticket was in it.
What ticket?
The lottery ticket.
I was asked to bring back a jacket...
- It's the ticket I want.
- So I brought a jacket.
The lining!
There was a ticket in the pocket.
What ticket?
The lottery ticket!
Then say so. Had you told me about a lottery ticket,
I'd have brought you a lottery ticket.
It would have been easy, because it's right here.
The ticket that was in the jacket.
I have it. Here it is!
When you haven't got a cent
You're never content,
And life seems unfair.
But your thoughts are gay
When you're young and can say
You're a millionaire.
Money isn 't everything, so beware!
Well that's what folks pretend.
But when you're a millionaire
You're not any worse off in the end.
Money isn 't everything, so beware!
So say folks who are intelligent to folks without a cent
We'll believe what they say
When they give all their money away
And there you have it!

Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul do take.
God bless Mrs Higgins.
God bless Mrs Denham.
And God bless the trustees, and please make us good children.
Forever and ever. Amen.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
And God bless my sister, Mary. Amen.
Please take very good care of my duck and my pony.
Please see that they don't catch pneumonia.
Spunky.
You'll get me in trouble.
What you need, Spunky, is a hot lemonade.
Will you be quiet?
Spunky, do you like the superintendent?
What? What?
Do you like Mrs Denham?
Do you like the trustees?
Do you like me, Spunky?
Spunk?
Good morning. Nothing must be allowed to go wrong today. Absolutely nothing.
I hope to please all the trustees, but I'm anxious that we make a good impression
- on Mr Morgan.
- I think I understand.
You think? Why, that isn't good enough.
Read that, Henrietta.
Read it carefully.
Mr Morgan is our richest trustee.
He's coming here today for the first time.
If he is really pleased with the orphanage,
I believe he'll double his donation to us.
- Oh, how wonderful.
- Exactly.
- Seven o'clock. Call the children.
- Very well.
Henrietta, I forgot. Mr James Wyckoff will be among the trustees who will visit.
I want you to make sure a large bottle of Mr Wyckoffs famous cough mixture is displayed in our medicine cabinet.
I'll see to it.
Elizabeth Blair, what have you got to say for yourself?
Oh, my goodness!
Elizabeth Blair, come into my office - at once.
Yes, ma'am.
This is the second time in a month you've been called to the superintendents office.
- Yes, ma'am.
- The last time you were here, your sister Mary was also brought before me.
You both admitted that you had been singing and dancing without permission.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Do you know why you are here this time?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then tell me why.
Don't you know?
Quiet. Now, Elizabeth, tell me why you are here.
- Because I took a pony to bed with me.
- Child, you're absolutely uncontrollable.
Yes, ma'am.
I am well aware that your late father and mother were in the theatrical profession and that you came here with no sense of discipline.
I have made every allowance for you.
But when you bring animals into the dormitory, I must act.
That's what my daddy and mummy used to do.
- What?
- Act.
Don't be impudent.
Now, your pony and your duck will be sold immediately.
Please, Mrs Higgins, please.
I'll be good, but don't take Spunky away from me, and my poor little duck.
And why not?
Because my pony and my duck are notjust ordinary animals.
My daddy and my mommy teached them to do tricks on the stage.
And just what is your duck trained to do?
My duck does a wonderful trick.
My duck can lay an egg.
- And just what is so wonderful about that?
- Well, can you lay an egg?
Oh, excuse me.
Elizabeth, I have decided to get rid of your pony and your duck.
- They will be sent away this morning.
- Yes, ma'am.
No sniffling, now.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?
No, ma'am.
There, baby, don't cry.
Mary, don't let them.
Please don't let them send Spunky and my duck away.
Oh, darling... Now, listen to me, dear.
Listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you.
All right.
Spunky would be very unhappy if he saw you crying.
- I suppose so.
- You don't want to make him unhappy?
- Oh, no.
- All right, then.
When it's time to say goodbye to Spunky, you'll have to be just as brave as brave can be, so you can make him brave too. See?
- Spunky and I are such awfully good friends.
- I know, dear.
All right, Mary. I'll try and be brave about Spunky and my duck.
Good for you. Look, how'd you like to help me get lunch?
I'd love that. I like to make things to eat and I especially like to eat them.
Oh, my goodness!
Singing in the dining room! Is this the kind of manners you teach them?
Of course not, Mr Wyckoff. They've been told they must be quiet at mealtimes.
Oh, they've been told, have they? Well, just telling them doesn't seem to be good enough.
Perhaps a bit of real discipline wouldn't do them any harm.
- Have you been told not to sing?
- Yes, sir.
Then why do you do it?
You're a bad and wicked child.
She isn't a bad and wicked child.
She's just a baby.
She was making the children laugh.
It wasn't her fault.
I told her to sing for the children.
And who are you, young woman?
- Are you an orphan too?
- Yes, sir.
Then what right have you to be here, living on charity at your age?
I'll tell you what I'm doing here.
I scrub the floors, make the beds, wash, iron and cook from morning until night.
- Quiet!
- I won't be quiet.
- You're mean and hateful to frighten children.
- Report to me after the meeting.
Yes, ma'am.
The rest of you, go to the yard and wait there till it's time for inspection by our trustees.
Yes, Mrs Higgins.
- Aren't you going to join us, Mr Morgan?
- What?
- Yes, of course, the meeting of the trustees.
- Of course.
Would you mind beginning without me?
I'd like to look about the place.
- But we have important matters...
- I'll join you in a few minutes.
- Well, of course...
- Thank you.
She isn't wicked...
- Oh... I'm sorry.
- Please don't get up.
I just wanted to tell you how much I admired your spunk in standing up for that youngster.
- She didn't mean any harm.
- Of course she didn't.
I don't think singing that song was such a terrible crime.
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed your playing, too.
Thank you very much.
Tell me, where in the world did that youngster pick up such a charming song?
- Well, I write them and...
- You write music?
- If you can call it music.
- I call it delightful music.
Look here, would you promise not to give me away if I made a terrible confession?
Of course.
The deep, dark secret in my life is that now and then I compose a bit of music myself.
But isn't it fun, getting a melody and then finding just the right words for it?
Great. You know, the happiest days of my life were those I spent studying music under Professor Auspitzer, in Br黱n.
Those must have been happy days.
But that isn't all of it.
I love the people in the little Austrian towns.
They're so proud because their music is the music of the world.
It seems that most everyone in those quaint little villages has a "Hello, neighbour" smile.
They love the simple things in life.
The simple things in life.
That almost sounds like the words of a song.
I'll remember the suggestion.
Perhaps someday they might make a song.
- Will you do me a great favour?
- Certainly.
I have to run along to the meeting, but I'll be back. Will you play me some more music?
- If you'd like to hear it and Mrs Higgins...
- I asked to.
- All right.
- Until later, then?
And what's this item?
"Sandboxes and swings"?
It's a problem to keep them occupied.
When I was young, we didn't have a play problem, because we didn't have time to play. No.
"Floor runner for the dormitory. "
- What's the matter with the linoleum?
- It's been so cold this winter.
The children have coughed so badly that I've been worried.
No need for that.
Madam, you have no doubt heard of the famous Wyckoffs cough mixture.
Of course.
I have manufactured and sold that cough mixture for many years.
Anyone taking it regularly will never cough.
I would suggest that you lay in a fresh supply.
- Very well.
- When I was young, I lived in Maine, where the weather was 20 below zero.
In those days, we didn't even have linoleum.
And look at me now.
When I was young, I lived in Maine, where the weather was about a thousand below zero.
No, no, Mrs Denham.
No carpets, no linoleum, no nothin'.
And look at me now.
Madam, is this the kind of respect you teach them?!
Oh, my goodness!
- How dare you take my hat and coat!
- I beg your pardon, but those are mine.
- Yours?
- Yes.
Oh, yes. I see.
- This eyesight of mine is bad, you know.
- I was only playing.
There, Mrs Higgins.
That's what comes of letting them play.
- Ridiculing their benefactors.
- I'm sorry.
It seems to me that this child is absolutely incorrigible.
Every time I see her, she's making a disturbance.
- She is rather a problem.
- Problem?
She's the sort of problem that might be better solved at a public institution.
- We couldn't send her away.
- I say you shall send her away!
I say she'll have to go to a public institution.
She'll have to do nothing of the kind.
If she's sent away,
I shan't contribute another cent.
- Now, Mr Morgan, you can't...
- Oh, yes, I can.
Mrs Higgins, I'd like to talk to you and to this little girl privately.
- Your office would be the best place.
- Why, of course, Mr Morgan.
Young lady, I've got a great idea.
Would you like me to tell it to you?
- Yes.
- Elizabeth.
Excuse me. Yes, sir.
That's better.
Now look here. Here's the secret.
How would you like it if you and I got to be very, very good friends?
- I don't think I would like it, sir.
- Why, Elizabeth!
I would like to talk to Elizabeth alone.
Do you mind?
- Of course not.
- Thank you.
Tell me. Why wouldn't you like to be friends with me?
- Oh, just because.
- Just because?
You've got to give me a much better reason than that.
Well, it's just because when grown-ups come to visit us we have to say "Yes, ma'am" and "No, sir" and smile all the time.
- Can you keep a secret?
- A secret?
Mm-hm.
- I won't tell anybody.
- Shake.
Now, here's the secret:
You don't have to say any of those things to me.
You see, all this business out here is new to me.
- My regular business is being a lawyer.
- What's a lawyer?
If you ever get into trouble, a lawyer is a person who gets you out of trouble.
Oh, my, I could use one almost every day.
- Tell me, what's your name, sweet?
- Elizabeth Blair.
Elizabeth Blair. I've got a much better name for you than that.
If I had my way, I'd call you Curly Top.
That's what my daddy used to call me, and my mommy too.
They did? I'll bet you're just as wise as wise can be.
- Well, I can recite.
- Recite? Recite what?
- Oh, poems.
- What kind of poems?
"Before I was a little girl,
I was a little bird.
"I could not laugh, I could not dance,
I could not speak a word.
"But all about the woods I went and up into the sky.
"And isn't it a pity I've forgotten how to fly?"
I think that's the loveliest poem I ever heard.
- I know more.
- Go right ahead.
"I wake in the morning early, and always the very first thing,
"I poke out my head, and I sit up in bed, and I sing and I sing and I sing. "
- I know more.
- I'll bet you do.
But listen, I've got a friend that...
- Oh, I bet that isn't true.
- What?
You said you had a friend.
I bet you have lots of friends.
Curly, you are an old flatterer.
- Is that something bad?
- Of course not, darling. Now, look here.
I'm pretty sure this friend of mine would like you.
I think he'd like to give you a beautiful home, lovely dresses to wear, dozens of dolls, and send you to the grandest kind of school and all sorts of nice things like that.
How could your friend do all that? I thought only daddies could do such nice things.
Well, being a lawyer, that's where that comes in.
You are too young to understand, but I could arrange with my friend to legally adopt you.
All I want you to tell me is how you'd like it if my friend could do those nice things for you.
- Would you want him to?
- I don't think I could do it.
You couldn't? Why not?
Do I have to say right off?
You mean you want time to think it over?
- Could I come back and tell you in a while?
- Why, of course. I'll wait for you right here.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Cross your heart?
Mary!
Mary! Oh, Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Mary!
Mrs Denham, suppose that youngster had a real chance in life.
Suppose someone gave her everything money can buy.
Of course, we always hope our children may be adopted.
But Elizabeth's case presents a special problem. You see...
There's no human problem that can't be solved by kindness.
- By Jove, Mrs Denham, I'll do it.
- You mean that you'll adopt Elizabeth?
On one condition. She must never know that I'm her guardian.
Why not?
Because she's always had to give thanks for every mouthful.
She's never gonna have to be grateful to me.
From now on, she's going to have all the lovely things in life, just because she has a right to them.
- But the child will have to be told something.
- That's right. Let's see.
I've got it. Tell her that I'm acting for a client.
We'll say that she's being adopted by a man by the name of...
- Let's call him Hiram Jones.
- Oh, Mr Morgan...
Before you go on, there's something about Elizabeth that you must know.
Come in.
Well, have you made up your mind?
- You haven't? Why not?
- Could I tell your friend?
My friend?
Oh!
You mean Mr Jones. Hiram Jones, hm?
What is it you want to tell him?
I would like to tell him that I'd love to go and live in his house if my sister could come too.
- Your sister?
- Yes, my sister, Mary.
- She works in the kitchen. There she is.
- This is Mary Blair, Mr Morgan.
We've met.
Isn't my sister pretty?
And she's awfully nice, too.
Mr Morgan, I'm very grateful to you -
I mean, to your friend - for wanting to adopt Curly.
But you see, when my father and mother...
- Darling, could you run outside?
- Must I?
- I think you'd better.
- All right.
You see, Mr Morgan, at the time my father and mother were killed...
- Killed?
- Yes, in an automobile accident.
- I'm so sorry.
- At the hospital, just before they... just before they died,
I promised them Curly and I would never be separated.
I couldn't break that promise, Mr Morgan.
She needs me. And I need her.
I understand.
I hope you'll thank your friend for us.
Please tell him how grateful we are, but...
Goodbye, Mr Morgan.
- I like that.
- Thank you, Aunt Genevieve.
- One of your own compositions?
- The melody came to me only this evening.
Quite the nicest thing you've ever done,
Edward. It has real feeling.
Your little nephew has real feeling, my darling, just like anyone else.
I'm going upstairs to write some letters.
I'll come down and kiss you good night before I go to bed.
- Promise?
- I do.
All right, it's a bargain.
In the meantime I shall be thinking up at least six new compliments for you.
Edward?
Edward.
- Aunt Genevieve.
- Well, I'm waiting.
- For what?
- For my compliments, of course.
- You promised me an even half-dozen.
- So I did.
I shan't be able to keep my promise.
I've been very busy.
- Busy.
- Word of honour.
I've been playing an old and charming game.
I've been daydreaming.
Just suppose, for example...
See that painting there?
But of course I do. I'll have you know my eyesight's every bit as good as it ever was.
Suppose the figure of that lovely child should suddenly come to life.
Suppose it smiled at you and waved its hand.
- What would you do?
- I'd call a doctor.
Now, Edward, now, now, take it easy.
Well, the truth of the matter is,
I just love your game.
I'd adore it if the child in that picture could come into this home and actually live with us.
Do you really mean that, Aunt Genevieve?
There's nothing that makes a home so happy as the sound of a chil飐 laughter.
- By Jove, I'll do it.
- Do what?
We'll open our place at Southampton. I can arrange for all the necessary legal details.
You can do all the shopping required:
Dresses and all the gadgets that go with them.
We'll have a glorious summer.
I'll send the limousine out next week...
- For what?
- For that lovely child in the painting.
Now, Edward, game or no game, you sound to me a little tetched in the head.
I've gone mad, Aunt Genevieve.
Delightfully mad.
- I think I will send for that doctor.
- I should if I were you.
And before the doctor arrives, let me be the first to congratulate you.
- Congratulate me? For what?
- My dear, you're about to become a mother.
- Bye, Mrs Denham.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Mrs Higgins.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mrs Higgins.
- All right, Mister.
- Very good, Miss.
Goodbye, Jeanie. Goodbye, Betsy.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Henrietta, what are you blubbering about?
I can't help it. I'm so happy.
There's no need to be sentimental.
What are you crying for?
Why shouldn't I? Why can't I be happy too?
Mrs Higgins said that now we're going to live in high society we must always remember to be grand ladies.
Oh, I won't forget.
My word!
Will you tell Mr Morgan that Miss Blair and her sister are here?
Hello, Mister.
Elizabeth.
Am I to understand that the livestock are also calling on Mr Morgan?
- They are.
- My word!
- A Miss Blair and her sister to see you, sir.
- Aunt Genevieve, they're here.
Hello.
Curly!
Well, where in the world did the menagerie come from?
- They were right behind us all the time.
- Right behind you?
Yes, sir, in the back seat.
Aunt Genevieve, meet our new family.
- Mary, Elizabeth, this is Aunt Genevieve.
- My dears, I'm very glad to see you both.
- Won't you come in?
- Hello.
Hello!
Oh, Reynolds, will you see to it that our other guests are comfortably taken care of?
You mean the, uh... livestock, sir?
Right.
Butling to a pony and a duck!
Now, no nonsense now.
I say, do you understand what I'm saying to you?
My word!
- How do you like your new home?
- It's wonderful.
- Would you like to look round?
- Mm-hm.
But first I would like to see where
Spunky and Betsy are going to sleep.
Oh, no, Edward.
Elizabeth must rest before dinner.
- Come now, Aunt...
- Mr Jones has given strict orders.
Mr Jones insists that Elizabeth and Mary have only the best of care.
- I see. Well, we can't argue with Mr Jones.
- That's what I thought.
All right, then, Mr Jones wins.
But I'll see you all at dinner, hm?
Come, dear.
Breakfast at eight. Luncheon at one.
Dinner at seven.
My word!
I think this will help you, Miss.
Allow me.
Now I'm just like a grown-up.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Miss.
Why, I didn't do anything.
- Yes, Miss?
- Wouldn't you like to sit down too?
Well...
- Coffee on the terrace, Reynolds.
- Very good, sir.
Could I say something to Mr Reynolds, privately?
I think it could be arranged.
But don't stay too long.
I won't.
I want to thank you for a very nice dinner, sir.
Thank you, Miss.
You wish for something else, Miss?
What is it, Miss?
Couldn't you come down here so I could talk to you?
Oh, my word, you are a package!
Will you be my friend?
Whenever I do anything wrong at the table, will you always stop me?
I will indeed, Miss.
- Promise?
- I do, Miss.
I'll always attempt to serve you as if... as if you were a princess.
A princess? My, you are nice.
- Happy?
- I didn't know such happiness existed.
Promise to let me know if Mr Jones can do more for you?
He couldn't do anything more.
- But you could do me a great favour.
- Done. What?
Tell me all about Mr Jones.
Not knowing him or even what he looks like makes him seem such a strange person.
He is a strange sort of person, Mary.
Very strange.
Perhaps I can best explain him to you if I tell you what he said just before you came here.
Do tell me.
He told me that all of his life he's had a hunger in his heart.
A hunger to love and be loved just for himself.
Said he'd travelled all over the world
- Europe, Egypt, the Orient - he'd searched everywhere for a simple sort of happiness and companionship.
- He never found it?
- Not real happiness.
He will find it someday. He must.
Maybe you're right, Mary.
Happiness may come to Jones, and soon.
Just before he sailed for Europe, he said that, at last, there was... hope in his heart.
I wish I could thank him for all he's done.
Tell him how grateful I am for all the happiness he's brought to Curly and me.
Just knowing that you and Curly have found happiness here, that'll make him happy.
I can promise you that.
This is not a dream, is it?
No, darling. Come to bed now.
- Good night. Did you say your prayers?
- Mm-hm.
- Mary?
- Yes, dear?
My pyjamas feel awfully nice.
What are they made of, Mary?
- Silk.
- Silk?
Oh, my goodness!
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Mary.
Uncle Edward said that Mr Jones was going to send you to a music school.
Uh-huh.
And he said that he was going to give me a pony cart and lots of pretty dresses.
I know, dear. It's all so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.
But we mustn't talk about it any more tonight.
It's time to go to sleep. Good night.
Good night.
Mary... is Mr Hiram Jones a very rich man?
He must be, darling.
Do you think maybe he could be the richest man in the world?
Mm, he might be.
The richest man in all the world?
Oh, my goodness!
- Your Southampton bills, sir.
- Thank you.
Two aquaplane boards. Don't you think it's dangerous for that youngster to...?
Dangerous? That child swims like a fish.
I really believe she's Neptune's daughter in disguise.
I hope you enjoyed your lunch,
Miss Elizabeth.
- I always like to eat.
- A splendid habit, Miss, if I may say so.
- Did my pony and duck have a nice lunch?
- Oh, quite, Miss.
- Are you going to give me a nice dinner?
- Without fail, Miss.
- I wish you wouldn't bow so much.
- I'm sorry, Miss.
There you go again.
You'll make my back ache.
My word!
- Isn't that the funniest picture ever?
- Mm-hm.
Curly, careful of your eyes in this sunlight.
Oh, this won't hurt my eyes.
This is just the funny papers.
Isn't that the one I've read you at least a dozen times since Sunday?
Mm-hm.
- Will you read it to me again?
- Yes, if you like.
But suppose we wait until later in the afternoon, after you've had your nap?
All right. I won't forget.
Jimmie, the Atlantic Ocean seems rather quiet without you splashing about.
- Why aren't you swimming today?
- I couldn't make it today. I had to work.
Work? I hope you don't call flying that airplane of yours work.
Mary loves to fly.
She's been up lots of times with me.
Yes, she's told me all about it.
You've been very nice to Mary this summer.
- That isn't hard to do.
- No, I gathered you didn't find that hard work.
Mrs Graham, I'd like to talk to you about Mary.
- Well, there's no law against it.
- Mary is a wonderful girl, Mrs Graham.
We've had grand times together this summer.
Seems that, no matter what, we always like the same things.
She likes to fly with me, she's a beautiful dancer, and we're both crazy about all kinds of outdoor sport.
I'd like to talk about Mary to her guardian, Mr Jones.
- But the catch is that he's in Europe now.
- What would you like to say to Mr Jones?
Well, you see, Mary doesn't want to make up her mind about anything -
I mean, anything important - without Mr Jones' permission.
- I thought maybe I could write him a letter.
- What about?
Well, I... I really can't tell you that,
Mrs Graham.
- I haven't even told Mary about that.
- Oh, I see.
- Do you think I ought to write to Mr Jones...
- Jimmie.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Jimmie.
The water was wonderful.
Aunt Genevieve, did you sell him a ticket?
- Mary, I forgot.
- A ticket? For what?
Don't tell me you don't know about it.
We're giving a show.
- Who is? What's this all about?
- It's Curly's show, really.
I'm just going to help out.
It's a benefit performance.
- A benefit? For whom?
- Curly had the most charming idea, Jimmie.
She couldn't forget her friends in the orphanage.
She wanted to raise some money to buy playthings for them.
- It was so nice of you to come, Mrs Denham.
- Wild horses couldn't have kept me away.
Do you know, this is the biggest thrill of my life.
- I'd try awfully hard to make you happy.
- Jimmie, you're pretty swell, but I... I just couldn't marry you.
Is there someone else?
- I can't tell you that.
- Well, I know there is, all right.
I watched you at dinner tonight and I watched you...
Well, you're always looking at Mr Morgan.
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because I don't like him.
He's got a swelled head, and just because he's got all the money in the world, he...
Jimmie... I won't let you talk about him that way.
I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I'll always love you, Mary.
Even... even if you say you can't really care for me.
Oh, Jimmie...
Do stop that ridiculous prowling about.
You act as if you had the heebie-jeebies.
- I'm just restless.
- You've been restless for the last three days.
Ever since you arrived to see Curly's show.
Can't you think of something more interesting to talk about? I'm just nervous.
I might be able to change the subject if I really put my mind to it.
- It'd make a hit with me if you will.
- Very well.
Let me see, what shall we talk about?
- Have you seen Mary since dinner?
- Nope, I haven't.
She, uh... she went out somewhere with Jimmie, didn't she?
- How should I know?
- Don't they make an adorable couple?
- Do they?
- He's very much in love with her.
He's a wonderful catch. He comes into money on both sides of his family.
He does, does he? Maybe that's the reason he's got a swelled head.
That, and the brass buttons on his trick uniform.
Why, Edward, I didn't know you'd ever noticed Jimmie.
I am surprised to learn that you've even observed the kind of clothes he wears.
Conceited young idler.
- Will you stop laughing?
- I will not.
Edward Morgan, insanely jealous, and acting like a sixteen-year-old Romeo.
Oh, dear, this is the happiest moment of my life.
I'm not at all jealous. Do you think
I care anything about Mary Blair?
The only reason she's here is because it was impossible to take Elizabeth without her.
- I'm not in the least interested in Mary.
- I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
- Relieved? Why?
- Edward, I've been noticing things.
And I had convinced myself that you'd grown very fond of Mary.
- In which case, there might be complications.
- Complications?
I'll try to make myself clear.
I believe that Jimmie Rogers means to propose to Mary before the summer is over.
- How do you know that?
- I looked at him.
You think you can tell a thing like that by just looking at a man?
Any woman of my age and experience who can't tell just by looking at a man...
Oh, nonsense!
What are you thinking about?
- I'm not thinking. I've decided.
- Decided what?
- I'll get the fastest plane in the country.
- You aren't going to fly it yourself?
Certainly. Why not?
And that isn't all. I'm going to start learning some of those trick dances, too.
- I'll make you happy, Mary. I know I will.
- I believe you, Jimmie.
- Oh, hello, Mr Morgan.
- Jimmie, will you pardon me?
- Mary, I want to talk to you alone.
- You'll have to ask me about that, sir.
- What?
- Jimmie.
I want to tell him. I'm the luckiest man in the world, Mr Morgan.
Lucky? What do you mean?
- Mary and I have just become engaged, sir.
- Engaged?
That's right, sir. The way I feel about it, well,
I just want to go out and tell the whole world.
I understand, Jimmie.
You should be very proud.
Mary's a fine girl.
- I want to be the first to congratulate you.
- Thank you, sir.
Mary, my congratulations to you.
I'm sure that you and Jimmie will find real happiness.
- I'll do everything to make that come true.
- I'm sure.
And if there's ever anything I can do to add to your happiness - anything, understand? -
- I want you to promise to let me know.
- Say, Mr Morgan, you're pretty swell.
- I mean it, Jimmie, every word of it.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, good night. Good night and my best to both of you, always.
Uncle Edward! Uncle Edward!
Time to get up.
Uncle Edward.
Oh, my goodness!
Sleepy head! If you aren't really awake,
I can jump on your stomach again.
Never mind!
- You can't go back to sleep again.
- This is Sunday morning...
Oh, no, Uncle Edward. No, sir!
All right, you win.
- Read me the funny papers?
- Wait a minute.
How about breakfast and Sunday school?
I like Sunday school. Will you take me?
- Yes, siree.
- Give me a ride?
- I'll get your bathrobe and slippers.
- All right.
Yippee!
All right, that's enough of that.
Now, I want you to tell me everything you've been doing while I've been away.
I've been in the city for a whole week.
What have you been up to?
- Every day I was wishing that you were here.
- Curly, you flatterer.
- Any special reason you wanted to see me?
- Very special.
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- All right, here I am. What is it?
Well, I wanted to talk to you about getting married.
What?!
Curly, whatever put that notion into your funny little head?
- Please don't laugh, Uncle Edward.
- I'm sorry. I forgot that this was very special.
Now, just what is it you want to know about getting married?
- Well... what does getting married mean?
- You mean like Jimmie and Mary?
That means they'll have their own home and always live together.
Mary said that I was going to live in Jimmie's house.
Does that mean Jimmie's getting married to me too?
- I'll tell you all about that some other time.
- I don't want to get married to Jimmie.
- Why not?
- I want Mary and me to get married to you.
Curly, you're a designing woman.
Now get up and get out of here.
I've got to get dressed. Do you hear me?
Come on.
Now, breakfast, funnies,
Sunday school and lunch.
- Then I've got a real surprise for you.
- Is it a present?
It wouldn't be a surprise any more if I told you.
Mary! Mary!
My word!
- Look at Aunt Genevieve.
- Edward, how dare you spy on me!
- What's the matter, growing pains?
- Why shouldn't I grow up?
- Please, Uncle Edward, what's my surprise?
- I have two surprises for you, young lady.
- Two?!
- Mm-hm.
Come on, darling.
- Ready for the first one?
- I can hardly wait.
You won't have to wait - not another minute.
You sit right here and listen very, very carefully.
All right.
Whoopee!
- Oh, but you are a bundle ofjoy.
- That was beautiful, dear.
Thank you.
Have you got a present for me too?
Yes, one for you and one for Mary.
- Will you run and tell Mary to come in?
- Mm-hm.
Mary! Mary!
Uncle Edward has a surprise for us.
You might as well admit that you're in love with Mary.
- Why don't you tell her so?
- Haven't you heard the news?
It so happens that
Mary's engaged to Jimmie.
Have you ever told her that you love her?
Here she is, Uncle Edward.
- Can I have my surprise first?
- Yes, indeed you may.
- Oh, goodie.
- Here you are, young lady.
A string of pearls.
Pearls?
They lookjust like those little stones on the beach.
- Oh, Elizabeth!
- Do you like them?
I would really rather have a pair of roller skates.
Well, we'll throw them in for good measure.
I'm sailing for Europe next week.
Before I go, I want to give you an engagement present and wish you every happiness.
I can't take it.
Why not?
I wasn't really in love with Jimmie.
We're not engaged any more.
I told him last night.
- You aren't going to marry him?
- No.
- Mary, you'd better watch out.
- Watch out?
You might not get married at all.
I asked Uncle Edward to marry us this morning and he said he wouldn't.
- Oh, Elizabeth, you didn't?
- Oh, yes, I did.
Didn't I ask you to marry us, Uncle Edward?
Oh, Elizabeth!
Mary, wait. I... I want to talk with you.
What's the matter?
They seem kind of excited.
- We'll go abroad and stay a whole year.
- It sounds like heaven.
- We'll make it heaven, darling.
- Look, can't we share our happiness?
- What do you mean?
- With the person who made it possible.
- You mean Mr Jones?
- Yes.
Oh, Mary, you blind little sweetheart.
There never was any Mr Jones.
- You mean that... you're Mr...?
- Mm-hm.
Oh!
Mary, do you mind if Uncle Edward could come now and read me the funnies?
Oh, my word!
- What a laugh.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it doesn't mean a thing.
- They laughed at Edison, too.
Looks like I'm an assistant to a guy out of a job.
You remember when mahjong was popular, don't you, Harry?
- So what?
- It's a fad.
I've staged 50 musical comedies and I'll stage 50 more.
I hope you're right.
Frazer and Gould are putting
Never Say No into rehearsal... and I'm doing the numbers.
- Am I going with you?
- Lf they don't run out of ink. Let's go.
- Hiya, Kent.
- Hello, boys.
When does Never Say No go into rehearsal?
Chester, it don't. You can't give the public what they don't want.
- What show are you gonna do?
- No show if we're in our right mind.
People ain't paying for shows no more.
Talking pictures is what they want.
So, it don't mean a thing, huh?
Plays is a dead issue.
We're in the picture business, exhibitors.
Yeah, we just bought four houses.
They deliver the show in tin cans and we got nothing to worry about.
So musicals are out, huh?
Yeah, come on around the corner and I'll show you why.
Yeah, come on around the corner and I'll show you why.
There's the answer.
It's a lot better to fill your theater
10 times a day at 40 cents a ticket... than to charge $5 a seat and have it half-filled once a night.
- Yeah, if you're lucky.
- Come on, I'll show you.
Won't last.
Excuse me, Zeke, offical busness.
From now on, he'll be gettng plenty
of orders, but they won't all be by wre.
- Here's your answer.
- Oh, well, no matter.
I'm so proud of you, John.
So, you're in the picture business, hey, Si?
Who's that, Whistler's mother?
There's competition.
We're booking a house down the street.
So we give them a little prologue to fit the picture.
What's the picture, Uncle Tom 's Cabn?
We're showing Slaves of the Desert.
So we put on something oriental to fit the plot.
That prologue wouldn't fit anything but an ash can.
Just the same, it costs more than the picture.
Say, why don't you let me put on some of those prologues for you?
- No, no. No more prologues.
- No more prologues, Chester.
That oriental flesh is too expensive.
After this, we're giving our customers talking pictures and nothing else.
Well, so long.
I gotta break the bad news to the wife.
Red line, I hear you calling me.
Public wants talking pictures and talking pictures only.
Listen, what you better do is get yourself another job.
Maybe I haven't made myself understood, honey.
They're not doing any more musical shows.
I always said they'd catch up with you.
Is it my fault if somebody invented talking pictures?
I don't care whose fault it is.
It's time you earned some money.
I'm used to good clothes and everything that goes with it.
- Well, haven't I always given you...
- Yeah. What goes with it.
Listen, I'm fed up with you and I have been for a long time.
Well.
- What shall we do about it?
- I'll show you.
Here, sign that and I'll be tickled to death to get a divorce.
- You sure this is the way you want it?
- Absolutely.
Well, that's that.
Here's your aspirin, 18 cents.
Say, how do you do it?
The place next door charges a quarter.
Yeah, but he's on his own.
We got 100 stores.
- What does that mean?
- We buy in big lots.
When you're buying for one store, you get soaked.
When you're buying for 100...
I see, practically name your own price.
That's it.
Say, that's marvelous.
The chain store idea solves everything.
Thanks a million.
- Hey, your aspirin!
- Take it yourself. My headache's gone.
Come on, Al.
Listen, boys, I just bought some aspirin.
- Drunk again?
- No, listen to this, listen to this.
When you've got one drugstore, you charge 25 cents for aspirin.
But when you're buying for 100 stores, you get it for less.
- So you sell it for 18 cents.
- So what?
So your house, I mean, your store is crowded.
That's great, Chester, old boy.
That's a marvelous idea.
Well, don't you get the connection?
Yeah, we'll use it.
If we ever open a drugstore.
No, listen. When you put on one prologue, it's too expensive.
But when the same prologue plays 25, 50, 100 houses... it doesn't cost a cent more, get it?
- We might have something there.
- Yeah?
No, the same scenery, same costumes, put them on once and they stay put on.
But we've only got four theaters.
Play them all over Chicago, all over the country.
Exhibitors everywhere will be tickled pink to get ready-made prologues.
- How do you know?
- It's a cinch.
You can give them swell prologues... cheaper than they can put them on themselves. Why?
Because you're in the chain store business.
- Si, he's right.
- No question about it.
Boys, your name'll be in lights from the rock bottom coast of Maine... to the sunny strands of California.
You'll have to wait a minute.
Will you take a seat, please?
Good morning.
- How about a job, Miss Prescott?
- See Arnold, the casting director.
- Any mail?
- Nine out-of-town calls.
Only nine? We must be slipping.
- Hello.
- Good morning.
- Is the boss in yet?
- I haven't seen Mr. Kent this morning.
- Maybe you blinked and missed him?
- Possibly.
- Hello, girls!
- Hello, Nan!
- Mr. Gould wants to see Mr. Kent.
- Oh, I'll put that in my memory book.
- Is Mr. Kent in?
- No, but I'm his secretary.
- This is something very personal.
- That's the kind of a secretary I am.
Well, you see, I'm a title-thinker-upper.
Honest, I am.
My real business is insurance... but I have a lot of spare time so I think up titles.
- Right out of your head?
- Yes, here's some I thought up yesterday.
"Girls of Spain, Girls of France,
Girls of South America"...
Keep them under your hat.
What do you do, just travel around the world?
That's right.
Maybe you could use them for prologues.
I'll sell them cheap.
Tell you what you do, you go over to Gladstone.
Sounds like his kind of stuff.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
Here you are.
- Cats!
- First drink that.
Working all night again. I thought you said you were going home early.
I did go home, that is...
I mean, I started to go home, right after dress rehearsal, about 3:00 a.m.
And then bingo! I got an idea. Cats!
I was walking on the street and saw some cats.
You ever see cats walk? Just like that.
A regular dance rhythm.
- So, you came right back here?
- That's just what I did.
I got the whole thing all mapped out.
Seven boys and seven girls, tomcats and pussycats, cast down in one.
Then we go to full stage with an alley drop... with the ash cans and a board fence.
Twelve girls come out in kitten costumes.
They're the children, see?
Now forget the cats, will you?
If you don't let up, you're going to meow yourself into a padded cell.
Now, go on, get washed and I'll get you a clean shirt.
You're right, Nan. You're perfectly right.
Perfectly right.
But it's still a good idea.
- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks.
Oh, get Mr. Kent some tomato juice, toast and coffee.
And a bottle of milk for the cat.
Hello? Yes, all right, wait a minute.
Hold on.
The Gay Nineties unit calling from Kansas City.
The park number runs too long.
All right, I'll talk to him.
Hello? Hello, cut out your first chorus and open up with your second.
That'll fix it, won't it? All right, fine.
Two units came in yesterday, finished their tour.
Say, you're slowing up.
Haven't sent out a unit this week.
We're getting two next week.
That is if I can stay out of the laughing academy that long.
I put a peach into rehearsal yesterday.
Prosperity idea.
- Ring Harry for me, will you?
- Skulking Thompson?
- What have you got against him?
- Just don't like him, that's all.
Sometimes I get the feeling you don't like anybody.
If you only knew.
Come in.
- Hello, Bea.
- Hello, Nan.
Good morning, Mr. Kent.
- Where's Thompson?
- Out for a few minutes.
He'll be out for life if he doesn't stick closer to business.
Gould signed 30 more theaters.
That means I've got to think of three new prologues a week.
Dust off the straightjacket, baby, we'll need it.
You'll need it.
Mr. Kent, about the bridesmaid unit, we're short six mirrors.
Well, take the...
Yeah?
What?
Wait a minute.
- More trouble.
- What is it?
Theater in Savannah burned down, costumes and scenery ruined.
Never a dull moment.
- The soldier girl unit?
- Yeah.
This is their last week.
Why not bring them in?
That's right.
Hello, this is your last week, isn't it?
Bring them in, we'll put them in something else.
What?
A nice, big coffin, and I'll lie down alongside.
There's a girl for you.
- What kind of a girl?
- With brains!
You can buy beautiful women a dime a dozen.
- She's got up here.
- So have I.
- What?
- A headache.
Always the rap.
Here's Old Man River.
- Hey, Chester!
- Not Harry Thompson?
Yeah, with a peach of an idea for a unit.
Now get this... all the girls come in dressed as different flowers.
Then for a finish, the leading lady is the American Beauty rose.
Stop, you're killing me.
I almost fell out of my cradle when the Shuberts did it back in 1912.
- What a memory.
- Old Faithful, I calls it.
Hoofers like elephants never forget, baby.
Here, Harry, here's a cat idea.
Get it started right away.
Yeah? Yeah, this is Kent.
All right, I'll fix it.
The Iceland unit's in trouble, cupidal man married the leading lady.
And they're both in the hospital.
That's quick work.
Listen, Nan, send a new boy and girl in right away.
Make sure they're not in love with each other.
Get a couple already married.
- Say, Gould wants to see you.
- Nothing strange about that.
- This cat thing ain't bad.
- Well, keep it that way.
Nan, there's some notes down there on a jigsaw puzzle unit and a willow tree idea.
- Type them up, will you?
- I will.
American Beauty rose.
He said only the cat idea.
Yeah?
Why should we give him a job?
What can he do?
Why, Scott's a lovely singer and dancer.
Isn't he, Si?
Why, he won his spurs in college shows.
Oh, dear, dear Mr. Kent, for my sake, now I implore you...
Now, Harriet, don't get excited.
You know what the doctor said.
Say, there's an idea, Si. A doctor unit.
The girls, doctors, and the boys, patients.
The girls give the boys a shot in the arm and they go into a big dance, like this.
- Divine, simply divine.
- Like the idea?
Oh, it's a beautiful idea.
Oh, now you see, dear Mr. Kent...
Scott is my protégé and Scott is such a dear boy, with the sweetest tenor voice.
Oh, please, please, Mr. Kent!
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.
Mr. Gould is very busy.
I'll say he's busy.
They're talking about me.
That shouldn't take very long.
I'm gonna work here.
Mrs. Gould is giving Kent the good news.
Really? Well, as far as I know, we have all the office boys we need.
I'm a singer, starred in two shows at Arkansas College.
Rah, rah.
Our shows play in theaters, not colleges.
Why, he's waiting outside.
Ready and eager to start his career.
Your mistake.
Mr. Kent will be delighted to engage you.
Mr. Kent, I want you to meet Mr. Blair.
- How do you do, sir?
- Oh, it's your great opportunity!
Thanks, Harriet.
Well, I must say adieu now.
I've gotta go see Si about a check.
Come with me and I'll put you in the cat unit.
- That's keen.
- Don't be so optimistic.
- Meow.
- Meow.
- Hello, Fannie.
- My name's Myrtle, Mr. Kent.
Myrtle?
Come on, girls.
All right, that's good.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Once again.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Hold it!
- Got a new boy for you, Mac.
- I don't need him.
Neither did I but I caught him.
He's yours, now.
Sit down.
In sprngtme, n fall tme
I face the sun at all tmes
I'm one step ahead of my shadow
It's fathful and noble
The deuce of all my troubles
I'm havng a jolly tme
Travelng the world and I'm
One step ahead of my shadow
Hold it, hold it!
What's the matter now?
This number's as dead as Chelsea's tonsils.
I worry about this and I worry about that...
Yeah, I know.
You got the kids looking worried, too.
This is a prosperity unit.
Some life and some pep.
Dance on your feet, don't die on them.
Here's the way to attack that finish.
Come on, let's go.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- All right. Then do it.
I get it, but I got too much on my shoulders.
It's all her fault.
She gives me absolutely nothing.
How can we look prosperity when he's got depression all over that pan of his?
There, you see, Mr. Kent?
See what I'm up against?
I'm afraid if this keeps up
I'll have to resign.
You and me both. But until we do, keep on working, will you?
Come on, let's do it.
All right now, come on.
Give us a pickup there. Come on. Right!
It's fathful and noble
The deuce of all my troubles
I'm havng a jolly tme
Travelng the world and I'm
One step ahead of my shadow
Now what?
We'll have to call off the prosperity unit.
Gladstone just put one on.
I slave day and night worrying about ideas and Gladstone steals them.
He's been doing it for months.
- All right, girls, let's try it again.
- No, call it off. Prosperity unit's out.
That's all, girls. You're excused. What's in?
The cat number. We'll put it in rehearsal right away and you're it.
I don't know anything about cats.
I never had a cat.
I've got one for you. It's up in my office.
Yeah, but what'll I do with it?
Go up and get him. Make a pal of him.
Study his movements.
Oh, no, listen, I'm an animal trainer, not a dance director.
Oh, no, I'm a dance trainer, not an animal...
You got me so worried
I don't know what I am.
I got bad news for you, Chester.
You can't use the cat idea.
You're gonna start to tell me what I can and what I can't use.
It's my job to see that our prologues fit in with the censor's regulations.
I'm only doing my duty.
Oh, I see, the tomcats and the pussycats are all right.
- But the kittens are illegitimate.
- They certainly are.
Unless they're married by a preacher cat.
No preacher cat, no kittens.
No, you can't use it in 39 cities.
Well, I've got some bad news for you.
You're fired.
You can't fire me. Mrs. Gould's my sister.
I don't care if she's your Aunt Minnie.
Get out of here and stay out.
- Yeah, we'll see about that.
- Get out of here!
Get that cat out of here.
You don't suppose I want him in here, do you?
Now I got cats to worry about.
I better quit, huh?
We'll go into that later, sweetheart.
Mr. Kent, I have here got all the cat music from our library.
- Anything good?
- Yeah, sure.
"Cat and the Fddle, Ktten on the Keys,
You are the Cats...
"Cats on Parade, Cat's Meow, Crazy Cat...
"Pussycat, Pussycat,
Where Have You Been?
"Me and My Cat Both Love You, and Love Me and Love My Cat. "
- Thompson just came in.
- Well, stall him till I get there.
Get Ktten on the Keys right over to Francis... and make an orchestration of Cats on Parade in B flat.
- Cats on Parade in B flat.
- Children!
Children, gather around.
I want you to watch this cat.
So I'm giving you some advice.
Go out and find yourself a nice, new job.
I got one.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
From now on my business address is
General Director, Gladstone Prologues.
Well, that's fine. After they fire you... you can put on your dance at the Old Soldier's Home.
The gate's open.
Gladstone.
- I bet that's our leak.
- I bet you're right.
Why, that dirty lowdown...
Oh, well.
He'll wind up checking soldiers when he has to think of his own ideas.
He's full of them.
Like American Beauty rose.
Say, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna keep a half a dozen of the chorus people here as models.
Teach the new kids the steps. Like it?
Yes, I do. Say, I'll tell you somebody who'd be swell for a job like that.
- Who?
- Bea Thorn.
- No, too valuable where she is.
- But she's a swell dancer.
- Used to do a turn in vaudeville.
- No, I don't think she'd be interested.
Whatever you say, boss.
- Listen, kid, I'm checking out.
- Lf you go, dear, so do I.
No, I want you to stick.
I've got a special reason.
But I'll never see you.
Yes, you will. We'll have dinner tonight.
Meet me at my place at 7:00.
I'll tell you how you can help me.
Dear Mr. Kent, I promised my father
I'd always look after Charlie.
Think it over, will you, Chester?
All right, all right. Take him back.
Only keep away from me or I'll sock you right in your blue nose.
And don't you dare let him fire any more of my relatives.
Come along, Charlie.
One, two, three, four.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
These are cats, not elephants.
This is about what I want.
Look, watch carefully.
Oh, I get it.
No, I want that certain rhythm.
That certain rhythm, it's preying on my mind.
What you've got to do is watch that cat.
I hate cats. I can't get away from him.
I've done everything but sleep with him.
Well, sleep with him. You've gotta get it.
Now go to work.
All right, girls, now please, pay attention, will you?
- I want you to get this. Now watch me.
- Hold it, Mac, hold it.
- Now, watch!
- Hold it!
The Egyptian unit just came in, 29 people.
Call them for rehearsal tomorrow morning.
We'll put them in the mechanical doll unit.
You must put brassieres on those dolls.
You know Connecticut.
What do they have to do in Massachusetts?
Wear red flannel drawers?
Rehearsal's off.
Call them back at 8:00 tonight.
Rehearsal's over, kids.
Back at 8:00 tonight.
- Hello. Say, did you see me dancing?
- Do you crochet, too?
No, not me, but I got a tenor voice people come miles to hear.
Here's a sample of it:
Sweet Adelne
Hey, wait a minute. What's the matter?
Don't you like it?
You must've gone over big at Arkansas College.
Well, I guess you don't appreciate me.
Oh, no? Well, here comes someone who does. Mrs. Gould, he's waiting.
Oh, Scott, dear. I'm just in time.
Yep, just in time.
A wet nurse to an alley cat.
Closing time.
Yeah, another day, another gray hair.
Wonder what it's getting me.
- You're a one-third partner, aren't you?
- Yep. My third does all the work.
While the other two-thirds drag down the money.
Yeah. Maybe it's better to be one of the help.
I'm supposed to be getting a percentage of the profits.
But so far everything's gone back into production.
So they say.
Why don't you do some investigating?
I'm too busy.
I'm daffy trying to think up new ideas.
We've done everything.
"Soldier Girl Unit, Bull Fighters,
Blue Girls...
"Ghost, Baby Dolls, Voo-Doo,
Russian Revolution."
There's nothing left in the world.
A unit a week.
Where am I going to get any more ideas?
When I do get them,
Gladstone steals them.
I'm falling apart.
Why don't you get something to eat and go right home?
No, I can't. I gotta stay and dovetail all this cat unit stuff.
If I promise to take him home with me, will you go right to bed?
It's a bargain.
Say, what's the name of that foreigner that built the monster he couldn't stop?
Frankenstein.
Shake hands with his Aunt Emma.
Good night.
Frankenstein. Swell idea for a unit.
That looks vaguely familiar.
Bonsor, Nanette.
- Vivian!
- I got the janitor to let me in.
I knew you wouldn't mind putting me up for a day or two.
- I thought you were in Hollywood.
- I was.
The pictures bored me.
So little culture out there, my dear.
- What is this culture gag all of a sudden?
- I beg your pardon?
Now, relax, will you?
I said, "All of a sudden."
Last time I saw you, your conversation was practically dese, dems, and doses.
We grow up, you know.
What was it Professor Malanoff said?
"Life is..."
- "Life is..."
- Just a bowl of cherries?
- No, but that's a very interesting thought.
- Nerts.
Yeah, sure I love you.
But now listen, give me the dope.
What's happening at Frazer and Gould's?
They're rehearsing a new act.
The girls dress like mechanical dolls and the boys wind them up.
Mr. Kent got the idea today.
Swell. Move it, babe, while I give it to Gladstone.
Remember now, you can only stay till Aunt Clara... or somebody or something comes through.
- Who is it?
- Kent. I wanna talk with you.
Just a minute. You answer the door.
Come in, won't you?
Be right out. The girl is Miss Rich.
Vivian, Mr. Kent.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
In California, I never missed a Chester Kent Prologue.
They were all so... What shall I say?
Intellectually devised.
I'm glad you liked them, Miss Rich.
I wouldn't call them exactly intellectual.
You're just modest.
Every one had a definite central theme.
Brains, you know.
- Maybe you're right at that.
- Anything special?
I got some new ideas on that cat stuff, wanted the outline.
It's on the desk.
Most prologues, Mr. Kent, are utterly commonplace.
But yours, yours have meaning.
What was it Ruskin said?
"That intangible something."
Oh, Vivian? What ever happened to that boyfriend of yours?
Is he still a bootlegger?
- Nan is so bourgeois at times.
- Swell gal, though, works like a slave.
Speaking of that, I was reading a most interesting book, Slavery In Old Afrca.
- Have you read it?
- I don't even have time to read my mail.
Oh, it's filled with the most fascinating pictures.
- All the women were slaves...
- Hold it, Vivian, I is a coming!
Say, that's a natural.
- Where is this book?
- I think I know a shop that keeps it.
I can see it now. Pretty girls in black face.
"Slaves of Old Africa."
White men capture them.
- Can we get that book tonight?
- Perhaps, if we leave right away.
- Well, let's get going.
- Oh dear, I forgot. I've had no dinner.
Well, have it with me.
After we find a bookshop.
I'd adore it.
Good night, Nanette.
Oh, good night. Never mind the outline.
I think I've got a new one.
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.
Mr. Francis?
The music department sent down this new arrangement.
Give it to Joe. Can't you see I'm busy?
I've got everything on my shoulders.
Music, costume, girls, cats.
And now I'm beginning to sniffle.
I feel as though I'm coming down with a dreadful...
Now that's where Scotty comes in.
- Where is he?
- He isn't in yet.
Mr. Kent's gonna hear about this.
From the beginning, girls.
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.
You know you're late, don't you?
Good mornng, dear teacher
Good mornng to you
I'm going to report you.
Mr. Kent is very strict about chorus people being on time.
- I'm not in the chorus anymore.
- Oh.
- They threw me out.
- I'm sorry.
And you were gonna report me.
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.
One, two, three...
Perhaps I could speak to Mr. Kent.
He might...
Now that's not fair, Miss Thorn.
You know I'm all upset. Look.
My hair's turning gray with so much on my mind... and you're keeping Scotty from rehearsals.
But he isn't in your chorus anymore.
Well, of course, he isn't.
They made him a principal last night.
A principal! Him?
I told you your favorite people had a voice.
All these annoyances piling up.
Come on, Scotty.
I'm waiting for you to sing that number.
Don't get a cold, will you? Come on.
- So long, time clock.
- So long, crooner.
Here's the statement for the last six months.
Profits going up all the time.
And here's the statement for Mr. Kent.
No profits at all.
Well, Mr. Kent's statement shows that all profits go back into production.
- Is that right?
- Exactly.
- Draw $20,000 in cash for Gould and me.
- Charge it to production costs as usual.
Yes, and take a century note for yourself.
- Good morning.
- Is it still morning?
You beautiful girl.
Nice of you to drop in.
There's some mighty pretty country around here.
Eleven wires, nine phone calls and one secretary slowly going out of her mind.
Arrange an audition for some girls.
I want one to sing that number with Scotty.
And I'm starting a new department today:
Styles and Ideas.
- Who's gonna run it?
- She'll be here in a minute.
Has brains and all kinds of culture.
Just what we need.
Gave me a swell idea: Slaves of Old Africa.
A hit.
I should've kicked her out the minute I saw her.
Hello?
Four girls from the Swiss Navy unit married a quartet in Philadelphia...
- yesterday and they wanna quit.
- Quartet any good?
Is the quartet any good? Yeah.
- Put them in the act.
- Put them in the act.
- Sorry, Chester, to keep you waiting.
- Hello, Vivian.
This is Miss Rich.
My secretary, Miss Prescott.
I know Miss Rich, if you remember.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I met her at your place.
Vivian is the head of our new Style and Idea department.
I hope you'll both be very happy.
Oh, Nan, would you get
Miss Rich an office?
I'm awfully busy, but I'll see that it's done.
This way, please.
Don't forget about our luncheon engagement, Chester.
- Right.
- She work here?
- Our new Style and Idea department... the head.
Splendid choice, Chester, splendid choice.
- Get her an office.
- Okay.
Here's our semi-annual statement.
- Maybe I'd be better off on a salary.
- I'll say you would.
When you've got a third interest?
Don't kid yourself.
Frazer and I ain't drawing a cent out of the business either.
It's tough on you boys.
I don't see how you get along.
And besides, Gladstone's copped the mechanical doll angle already.
- I'll stop it some way, Chester.
- That's gonna be a big help.
Between Gladstone stealing all our stuff... and you saying there are no profits...
I'm getting pretty well fed up.
But, Chester, think of the Apollo Deluxe Theater.
- So what?
- They're gonna do prologues.
- Forty houses.
- Have you signed them?
Apolinaris says they're too classy for our regular stuff.
And Gladstone's hot after the contract.
It's up to you, Chester, to think up something original.
Gladstone again. That means Thompson.
Well, we'll take care of him.
That's the spirit, Chester.
I knew we could count on you.
Come in.
I'm Charlie Bowers.
- Well?
- Mrs. Gould's brother.
Of course.
Won't you come in, Mr. Bowers?
Yes, thank you.
- Awfully glad you dropped in.
- Yes, same here.
- So sweet of you to say that.
- Yeah.
Gives one the feeling of...
What shall I say?
Esprt de corps.
Yeah, that's the way I feel about it.
Oh, I'd like to ask you, Mr. Bowers...
- Pardon me.
- That's all right. Go too far.
All right, girls, stand up!
Show Mr. Kent your legs.
- Oh, higher, higher.
- This is an audition, not an exhibition.
I'm not a mind reader, you know.
Down, girls.
This audition is to find a girl to sing a number with Mr. Blair.
- You all got copies of the song?
- All of them.
Sing it for them once, will you, Scotty?
And, Francis, show the routine.
- Just pick up there.
- Watch this very carefully, girls.
Ah, the moon s here
Ah, and we are here
Love s offi to a wonderful start

- Now, who's first?
- Mary.
Give us a pickup. Great.
Ah, the moon s here
Ah, and we are here
Sorry. Sorry, little lady. Next.
You're next. Come on.
Pick up there.
I always get in my singing mood with perfume. Do you mind?
Never mind the smell, honey. Sing.
Ah, the moon s here
Ah, and we are here
Love s offi to a wonderful start
Sorry. Sorry, won't do.
Why, I've sung before crowned heads.
You've laid yourself wide open for a crack.
We'll let it go. All right, next.
Come on, you're next. Give us a pickup.
Ah, the moon s here
Ah, and we are here
Love s offi to a beautful start
I'm sttng pretty

I can't get too much of?
I've got a feelng t's love
All right, that's it. Get to work, Francis.
- Nice going, kid.
- Thanks.
That's all for the singers.
Dancing girls on the stage.
Hit that again for me, will you?
On the stage, girls, hurry!
Come, dear.
I've come to take you to lunch.
Gee, that's nice of you, Harriet.
I'd love to go, but...
I'm not eating lunch anymore.
I'm in training now.
Well, you can walk with me as far as Si's office, can't you?
- Si's office? Oh, yeah.
- All right, sweetie pie.
- Have you seen Miss Thorn?
- I think she's gone to lunch.
Oh. Thanks.
What s ths funny thng
I can't get too much of?
I've got a feelng t's love
Lunch!
- Have you seen Mr. Blair?
- He's gone to lunch with Mrs. Gould.
He would.
Well, use a short introduction.
Then bring Miss Schubert out for her number. Yeah.
These wires just came.
No, no, no, do it that way.
Just that way. Yeah.
These wires just came.
I can't look at them now.
I got a date for lunch.
Phone Miss Rich and tell her
I'll be right over, will you?
Miss Rich, please.
Miss Rich? I'm calling for Mr. Kent.
Yes, he won't be able to have lunch with you.
No, he said you may take the afternoon off.
He doesn't want you to strain yourself the first day.
- Hello, hello.
- It's the only vacant seat.
At least you're sitting next to another good singer.
I'll try not to let it spoil my lunch.
Why, Scott dear, you told me you stopped eating lunch.
Well, I have. You see, actually,
I'm just having breakfast.
Well, I'll forgive you this time, you naughty boy.
I'll take spinach.
If I were a man, I wouldn't be a lapdog tied to any woman's apron strings.
- I might surprise you.
- You probably won't.
Mr. Kent, I wanna quit.
Don't be silly, singers never quit.
They hang on till somebody knocks them off.
I know, but that's why I wanna quit.
There's no future in singing.
- What do you wanna do?
- I wanna be your assistant.
You haven't filled Thompson's job yet.
I'll work a year for nothing if you insist on a sample.
You're reading those magazine ads again.
"How I Became President of the Atlas Pickle Works."
Give me a chance at the job, will you?
That's all I want.
I know I'll make good. But if I fail...
We'll make-believe you're Mrs. Gould's relative. Keep you on anyway.
- You've got the job.
- Thanks.
So Mrs. Gould sniveled you into another job.
I got this absolutely on my own.
Is there any business you wish to discuss with me?
No, that's the trouble with you.
You're all business. All efficiency.
You're not alive. You're not a bit feminine.
Look at that dress. Look at those glasses.
All you need is a pair of brown-paper shoes... and The Atlantc Monthly tucked under your arm.
Anything else?
That's all. If I need you, I'll send for you.
No, Mr. Kent is busy.
- Nan, are you busy?
- No, just dreaming lazily about life.
Tell me, where do you get your hair done... and where do you get all those pretty dresses?
What's the idea?
You're the type men like and...
Me?
Know any more funny stories?
Mr. Kent.
Yeah?
Listen, cut a minute out of George's comedy... and then bring the trumpet sextet up before the Hawaiian number.
See my secretary.
And if you're still overtime...
Wait a minute, call me back in five minutes.
- No!
- Yes.
The one girl in the place that showed some sense.
I got sick of looking like a schoolteacher and I'm sick of working in an office.
I wanna go back on the stage.
It was just a question of time before this place got to you.
- Did you say she could dance?
- One of the best.
All right. Hold it!
- Hold it!
- Hold it!
Let's see what you can do.
Play something in two-four.
Same thing. Go ahead.
Fine, that's grand.
How'd you like the job of teaching new kids the routines?
Gee, Mr. Kent, that'd be swell.
All right, job's yours. Oh, Francis...
Miss Thorn is your new assistant.
It can't be done, Mr. Kent, it can't be done.
All right, Miss Thorn, you watch it from over there, will you?
All right, girls, places.
Another good gal gone wrong.
Come out, come out
Come out and get your lovng
Now, don't you keep me n suspense
Come on, come on
We'll do our turtle-dovng
Sttng on a backyard fence
Come on, come on
The lttle stars are peekng
They're watng for you to commence
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I knda thought I'd weaken
Sttng on a backyard fence
It may be just another lttle backyard alley
Offi the avenue
But I can see a wllow tree,
a moonlt valley
In the dreams I share wth you
Meow, meow
The ktty-cat s coong
He shows a lot of common sense
He knows, he knows
There's always somethng dong
Sttng on a backyard fence
Come on, come on
Come out and get your lovng
Now, don't you keep me n suspense
Come on, come on
We'll do our turtle-dovng
Sttng on a backyard fence
Come on, come on
The lttle stars are peekng

Uh-huh, uh-huh

Sttng on a backyard fence

The ktty-cat s coong
He shows a lot of common sense
He knows, he knows
There's always somethng dong
Sttng on a backyard fence
That's all!
Those contortions are pretty vulgar.
One thing after another.
Just a minute.
- You look like a girl I used to know.
- Oh, really?
You're new here, aren't you?
I thought so.
You tried to fool me, didn't you?
But what a change. You're beautiful.
And what a dancer.
Is that all you can say?
Well, how about a little kiss then?
Mrs. Gould's little boy? I should say not.
Chester, you gotta do about something quick.
The Apollo deal's hot and Gladstone's after the contract.
Forget Gladstone.
I'll give you something tomorrow that'll knock Apollo for a loop.
Yeah.
Now all I have to do is think it up.
Maybe we'd better go back to your office.
Yeah...
Yeah, that's right.
Can't keep my mind on the race here.
But, Chester?
I'll pick you up at 6:00.
You're gonna get picked up again.
Old Faithful's gone blank on me.
I thought of a thousand ideas and every one of them moth-eaten.
If the little girl's not too bold, how's for me sticking with you to get it.
You could think out loud.
- Like we used to?
- It might help.
- Keep throwing ideas at me.
- And you throw the poor ones right back.
Sold.
We'll give Apollo a show if it takes all night.
We'll have dinner, think and walk.
Let's go.
Got something?
It was so old you had to fumigate it.
Say, how about a great big coffee pot, boys come out, and the girls come out... and the audience goes out.
I think the jury better go out again.
We could have a band on the stage and the chorus in the pit.
How about trees?
We've had flowers, pictures... tables, radios, statues, more tables, sofas, pianos.
Oh, nerts.
No good for a unit.
Hello?
Who's speaking? Nan?
Nobody else.
I wouldn't think of waking him.
He's sleeping.
And so was I when you called.
Goodbye, dear.
Move over, Chester, darling.
Hello?
It can't be out of order.
I just spoke to them.
- How'd you sleep?
- Like a newborn child.
So did I. No ideas, though.
Didn't even dream of one.
Maybe we'd better start all over again.
How do you suppose an insane asylum idea would go?
I could play the lead myself without any trouble.
Me, too.
Hey, look at this.
"What happens to unproduced musical comedies?"
- What does happen to them?
- "They gather dust on the shelves."
Say, we've got it.
I know we've got it!
- Apolinaris is in the bag.
- What do you mean?
"What happens to unproduced musical comedies?"
I can tell you what's gonna happen to them.
We'll put them in picture houses, prologues!
- Grand!
- Cut them down to 40 minutes.
Give them a picture and a musical comedy for 50 cents.
Most picture fans never saw a musical comedy.
That's the idea. Come on, let's grab a cab!
Instead of 40 people, our musicals will have 80.
- I'm afraid of it.
- Now, I know it's good. We'll do it.
Sure, we can't miss.
I'll have George Apolinaris up to dinner tonight.
I'll be there.
He'll be there. Our troubles are over.
There you are, Mr. Apolinaris.
You give them a musical comedy and a picture, all for 50 cents.
It's good. But somebody beat you to it.
Impossible.
You know Thompson,
Gladstone's director?
- Doing the same thing?
- Sure, same thing.
- But he stole our idea.
- Well, sue him. It ain't my funeral.
Gladstone's got three prologues in rehearsal.
Gonna show them to me Sunday.
Now here's what I'll do.
You fellows get three started... but they got to be ready Saturday night.
I'll preview them in three of my houses around town and get audience reaction.
What I like ain't worth a cent.
What audiences like is worth a million.
- And if the audience likes our stuff?
- You'll get the contract for the whole 40.
If not, I sign with Gladstone.
Give me a good reason why not.
I ate too much.
We'll see Kent and let you know.
That's up to you gents.
Well, so long.
I hope your dinner shouldn't make me indigestion.
Yeah, well, good night. Good night.
We gotta get hold of Kent.
Try his secretary, she'll know where he is.
Hello?
Oh, yes, Mr. Frazer.
Well, I may see him later.
Yeah, it'll be late all right, but I'll surely send him over.
How's the world's best secretary?
- I'll take care of him.
- Looks like you have already.
Here, drink this.
They want you at Frazer's apartment right away.
Can't be annoyed, can't be annoyed.
Got the greatest news of my life tonight.
Don't tell me you married that chiseler?
I'll thank you not to insult the future Mrs. Kent.
I'm glad you said "future."
I always ignore crude persons, dear.
- I'll take care of you later.
- Well, now, wait...
- You got a taxi waiting?
- Always got a taxi waiting.
Now you listen to me.
This is your big chance.
Forty units in deluxe houses.
The whole Apollo circuit.
It's too late for units.
Units to the right of them.
Units to the left of them.
Volleyed and thundered and lightening and everything.
Come on, now, you get up here!
This is a chance of a lifetime.
All right, all right, I'll go, but I want you to know I resent this.
How dare you! My fiancé.
Now you scram before I wrap a chair around your neck.
But it's 3:00 a.m.
Where do you want me to go?
- Listen, you cheap stenographer...
- Outside, Countess.
As long as they have sidewalks, you've got a job.
So you're gonna hire detectives.
A fine pair of quarter-wits
I teamed up with.
Every time I get a great idea, you let Gladstone steal it.
I've got a hunch you know something about that.
- I don't know a thing.
- What are you gonna do about it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna show that big jerk three prologues by Saturday night... and we'll stand him on his ear.
I'll give him the greatest show since he quit the restaurant business.
In three days?
Where'll you get the people?
Right in our own studio.
Use three choruses and double up on the principals.
It can't be done.
Give me absolute authority till Saturday night, I'll do it.
- You've got it!
- You got it!
It's done!
We've gotta have three of the greatest prologues ever put on.
Now, get this.
Somebody working among us has been giving Gladstone inside dope.
Selling him my ideas.
And for once, I'm gonna put a stop to it.
Now this is the way we're gonna do it.
Nobody leaves here until Saturday night.
Quiet!
You'll eat here and sleep here.
Live three whole days right here in the studio.
Quiet!
This is war, a blockade.
Anybody comes in, stays in.
- What do you mean, "stays in"?
- Quiet!
Now this is your last chance to get out.
Well? Anybody wanna go?
No!
All right. Thanks. This is a large order.
Three prologues in three nights.
We're gonna work your heads off.
Curse you and break your hearts.
But by Saturday night, we'll have what we want.
All right. Hop to it.
This is dangerous, Mr. Gould.
Anything might happen.
Suppose a fire broke out.
Locking us in like this.
He can't do it.
Let me know just as soon as it's done.
Did you check that measure
I told you about?
All girls in this number to the rehearsal hall.
Come on, girls.
Come on, get ready.
Come on, honey, be reasonable, will you?
She and I are all washed up and you know it.
Yeah, but does Mrs. Gould know it?
It was awfully nice of you to bring me in here, really.
Come along, Barrington.
I'll introduce you to the stage director.
Thanks ever so much.
Please sit down right here.
I want you to meet Mr. Barrington.
Here's the man you want to see.
See, what did I tell you?
- It does look like Independence Day.
- Let's celebrate.
Now, there. Look at that.
How can you expect to keep up a high moral tone with that going on?
I'm awfully glad to have played love's little messenger... and brought you two together.
But do you realize there's work to be done?
Well, we were just...
Would you mind saving about that much of loving for the act?
We can use it. You're in two prologues.
Miss Thorn, you're in all three.
So how about it?
Is there anything I could do?
- Yeah. See that window over there?
- Yes.
Take a running jump and I think you can make it.
Come on, fellows, this way.
Bring it down the hall. That's it. That way.
Come on, kids! Come and get it!
Go on, let her go.
I'm terribly worried, Doctor.
- Quiet, will you!
- There's nothing the matter with you.
I feel, Doctor, that I'm gonna have a dreadful heart attack. You just listen.
Did you hear that? Oh, I am not all right!
That's enough. Who's next?
- I'm next.
- Here.
Three prologues in such a short time.
It can't be done, it can't be done.
Get to bed, girls.
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.
I just wanted to be sure you're all safe in bed. Good night.
Good night.
Wake up, gang!
When do we eat?
- Truckload of breakfast just arrived.
- All right!
Rehearsal in 20 minutes.
Left, right!
One, two, three, four!
Come on, kids. Come and get it.
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three... four.
Hello?
I don't care if you wrote the doxology.
Mr. Kent won't see anyone till Monday.
Chester, it's like being in jail.
- Sorry, dear, better get used to it.
- She is used to it.
But how about our engagement ring, darling?
Get it for you Saturday night.
All right, sweet.
I wouldn't beef about being locked up with the man I love.
Hello? Yes. Yes, I'll tell him.
Apolinaris says your prologue goes on at the Jupiter Theatre 9:00 tonight.
How about the other two?
Mercury Theatre at 10:00, the Diana Theatre at 11:00.
Looks like we're in the laps of the Greek gods.
- You worried?
- Well... that water nymph number will empty the theater like a stench bomb.
There's still time to change it.
It's too late and I'm too tired.
Every time I fool with it,
I ruin it some more.
Old Faithful's gone blank on me completely.
Hey, wait a minute.
This is Mr. Kent's private office.
How nice. I'm Mrs. Kent.
And I'm Lydia Pinkham. Outside.
Do you know this dizzy dame?
Yeah, I still have nightmares about her.
She used to be my wife.
Still is, Chester, dear.
- You went to Reno.
- I was going.
- Somehow, I never got around to it.
- I see.
- You heard I was in the money.
- Exactly.
- What kept you away so long?
- I was in Europe.
- And who paid for that?
- That's my affair.
I understand you're all steamed up about a Miss Vivian Rich.
- And what's that to you?
- I can make plenty of trouble.
- All right, come on, come on. How much?
- $25,000 worth.
You might as well ask for $25 million.
I work for a living.
You can have till 4:00 this afternoon.
Then my lawyer and I start shooting.
Wait a minute.
Here's a pass for the cop at the gate.
I wouldn't want you to have any trouble getting out.
Well, here's where I go to the cleaners.
Maybe I can do something about it.
You mean raise that dough?
What are you gonna do, print it?
Never mind. I've got an idea.
Keep it to yourself or the wife'll cash in on it.
And when I get an idea
I do something about it.
Most dames do.
By a waterfall
I'm callng you
I want to talk to Scotty.
You can't come in here and break up my rehearsal this way.
- Mr. Kent's orders.
- Hold it! Come here, Scotty.
Were you on the level when you said that...
Frazer and Gould were holding out on Mr. Kent?
- You know Mrs. Gould, she talks a lot.
- Anything we can prove?
Just suspicions, but I sort of put two and two together.
That's what I'm gonna do and make 25.
Back to your places, girls!
- You've been gypping him for months.
- You're raving.
No, just investigating.
And my knowledge is worth money.
It's out and out robbery and that's a crime in any country.
- Lf our accountant made a mistake?
- Mr. Kent will let the jury decide.
Bonjour, darling.
Just got some tough news, Vivian.
My wife showed up.
You mean your ex-wife.
- My wife. She never got the divorce.
- What do you mean?
Now listen, baby.
It's just one of those things.
You've gotta be patient.
- Young lady, you're on the wrong track.
- What do you want?
To keep my mouth shut? $25,000.
Blackmail!
If I tell Kent, he'll walk out and you know it.
- You can't bluff us.
- What makes you think I'm bluffing?
Young woman.
You see, darling, that's the way it is.
You promised to marry me and you're going to marry me.
But I can't get rid of her.
She wants $25,000.
Listen, you silly-looking baboon, who do you think you're running around?
- Some little punk from the sticks?
- What's this?
I wrote the book and I know all the answers.
Well, well...
- The cultured Miss Rich.
- Not cultured, just smart.
Smart enough to sue and attach everything but your garters.
That's nice to know.
Well...
I'd rather have you sue me than marry me.
Mr. Kent, there is a Santa Claus.
$25,000 and made out to you!
Endorsed to Chester Kent.
Take it and ask no questions.
There's something phony here.
How'd you get it?
- Blackmail.
- Come on, spill it.
I played a pair of deuces like four aces and they paid.
Frazer and Gould have been holding out on me.
Bookkeeping mistake.
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?
Hello, Chester.
- So you double-crossed me.
- A book-keeping mistake.
I slave day and night for you.
What do I get?
You stab me in the back!
Me, the guy who made this place!
Killed myself so you chuckle-headed apes could get rich.
We'll straighten it out.
Go and get somebody else to double-cross.
- What about Apolinaris?
- Stick him in your rear.
And that wood nymph prologue has got no chance the way it stands.
- What do we do?
- Fix it yourselves, you two wonder men.
Chester!
Chester, you've gotta stay on the job!
You can't do this to us! Chester!
- Just a moment, you can't go out there.
- The orders are wrong.
Now wait a minute. Listen!
Cab!
- Where to, mister?
- Anywhere, just keep going.
- Let's go back, boss.
- For what?
They'll never get Apollo if you quit.
The three of them can open a peanut stand together.
No! No! No! Wait a minute.
Try it again.
Hey, Mr. Francis, Kent has quit.
- What?
- He can't do that.
He took the brains on the drive with him under his hat.
I knew it couldn't be done.
I knew it couldn't be done.
Let's go home.
When Apolinaris hears, he wouldn't sign if we gave him Garbo on roller skates.
Prologues, prologues, prologues.
I'm fed up.
Fighting for ideas and chained to that office, morning, noon and night.
And the third prologue, it's rotten.
But boss...
Pull up!
Hey, lend me that brush, will you?
Just a minute. Lend me that.
Hey, wait a minute! Hey!
Wait a minute! Hey, you!
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
What do you think you're trying to do?
That's my name and I don't want it up there.
- Yeah, you're full of hooch, are you?
- Let go.
Look at that.
That's what that wood nymph prologue needs.
A mountain waterfall splashing on beautiful white bodies.
- You get it?
- I have ideas, too, Mr. Kent.
- All right, well, come on!
- Yeah, come on.
Sorry, gents. Without Kent your prologues ain't worth a nickel.
He's coming back in a little while.
I can't wait very long.
I've got a date with the Gladstone.
Where do you think you're going?
Come on, get back in! Everybody back in!
Come on.
Hold everything. Everybody stand by.
Lock that gate. Nobody in, nobody out.
- Same as before?
- Same as before.
Listen, get back to work.
That third prologue has changed.
All the dance routines are shifted.
Only this time, it's gonna be good.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Go on, get to work.
That's impossible, Mr. Kent.
It can't be done!
All right, children, back to the rehearsal hall.
It can't be done. No, it can't be done.
Look, smallpox, I got the money.
But I want a release.
Here, give her that when she signs.
I won't take a check.
You'll stop payment on it.
Throw her a herring.
Say, that gives me an idea.
How about shiny fish jumping out of the water?
Swell. Come around Friday.
Say, listen...
What's this? I thought you quit!
- Everything's off.
- It's on.
Here's your customer.
Got him on the way out. Hold onto him.
Keep him here if you have to tie an anchor to him.
I'll see you later.
- What about that accounting mistake?
- Mistake, your Aunt Fannie.
- We're giving you a new deal.
- Yeah, and I'm the dealer.
Mr. Kent.
- Do you like to look at funny pictures?
- What do you mean?
I hope it looks as good as it sounds.
Well, well, just folks.
Don't mind us.
We just dropped in for a laugh.
- This is all a mistake.
- Right, sister, and you're it.
I was just showing Miss Rich what you can't do in Kalamazoo.
You won't need that lawyer.
Your breach of promise suit is right in the ash can.
And you're my witness.
I certainly have a genius for picking dames to fall for.
- You said it, papa.
- Maybe you better help me next time.
What do you think I've been doing?
Mr. Kent, seeing all these girls gives me a lot of ideas.
- And don't let them keep you awake.
- No.
Look, suppose I quit my job and work for you?
Wait till Saturday.
I may be working for you.
Hold it! That's where your song comes in!
- How's Barrington?
- I'm a little worried.
Only a little worried? He must be colossal.
He is, but maybe he'll improve.
Well, you can start worrying all over again.
All the stuff you've done in this prologue is out.
Here's the new stuff and it goes on tonight.
No. No. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back.
Mr. Kent, I cannot and I will not try the impossible.
Come on, baby, wind yourself up.
After all, I'm only a human being.
I'm not a superman.
And even if I were, it couldn't be done.
Mr. Kent, I resign.
I accept. You're through.
You accept?
Do you realize that leaves me without a job?
And after I've worked myself to the bone for you?
Come on, kids.
I'm putting this prologue on myself.
Line up. You're through.
All right kids, come on.
Come on, girls. Hurry, girls!
Hurry, please!
The bus leaves in 10 minutes.
Will you hurry?
Come on, girls, hurry up! Step it up!
I ate my dinner too fast. I got indigestion.
Come on!
In here! In here!
Here, girls. Take it away!
How am I to say what I want to say

- Did you like it, George?
- Tell you later.
Now I've got indigestion.
Well, so far so good.
Now this last prologue's up to you and Joe Barrington.
- Where is Joe?
- He's waiting for us at the theater.
Don't worry, boss. Joe will do his best.
He'll have to do better than that.
Well, this tells the story.
Cheer up, boss.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You stick close to Apolinaris and keep feeding him bicarbonate.
I've got to give Barrington a pep talk.
Hello, Mr. Apolinaris. Enjoying yourself?
I shouldn't have ate pie and salami.
- Oh, let me get you some bicarbonates.
- I just had some. Don't help me none.
Honey, how about a prologue honeymoon?
- I'll sign now.
- We'll make love in 40 cities.
And then start all over again.
If Apollo signs.
Well, he'd better.
Come on, girls! Come on!
Hello, Mr. Kent.
Come on, get with it.
You've got to get on here.
He was nervous so I gave him a little drink.
Oh, yeah?
My regards to Thompson.
I can't do it. I tell you I can't.
I've only appeared in amateur performances.
- An amateur!
- Yes, sir.
Well, I might have known it.
That's our call, you go on.
If it's cold you go back to that amateur league on crutches.
- I'm too nervous.
- Get on! Get out there and do it!
- I can't do it. I tell you I'm sick.
- I'll wrap this around your neck.
- What do you want to do, boss?
- Bring up that curtain!
Bring it up, Joe. Places, everybody!
All right, that's you!
- No, I can't! I won't go on!
- You better go on!
Looking for your Shanghai Lil?
No, she ain't your Shanghai Lil.
Don't give him flowers.
He'll just take your flowers straight to Shanghai Lil.
No, I ain't seen Shanghai Lil.
Hello, Bailey, you old goon.
Where'd you get that monkey suit?
Don't tell anyone you saw me or I'll wrap you in the snoot.

Princess? Jeanette?.
Count, I'm going to bed.
- I've just come up to join you.
- Join me?
Join you in a little chat before dinner.
Not tonight.
I've had another fainting spell and my uncle, the Duke, thought bed was the best place for me.
I always think that do you wonderful well.
- Count, why the ladder?
- Oh, it's more romantic.
Careful.
Oh, I've brought along my flute, hoping to entertain.
No, count. Not tonight.
Oh, before I go.
Remember what I said to you down by the horse trough?
- Quite well.
- Oh, What was it?
I simply wish to see if it made any impression.
You said "I love you".
Made no impression whatever.
There's probably no use of repeating the sentiment at this time.
None at all.
Oh, Princess...
I trust you don't find my wooing too ardent.
I was just admiring your restraint, good night, Count.
On with the dreams, Princess.
I'll never be able to use it again.
Oh, Count, did you break your leg?
No, I fell flat on my flute.
- Yes, no league, no.
- But not too long.
Oh, may it help our niece grow strong.
Plants from the woods and birds from the dales are certain cures for fainting spells.
Please heaven, we no start in vain.
May morning bring her health again.
Oh, ¿what?
My dear Duke, you can get rid of me for 20 thousand francs.
My dear Countess, I...
Oh, Uncle, don't be so pompous.
I'm only asking for some of the money you're holding in trust for me.
If I gave you any, you'll go straight back to Paris.
You're staying here, Valentine.
What you need is more of the simple life, young woman.
- Oh, uncle...
- I say... come in.
- The new footmen, your grace.
- Oh.
- Uncle...
- No.
Can't we ever get a footman under forty in this place?
Valentine.
About the schedule for the guests for tomorrow, your grace...
Tomorrow?
Bridge, at three...
And dinner, at eight.
And after dinner, bridge.
- Rather an amusing day, Flammand?
- Quite exciting, your grace.
And what are the guests doing now, Flammand?
Playing bridge, your grace.
You wait. I'm going right back to Paris.
A man?
Oh no, just cousin Gilbert.
What are you doing?
Trying to get up enough energy to go to bed.
What are you doing in this dull hole?
Oh, I'm just passing through.
I got a taxi waiting to take me back to Paris.
Take me with you.
That's not a bad idea.
It may save for haven't to see uncle.
How much money can you loan me?
I'm over my allowance and uncle won't let me have any money.
Oh, you don't know how to handle the old sky-hawk.
I'll tell him I need the money for charity.
To provide good homes for bad stenographers.
- Flammand...
- Aha.
Send that taxi away.
No, no uncle, now look,
I've got to go back to Paris.
You can't. You're staying here permanently.
And if I hear any more about your debts, any more bills, I'll cut you off without a soudle.
Now, you understand?
You imp... imp...
- Now, what's the word?
- Impecunious.
- No, no, no.
- Impudent?
- No, no.
- No, no.
- Impostor.
- No.
- Impertinent.
- Ah, that's it.
- You impertinent jack... jack...
- Jackal?
- Well I'm sorry.
- Jackass?
No, no.
I wish you go to bed.
Jackanapes.
You impertinent, jackanape, liar, cheat.
Liar.
Cheat.
- - You'll be insulting me in a minute.
- Nitwit.
Numbskull. Nincompoop.
Lord, grant her rest be sweet and deep.
And knights go riding through her sleep.
Her own Prince Charming, young and bold.
Who came to Princesses of old.
- Never to us...
- Never to us...
Never to us.
Stir slowly...
Slowly, and may it heal her howling.
- I want the money for my shirts.
- And my shoes. And my hats.
You introduced him to us.
You said his trade will bring other business.
It will.
We must be careful not to insult the Vicomte de Barres.
He comes from the old nobility,
- quick to take offense.
- And slow to pay.
- Maurice Courtelain?
- Yes.
I understand you made a lot of clothes for the Vicomte de Barres...
Ah, you see, you see Monsieur, that I made a lot of clothes for the Vicomte.
If Monsieur will take a chair...
I'll show him samples.
- Monsieur is a friend of the Vicomte?
- Not at all.
You know who I am?
Oh... now I understand.
Oh, Monsieur, monsieur, why don't you try to forgive and forget?
This is Paris, city of romance, love.
Please, forgive the Vicomte and forgive also your wife.
I have no wife.
What is all this?
You are not the man who chased the Vicomte in his BVDs?
Certainly not.
I am the credit manager of the
Association of Retail Merchants.
I came here to tell you, that not a tailor in Paris will make that fellow a suit without full payment in advance.
You... you... you mean...
I mean... the Vicomte de Barres never pays.
The Vicomte, never pays...
- My shirts.
- My hats.
- My boots.
- My suits...
Gentlemen... you have my profound sympathy.
The old nobility, eh?
Do you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to have a crowd march down there and attack that chateau.
- Wait. That's an idea...
- You think we could?
Just like in the old days?
What about the police?
I don't mean attack it in a crowd.
Let me attack it, alone.
I'll be a one-man French Revolution.
Let me have all the goods the Vicomte ordered.
I'll deliver them to the chateau.
And I'll make him pay.
Maurice. I just heard you were going. Let me husband drive you.
He had to go to the art shop of his employer, and he'd love to drop you.
Pierre, tell Maurice you'd love to drop him.
I'd love to drop you.
Get in.
Oh, that's fine. Over here.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, just like a millionaire.
A millionaire.
Oh no, look at that.
I'm not going to drink that.

Pierre. You take the horse,

- Mademoiselle, are you hurt?
- Oh, no.
- Mademoiselle, put your arms around me.
- No, thank you, I can manage alone.
Oh. My ankle.
I think is better that you put your arms around me.
Would you think I put my arms around people I don't know?
My name is Maurice.
Oh, that's nothing.
- Is this ankle?
- No, it's quite unnecessary.
- Don't stand on it yet.
- I'm sure it's better.
No no no.
Tell me, do you live down here?
I often wonder.
No, I said, do you live down here?
I heard you.
I wonder if you can call it living...
Seems so dead.

They both want to go.

Aren't you a little insane?
Yes. Let me sing for you.
You are insane.
But you sang for me.
I didn't even know you existed.
You don't exist either.

You think I'm rude? Vulgar?
You know, since you came into my life, I'm not myself.
- Perhaps I'm in love with you.
- Oh really now.
Afraid?
- Of what?
- Of me.
- What conceit...
- Afraid of yourself?
What insolence.
You think it takes years to fall in love?
You're right.
I've known you a hundred years.
A thousand years.
You're impossible.

Your hat.
Look at it.
What will you do without your straw hat, Maurice?
And where's that smile of yours?
No straw hat? No smile?
It's all over, Maurice.
You can't go on.
Now we can go on, Pierre.
Good old Pierre.
We can go on if I ever fix this car.
Princess. Help. Help.
Help. Help.
Help. Help.
She's fainted again.
You know, I had an elder brother who used to faint quite often.
- He was a nip-omaniac.
- A what?
A nip-omaniac.
He used to go around pinching things.
Oh, I had a friend like that.
He used to pinch business girls in elevators.
They had to send him to a cooler climate...
- No... I knew a girl...
- This is no time for reminiscences.
Get a couple of footmen to carry her upstairs.
But you gave the servants the afternoon off.
Our footmen are playing football against the Old Soldiers Home.
Well, you two carry her upstairs.
Someone fetch a doctor.
You carry her, I'll get the doctor.
Valentine, can you go for a doctor?
Certainly, bring him right in.
No, no, it's for Jeanette.
She's fainted again.
Princess, permit me to introduce doctor Armand de Pertignac.
- Your Highness...
- Doctor.
And now my dear, remove your dress.
- My what?
- Your dress.
There's no occasion for distress.
- Is that necessary?
- Very. Yes.
As long as professional ethics apply,
I'll see you with only a doctor's eye.
The doctor's eye is satisfied.
Now I'll hear your heart.
Don't sigh.
Very good. Nothing wrong here.
Now I'll take your pulse, my dear.
Perfectly regular, right on the tick.
Madam, oh Madam, you cannot be sick.
Then why do I lie awake in bed?
And why does blood rush to my head?
- At night?
- Quite right, at night.
And why does music make me sad?
And why do love songs drive me mad?
- At night?
- Quite right, at night.
- And frequently I faint.
- That's quaint.

Oh, then Jeanette is not in any danger?
Well, nothing immediate.
But...
The Princess... ought to be married.
- Married?
- Married?
To a man of her own age.
Ah, but the only two eligible men in France, the only two of rank equal to Her Highness are not exactly of my niece's age.
- How old are they?
- One is 85... and the other will be 12 on his next birthday.
- Well, this is a problem.
- What do you recommend?
Exercise... exercise... and exercise.
Exercise...
- This gives me new hope.
- Eh?
About my chances of marrying Jeanette.
I'll ask her to consider me as a prescription.
My dear Count de Savignac, the only obstacle lies in the delicate matter of rank.
Jeanette demands a prince at least.
And you are not a prince.
Well I would've been if our family hadn't been badly gypped during the crusades.
Anyway, your grace mustn't forget the tenth Count de Sauvignac.
What about him?
- Marie Antoinette?
- Positively.
- Now may I ask Jeanette?
- Yes, but not this afternoon.
Quite right. Of course, that's me, you know, always impetuous.
Monsieur...
Mademoiselle..
I'm looking for the Vicomte de Barres.
I didn't know he was expecting a friend.
- Are you alone?
- Alone?
- I mean in life. You're not married?
- Ah, no.
I'll be right down.
Monsieur...
Who made that for you?
McClintock and Armstrong, Monsieur...
Of London.
Might I recommend them for your own service?
Oh no, thank you. I'm looking for the Vicomte des Barres.
- Possibly in the drawing room, Monsieur.
- Thanks.
- Mesdames...
- Monsieur...
- His smile is so disarming.
- So grand.
- So gay.
- So charming.
Mesdames...
We bore you with our sewing?
- Sewing?
- Quite so.
Oh no. A needle is magnetic.
- How true.
- And how poetic.
- Mesdames...
- Monsieur...
Oh no, no. Never use silk on armor.
Flannel is the thing.
Oh, are you interested in armor?
Any kind of wearing apparel.
- Is this your only job?
- Oh no, I putter around.
Tell me, where can
I find the Vicomte de Barres?
Oh, he's somewhere about.
I hate him.
Imagine... he would like to tear down this beautiful chateau.
No, it would be better to tear down the Vicomte.
You're a man after my own heart.
- You have a soul.
- Someone looking for me?
- Ah, Monsieur Vicomte.
- Maurice...
I came down about those...
My, my, how well you're looking.
You, you've met my uncle?
- Uncle?
- The, the, the Duke.
Oh yes, we had a little chat.
He's the first of your friends who I haven't wanted to hit with a battle axe.
- OH...
- He recommended flannel.
Flannel? Would you pardon us a moment, uncle?
Maurice, may I have a word with you?
Maurice, did you tell uncle about those bills?
But I didn't get a chance.
And I didn't know he was your uncle.
Now, Vicomte, I brought all your clothes and I want the money.
See, it's 63,000 francs.
And I'm here also on behalf of my fellow creditors.
Put yourself in their place.
I'd like to. It isn't anyone who can be a creditor nowadays.
Now, Maurice, I'm going to be frank with you.
Right now I can't pay you.
Ah, then I'll have to see the Duke.
He'll throw you out, he hates tradesmen.
He'll throw me out too, so what's the use?
I won't leave the chateau without my money.
Oh why do you say that.
Well, I...
I've got it..
Then stay here
I'll have the money in a few days, I'll borrow it.
No no no, this is no place for me.
- A tailor in a chateau.
- Well why not?
- No no, I'm going to see the Duke.
- Oh, Maurice, please...
Oh...
Oh. The charming young man.
I'm trying to persuade him to stay.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Oh there you are.
Yes.
And you been trying to persuade him to stay...
- No we really are...
- Oh, you're staying. Jeanette.
Countess Emilia... let me present...
Gilbert, present your friend.
Yes yes, of course.
This is my good friend...
Mauri... Eh, Baron Courtelain.
Yes, I've met the Baron.
We're trying to persuade him to stay.
- - Are we?
- The Baron must've changed.
He used to make very sudden decisions.
I'll stay.
That Baron, eh?
How did it go?

- Ah?
- Hi, Count.
Your grace, with your permission,
I'd like to do my hunting indoors today.
- Indoors?
- In your library.
What the deuce?
As much as I love a good gallop,
I'm giving it up in your interest.
Yes, but why all this mystery?
Concerns the Baron.
I've never heard of the Courtelains in all my historical research.
Have you?
No, but I'm not as familiar as I might be with the nobility of the South.
I ran through 8 or 10 volumes before breakfast and found not a Courtelain.
Bless my soul.
Mind you, I still have 36 more volumes to look through before I'm sure.
Yes, but this fellow is a friend of Gilbert's.
Gilbert I need only remind you is none too choosy.
Well, you go right ahead, my boy.
Oh, well, Maurice. You look great.
Is that my new riding habit?
No no, not until you paid for it, Monsieur Vicomte.
I've been up since daybreak altering it to fit me.
Oh, I see...
Have you picked out something good to ride on?
- The best I could get.
- Is it the big gray one?
No, small, orange, with black stripes.
Orange with black...
What is it, a zebra?
No. A bicycle.
You can't use a bicycle in a hunt.
You got to ride a horse.
No, but I've never been on a horse in my life.
Well Baron...
I want to lend you a horse worthy of your line.
- Thunderbolt.
- Thunderbolt?
- He's fast, but furious.
- Say, you better, I...
I think I'd better not.
You see, the harder the horse, the harder I get.
- I might hurt Thunderbolt.
- Oh, he can take it.
Oh Baron. I took the liberty of choosing a horse for you.
Oh, that's so kind of you.
I won't need your Thunderbolt.
What's my horse's name?
- Solitude.
- Oh, Solitude.
- Well. Good hunting.
- Well, I'm set.
Solitude sounds just my type.
You know why they call him Solitude?
Why?
Because he always come home alone.
Solitude for Baron Courtelain.
What's the point in giving the Baron a horse like that?
I want to test the Baron.
I can think of several better ways to do that, let me try.
Don't bother, tell me, you ever think of anything but men, dear?
- Oh, yes.
- Like what?
- Schoolboys.
- Ohh.
I know that's Solitude.
No, that's only Thunderbolt.
There's Solitude.
Oh, Gilbert. He's not going to...
Oh Gilbert, don't let him.
Oh, Gilbert.
Stand back. Stand back.
What is this?
This? This is oats, madame.
Very wild.
And this is the stag.
Very tired.
And where's Solitude?
We agreed to separate.
- He went home. Alone.
- And what are your plans?
Oh, very simple, madame. After supper, the stag will go right to bed.
He's had a hard day.
And the hunt just stops, I suppose.
A very happy ending, madame.
- Which we both approve.
- I do not approve.
No, no. I mean the stag and myself.
No true nobleman would mock the tradition of the hunt like this.
There are things too fine, too sacred, to be made ridiculous.
Oh, your Highness is losing your temper.
I'm not losing my temper.
You let that stag go.
No.
He'd be caught and killed.
You wouldn't want that, madame, look...
Look at those eyes.
You are not a gentleman.
You need some lessons.
And you, your Highness, are not a woman.
You need some lessons too.
You know too much about hunting, etiquette, tradition...
You know nothing about style... charm... love.
Your riding habit...
Look, you riding habit, it's not graceful, it's not in the mode.
And your hair...
It's too prim, madame.
It's to severe.
Please let me be judge that...
But your riding habit...
It's discouraging.
- What are you doing now?
- I'm thinking...
I'm thinking about you without these clothes.
Open your eyes, at once.
Oh no, pardon, madame.
I mean, with different clothes.
- Smart clothes.
- Here they are...
- The clothes?
- The hunt.
What's the meaning of this?
- The stag, the stag, he's asleep.
- What?
Shh. We must go back, he's very tired.
Go back, go back.
Quickly and quietly.
Go back. Quickly and quietly.
On tiptoe.
On tiptoe.
Oh, madame.
Good hunting?
No luck.
The Baron and the deer made friends and called the whole thing off.
Well I've had good hunting.
There's no such title as Baron de Courtelain.
What?
Gilbert, did you hear that?
I've even been through the better class illegitimates.
- And still no Courtelain?
- Not a Courtelain.
Now Gilbert... who the deuce is your friend?
Well, uncle, I don't think
I'd better tell you.
- It wouldn't be safe.
- Wouldn't be safe?
You see, I owe Maurice something...
You owe him something?
Uncle, you shouldn't keep repeating everything I say.
- You live the life of an echo.
- Will you kindly come to the point.
Uncle... we live in an age of toppling thrones... of uneasy crowns, of persecuted royalty compelled at times to travel under strange names.
Right?
Are you trying to hint that your friend is... royalty?
Well, I...
He has the Hapsburg lip.
And the name...
Baron Courtelain is...
A mere nom de pullman.
Well, we're all here except the Baron.
Good, then we're all here.
Count, could you do something to entertain?
No, I'm helpless since my accident.
- Accident?
- I fell flat on my flute.
Ah, Emperor.
Have you seen Valentine, uncle?
Why no, she's not here either.
The Baron and Valentine are both missing.
You know uncle, it's dangerous to invite guests with a girl like that around.
- Somebody will sue us.
- Ah, there you are.
The Baron will be down in a moment.
He had to send to Paris for his costume, It was late getting here.
- I've been watching him put it on.
- You've been what?
It's all right, uncle, she has the room next to Maurice.
And she's bored holes in the connecting door.
Valentine?
Are you aware that...?
Are you...
Are you... Now...
Are you aware that that door come down to us through generations?
So have my instincts.
Hey, she had you there, unc.
Will you stop blowing that infernal bladder?
Thank you, madame.
- Oh, how original.
- Thank you, madame.
- Oh, how intriguing.
- Thank you, madame.
How common.
Do you find my costume out of place, madame?
Decidedly.
Maybe you're right.
An Apache among all these nobility.
And yet I understand an
Apache wanting to come.
- Where there is beauty and light.
- Yes,
But people should be on guard against him.
You don't like the Apache, eh?
I dislike his attitude toward women.
Oh madame, you do not understand the Apache.
He's not always such a bad fellow.
I'd like to tell you what he really feels.
- I'd love to know.
- And I... am not interested.
Are they always so brutal with girls?
- Haven't they any weak moments?
- How do they live?
I'll tell you the story of one who I have known.

I brought you over here because I want you.
Oh, Countess.
I want you to keep as far away from me as possible.
Countess, I'll try.
Pardon me, Countess, something I must do.
Some place I must go.
Princess.
Princess... open your eyes, Princess.
Open your eyes.
No.
Don’t open your eyes.
Sleep.
So I can tell you how beautiful you are.
How beautiful...
And how I love you.
And how I love you.
How dare you.
Wait...
- Why did you do that?
- Because I love you.
You... you kissed me, Princess.
Why?
Because...
I love you, Maurice.
You... you love me?
Yes.
I thought against it,
I was afraid.
Oh, my darling... how foolish I was.
- Perhaps you were wise.
- Why?
Fear is a warning, Princess.
I don't understand you, Maurice.
Let me dream this dream a little longer.
When I wake...
I'll go away.
Go away?
- Don't you want me, Maurice?
- I want you, my Princess.
But...
I have wanted the moon too.
Look, my hands are empty.
Your arms need ever be empty of me, Maurice.
We have found each other in darkness.
Like ships that come into harbor together, at night.
When morning comes... one's there... one sails away.
We'll sail together... or stay together.
I love you, my beautiful Princess.
I love you.
This, I can tell you, this is mine.
- Jeanette...
- Maurice...
You don't know who I am.
You're you... and I love you.
But... if I...
If I were not... what you think I am.
- If I...
- Whoever you are...
Whatever you are...
Wherever you are...
I love you.
Jeanette, you know what I think?
I think I'm mad.
And that you are mad.
And that the whole world is mad.
But I'm luckiest man of all.
And the happiest.
Listen, my beautiful Princess.
I love you. I love you.
And whatever comes tomorrow...
Love me tonight.
Love me tonight.
"Whoever you are... whatever you are..."
"Wherever you are...
I love you".
"Oh, my Princess..."
"You don't know who I am.
I am... I am a tailor."
"A tailor? A tailor.
Isn't it romantic."
"Oh, I love you."
♪ Your heart and my heart were made to meet... ♪
♪ Don't make them wait, love me tonight. ♪
♪ Why should our lips be afraid to meet. ♪
♪ Love me tonight. ♪
♪ Who knows what tomorrow brings with the morning light. ♪
♪ Dear, I am here with a heart that sings ♪
♪ Love me tonight... ♪
Let me see.
There...
There, it's superb.
Come in.
- You sent for me, Princess?
- Yes.
Yes?
Yes...
I'd like your advice on my new riding habit.
- Beautiful.
- Do you really think so?
Perfect.
How about the length?
Divine...
Here, look at it more closely.
The closer I get, the more perfect.
Monsieur has taste.
- How about the color?
- Lucky color.
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, certainly.
The color rides up.
- Oh no, that won't do at all.
- You think so, Monsieur?
Oh yes, madame, yes.
And look, it's too tight here, madame.
It's too tight across the chest.
And the lapels, the lapels, they're too stiff.
No, no, really.
The whole thing lacks smartness, youth, grace.
- No, no, no...
- Oh, Maurice...
Your Highness, I have never been so insulted.
With your permission, I'm going.
Madame Pituar, madame Pituar...
Maurice, what am I going to do now?
Don't worry, Jeanette.
We'll fix it.
How?
We'll fix it.
No, no...
That's not possible...
We'll make you a riding habit... that will tame Solitude.
But how?
The important thing... is not to hurry.
What's the matter?
- I have never been so insulted in my life.
- Who insulted you?
- What?
- Madame Pituar has been insulted.
- At her age? Remarkable.
- Madame Pituar has been insulted.
Some men have no taste.
- Madame Pituar has been insulted.
- The old girl must have something.
Shh. Let us look into this.
- A scandal.
- An outrage.
- I'll shoot this.
- Oh, let me die.
No, let me explain.
I was only fixing the
Princess's riding habit.
- What?
- Uncle, uncle, that's the truth.
- Preposterous.
- I give you my word of honor.
I tell why the Baron often gives people advice about their clothes.
Be quiet.
What you say is insulting.
- I'll run him through for this.
- You've already shot him.
Silence.
- Silence.
- Silence.
I'll prove I'm telling the truth.
Give me two hours and I'll remodel this riding habit.
What?
Alright.
I'll convict you by your own falsehood.
- I'll give you two hours, sir.
- Yeah, he'll do it.
- I'll bet he can't do it.
- I'll bet you 10,000 francs he can.
- I'll bet you 50,000 he's a liar.
- Your done.
Your grace, time flies.
Quite right. Leave them alone, everybody.
- I'll give you two hours, sir.
- 50,000 francs, now, eh?
- Maurice, what will you do now?
- You'll see. Two hours to go.
Wait a minute... now... and this...
Now I start.
Five.
Twelve.
Twenty two.
Twenty eight.
Excuse me...
How do you like it?
Oh, it's perfect.
Of course, if I had more time...
Too perfect.
Tell me, How were you able to make this habit in 2 hours?
How were you able to make it at all?
Because...
Because I am a tailor...
- What?
- A tailor.
Oh Maurice, you're joking.
No.
I'm not a baron...
I am a tailor.
Does that make so much difference?
A tailor...
Last night... you said to me...
Whoever you are...
Whatever you are...
Wherever you are, I love you.
Remember?
Jeanette, what happened?
Why, Baron, what happened?
I just told her I'm not a baron.
I'm a tailor.
- A tailor?
- Yes, a tailor.
Help. Help.
Help. Help. Help.
The Baron. He's not a baron.
He's a tailor.
What?
- The Baron,
- he's not a baron.
He's a tailor.
What do you know about this?
Well I, I.
- You see, I owed him some bills.
- Bills?
I'll deal with you later.
But first I'll get Flammand to give this tradesman his money and kick him out.
A cane.

Stop the train. I'm going with you.
Oh no, Your Highness forgets I'm a tailor.
I love you. I can't live without you.
I love you, but you couldn't be a tailor's wife.
I could and I will.
Stop the train.
No, I love you too much. You belong to the chateau, Goodbye.
- Stop the train.
- What happened?
I love him.
- That's not a railroad problem.

No. No.

Come, darling, come...
Once upon a time there was a
Princess and a Prince Charming...
- Who was not a prince.
- But who was charming.
And they lived happily ever after...
We've sailed to every shore from here to Singapore

A sailor can't be true to any one gal
He's a cheatin' son of the sea
A sailor can't be true to any one gal
A sailor man must have variety

But I'm a man that could be true to one gal
If she's the right gal for me
It's a lie
It's a lie

Yeah, B.C. Before

Well, I don't think I'll trouble with the orange juice.
There's very little to be gained from orange juice.
It says brandy here.
This is confusing.
Well... brandy.
What on Earth are you cooking? Ha-ha!
It's too weak.
Aaah!
Ohhhhhhh.
Nights in Havana are warm and delicious
They make trusting hearts a bit too ambitious
The sway of the palms makes a girl so pernicious
A tra-la-la la-la-la-la-la
The men are all sheiks and they use a new system
So, girlies, be careful and learn to resist 'em
They'll fill you with bull and after you've kissed 'em
They'll leave you flat on the spot Ah-ha-ha, but for what
Ahh, for tra-la-la la-la-la-la-la, ohh
If some caballero takes off his sombrero
You better take care-o watch out and beware-o
For it's just a new Spanish custom
If some sweet bambino says you are his queen-o
Then in some casino he fills you with vino
Oh, it's just a new Spanish custom
If he starts acting too haughty-o
Ah,just kick him right in the patio
If he starts to pet-o
I warn you no let-o
If he sings ''I love you'' he's singing falsetto
For it's just a new Spanish custom
If you're so interested in that sailor, why don't you have him up here and take him apart? What sailor?
Oh, not the one you stare at, of course.
I do not stare at him.
I've hardly noticed him.
Then, uh, why have you been picking on him the whole voyage?
Come along, Doris. I've cut for you, and we're partners.
- Oh, Michael, would you mind getting me a highball?
- Oh, certainly.
Isn't he gorgeous?
In fact, they're both gorgeous. Yeah.
I don't wonder you have so much trouble choosing between them.
What are you butting into this for? Me butting in?
Hmph! I like that. I found her first, didn't I?
Didn't she ask me to get her this drink?
You don't do as well with women as I do.
You've always got your cut, haven't you? I proposed to her first.
You're making a big mistake. Lay off.
We three could be very happy together.
I wish you'd hurry up and take.
I'm simply dithering with envy.
But why, darling? Because I'm gonna take the one that's left, that's why.
You are? Are you sure you can afford it?
I do hope I haven't made it too strong.
Why, Michael, how can you say that?
Whatever touches those lips turns to honey.
Aren't they divine?
They're positively sinful.
Sinful is right. They're positively a crime against nature.
Here's your baby, nursemaid.
She's cryin' for ya.
Oh, hello, Droopy.
She probably wants her whiskers combed. Sing to her.
Come on, Steve.
Sing something.
Oh, no, not me. You know how funny she is about music.
Oh, come on! That's all right. I'll hold her for ya.
Okay.
I'll sing about the birds and bees
The pretty flowers and the trees
The moon, the sun the summery breeze
Hooray
I'll even go to town
With ''London Bridge
Is Falling Down''
But I positively refuse to sing
Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
['ll sing about the night we met
And about to remember or forget
The grass is green
The dew is wet and say
I'll yodel
Night and day
''On the Road to Mandalay''
But I positively refuse to sing
Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf-a
''When Annie Doesn't
Live Here Anymore''
I'll take a heartbreak
I'll even end my song with a ''hey-hey'' or a ''Yeah, man''
I'll sing about the cabin door
The fields of corn
The Swanee shore
Let it rain
Let it pour
What's more
A cottage warm and cozy
Or a
Ring-Around-the-Rosy
But I positively refuse to sing
''['m Headin'for
That Last Roundup''
Get along, little doggie
Get along
Good night lovely little lady
I must say adieu
To you
And your loveliness
The owner wants to see you on the upper deck.
Who, me?
At once.
Evening, ma'am.
Good evening.
When I chose you to take care of Droopy,
I did so because I believed you were a steady and trustworthy young man.
Yes, ma'am? But when I see you wrestling the poor creature all over the deck, I believe-
I wasn't wrestling with her.
Why, I saw you.
She was wrestling with me.
Are you being impertinent?
No, no, ma'am. You see,
Droopy only likes one song, and whenever I sing anything else, she just naturally ups and throws me.
What's your name?
Stephen, ma'am.
Stephen what?
Just call me Stephen.
I suppose you have a second name. Oh, yes, ma'am.
Where did you learn to sing?
Oh, I-I just sort of sing.
You sing quite well.
Thank you.
Will you sing something for us?
Well, if you don't mind,
['d rather not.
We could tie Droopy up.
Just the same,
I- I don't think-
We don't expect you to amuse us for nothing, my man. He doesn't want your money.
Come on, sailor. Well, I don't know. I-
Of course he will.
Pardon me, darling.
Why does my heart pound like a hammer
Why do I start to stutter and stammer
When I'm near the one I adore
The girl I love
Why is it I'm the silliest person
Spend all my time and keep on rehearsin'
A love song
She knows nothing of
[f [ were sure that
[ meant anything to her
I'd be brave
And here's the song
I'd bring to her
I'd sing to her
May I
Be the only one to say I
Really fell in love the day I
First set eyes on you
May I
With your very kind permissi髇
Tell you that my one ambition
Is to share a love affair with you
Here I wait
Do give me my chance
Do tell me my fate
What is your answer
May I
Hold you to my heart and pray I
Will be there beside you when they groom and bride you
May [ hear you say
I do
Oh, may I
Be the only one to say I
Really fell in love the day I
Oh, the day that
I set eyes on you
May I
With your very kind permissi髇
Tell you that my one ambition
Is to share
Oh, to share that love affair with you
Here [ wait
Do give me my chance
Do tell me my fate
What is your answer
May I
Hold you to my heart and pray I
Will be there beside you when they groom and bride you
May I hear you say
I do
Good night, lovely little lady
I believe you taught her that trick yourself.
Yes, ma'am.
Anyhow I think you better give Droopy some exercise. She looks stuffy.
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, Doris, ['m not sure the sailor and the bear should be allowed to parade this deck.
Why not, when you think of the other things that parade this deck.
Ha! We're playing bridge.
Uncle Hubert, couldn't you manage... to be a little less rude to Prince
Michael and Prince Alexander?
I don't like 'em. They're really very nice boys.
I know. I know. They dance beautifully, probably knit beautifully too.
But I don't like 'em.
You better had. They want to marry me. Both of them?
Yes. That's what makes it so difficult; I can only marry one.
Well, don't stint yourself. You know you can afford both of them.
Now, Uncle Hubert, don't be unkind.
The Siamese twins married one girl.
They're not Siamese. Well, I could paste 'em together for you.
Even then, you wouldn't have a man.
Ah! Well, you know, I'm very fond of that animal. Aren't you?
Who, me? Oh, yes,
I'm very attached to her.
Say, what would you think about giving her... a little more scope when you exercise her?
How do you mean?
Well, uh-
Wait just a minute. Just a minute. Right here.
Well, how about these?
I hardly think the owner would want me to go skating about, sir.
Oh, no, no, not for you.
Let's put 'em on Droopy.
Droopy? Yes. Then she'll get twice the exercise.
Don't you see?
Yes, sir. Yeah. Come on, Droopy, old girl.
Come on.
All right, get her up.
There you are.
Hey!
Look out!
Look out!
- Hello. Oh, I-I-
- I'll murder that sailor!
He should be put in irons!
And fed on bread and water.
Look out.!
Look out.!
The lad is teaching that bear too fast. But can you imagine that?
Fancy skating lessons the first time out. Hold her, sailor.
This is insufferable! The man must be out of his mind.
- Anybody get hurt?
- I did, but not where it shows.
In my country, the man would be taught a lesson he'd never forget.
The lad meant no harm.
Put Droopy to bed and come back here and wait for me. Yes, ma'am.
I should report you to the
Captain to be disciplined, but I prefer to deal with you myself. Yes, ma'am.
He's the freshest sailor
I've ever seen.
Ah, but he's cute.
If you'd only give me the right to protect you.
Oh, Doris, if I were your husband, such things as this would never happen to you.
Well, anyway, who wants to walk?
Hubert, I want one.
You want one?
I want a prince.
I want a drink, a great big drink.
She walks like you
She talks like you
Says pretty little things just the way you do
So I fell in love with her
Because she reminds me of you
She doubts like you
She pouts like you
Always keeps on telling me that I'm untrue
So I fell in love with her
Because she reminds me of you
Now time and time
I've called her by your name
And our love
I never have denied
But she said if I loved her half as much as I love you
She'd be more than satisfied
She sighs like you
She cries like you
Always keeps on telling me that I'm untrue
But I fell in love with her
Because she reminds me of you
Angry, Hubert? No, I'm not angry. I'm just hurt.
I had a vague idea we were engaged to be married.
I'm perfectly willing to marry you, but first I want you to buy me a prince.
What are you gonna do with it, have it stuffed?
No, I wanna marry it.
I- What?
Then when I'm a princess,
I'll divorce him and marry you.
Well? You asked me to come back.
Haven't you anything to say about your extraordinary behavior?
I'm sorry it happened, and I said so. What made you do such a thing?
The reason one does things isn't always clear.
It's perfectly clear to me.
You did it because you're fresh, irresponsible, indifferent to the decorum of my ship and safety of my guests.
Isn't that true?
Answer me!
Well, I-I wouldn't say that. A full grown man who should be doing something useful... like trying to rise in your professi髇, making yourself fit to command a ship of your own someday.
But you haven't anything on your mind but singing songs or playing games with bears.
I also scrub decks.
You are being impertinent.
I haven't said anything disrespectful... yet.
You annoy me so,
I could slap your face.
Well, if it would make you feel any better.
Ohh! Is there anything else, ma'am?
Get below and never put your foot on this deck again!
The next port we touch, you're dismissed! Yes, ma'am. Good night.
Fog lifting any? No sign of it yet, sir.
[f some sweet bambino says you are his queen-o
Then in some casino he fills you with vino
The charts!
They're overboard!
Charts. Don't be silly. Christopher
Columbus never had any charts.
It's more sporting, more exciting... to sail out into the unknown.
Now see what you've done now. Take the wheel. I'll call the skipper.
No, no, no, don't bother.
Don't bother.
I'll steer this ship like the ancient Phoenicians
- by the stars.
This is serious, sir.
Oh, calm yourself.
Men nowadays use too many gadgets. There's the North Star.
The North Star is there.
That's the North Star. I'll show you. Just a minute.
We're on a reef!.
Close all watertight doors!
Three feet of water in the port hold, sir.
Everybody on deck, and put on your life preservers!
We're sinking!
The owner and passengers will leave in Mr.Johnson's boat.
Everything is okay now, my darling.
Captain said to shove off at once. Right.
Are you coming?
One minute.
Don't worry, Edith.
I'll save you.
She's filling up fast, sir.
Stand by the pumps.
Where you goin'?
I forgot Droopy, sir.
Hurry up, Doris!
We're sinking!
- Soon as I get my clothes on!
- A life preserver's more important.
I haven't got one!
We'll save you!
I'm practically in the water now.
Hubert!
There goes our sea skate!
Look, Droopy!
Good night
Lovely little lady
[ must say adieu to you
And your loveliness
Good night
Lovely little lady
How it makes me grieve to leave
The charms you possess
For when you are gone my dear
How lonely it seems
But we'll meet again my dear
On a pillow of love
'neath a blanket of green
So good night lovely little lady
Oh, let us kiss again
And then good night
Many brave hearts
Are asleep in the deep
Well, good night
Lovely little lady
I must say adieu to you
And your loveliness
[s that you, sailor?
Yoo-hoo!
Hey, sailor!
Yoo-hoo.!
Yell in English!
- Well, where are ya?
- Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean!
Well, keep on yellin'!
We'll get together!
Yoo-hoo.!
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo.!
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo.!
Ah, there you are. Well, how ya doin'? Let go of that poor animal.
I can't. I haven't got any life preserver.
No, you wouldn't have. That's what's the matter with my yacht- sailors who haven't sense enough to wear a life preserver when the ship's sinking.
I should fire you. Ah, but you did. Don't you remember?
You're still fired.
Okay, okay. Pay me off.
Hmph! Think you're funny?
Quiet!
I'll talk as much as I
- Shut up! I think I hear land.
You hear land? Do I have to duck you to keep you quiet?
You wouldn't dare.
Oh! With the whole Pacific Ocean to swim in, I'd have to bump into you!
Get along little Droopy Get along
Work for the night is coming
Work through the morning hours
Work while-
This is beginning to depress me.
We're still on our first day, so you better keep your chin up.
My chin is fine. The trouble is with my chassis. Come on. It's your turn.
All right. What's the idea of the scotch?
Oh, I brought it along in case. [n case. Get it?
I bet the answer's funny.
Work for the night is coming
Work through the morning hours
Work while the dew is sparkling
If you'd kept out of it, I might have married her before the yacht crashed.
Yeah. Then you'd have had her money. Well, now nobody's got it.
Look! We're in!
Put me down! Oh, I can't let you drown.
Put me down, sailor! Don't be any more annoying than you can help.
Ooh!
You put me down, all right!
Looks like a nice little island.
Looks pretty lonesome. Did everybody else get off on lifeboats?
I don't know. Oh, the boys were getting me a life preserver.
One of them did. Do you know which one? No, you wouldn't.
Well, you might tell me what you think happened to 'em.
Well, there's a chance they might have drowned.
Why, with this sun, we ought to be dry in no time.
I can't stand these wet clothes a minute longer.
Then you better get up there and take 'em off.
Sailor, wring that out for me.
It hurts me to tell you this, but you'll have to get along... without a lady's man for a time.
I hate to tell you this, but I'm gonna bounce this rock on your head... as soon as [ get dressed.
Ah-ah. Remember what happened when you just slapped me.
Well, don't be unsociable, sailor.
Let's try and get along.
Well, look.
At what?
The boys.
The boys!
Well, don't stand there.
Go help them. Do something.
Right this way.
Hey, sailor, pull us ashore!
Yes, sir!
Come on.!
Nuts.
You're safe. That's the important thing. All those hours thinking you lost.
Which one of you saved me? Well, I, uh-
Well, don't be modest about it. Tell me. Doris.!
Darling! Ohh!
Honey!
Well, Doris! Oh, Uncle Hubert!
Thank heavens you're safe!
Da- Ohh.
The shipwreck hasn't turned out as well as I'd hoped.
Oh, hello, sailor. I wish we could dry out.
Sailor, build a fire.
Hurry up. I'm hungry.
Breakfast. That's an idea.
Where are we gonna get it?
- There must be things to eat.
- This is an island, probably uninhabited.
Well, the first thing is a fire. Have you matches?
Can you cook?
Certainly.
- Swell. Then we can have some breakfast.
- Not anything that takes long.
I'm famished. Something simple
- a fish, for example.
We'll leave the menu to you. I think maybe we better get one thing straight.
We're on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
There's nobody here to fetch and carry for you. Well, what's he mean?
I fired him. This seems to be a devil of a time-
You'll be well-paid for any- You can cut that. We're off the gold standard here.
What do you expect us to do? The last thing that you'd ever think of. Work.
See, I'm willing to do all I can, but you got to help yourselves.
Gather driftwood, dig clams, pack water, build a shelter. What are you gonna do?
Well, I'll show you how if you wish.
You mean you're gonna run things?
Well, it looks as though I'd have to. You seem to forget-
You can take it or leave it.
Naturally, we don't take it.
Can't take it, you mean.
''Don't take it,'' I said.
Okay. I didn't suggest it.
You got hungry.
Well, now don't you think you were a little hasty, dear?
We'll probably starve.
Oh, we'll look after you.
Just leave everything to us. Now I know we'll starve.
Aah!
Oh! Ohhh!
My lingerie. It's a blessing you're not in them.
Gracie, you've lost something. Yeah
- Oh.
Aw. Oh, thanks, George.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks for what?
For my panties.
I know better than to ask you, but what are you talking about? My panties.
It was sweet of you to buy them for me, and such a surprise too.
Listen, we're in the middle of the ocean on an uninhabited island.
We are here collecting species of flora and fauna. What station are they on?
What station are they on?
They're not on the radio. Yes.
Flora are plants and fauna are animals.
Flora and Fauna will be on the radio... because that combination sounds as good as Amos and Andy, don't you think so?
I think so.
Listen, what I'm trying to say to you is that there are no stores on the island.
Where would I buy panties?
Well, I give up, George, but why don't you buy 'em in the same place you bought these?
Yes, well
- Stop it. Stop it. You're getting daffy.
George, another surprise. Am I getting a one-pound box or a two-pound box?
I love daffy. That's my favorite candy. Stop it. You're getting nuts.
If it's just the same to you, could I have daffy without nuts?
I've had it with nuts. Listen, try to understand what I'm talking about.
You're just plain daffy. Now that's what I want
- just plain daffy.
I'm crazy about just plain daffy. You're crazy.
My map! My map of the island! This is the result of two months surveying!
What is all this? What are these little marks? Those are my inventions.
That's my moose trap.
Moose trap?
You probably mean a mousetrap. Oh, no. This is for more than one mouse.
You see, two mouse make a mice.
And two mice make a moose.
And two mice make a moose?
How is this silly invention of yours gonna catch moose? Well, it doesn't.
It catches lions and tigers. Lions and tigers?
Well, sure. You see, it has a sign on the trap.
It says, ''Keep out. For moose only.'' That explains it, I guess.
And the lions and tigers can't read,
So they go in and get caught. so they go in and get caught.
I wanna show you my invention. You couldn't invent something that would make you disappear.
Well, I'm working on that. Come on.
Look. Footprints.
Where do they come from?
What are they doing here?
Well, that's part of my trap.
Animals always follow footprints, you know. I-
What are you doing? I'm picking up the footprints so the animals won't follow us.
''So the animals won't follow us''? Yes.
It's part of your invention. That came right out of my own head.
I'd have it stuffed. Your head. My head?
Oh, I have brains.
Animals.
My shaving mirror.
I've been looking for it for days.
Well, that's part of my invention also.
You see, the lion sees himself in the mirror and thinks it's another lion.
So he, the real lion, snatches the piece of meat so the other lion won't get it.
I'll see you later. Don't go,
George. I haven't finished yet.
Now, look. You be the lion and pull the string. Pull the string.
Moose trap.
There you are.
Come on, George.
Well... who is that?
Well, that's Uncle Fred.
He frightens the lions. No, he really doesn't do anything.
Ya see, he was always very kind to animals, so I just put him there out of sentiment.
Come on, George.
And this-This is a barrel. I'm glad you told me because for a minute,
I thought that was a barrel.
Yeah.
There ya go.
Quiet. Quiet.
George, kick the coconut.
Kick? I'll be glad to.
Oh, this next one will get ya.
Clever. Don't you think so? I think so.
Did you notice the camera? Yes.
In case the lion gets away, then we always have a picture of it.
And the music soothes the savage beast. Soothes the savage beast.
Is that gun loaded? Oh, sure. If you pull on the rope, it goes boom.
It goes boom?
Oh, yeah.
Let me out of here! I'd like to, but
I have to wait until it gets dark.
Good and dark? Well, sure because if I let you out now, the animals might see me, and then they'll know how to get out.
Well, good-bye, George.
I'll see ya sometime tonight.
Gracie.
Good-bye, George.
Gracie! Gracie! Good-bye.!
Good-bye, George.!
Never treat others with scorn
We're only here
'cause we're born
Although you're way up
You may not stay up
Stop tootin' your horn
Why boast of the wealth you possess
High on the hill of success
On friendship you never should frown
You'll need the same friends
On the weary way down
So love thy neighbor
Walk up and say how be ya
Gee, but I'm glad to see ya, pal
How's tricks
What's new
Love thy neighbor
Offer to share his burden
Tell him to say the word 'n'
You will see him through
'Specially if there should be
A beautiful girl next door
Say to that girl next door
Now don't think ['m bold
But my mother told me to love thy neighbor
And you will find your labor
A great deal easier
Life will be breezier
If you love thy neighbor
How will we live? What'll we do? What'll we eat?
We'll live on the milk of human kindness and coconuts to you.
I could live here forever.
It's wonderful. It's grand.
Especially when a charming neighbor lends such a helping hand.
Oh, let's be domestic happy and love nest-ic
Let's begin to turn this into an island of joy
You'll be the papa and I'll be the mama
We'll be a hubby and spouse
You wash the dishes
I'll look at Ballyhoo
Let's play house
Own your own home, the acme of perfection.
And the customer is always right. We're open for inspection.
Inquire on the premises. If nothing suits you, we will alter.
For when a home is built on the foundation of love, it's as strong as the rocks of''Gibraltinter.''
Uh, Gi-Gi-Gibraltar. There it stands, yawning invitingly.
Into its fold let's creep.
It was yawnin', Massa.
It was yawnin', but it's rolled over and done gone to sleep.
'Specially should there be
A beautiful girl next door
I will say to that girl next door
Now don't think I'm bold
My mama told me to love thy neighbor
And you will find your labor
A great deal easier
Life will be breezier
If you love thy neighbor
I'll never go on another uninhabited island.
I don't care who lives there.
Quitters!
Could we help you in a nice way?
I'll set the table and wash the dishes afterwards.
If you want anything to eat, you'll have to go dig some clams.
Maybe if I made a noise like a female clam, they'd come out by themselves.
Come on, dear.
Maybe the sailor has a match. No!
Well, not so gently.
Hit it hard.
I was only trying to act like a lady. Why, with all your talents?
Oh, it's no use.
That's what I thought.
I think maybe I'll go borrow a light from the sailor.
I think maybe
I'll go with you.
All right. If that's what you want to do.
Could we be of any assistance to you?
Go up there and gather some wood... both of you.
Anybody care to drink a little dessert?
Did you ever see anyone so stubborn?
Well, sir, everything a man needs to live is right here... ready to take.
Why, with a hammer and saw,
I could build a city.
What you could do with tools.
Are you gonna let me starve?
Say, if you wanna eat, you gotta work... just like the rest of us.
Papa spank.
Thank you.
That's just the same as stealing.
Oh, I ought to slap your face. If it would make you feel any better.
Gracie, what's the matter? I can't sleep.
Why don't you try counting sheep? Shh! I did. Look.
News flash: The oil tanker
Good Hope reports by radio... they have rescued the crew of the palatial yacht Doris, which was owned by Miss Doris Worthington, heiress of the Worthington millions.
The owner and her party are believed lost.
Did you hear that? Isn't that awful? I should say that is.
Sure. They woke up my sheep.
Gracie, why don't you go to sleep?
I can't go to sleep. I've got insomnia. George, frighten me, and that will cure my insomnia.
All right,
I'll frighten ya.
Close your eyes and count from one to 20, and I'll frighten ya.
Yeah, all right.
Now no peekin'.
B-19, 20!
Here I come!
Ready or not! Here-Aw!
George! George!
George?
George, where are you?
That's a good disguise, George, but it doesn't frighten me. Try again.
Ready or not, here I come.
Here I- George?
Georgie Porgie?
George.!
Georgie!
Ye-
Oh, that's much better, George, but your baby-blue eyes gave you away.
I don't know, but I think you look better in that than you do in your street clothes.
I'm getting tired.
Let's stop playing and carry me home piggyback. Whee! Here I go!
Now, George, not too fast.
Oh, George! You know bears can't climb trees!
Now George Martin, take me down this instant. Gracie!
Who are you?
Who am I?
If this is you up here, then who are you down there?
Gracie, this is me. That's a real bear up there. Come on down.
Yeooooowwww!
Come on, Gracie!
May [

Gracie, my gun! A bird! What?
A bird! A bird! All right, wait a minute.! Here.
Not a duck. My gun! How could you shoot with a duck?
Well, my father used to shoot ducks, but maybe that duck wasn't loaded.
I'd like to bet that your father was. If he was, then why did... the duck shoot my father because I always say
- Quiet! Quiet!
Well, I missed him. He's gone, and that was a stratosphere duck, and they're very rare.
I'm glad you missed him. I don't like rare duck. I like my ducks well-done.
Now take my uncle.
You take your uncle.
They did.
They did?
My uncle's a hunter. Well,
I'd rather not hear about it.
My uncle always goes out duck hunting.
Now Monday he takes four dogs, and Tuesday he takes three dogs.
Gracie, Gracie, why does he take four dogs Monday and three dogs Tuesday?
Because that other dog won't follow him on Tuesday. Why?
Because he shot him Monday.
Nice work. He aims at little innocent birds and shoots dogs.
Yeah, all except one dog. His favorite dog. His name is Scram.
Your uncle's name is Scram? Oh, stop. No, the dog's name is Scram.
You see, that saves my uncle a lot of money calling him Scram.
Because the dog's name is Scram, that saves your uncle a lot of money?
Sure. When he calls the dog to feed him, he hollers, ''Scram! Scram!''
And the dog runs away. I get the whole thing. And the dog runs away.
I mean, the whole-
Gracie, the stratosphere duck! My gun!
George, hit him! Hit him hard! Hit him hard!
Gracie! Gracie!
I missed him.
I missed him!
George, you missed him with your gun, but you didn't miss him with your head.
I think you shoot straighter with your head than with your gun. You think so?
I think so. Let me tell ya somethin'. There is nothing up here.
Yeah, I know.
What was that? The moose trap.
Something's caught in my moose trap.
Moose trap.
Me know you.
Gracie, what's the matter?
We just caught Tarzan's mate.
Tarzan is a character in a book. Well, maybe he got out.
Would you mind helping me out of this hole?
Well, who are you?
Where did you come from?
We were shipwrecked on the other side of the island. Do you live here?
Well, temporarily. We're Mr. and
Mrs. George Martin. Naturalists.
Our camp-
I'm Miss Doris Worthington.
Oh. Oh, Gracie, this is the missing heiress.
Hello. Maybe she knows where my missing brother is. Do you know where my missing brother-
Gracie. Instead of shooting a bird,
I should have shot a little idiot.
If you gotta shoot an idiot, shoot a big one. We're gonna have company for dinner.
We heard about your shipwreck on the radio.
Ships are searching all the islands for you. Oh, how nice.
Our boat is coming next month. In the meantime, we could make you comfortable at our camp.
Thank you. But for the present, could you just lend us some clothes?
Oh, certainly.
Why, certainly.
And a kit of tools?
Tools?
Yes, a tool kit, if you'll be so kind.
Playing boats?
Tools! This is luck!
A gift from heaven. Now you can build that city you were talking about.
This feels like a blanket. That's to sleep on after you've built your city.
Clothes! Ohh! Now where do you suppose they came from?
Maybe they were washed ashore.
Here.
Carry some of these.
Come on.
Well, sir, it's a good thing somebody around here keeps his eyes open.
Sailor, I don't know how we'd ever get along without you.
Hey, look, Robinson Crusoe. Why do we have to do everything in one day?
Is our lease up tonight? Oh, stop crabbin'. The work is good for your liver.
My liver never did anything for me.
Anyhow you'll all sleep well tonight.
See, a little work won't hurt you... for once.
Oh, I don't mind work now and then.
But I don't want it to become a habit.
Don't say that, Uncle Hubert. He worked harder himself than any of us.
He certainly did.
Why, we've only begun to work.
Tomorrow we'll get an early start, about 6:00.
What? And waste the whole morning?
Stop grumbling. The least you can do is obey orders cheerfully.
Without the sailor to lead us, where would we be now? Asleep.
We'd probably be dead of starvation and exposure. Oh, now don't exaggerate.
I'm gonna hit the hay.
Call me October 8.
How can you think of sleep on a night like this?
Smell the breeze. It's perfume.
Smell it yourself. It's your idea.
Aw, let's go out in the jungle and pick some orchids.
No, I'm tired. Let 'em come out here and pick us.
Now you draw two hearts with an arrow joining them.
Then you put the initials inside the hearts. Oh, I didn't see you.
That's what annoyed me. I'm just trying to figure out a simple method... of bringing fresh water into the camp. See-
Sailor, look at the moon.
Now look at me.
Now tell me what you're thinking about.
Uh, this, uh- this diagram. I-
Sailors aren't what they used to be.
No, sir. Gimme the good old sailors.
If I could get this figured out tonight,
I think we could have it in operation in three or four days.
How long do you expect to be here?
Well, your guess is as good as mine.
Maybe better. You know you're just like that butler in the play, the one that was marooned with his lady?
What was his name?
Crichton, isn't it?
Crichton. That's right.
The Admirable Crichton.
Only he was dressed in skins, showing his chest.
Am I gonna get to see your chest, sailor?
Everything's funny to you, isn't it?
The lady fell in love with him. I remember that part.
But it didn't turn out very happily. He had to give her up.
[ remember that part. It must have been fun while it lasted.
Oh, she was a selfish little prig.
How could he fall in love with a selfish little prig?
I did.
Who is she?
Wouldn't it be better if you ran along and let me figure out the water supply?
No. It's after working hours.
Who is the little pig you fell in love with? Prig.
Who is she?
You.
I fell in love with you the day you walked up that gangplank.
You kept it pretty quiet. What's the matter with me, too much money?
No. Nobody has too much money. What then?
Don't you think you better... go to bed?
Look, sailor. Why didn't you tell me you're in love with me?
A man hasn't a right to keep a thing like that to himself.
I didn't want to.
Why not?
Because I have a fairly clear idea about my life- what I want and what
I have to do. Such as?
When we get off this island, I'd like to continue around the worid. I'm an architect.
At least, that's what they told me at college.
I've been offered a job in New York.
Is that so important?
No, but it's better than letting a wife support you.
You mean that, sailor?
I wish I didn't.
I never thought about it that way before.
But, you see, it hurts because I saw you too when I came up the gangplank.
You had a smudge of grease on your nose.
Well... what are we gonna do about it?
Nothing. Then why are you making love to me?
I'm not making love to you. Yes, you are, sailor.
Really, you are.
And I want you to, though I don't know why.
Once in a blue moon
Someone like you happens along
Out of a clear blue sky
Here are you
Here am I
Once in a blue moon
Life will become a beautiful song
Though we were worids apart
Here we are heart to heart
Souls
That used to be strange souls
Now are sharing
A dream so divine
Lips
That used to be strange lips
Are declaring
I love you
Will you be mine
Say you'll be mine
Once in a blue moon
Someone like you happens along
A blessing from heaven
Above
Here are you
Here am I
This is love
Miss Worthington.!
Miss Worthington.!
Miss Worthington! Do you know where Miss Worthington is?
This is
Miss Worthington herself.
[ came to tell you that you're rescued, and the captain's-
Two boats arrived searching for you over in the cove by our camp now.
We thought we'd better come fetch you. You could spend the night... at our camp and be ready for an early start. George would like his tools.
Come on.
Well, no, wait a minute.
[ mean, the tools and the clothes that we leant her to play thatjoke on somebody.
Yes, thank you.
You can take the rest across.
We'll follow in a few minutes. Come on.
Ye- Oh, oh.
Don't be angry.
Please.
Why don't you go? You've had your fun. Don't take it like that.
Go on back to your friends. A lot of people laughing makes it funnier.
Stephen- You can tell them the rest of it- how I made love to you and told you my life's history and everything.
They'll die laughing.
I kissed you.
Now that meant a lot to you, didn't it? Doris.!
Oh, Doris!
Here [ am, Michael.!
- You gave us an awful scare, Doris.
- We thought you got lost.
She's not alone.
Well, practically alone. Come along, Doris.
The others started over long ago. Miss Worthington isn't going.
She's staying here.
What's he talking about?
Thank heaven we don't have to take any more of his insolence.
Come along, Doris. On your way, before I break both your necks.
See here. The man's crazy. I've been wanting to do this for a long time.
That was a very stupid thing to do.
Why? Can't we all play games?
I like to play rough.
Will you tell me what on Earth
- You'll find out.
I suppose a fate worse than death awaits me.
How do you know it's worse than death?
You never been dead, have ya?
Let me go!
I will not!
Let me outta here! This is not exactly a perfumed boudoir, but after all, Adam and Eve got along all right. You wouldn't dare!
Why wouldn't I? Tomorrow you'll be back in your own worid... spoiled and petted and sheltered and out of my reach.
In all my life, I'll probably never see you again.
But tonight you're mine, just as you pretended to be.
Remember this, will you?
And remember it always.
Remember there was a man you led on and laughed at. A man who could have-
Well, he didn't... because you're not worth it.
Doris. Are you all right?
Are we in time?
Yes, you're in time.
Doris, I feel you ought to know that it was Michael who gave you his life preserver.
Alexander, you shouldn't have told her. I asked you not to.
Michael is so modest. It was very nice of you, Michael.
I'll see that you get a
Carnegie medal or something.
Ready,
Miss Worthington.
You know
- Gracie, do you miss these people so much?
No, they don't mean anything in my life. Then why are you crying?
Oh, this thing keeps pinchin' my stomach.
Mr., Mrs., Mrs., Mrs.,
Mrs., Mrs., Miss.
Say, look at this.
''Miss Lucille Van Epps O'Rourk,
Park Avenue, New York.''
Mike!
Alex!
If you're drinking scotch-a and feeling quite reckless
And some sweet muchacha says ''buy me a necklace''
It's just an old
Spanish custom
Ah, my Adonis, so handsome, so fair.
Smoke gets in your eyes, but you gets in my hair.
Go to your royal princes.
We're finished. We're through.
Princes now are quite taboo
All I crave is Y-O-U
Can't you see, woof-woof
It's the animal in me
Skipper wants to see you on the bridge. Right.
- I changed ships.
- Why?
On account of Droopy.
She needs a father.
Now what did you come here for?
For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer.
No, really, Stephen. I want to study architecture too.
Haven't you had enough fun with me?
I've never been so serious in all my life. Please believe me.
No. Oh, I'm sorry for what I did to you.
I'll be good, Stephen, really I will.
I'll do everything you tell me to.
Say, do I have to slap your face to make you kiss me?
['ll be there beside you when they groom and bride you
May [ hear you say [ do
Hey, Captain. Can you sing ''Good
Night, Lovely Little Lady''?
- Yes.
- Then sing it loud and clear.
Good night
Lovely little lady
Doris
Lovely little lady
Dearest one you are
A blessing from heaven above
Here are you
Here am I
This is love
- How's Florrie?
- She's okay, Joe.
- Take her to the hospital?
- We didn't have time.
- I want to see her.
- Your public's calling, get back out there.
Thanks, folks.
It's been five years now since you've said hello to me and Florrie...
...but this time she asks to be excused.
Joe, it's a boy.
Go on.
Well, it looks like I've got a son.
Born in the Palace Theater.
Here's a toast to vaudeville, the greatest entertainment in the world.
It made me what I am today, a papa.
And it's pretty nice, I tell you.
Having that little home down there on Long Island...
...where you can take the wife and kiddies.
Where you can lay off all summer long...
...in the country instead of a crowded boarding house in the roaring '40s...
...where there's nothing but streets to play in, like I had when I was a kid.
What other business is like that,
I ask you? There ain't none.
Vaudeville, boy, you're something.
Listen, you mugs, quiet.
With so many of the best in one bunch,
I'm tempted to warn you.
There's a shadow coming up, may change things a whole lot.
It's getting taller, that shadow, and wider, very fast.
The motion picture.
Shadow is right, making faces.
Flash in the pan.
Motion pictures change things?
Not until the Hudson catches fire.
- Yeah. He's right.
- Okay, okay, boys, I hope you're right.
Here's to 40 weeks, may it last forever.
I tell you, Joe, there's no vaudeville anymore.
Now, take the Palace Theater...
...go there any day in the week, even Monday, what do you see?
A lot of people buying tickets for a talking picture.
I don't know what to make of it.
Something's gotta be done.
Every vaudeville performer in Seaport is broke, and owes everybody in town.
I never thought that pictures would take the place of vaudeville.
- Maybe if you and Mom had a new act.
- New act, new act?
You talk like your brother.
- Where is Mickey?
- He's in town at the music publisher's.
He wrote a song last night.
He'll write another tonight, like last night and the night before.
Kids have to go through their song writing age, I remember when you did.
And I wrote some pretty good ones too.
And what did it get me, nothing.
Mickey is wasting his time.
He'd better learn a trade and forget about show business...
...or he'll wind up like me.
- There must be some theaters left, Dad.
- A lot of empty ones.
But, darling, with a good bill you could open them.
There's a lot of good acts here that would be tickled to death to have the opportunity.
Say, that's an idea.
A road show with a lot of old-timers.
So a guy's got to do it himself, eh?
Okay.
I'm going over to Brice's and see what he thinks.
And that 10-percenter said that vaudeville was dead.
Not with a lot of troupers like us around here.
- Will you okay this lyric?
- Wait a minute, I want to hear this song.
Good morning, good morning
We've danced the whole night through
Good morning, good morning to you
Good morning, good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning, good morning to you
When the band began to play
The stars were shining bright
Now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say good night
So good morning, good morning
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good morning, my darling, to you
Here we are together
A couple of stayer-uppers
Our day is done at breakfast time
And starts in with our suppers
Here we are together
But the best of friends must party
So let me sing this parting song
From the bottom of my hearty
- Good morning
- It's a lovely morning
- Good morning
- What a wonderful day
- We've danced the whole night through
- Danced the whole night through
- Good morning, good morning to you
- Good morning, good morning to you
- How do you do, do, do?
- I said good morning
- See, the sun is shining
- A good morning
Hear the birdies sing
- It's great to stay up late
- It's great to stay up late
- Good morning, good morning to you
- Good morning, good morning to you
When the band began to play
The stars were shining bright
Now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say good night
Good morning, good morning
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good morning, good morning
Sell it, Ma, sell it.
Good morning, my darling, to you
- How was it?
- Where did you swipe that?
Oh, quit your kidding.
Words and music by Michael Z. Moran.
Why, it'll sweep the country. Won't it?
- Nothing very new there, Mickey.
- Oh, what good is new?
It's the same old rose you see every year.
But it's just a little fresher, but it's the same thing, isn't it?
- How many have you brought me, Mickey?
- I brought you five that you didn't publish.
But I ain't mad,
I'm gonna give you another chance, see?
You can't be wrong all the time, nobody is.
- How much do you want for it?
- The usual, 1000.
I'll give you 100.
- A hundred.
- A hundred.
- Honest?
- Oh, that's wonderful.
Mickey, he's gonna publish it.
He is.
Oh, he's fainted. Quick, get some water.
He's... Get some water.
Oh, Mickey, please speak to me.
Wake up. Oh, dear.
It was too much for him.
He couldn't believe it.
Good thing I didn't say yes to the thousand...
- ...or he'd have dropped dead.
- Yeah.
Are you all right, Mickey?
Speak to me, Mickey.
- What happened?
- Mr. Randall's gonna publish your song.
Look, here's your advance check for $ 100.
Gee, Mr. Randall, you don't know what this means to me.
I'll never forget you.
You know, you can always be my publisher.
I'm telling you that.
You better get him home before he passes out again.
- Don't have to worry.
- I understand.
I'm not ever gonna get the big head like...
- You can always be my publisher.
- Okay.
Wait a minute, friend, you've got my head.
Didn't hurt, though. Didn't hurt.
- See you later.
- It's all right.
You know, it's just like coming home from a big battle the winners.
- Yeah, it was a tough fight, Ma, but we won.
- Oh, Mickey, I'm so proud of you.
But think of all the time lost because my stuff wasn't recognized before.
Oh, well, all geniuses have trouble getting started.
Sure, that's what makes them geniuses.
Oh, Mickey, aren't they pretty?
Wait a minute, I wanna pick some.
Just think of it, Pat. My first 100 bucks.
- And it's only the beginning too.
- Is it really the beginning?
Does it mean that I'm really on my way in the theater?
- I want success so.
- And you'll have it.
I know you will, Mickey.
Just think when our names are up in electric lights.
You, the big composer and producer, and me, the singing star.
Oh, and I'll work hard for you, Mickey, honest I will.
Yeah, then when we go on our vacations to Europe...
...you know, like you read in the paper.
- Our folks won't have to worry.
- No.
We can pay the bills then.
Pat, sometimes do you ever feel older than your folks?
Lots. Especially when they talk about
40 weeks on the road.
Yeah, and making a comeback.
Gee, it must be terrible to be a has-been.
Don't talk like that. It scares me.
We gotta work hard and make a lot of dough for our folks.
That will be fun.
Oh, won't it be fun, Mickey?
Oh, with both of us in there pitching, it certainly will be.
It's got to be.
Pat, I'd like to buy you a little something out of this 100 bucks, but I... oh, we gotta pay our grocery bill too.
Well, I... Just the same
I'd like to show my appreciation some way.
Would you like my pin?
It's your music class pin.
Well, what do you want me to say?
You know what I want you to say.
Well, I won't.
All right then, don't.
Oh, Pat, I do.
You do what?
I do, what you want me to say and I won't.
Very much.
- Well, that settles that.
- Yeah.
Gee, you know, it's good for a man to have responsibilities.
Your act is just as sure fire as it was when you were knocking them in the aisle.
Say, Dad. Dad, what's going on here?
Mickey, we're going on the road, all of us.
- Oh, gee, that's swell, Dad. When do leave?
- Mickey, none of us kids can go.
None of the kids can...
What do you mean, Dad?
Well, you see, son, it's only the acts that go, no excess baggage.
You call talent excess baggage?
Dad, there's a lot of entertainment on this side of the room.
You folks are responsible for it.
We're your kids, chips off the old block.
Most of us were born in theaters, greasepaint in our veins.
You say you don't want us to go on a stage. No.
You want us to be lawyers and brokers and your girls to marry rich guys.
- I suppose that's bad being a broker.
- Clark Gable ain't on relief.
- You're too young, all of you.
- Oh, yeah?
I suppose I'm too young to sell a song I wrote.
Look, 100 bucks in advance.
- What?
- Mickey, you sold your song.
- Yeah, Mom, and it's all yours too.
- Oh, Mickey, I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.
- Of course, I always knew you had talent.
Well, so do the other kids.
I've seen them do their stuff.
Take our sister for instance.
What a voice, a natural.
Two more years and she'll be in the Met.
Patsy and Don Jr. And Dody are swell dancers.
- But our acts are routine, they're standard.
- I'll say they're standard.
So standard that when you miss a line the audience can prompt you.
All right, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be fresh, but I've got a new slant on things.
Got my finger on the pulse of the public.
You wanna hear something?
Molly and Patsy come on over here.
Look out. Spread out kids, give us room to work here, will you?
Get set. We'll show them whether we got talent or not.
Wait, until you hear, this will send you solid.
Now, come on, kids, give your all.
To look at us you'd never dream
The two of us were twins
In fact it's quite ridiculously odd
But speaking pedagogically
And not too biologically
We're really just like two peas in a pod
We both like to swim
And we both like to dance
We both could fall in love with Gable
If we had the chance
Our tastes are just the same
Except for just one thing
I like opera
I like swing
We both like to eat
But it pains us to discuss
The fact we like potatoes
But potatoes don't like us
But when we want to sing a song
We're really on a spot
For I sing sweet
And I sing hot
You are my lucky star
My darling, you're my lucky star
I saw you from afar
Rudolpho
Robert Taylor
Minneapolis and St. Paul
You are
My lucky star
Once there was a barber
A barber who lived in Spain
He was a barbering fool,
A shaving fool, shaving fool from Spain
He was kind of crazy,
He was always singing in the rain
His name was Figaro The barber of Seville
Figaro
Figaro
Figaro was Spanish
Every time there's a bullfight He quits
Shave and a hair cut, six bits
Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro
Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro
Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro
Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro
Figaro
Figaro
Figaro
We're gonna break it up tonight
Stand back
Give them room
- You've gotta clown
- Yeah, you gotta clown on old Broadway
Broadway rhythm, it's got me
Everybody dance
Broadway rhythm, it's got me
Everybody dance
Out on the gay white way
And each merry cafe
Orchestras play
Taking your breath away with that
Broadway rhythm, it's got me Everybody sing
Everybody stand right up and dance
- Hey, Pop, how did you like that?
- Oh, it was fine. Grand, son.
Great, but you see, for instance, that number, it just wouldn't fit in.
- Well, for Pete's sake, why?
- Because we're doing a comeback show.
The kind of acts we did on the big time.
They've got value, a selling point.
Oh, I get you, Pop.
I've gotta show you, just like the rest of the world.
I thought we could help you, but you don't want us on the stage, do you?
- Just because you're all... Just because...
- Wait a minute, Mickey.
All right, I hope you're all a big success.
Mickey's sort of excited, that's all.
- Wait a minute, Mick.
- Don't mind what the folks say, Mickey.
- We're with you.
- Sure we are.
- Everything will be all right.
- Buck up, Mickey.
I shouldn't have shot my mouth off the way I did.
It's all right, they understand.
I wouldn't wanna hurt Dad for all the show business in the world.
- Forget it.
- Certainly, our time will come.
- You bet it will.
- Sure, sure.
Listen, you kids,
I think our time has come.
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you.
Might as well face it, our folks are up against it, and up against it good.
I've been snooping around...
- ...know what I found out?
- What?
There's a frame up to get the actors and their kids out of it.
Our houses are mortgaged unless payments are up to date by July 1 st or out we go.
Yeah, I know something else too.
Miss Steele of the Welfare Society...
...is getting a petition to send us to a state work school.
- Work school?
- Are you kidding?
- Can I go too, Mickey?
- Quiet, will you, Bobs?
She thinks we ought to be learning a trade instead of the theater.
She's against show business.
Just be her chance, while our folks are on the road.
We can't go on the road.
No, we're too young.
We're excess baggage.
You willing to stick together and pull yourselves out?
- You bet.
- I've got an idea.
Our folks think we're babes in arms?
We'll show them whether we are or not.
I'm gonna write a show for us and put it on right here in Seaport.
The most up to date thing these hicks here have ever seen.
Opening night, we'll have Max Gordon,
Sam Harris down to give us the once over.
How about it, kids?
We'll get every kid in this town on our side and we'll start now. What do you say?
All right. Come on kids, let's go.
They call us babes in arms
But we are babes in armor
They laugh at babes in arms
But we'll be laughing far more
On city streets and farms
They'll hear a rising war cry
Youth will arrive
Let them know you're alive
Make it your cry
- They call us babes in arms
- We never dance
- They think they must direct us
- Got no chance
- But if we're babes in arms
- To find romance
- We'll make them all respect us
- Why our arms?
- Why have we got our arms?
- And what's our eyes?
- What have we got our sight for?
- Our sight for, fight for.
Play day is done We've a place in the sun
We must fight for
So babes in arms
- To arms
- To arms
To arms, babes in arms
- We don't wanna go to county farms
- No
Come on, you babes in arms
Stand up for your rights
We're coming, we're coming
Come on, you sons and daughters
We gotta fight
We're coming, we're coming
George Washington was just a kid
When he chopped down that tree
But if they'd locked him up for that
Where'd this country be?
- We gotta stand
- We gotta stand
- We gotta stand right up
- We gotta stand right up
We got to stand right up
And tell them that we're right
Yeah, we gotta fight. Yeah, we gotta fight
Fight, fight
What do we cheer for?
What are we here for?
Why were we born?
What do we cry for? What do we die for?
Why do we mourn?
Life doesn't stop, life doesn't wait
It goes on
We've got to step
We've got to skate into the dawn
It's a new day
It's a new day, our flag's unfurled
Come on, let's tell it to the world
On city streets and farms
You'll hear a rising war cry
Youth will arrive, let them know you're alive
Make it your cry
They call us babes in arms
A tisket, a tasket,
Who wants your yellow basket?
They think they must direct us
Babes in arms are growing up,
Growing up, growing, growing
But if we're babes in arms
Going around the mulberry bush
Who wants to go around the mulberry bush?
We'll make them all respect us
Hooray, hooray, it's Emancipation Day
- Why have we got our arms?
- We got arms so we can fight
What have we got our sight for?
Play day is done
We've a place in the sun We must fight for
So babes in arms
To arms
In the beginning, we will see Patsy singing...
...the most recently published song number "Good Morning," followed by...
Where is the other piece of music?
What are you doing, son?
Oh, nothing. Just scribbling.
- Another song?
- A show.
You're so much like me, you're funny.
- I am?
- Exactly.
You know, I used to troupe with your grandpop, was he stubborn.
I used to try to get him to put new things in the act.
You know, like you do to me?
- Wouldn't he do it either?
- Not a chance.
- What happened?
- What happened?
He was the greatest headliner in vaudeville, right up to the day that he died.
Yeah, I know what you mean, Pop.
You know, Mickey, you're like a lot of kids.
You think your old man is finished, washed up.
Why, Dad, listen here.
They don't come any better than you.
Anyway, your mom and me are leaving in the morning.
I'm sorry you can't go along the way you used to.
I'm going to miss you, a lot.
Yeah.
I know, Dad.
But I'm depending on you to stay here and take care of things.
- I hope things break real big for you, Dad.
- Thanks.
- Is Judge Black in?
- Yes, ma'am.
I wonder what cause she's agitating for now.
I never saw a woman get so excited over other people's business.
My duty is concerned with those poor children.
And something has got to be done about it.
I want my nephew to tell you what he knows.
Go on.
Well, the vaudeville kids kind of run in a gang.
They seem to be cooking up something.
Next thing you know, we'll have a series of filling station robberies.
- Who's the ring leader?
- A tough little kid named Moran.
There's no doubt about it, judge, he's a bad influence around town.
- Do you know him very well?
- No. Just to speak to.
I go to military school upstate.
Just step outside, Jeff.
I want to talk to Judge Black alone.
As you very well know, John,
I'm head of the welfare board here.
And I'm serving notice on you...
...that I'm not gonna let innocent children be the victims of society.
Their parents have no income. We don't know if those youngsters eat regularly.
We know they stay away from school half the time. They're undisciplined.
They haven't a chance of learning an occupation that'll support them.
I call that criminal.
But, Martha, you'd be taking them away from their homes.
Homes? Those poor little things haven't any worthy of the name.
Martha, my whole life's been lived in this town.
I saw the actors come in.
They built their homes here.
They built the church, the library.
Why, their taxes even paved the roads.
They're sweet lovable people.
Just grownup children.
And we ought to thank God...
...for the pleasure and laughter they've given us in our drab lives.
Right now they're having hard times.
And you want me to help you torment these poor folks...
...by taking their children away from them?
I won't do it, Martha.
- You mean, you won't...?
- And that's final.
You'd sacrifice the children for the grownups.
All right, John, I accept your challenge.
I'll see this thing through alone.
Our bankroll will only stand two Cokes.
I never drink anything but Cokes anyway.
Two great, big, large, wonderful, expensive Cokes.
- Here.
- Patty, look, let's pretend.
All right, where are we?
We're in the Stork Club in New York City and it's after our opening night.
- I'm in tails and a white tie.
- And I have on an ermine coat.
Oh, Mickey,
I've just got to have an ermine coat.
Oh, sure, sure.
And the Cokes here, this is champagne.
Oh, aren't you just mad about champagne?
Yeah, but if this was champagne,
I'd rather have the money it costs instead.
Now, don't worry about it.
You thought up that big parade to advertise the show...
...and anybody that can think that up...
- ...can think up anything.
- Thanks.
Just think when those
New York producers sign us up.
You know, I've been thinking, maybe we should get us an agent.
Sometimes you get worse than I do.
I'm worried about getting the show on.
I never realized how much a piece of cellophane and a yard of cheesecloth cost.
What have you planned?
Our folks owe the stores a lot of dough,
I'll say:
"If you want to collect that money you've got to put dough into our show...
...so we can be a success then pay you back."
I don't understand, but it sounds wonderful.
I got the ideas out of a paper.
Seems a lot of countries are borrowing money...
...so why can't an American go in and borrow money the same as anybody else?
Sometimes I think that being a great Broadway producer...
...isn't going to be big enough for you,
Mickey.
Here comes trouble.
Do take the darlings, Alexander.
Let them walk around a bit.
In California, we have drive-ins.
You stay in the car.
- Who's the girl with him?
- I think it's... It is. It's Baby Rosalie.
- Remember the kid movie star?
- Oh, yeah.
Hello, Patsy. Miss Barton, this is
Miss Essex, the once famous Baby Rosalie.
How do you do?
I remember you very well.
Really? Did you see my biggest success,
The Queen's Little Daughter...
...or did you see my smash hit,
The Baby General?
Well, let me see, I...
It all seems so long ago.
Sauerkraut juice, please.
- I watch my weight very carefully.
- Yes.
I hear you're going to produce a show.
Oh, he is. This is Mickey Moran.
- How do you do?
- Anything for me in your show?
I'm dying to get back in the harness.
You? In...
Why, I think that would be swell.
And with your name and all...
You don't wanna fool around with a punk like this.
You be quiet. You wanna come over to my place for dinner and talk it over?
- Tomorrow night? Oh, I...
- Say, listen.
My aunt's gonna put you in the state work school where you belong.
Why, you...!
- Please, don't fight over me.
- Stop it. Mickey!
- Don't worry, it's a pleasure.
- Stop it! Stop it!
Oh, my perfumes.
Hey, get out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of here, all of you. Get out.
Come now, come now, quiet, please.
This is not a picnic.
This is a very serious matter.
Proceed, Mr. Marks.
And when these young roughnecks finished up...
...my drugstore looked as though they'd taken an ax to it.
I want you to know that seven bottles...
...of my most expensive perfumes were busted.
Forgive me if I say I told you so.
Martha, my faith in human nature would be shattered if you didn't.
Why doesn't somebody tell what he said to my brother?
I'll tell. I was there.
He told Mickey his aunt was gonna put him in the state work school.
I hope you see how this proves every point I made.
Even with provocation, wrecking this man's shop...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Young man, I'll trouble you to step into my private office.
There are things I'd like to clear up.
The rest of you will kindly wait here.
- Mickey.
- Well?
Let you in on a little secret.
I don't need those glasses any more than a rabbit.
But in times of stress, they're the best safety valve I ever had.
Gives me time to think too before acting.
- You ought to find something like that.
- Oh, I got it.
You mean I ought to think first and then bust-up drugstores afterwards.
Come over here and sit down.
- Quit school, huh?
- Yeah, last fall.
Tried to get a job. Started writing songs, you know, show numbers.
Where's your father playing now?
Schenectady.
Good booking?
I'm so worried about my family, judge,
I'm sick inside me.
Miss Steele might be right, Mickey.
It's not fair for you youngsters to be carrying grownup burdens.
I'm wondering if you were my son, if
I wouldn't rather see you in some school...
...getting an education.
Yes, I think if I were your parents,
I might sign Miss Steele's petition.
No, no, no, judge, you don't understand.
She don't understand either.
Why, she don't mean no harm to us...
...but we're not her kind of people or yours either.
We belong in show business.
We gotta start young so we can get some steel in our backbone.
Well, gee, we're developing it.
You couldn't teach us a trade.
We got one.
And you couldn't do without it.
We're only kids now...
...but someday we're gonna be the guys that make you laugh and cry.
Think that there's a little stardust left on life's dirty old pan.
She don't understand.
Why, she'd put butterflies to work making rubber tires.
I'm not saying I hate her, but why can't people leave other people alone?
Defense sustained. Case dismissed.
I'll give you 30 days probation to square yourself with Mr. Marks.
Here he is now.
- What happened, Mickey?
- Was it all right?
Oh, everything's swell.
I guess I showed you, twerp.
The judge bought out the whole front row.
Look at that.
Come on, kids, we got some rehearsing to do.
Isn't that marvelous?
It seems we stood
And talked like this before
We looked at each other
In the same way then
But I can't remember where or when
The clothes you're wearing
Are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling
You were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happen For the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where or when
Come on, put some life in that song, will you?
Patsy, will you hook my collar in the back for me, please?
So you're going to dinner with Rosalie tonight?
Don't go getting jealous.
We haven't got time for that.
- She made eyes at you.
- Oh, you're crazy.
I'm not. She's practicing to be a glamour girl, so she can get back into pictures.
If those two sing that song like that, the audience will think it's a lullaby.
It seems we've stood
And talked like this before
We looked at each other
In the same way then
But I can't remember where or when
That's right. With feeling like that.
I figure you have to know what you're singing about...
...before you can give the idea to others.
Don and Molly don't know what they're singing about?
They're just bashful in front of people, that's all.
Come on, let's go out and see if we can't needle them up a bit.
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
- But who knows where
- But who knows where
- Or when
- Or when
That's what the audience will be doing if you sing the song like that.
- We were just rehearsing.
- Yeah. Well, that's no excuse.
Molly's heard pop say a million times, do your best always if you wanna improve.
Wait until Dad's suit fits you before you try to talk like him.
The coat fits all right. I can button it up so nobody can see how loose the pants are.
I wanted my white pants, but wouldn't they be at the cleaners?
She'll be so busy talking about herself that she won't notice.
Maybe not, but lay off me.
You gotta get some feeling into this.
This show is all business.
- Get in there and try the number again.
- Do we have to do it in the canoe?
It's cramped in there, you can't move.
All right.
Then come on, do it over here...
...so long as you get some feeling into it.
Spread out.
Kids, get back to your places.
We're gonna try the number again.
- Bring that settee down here, please.
- I wish they would make up their minds.
Spread out.
Give them plenty of room to work.
Start the number back of the settee here and later on you can come around in front.
For goodness' sake, put some real feeling into it.
All right, Antonio.
Give them the introduction.
It seems we stood
And talked like this before
We looked at each other
In the same way then
But I can't remember where or when
The clothes you're wearing
Are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling
You were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happened
For the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where
Or when
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
- But who knows where
- But who knows where
- Or when
- Or when
Swell. Swell.
That's the way to sing. In a few minutes, go over the number again...
...so you'll be sure you got it perfect.
Tony, listen.
Go over that interlude again, that was terrible.
Well, I gotta go, kids.
Good night, everybody. Come on, Pat.
Send them all home at 9 and tell them to be here at 10 in the morning.
Okay. I hope you have a nice dinner.
Oh, this is all business, Pat.
You look wonderful, Mickey.
Thanks, for always saying the right thing.
I can lick wildcats now.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Whom do you wish to see?
Baby... Miss Essex.
- I'm afraid she'll be unable to see you, sir.
- Why not?
Miss Essex is expecting an important theatrical impresario.
Hey, that's me.
Oh, I don't believe I heard the name, sir.
I know you didn't, because I didn't say it.
It's Moran, Michael Z. Moran.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Won't you... Won't you step in, sir?
Thanks.
Oh, Michael.
I hardly expected you so soon.
So nice to see you again.
Yes, nice to see you too.
I know I kept you waiting.
No, you haven't kept me waiting.
I mean, that is...
...I have been waiting to see you ever since I met you in the drugstore.
You're just as impetuous as I thought you were.
I am?
Dinner is served, Miss Rosalie.
Thank you, Bartlett.
Oh, I almost forgot.
You haven't met my darling yet.
This is Kai.
- Cute, isn't he?
- This is Mr. Moran, Kai, baby.
You give him a nice wet kiss.
Oh, I hope he didn't frighten you.
No, no, no. No, he didn't at all.
He's an affectionate little fellow, isn't he?
Now, you run along and play, Kai, darling.
He has temperament, just like me, daddy says.
Gee, the crickets are pretty thick out tonight, aren't they?
I've never tasted a tastier...
Miss Essex.
Oh, don't call me that.
Call me Baby, everybody does.
Well, all right.
What do you do with yourself, Baby?
I study voice, French and dancing.
That's why I didn't go to Maine with father.
You see, I'm preparing for a comeback.
I don't see why I should accept failure.
Why I should let them tell me I'm through.
Do you?
Heck, no. That's why I think my production would be perfect for you.
Do you think so?
Oh, I was praying you'd say that.
Oh, Michael, don't tell me you're going to give me my chance.
Well, if I had the dough, I would.
How much do you need?
Well, let me...
Let me see.
We're gonna use a barn some actors used last summer, turn it into an outdoor theater.
I figured if we all pitched in together...
That is, for the scenery and the costumes and everything, it would run us about $287.
Have you got it yet?
No.
Well, you have now.
Move over here where we can talk.
- Oh, it will be exciting.
- Yeah, yeah.
I can hardly wait.
We'll work together wonderfully, you and I. How about an orchestra?
We can have the Rangerettes in for nothing.
Enchanting. It'll be a great show.
Shall we drink to that?
Why, you bet.
Good luck.
I hope so.
Cigar, sir?
Oh, do have one. They're daddy's best.
Well, I can't pass up anything like this.
I suggest, sir, it would draw better if one bites the end off.
How could I make a mistake like that?
Don't draw the cigar smoke in,
Mr. Moran.
Blow it out for your own sake.
This is... This is delightful.
When does the show start rehearsing?
Well, as soon as I can get it...
When?
Well, I'll phone you.
I'll phone you tomorrow and let you know.
You'll have to excuse me, please.
I've got another appointment.
Thanks for the dinner.
It was swell while it lasted.
- Hey, Mickey, here's your pants.
- Where have you been?
Go on, get up there in your place, would you?
All right, kids, that's enough.
Take a rest. We'll try the dance later on.
In the meantime, we'll take a reprise of this "Where or When" number.
Pass the parts out.
We'll take the other in a little bit.
- Hey, Mickey.
- What do you want?
Have you told Patsy yet?
No, I've tried to get it out a million times.
I just can't do it.
Well, she's on her way in and
Baby Rosalie will be here any minute now.
Well, I guess it's gotta be now.
- Come on, take over, will you, Don?
- Sure.
Oh, Mickey,
I've practiced until I'm nearly hoarse.
- Gosh, isn't it wonderful?
- Yes, it sure is, Pat.
But come over here, I...
I wanna talk to you for a minute.
What is it?
- We're in a tough spot, Pat.
- Yeah?
Yes, we've gotta have a lot of dough to put on this show.
Well, we need an angel, you know, and...
Can you take it?
Dish it out.
Well, we found an angel.
But in order to keep her, we have to give her the lead in the show.
Sing my songs?
The songs you wrote for me?
Say my lines?
Oh, Mickey...
We were gonna do it together.
This was gonna be our first show.
You and me in there pitching, just like you said.
Yes, I know, but what can we do?
I can't bear it.
Oh, don't cry, Pat, because if you do, then I'm just gonna call the whole thing off.
Because, I mean, this is too much for me.
Who's crying?
Don't be silly.
Pat, would you punch me right in the nose if I asked you to understudy?
Katherine Cornell did it.
I should be proud.
It's gonna be a tough job, kid...
...because this Baby Rosalie is just a bundle of temperament.
Will you help me keep her quiet, and will you stick in there and pitch?
Put her there.
Pat, you're...
You're the tops.
Hello, there.
Hello, everybody. Hello.
Alexander, do take the little darlings for a walk.
Thanks.
Just getting the kinks out.
All right. Come on, kids, let's try the Antony and Cleopatra sketch.
And I want the scene set just like we're gonna have it with props and everything.
A little pepper now.
Stand up, honey, so I can brush you off.
It's so close today.
Yes, it is sultry, isn't it?
- May I get you a glass of water?
- Thank you, my dear.
Isn't she a sweet little girl?
All right...
...bring the window up in position.
Over the divan, please. There, that's fine.
Okay, give me the parts now, will you?
There, that's fine Bobs.
Don, here's your part. Sid?
- Yeah.
- Miss Essex, please.
And I'd like Miss Essex's headdress now.
This is the gate here and the guard keepers right there.
Now, this Cleopatra's throne room.
A very luxurious layout overlooking the Nile.
This is a swell divan covered with satin cushions and ostrich feathers...
- ...jewels and pearls, things like that.
- Glorious.
Don, you entrance from over here and you see Baby reclining...
Will you recline, please, Miss Essex?
That's fine. Now, look.
This Mark Antony is a sort of a man about town.
Very... Very suave, see?
You, Baby, you're Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt.
Very beautiful, lovely and...
And suave, see?
You hardly know him.
He's busted up your army...
...so the only way you can keep your throne is to have him fall for you.
Listen, Don. You're a...
You're a Clark Gable-type.
Very modern, polished, and, well, full of suaveness. You see what I mean?
- Yeah, you mean we're suave.
- Yeah, that...
Come on, now.
Let's try it once everybody.
From the beginning now, from the curtain.
Ready? Curtain.
- Greetings, Mark. What's new?
- Your Majesty.
No, no, no, that's not quite it, Miss Essex.
Look, do you mind if I show you?
Stand over there. Now, watch me.
You're down here.
You're reclining here. You watching?
Now, I want you to get up and I want you to slink.
Slink, a regal slink.
Sort of bouncing-like, see what I mean?
All right, go ahead, Don.
Your Majesty.
- What's your name?
- Just call me Baby, everybody does.
Just call me Baby, everybody...
No, what I meant was, what was your line?
The only man in the world who I would go to meet.
You're the only man in the world
I'd go to meet.
See? More... More...
- Suave?
- Yes.
Well, go on. Now, let's try it again.
Come on, right from where we left off.
Here we go.
You're up there, Baby. That's it, fine.
Your Majesty.
I have a feeling
I'm going to find Egypt fascinating.
Terrible. Terrible. Don, terrible.
- I didn't think so.
- It's the way you read the lines.
There's no feeling to it or anything.
Maybe we'd better try it here on the couch.
Don, come and sit beside her.
I want a more virile approach, like Clark Gable would do it.
Come on, do it once for me, will you?
Your Majesty, I have a feeling
I'm going to find Egypt fascinating.
No, no, that's still not it, Don.
Let me show you, will you?
Just stand up there for a minute. Look.
Now, see here, Cleo.
You've stalled me for the last time.
You can't push Mark Antony around like that and get away with it.
Last month, I took over the south side.
Now, I'm taking over the palace.
And what's more, I'm taking over you, see?
Get your things packed.
We're taking a honeymoon on the Nile.
I've got a barge waiting with the motor running.
Now, you see?
That's more the way Gable would do it.
- Well, Gable and I work differently.
- Yeah, that's why he works more often.
Okay, Sid, it's your cue.
Don, you're over here now.
Cleopatra, who is this man?
- Who's this?
- Well, that's your uncle, Croesus.
But Cleopatra didn't have an uncle.
Well, she has now.
- Shall I keep going while I'm hot?
- You're as cold as an ice cube.
Look, I want this uncle to be a violent character.
Like Lionel Barrymore would play it.
I mean, when he comes into this room...
...and finds his niece here with a strange man, he's...
He's gotta be...
- Suave?
- No, furious.
Look, Sid, let me show you what I mean, huh?
Now, this is the way Barrymore would do it.
Now, watch, Sid.
Now, see here, Cleo.
This isn't by chance one of your latest admirers, is it?
Why, uncle, I don't know what you mean.
Don't try to act innocent, my child.
The whole town's talking.
Now, see here, sonny, we don't like strangers hanging around this place.
I'll give you just 48 hours to get out.
Pardon me, Don.
When I go, Cleo goes with me.
I love her, you see?
Out of the way, uncle. We're leaving.
Now, look here, Cleo. I'm your uncle.
I love you as if you were my own niece.
But this man is marrying you just for your money.
She's going with me, understand?
Do you love me because I'm worth $50 million?
Nonsense. I'd love you if you only had $40 million.
Money isn't everything.
And I love you.
Yes, that's fine, Miss Essex.
That's just right.
Here, Don, you take over from there.
Come on, Clark Antony, finish the scene.
Well, if you insist.
- Is this the sleeper bus for Schenectady?
- Yes, sir.
Have you seen a little girl about?
Oh, never mind.
Oh, Pat. Patty.
Look, let me talk to you.
- Will you listen to me, please?
- No, I won't.
Wait a minute, that's acting like a big baby.
I'm not a baby, Mr. Moran.
- Then why are you going to Schenectady?
- I wanna see my mother.
- Why?
- None of your business.
Wait a minute, Pat.
Listen, I'm doing the best I can.
Oh, you're doing grand for Baby Rosalie.
- Whatever I've done, I've had to do.
- Did you have to kiss Baby Rosalie today?
Well, that's my business, honey.
I'm a director.
Then you'd better get to work,
Mr. Ziegfeld.
The Girl Scouts are just clamoring for you.
- Oh, you don't have to talk...
- Here. I suppose you want this too.
Indian giver.
Listen, how can I be an Indian giver...?
Oh, Pat, listen.
Won't you let me explain?
Hey! Hey, Patsy!
Give me a chance to explain, will you?
Will you let me...?
I cried for you
Now, it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
But I'll find two eyes
Just a little bit bluer
I'll find a heart
Just a little bit truer
I cried for you
Now, it's your turn to cry
Over me
I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby...
Like her.
But maybe someday, you'll realize that glamour isn't the only thing in this world.
If your show's a flop, you'll find you can't eat glamour for breakfast.
Anyway,
I might be pretty good-looking myself...
...when I grow out of this ugly duckling stage.
And you're no Clark Gable yourself.
But that's all right.
You go your way and I'll go mine.
Don't worry about me. I'll recover.
Time is a great healer.
But in the future, if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball...
...and I'm dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps...
...and surrounded by lords and dukes and princes...
...you'll probably be sorry.
And you'll probably realize that life is...
...just an idiot's delight.
And as I speed through the dark night into the abyss of oblivion...
...I can only say thanks.
Thanks for the memory.
I'll find two eyes
Just a little bit bluer
I'll find a heart
Just a little bit truer
I cried for you
Now, it's your turn to cry
Over me
- George, everybody in?
- All but Eddie.
- He'll be here shortly.
- Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes.
- You're on seconds, folks.
- Okay.
- Who opens the show tonight?
- You fellows do.
We do? What's the idea...?
Hey, Joe, why do we open the bill?
Listen, we've gotta take turns in opening the show.
- We're all headliners.
- But we got a terrific finish.
- You want to see anyone?
- Yes, I wanna see my mother, Mrs. Barton.
- Okay. Dressing Room Number 4.
- Thank you.
We'll try it that way tonight and we'll see how it works.
- For the love of Mike, Patsy.
- Hello, Mr. Moran.
- What are you doing here?
- I got kind of lonesome for my mother.
Things got so tough you had to come up here, huh?
- Oh, no. Everything's just fine.
- Lillian, Lillian, I got a surprise for you.
- Look what I found in the hall.
- Why, Patsy.
Why, did the house burn down or something?
Can't a girl come to see her mother without everybody thinking she's crazy?
Hello, Mrs. Moran.
- Hi, Patsy.
- When did you get in here?
Patsy, tell me, what's Mickey doing?
What's Mickey doing?
He's got a lot of kids together and he's gonna put on a show, a wonderful show.
- He's doing what?
- Dear, don't get excited.
- He didn't say anything in his postcard.
- Is Junior in it?
- How's Dody?
- How Frankie's dance?
- It's grand.
- What's this baloney about a show?
It's the truth.
He wrote it, and now he's gonna produce it.
And he's got the Rangerettes and Baby Rosalie and... oh, he's got a lot of kids.
No kidding. It's gonna be swell.
Why did Mickey do this?
Miss Steele said that we weren't having the proper care...
...and she threatened to send us to the state work school.
- What state work school?
- An institution?
How do you like that?
Our kids in a work school.
Listen, folks, let's give up this silly tour and go home.
- I'm going home.
- Right.
George, we can't do that just because the going is tough.
- I know business will pick up next week.
- You told us that last week...
I'm gonna put you all out of here...
- ...because I wanna talk to Patsy.
- Right you are. Everybody get out of here.
Mickey's show sounds elegant.
Where did he get the money?
- I don't know.
- Isn't Baby Rosalie the movie baby?
- She's the star of the show.
- Wonderful.
Now, dear, tell me, why aren't you in it?
Oh, I thought I wanted a theatrical career, but I changed my mind.
Why?
Too many heartaches.
- Now, what do you know about heartaches?
- Well...
You and Mickey quarrel?
You did, didn't you?
And you quit the show and came up here to see me?
You shouldn't have done that, Patsy.
Well, he took all my songs and gave them to her.
Doesn't matter.
- Why not?
- Mickey was doing it for everybody.
Patsy, your daddy was a minstrel man.
So was his daddy.
They did plenty of crazy things, but they never walked out on a show.
But, Mother, Mickey and I were...
And she kept putting her arms around him and I just couldn't...
Sid, girls, what are you standing around for? Hurry up, get ready.
Aren't you finished with that?
I may be a sap about the men I pick, but I'm no quitter.
So there. My family are all troupers and we don't walk out on any show.
Who said anything about walking out on any...?
Oh, women.
See who it is, Millicent.
- Is Miss Essex dressed?
- Come in, Michael.
Oh, how's our little star? Fine, I hope.
- A little nervous. Sit down.
- Thanks.
- How's our director?
- I'm a little nervous too, and then some.
That's a sign of a good trouper.
Then I must be great. Gee, I wished I hadn't plastered my name all over everything.
- You'll get used to it. Look at me.
- Well, maybe.
Get out of my way or I'll put you in jail where you belong, the lot of you.
My father!
Well, there you are, young lady.
- Where's this Michael Z. Moran?
- I'm him.
So you're the smart twerp that was going to exploit the prestige of an important name.
- Why, for a nickel...
- Wait a minute...
Wait nothing. Here, young lady, get into this coat. We're getting out of here.
- But she's the star of the show.
- Don't make me laugh.
I'm grooming her for a comeback.
Millicent, you pack up. Come on.
- But, father, I've got a great part.
- Listen, you can't take her away.
- Take her. She's a pain in the neck.
- Come on.
- Listen. Will you listen?
- Father, dear...
- She's got money in the show.
- Kiss that goodbye.
I'll tell you when you have a great part just as I always did.
- What are you gonna do?
- What about the audience?
- Are we gonna give a show?
- What's gonna happen?
Quiet, will you?
I don't know what I'm gonna do?
Give me a chance to think.
Come on with me, Patsy.
Everybody out but Patsy.
The show is going on.
The curtain goes up in seven minutes.
Now, snap into it, will you, kids?
Get your makeup on.
I wrote this show for you, see?
Get out there and show them
I wasn't crazy when I did it.
Don't think things have changed between you and me. Go out and sell it.
- Oh, Mickey, you're...
- Never mind.
I know what I am, an Indian giver.
What's the delay, Mickey?
I didn't know you could have so much trouble.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you make a speech...?
Mickey, here's your makeup.
You'd better hurry.
Tell them that Patsy's going on instead.
- What's happened?
- Tell you later.
Would you do that for me, please?
- All right, Mickey.
- Thanks.
My daddy was a minstrel man
When minstrels were the thing
When Mr. Bones and Mr. Jones
Danced the buck and wing
When Eddie Leonard was so great
And Primrose was the king
Gee, I'd like to be a minstrel man
I'd like to black my face
Put on a stovepipe hat
Get out an old banjo
And go once again down memory lane
With an old-fashioned minstrel show
Going to run all night
Going to run all day
I'll bet my money on the bobtail nag
Somebody bet on the bay
Here they come.
Hurry, we go on in a minute.
I'm hurrying.
Come from Alabammy Come from Alabammy
Come from Alabammy Come from Alabammy
Come from Alabammy With my banjo on my knee
I come from Alabammy
With my banjo on my knee
I'm going to Louisiana
For my true love to see
Now, it rained all night the day I left
The weather, it was so dry
The sun so hot I froze to death
Susanna, don't you cry
Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me
I've come from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me
I come from Alabammy
With my banjo on my knee
Gentlemen, be seated
Mr. Bones, Mr. Bones
I've a question to ask
- There is something that I want to know
- Well, tell me, sonny
Mr. Bones, will you tell me
And answer me right
Who's that lady You were with last night?
Now, Mr. Interlocutory
You are a curious man
But I will tell you if you want to know
Now, so help me, Moses And upon my life
That was no lady, that was my wife
Hallelujah upon his life
That was no lady, it was his wife
Mr. Tambo
I've a question to ask you tonight
And with all your fancy knowledge
You should know
Mr. Tambo, will you tell us
And give us a treat
Tell us why does a chicken Cross the street
I has studied up my geography
Studied up my history
Studied up my poultry with pride
And I am here to repeat
A chicken crosses the street
Just to get on the other side
Mr. Rooster, don't you hide
The chicken crossed the street
To reach the other side
There's a grand old minstrel man
Whose name we hold so dear
I know that you'll remember him
The moment that you hear
Ida, sweet as apple cider
Oh, sweeter than all I know
Know, know, know, know, know, know
Come out, oh, won't you come out
In the silvery moonlight
Of love we'll whisper so soft and low
We were sailing along
- We were sailing along
- On Moonlight Bay
Down the silvery bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say
- You have stolen my heart
- A maiden's heart
- Now, don't go away
- Don't you ever go away
As we sang love's old sweet song
On Moonlight Bay
I am here to state I am here to relate
To explain and make it plain
That I'm just wild about Harry
And Harry's wild about me
The heavenly blisses of his kisses
Fills me with ecstasy
He's sweet just like chocolate candy
Or like the honey from a bee
Oh, I'm just wild about Harry
And he's just wild about...
Cannot do without
He's just wild about me
I'm just wild about Mandy
And Mandy's wild about me
I'm just wild about Harry
And Harry's wild about me
The heavenly blisses of his kisses
Fill me with ecstasy
He's sweet just like chocolate candy
And just like honey from the bees
Wait a minute, folks!
Don't go. Please stay.
Don't leave. It's only a little shower.
Well, you'll have to admit, it took a hurricane to stop me.
Mickey, that was a fine effort.
Where's Dad?
Mom, where's Dad?
You have to keep pounding on the piano?
Nobody can hear himself think.
- Nobody can think in this house anyways.
- You're so smart...!
Children, please.
Gee, I'm sorry, Mom.
Don't worry, he'll be home.
He'll be home? Say, what is this?
You two trying to keep something from me?
Something happen that I don't know about?
Where's pop?
Mickey, don't shout.
I'm nervous, that's all.
- I wish your father was home.
- He didn't come home.
He didn't get up and go out before I did.
- Where is he? What...?
- Mickey, quit picking on Mama.
If you must know, well, we're afraid Dad's been drinking.
- Dad?
- No, no, it isn't that.
- I'm quite sure he's looking for work.
- What? For the act?
- No, he's through with show business.
- Through?
That's all he knows.
That's all he's good for.
He's trying to find something steady.
Something we can depend on.
Maybe you could sell Mr. Randall a couple of your songs to tide us over.
- I was over there this morning.
- Well?
They got enough songs on the shelf to drive the country crazy.
I'll still keep on trying.
Maybe Dad is right. Maybe he is through.
But I'm not.
Show business owes us something and I'm gonna collect.
Is that so?
We're through. All of us.
Starting over.
And if ever I hear show business, song writing...
...or that word vaudeville mentioned here,
I'll kick the tar out of you.
You didn't raise me on that kind of talk.
I'll take that rap.
I didn't know any better. I do now.
Come on, take it easy. Take it easy.
The theater is full of promises, great promises...
...so long as you hand over your heart and soul.
Then something new comes along, you're tossed in the ditch.
The procession goes on.
Well, I got a job. I start tomorrow.
Doing what?
- Running an elevator.
- Listen...
- At least we'll eat.
- Yeah, that counts me out.
- What do you mean?
- I'm getting out on my own.
- No, you're not.
- No? You just try and stop me.
- Mickey.
- Well?
- Mr. Moran.
- Yes?
I've brought the papers.
Papers? What papers?
After you've signed them, return them to Judge Black's office.
Have the children there at 9:00 on Friday morning.
Hey, what...? What is this?
- Haven't you told them yet?
- I'll take care of this, thank you.
I'm sorry.
Dad...
Dad, you've... You've turned against us.
- You, you...
- It'll only be for the time being.
You'll get education there.
I can't do it no other way and
I won't let you be a tramp in the streets.
Listen, son, you gotta be something.
You'll thank me someday, I know you will.
Quit talking like that.
It makes me sick to hear you.
Go on, sign the papers!
- But that Steele, she'll never get me!
- Shut up.
All right, Dad.
Here comes Mickey now.
- Wait a minute.
- What's happened?
- What's the matter?
- Something the matter?
- What's up?
- Anything wrong?
They're gonna sign us to the state work school.
- They are?
- Oh, no.
- Did you near that?
- Hey, Mickey, here's a letter for you.
The mailman just brought it.
It's from Harry Maddox.
- Say, that's the big producer.
- Read it, Mickey.
- Yeah, go on.
- See what it says.
You read it, Don.
"Dear Mickey. Your friend, Judge Black, talked me into coming to see your show.
It was the only time I came near being drowned and liking it.
Drop in and discuss your production with me.
Sincerely yours, Harry Maddox."
Say, anybody got a dime that I can get to New York with?
- Here, I got two bits.
- Oh, what a pal.
- Come on, let's go to the station with him.
- All right.
Look what it says in the paper about the show. "Babes In Arms..."
Come on, get back on the stage.
We got a lot of rehearsing to do. Come on.
Hello. Yes, this is the Harry Maddox
Theatrical Productions.
Yes, ma'am. Yes, we're casting children for the new show.
You're welcome.
Stage mother. Why doesn't Mr. Maddox produce Ibsen instead of kid shows?
You got me.
Sorry, Mr. Maddox is busy.
You'll have to wait.
Hello. Yes, Mr. Maddox.
No, he hasn't come in yet. Yes, sir.
- I beg your pardon.
- Only casting children today.
I'm Joe Moran. Mr. Maddox sent for me.
Mr. Moran. Oh, yes, he's expecting you.
Please come right this way.
Hello, Joe.
By golly, it's good to see you.
Thanks, Mr. Maddox.
Cut it out. Where did you get that
Mr. Maddox stuff?
- Well, you're a big shot now, Harry.
- Apple sauce.
You know show business, up today and down tomorrow and back up again.
Sit down, sit down, I wanna talk to you.
Say, Joe, do you know it's taken me a month to find you?
Well, Florrie and me have got a place down near the job.
- You know, the kids went out on their own.
- Yeah.
Yes, I know. They'll...
They'll do that, kids will.
What I wanted to see you about was this.
- I'm in a spot where you can help me out.
- Oh, no show business.
The world has been changing so rapidly in the last few years, it's kept us all dizzy.
The public...
The public is like the Frenchman's flea...
...you put your finger on them and boom, they aren't there.
They're always hungry for something new.
I'm not interested in the public.
Didn't talk like that the night Mickey was born, back in the Palace Theater.
When everybody in the audience got to be your brother and your sister.
Gee, they were great that night.
Remember?
- Yeah, they were.
- A lot of that's come back, Joe.
Old-fashioned sentiment's not taboo anymore.
And, Joe, a song-and-dance man as great as you are...
...is just as much of a miracle as he ever was.
Leave me alone, Harry.
I want no part of it.
I stood on Broadway corners and watched the business I grew up in...
...that I was good in.
I watched it pass me by like I had no place in it.
Never turned around to see if your feelings were hurt.
Kids had nothing.
Home gone.
I got up out of the rosin as often as I could.
I'm tired.
- I'll stay where I am.
- You...
Kidding yourself that you can live without doing what you were put here for.
You mean to say that you think you can keep away from show business? No.
Joe, I'm offering you a job.
A job where you'll see the people crowding, sure they're gonna have a good time.
You get to the theater, you meet your pals...
...you get your makeup on.
You hear the orchestra tuning up.
The stage manager calls, "First act places, please. Curtain's going up."
Then the curtain goes up.
Oh, boy, what a thrill.
No, Joe. You and I, we can't ever live without it.
We know too much about it.
What's your proposition, Harry?
Well, I've got a show.
A new show. A bunch of kids, see?
As fresh and sparkling as anything that ever hit Broadway.
But, well, they don't know as much about song and dance as they think they do...
...so I want you to teach them.
Show them how.
Yeah?
What do you say?
- All right, Harry.
- I knew you would.
You run home and tell Florrie all about it. And listen...
...you and she are having dinner with me tonight, just like old times.
Joe, by the way, there's somebody in the show that you know.
Who?
- Mickey.
- Mickey.
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Just keep cool. The kid is swell.
No fooling, he's immense, but he needs you, Joe.
He needs you more than anything in the world.
All right, call your rehearsal.
I'll make a trouper out of him.
A real trouper.
Give my love to Florrie.
Gee, I didn't think you were gonna be able to make it.
What a man. Thanks, Mr. Maddox.
You see, Mickey, I've loved your father much longer than you have.
I'm gonna make good for him too.
- You'll make good for a lot of people.
- Who?
For the kids who never had a chance.
For the kids a lot of wiseacres are telling...
...there is no such thing as an American dream.
Well, those kids have got their eyes on you.
Because you're being given your chance...
...and by the bones of Bacchus, you'd better make good.
Gee, it's bigger than just a show.
Say, it's everybody in the country.
Look at that kid, will you?

I beg your pardon.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Hardwick.
- Has Mr. Jerry Travers come in yet?
- Yes, sir.
He's been waiting for you the entire evening, sir.
The entire evening? Oh, dear.
Thanks.
Begging your pardon, sir.
But is that the Mr. Travers, the well-known American gentleman, sir?
It is indeed.
He's come over to star in my show.
It's his first London appearance.
Your show, Mr. Hardwick?
I'm producing it.
But I don't want any of the members here to know.
I want to surprise them.
I'm sure they'll be surprised,
Mr. Hardwick.
Hello, Jerry. I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
Jerry, there are a lot of things that I have to discuss.
So I want you to come over to my hotel now.
What happened?
Jerry, I forgot to tell you.
I want you to stay here for the night.
I'm sorry, I can't do it.
But you must, old man, really.
You see, at the moment, I'm having a sort of a problem with my valet.
What do you want me to do, press your pants?
No. You wouldn't know how.
No, you don't understand.
It's my man, Bates.
- We've had a bit of a tiff.
- How terrible.
- You didn't come to blows or anything?
- Nothing like that.
We're not speaking to each other.
We've had rather a clash of taste.
You see, Bates insists that a square tie... is the only possible tie that can be worn with evening clothes.
A square tie, imagine.
I prefer the butterfly.
- I think Bates is right.
- Bates is never right.
- Well, then why don't you fire him?
- That's a little difficult.
I'm hoping against hope that the man will just disappear.
I hate to interfere in these little family squabbles.
But let's hope he'll approve of me.
There's never any telling with Bates.
There you are.
If you please.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Allow us to introduce ourselves, sir.
We are Bates, sir.
Really?
- We are Jerry Travers.
- Welcome to our menage.
Thank you, Bates.
It seems that I'm to stay here tonight.
At least that was the idea of our beloved impresario.
Whose idea?
Mr. Hardwick's.
His idea.
Welcome anyhow.
Thank you, Bates.
Pardon, sir, but may we make a personal observation?
- Not too personal.
- No, sir.
It's merely that we feel impelled to compliment you, sir... upon your excellent taste in ties.
- They like me.
- You never know.
Where on earth did you ever find him?
From the Salvation Army, as a matter of fact.
I sent them a pair of very old shoes.
I see. And the shoes came back and Bates was in them.
And he's been wearing my good ones ever since.
- How's Madge feeling?
- She's fine. Thanks, Jerry.
The climate at the Lido has done her a lot of good.
That's fine. Too bad she won't be here for the opening tomorrow night.
Isn't it? She's heartbroken, really.
However, she's expecting us to fly down to Italy for a weekend.
Fly down to Italy for a weekend?
I can't. I haven't got any goggles.
My word, Jerry, you'll have to go.
She's counting on us.
She's going to have a young friend visit her.
I suspect there's something in the air.
You know Madge and her matchmaking proclivities.
Is she expecting me for a weekend or a wedding?
You can't tell. You know how wives are.
No, I don't. How are they?
Wives? They always have a little scheme.
Look here, I think it's about time you found out for yourself.
- You do?
- I certainly do.
No, thanks, Horace.
In me you see a youth who's completely on the loose.
No yens, no yearning.
Hello. This is Miss Tremont.
I'd like to speak to the manager immediately.
Hello. Are you there?
Who? The manager. Yes.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
There's a young lady downstairs.
A young lady. At this time of night?
She can't come up here now.
No, I'd better come down myself.
Jerry, go right ahead.
A young lady downstairs evidently wants to see me.
Hello.
Won't you come in?
I'm awfully glad you dropped in.
I dropped up from the room below, where I've been trying to get some sleep.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was disturbing you.
You see, every once in a while,
I suddenly find myself... dancing.
I suppose it's some kind of an affliction?
Yes, it's an affliction.
St. Vitus' dance.
And it only occurs at this time of night?
Yes, that's it.
It only occurs at this time of night.
As a matter of fact,
I really shouldn't be left alone.
Yes, I can see that.
You probably should have a couple of guards.
I think you're very unkind to make fun of me.
I'm sorry.
- I wish you wouldn't leave.
- Why not?
I think I feel an attack coming on.
See, there it is.
So I see.
There's only one thing that'll stop me.
You must tell me what it is.
My nurses always put their arms around me.
I'll call the house detective and tell him to put his arms around you.
Good night.
What are you doing here?
What are you carrying that for?
- Who was the young lady?
- What young lady?
That call wasn't for me. It was for you.
Somebody has registered a complaint.
I know. I've just seen the complaint.
She's lovely, she's delightful, she's charming, and she wants to sleep.
She does?
And I'm going to help her, and you're going to help me. Take this.
No, bring it in here and guard it with your life.
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.
Look here, what's the idea?
The young lady downstairs wants to sleep.
So you told me.
I've appointed myself her official sandman.
But, Jerry...
What else have you got?
I'm sorry, sir, but you've cleaned out the shop.
You better tell them to plant some more for tomorrow.
They are all to go to Miss Dale Tremont, sir?
That's right.
Her room number is 304.
What's that?
That's for the opening of a butcher shop, sir.
- Send that up, too.
- But, sir, a horseshoe?
Why, yes, I may want to order a peach orchard tomorrow.
What's the number of your room, sir?
Just charge it to Horace Hardwick, room 404.
Yes, sir.
I wonder what Mr. Beddini is going to say about this.
What can he say?
He's been sending her flowers daily ever since they came here.
And entre nous... the desk clerk has intimated... that Mr. Beddini provides Miss Tremont with all the niceties... including her clothes.
Really?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- I do hope you slept well last night.
- I slept well enough, but not long enough.
I'm sorry. I was hoping... there was something I could do to square myself.
That's quite all right.
I thought perhaps I could drive you to the stables.
No, thank you. I have a hansom cab waiting for me outside.
With a horse in front of it?
Yes. You see, the stable people always use them.
They feel the horse is coming back.
Where's he been?
We're leaving tonight.
Has Mr. Beddini made arrangements?
Yes, Miss Tremont.
He's ordered your baggage to be picked up at 7:00.
Thank you.
- Driver.
- Yes, miss?
Can't you go any faster than this?
Lord love a duck, miss. I can, but I'm not allowed to leave the horse.
I meant the horse, of course.
It's like this, miss.
You see, the horse is kind of tired today... on account of having won the Grand National on Friday.
Are you trying to tell me that this is a racehorse?
Yes, miss, and I've got his pedigree, too.
As a matter of fact, his sire was Man O'War.
Who was his dam?
- I beg your pardon, miss?
- I said, who was his dam?
I don't know, miss. He didn't give a...
Peekaboo.
Stop this cab at once.
I don't know how.
I've never handled anything more complicated than a Duesenberg.
Take it easy, Mavis.
What are we going to do?
In dealing with a girl or horse, one just lets nature take its course.
There we are, miss.
I told you the horse would bring you to the right place.
What is this strange power you have over horses?
Horsepower.
Don't I even get any thanks?
Buy yourself a new hat.
Cab, miss?
May I rescue you?
No, thank you, I prefer being in distress.
Charming little spot you have here.
When does the concert start?
Just as soon as you and the rain stop.
Now, please.
You wouldn't like to be just a little bit more friendly, would you?
Why should I?
I don't know you from Adam.
Maybe it's the way I'm dressed.
Are you afraid of thunder?
No, it's just the noise.
You know what thunder is, don't you?
Of course.
It's something about the air.
No, when a clumsy cloud from here meets a fluffy little cloud from there... he billows towards her... she scurries away and he scuds right up to her.
She cries a little... and there you have your shower.
He comforts her.
They spark.
That's the lightning.
They kiss.
Thunder.
Who is sending you this horse's shoe?
How cute.
Alberto, I've seen him.
I've talked to him. I've danced with him.
- Him? Who is this him?
- Who?
His name is Adam.
You forget this Adam.
You have promised to go with me to Italy.
Your friend Madge Hardwick is awaiting you.
There, you will dazzle the eyes in clothes designed by Alberto Beddini.
Alberto, I hope you don't mind, but I'm not going to the Lido.
Madre mia. What you say?
My dear, listen to me.
We have made agreement.
Beddini designs the clothes... which you wear among your friends, the smart people.
So that they ask:
"Who is so smart as to make these smart clothes?"
And you say,
"Who? Who is so smart? Beddini. "
Forget this Adam. Beddini demands it.
Beddini does, does he?
Alberto, up to the present, our relationship has been purely a business one.
But if you start interfering in my personal affairs...
I'll go back to America and live on the dole.
Now, Dale darling, I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to interfere.
Go ahead, fall in love with this Adam.
Marry him.
But, as Mrs. Adam, what would you wear?
Fig leaves.
Thank you, sir.
Dale, a telegram for you.
Read it to me, please.
"Come ahead, stop.
"Stop being a sap, stop.
"You can even bring Alberto, stop.
"My husband is stopping at your hotel, stop.
"When do you start, stop. "
I cannot understand. Who wrote this?
Sounds like Gertrude Stein.
No, it's from Madge Hardwick.
She says her husband is stopping at this hotel and will look you up.
Wonder what kind of man Madge married.
He's sure to have influence.
Let's be nice to him.
I'm going to be too busy being nice to somebody else.
Dale, you can't do this.
All my life I have promised my dresses to take them to Italy... and you must be in them.
Sorry, Alberto, but I'm unpacking.
Never again will I allow women to wear my dresses.
- Good evening, Miss Tremont.
- Good evening.
Mr. Beddini and I have decided to stay.
I'm so glad. Then I'll cancel the order about the bags.
Thank you. Is there a Mr. Hardwick stopping at this hotel?
Why, yes, Miss Tremont.
Mr. Hardwick has room 404.
Just above you.
- Are you sure?
- Definitely, miss.
As a matter of fact, there's Mr. Hardwick now... on the mezzanine.
The gentleman with the briefcase and cane.
- Horace, here's a telegram for you.
- For me?
- It's from Italy.
- Italy? That's probably from Madge.
There's a message in your room to call the box office.
Some trouble about the tickets or something.
Trouble? With the tickets?
My word, Jerry. Why, they wouldn't dare.
Will you hold those things for me please?
Get a taxi and I'll meet you downstairs.
All right.
Cab, miss?
When a clumsy cloud meets a fluffy little cloud.
We're only trying to investigate matters, miss.
We must protect our guests.
She does not need your protection.
I am too much protection enough.
There's nothing to investigate.
Nothing matters, nothing's happened.
Will you please ask these gentlemen to go?
You mean to tell me that girl slapped your face... in front of all those people for nothing?
What would you have done, sold tickets?
I mean, you did nothing, and yet she slapped your face?
- Now you're getting it.
- I wish you'd be serious about this.
One breath of scandal at this time will ruin our show.
Why, I'd rather have had it happen to me than to you.
- If you enjoy that sort of thing.
- I do, immensely.
Don't be absurd.
I hate men. I hate you. I hate all men!
But cara mia, you make a big mistake.
I am no man.
I am Beddini.
How could he have made love to me when he was married all the time?
And to Madge of all people.
So, this snake in the grass, this Adam... already he has eaten the apple?
Yes.
I will kill him for you.
Have you finished packing?
But you do not understand.
Are we leaving or aren't we?
No, you cannot go back to America.
We must go to the Lido.
But I can't face his wife.
And why not?
Women are facing wives every day.
And, after all, you can't avoid seeing
Madge sometime, can you?
I guess not.
Very well then.
Why not face the musicians now?
All right. Maybe she ought to know.
You're sure you didn't forget yourself in the park?
Positive.
If I ever forgot myself with that girl,
I'd remember it.
- We're the management.
- Are you?
Oh, dear. Some more of these plural personalities.
Just a moment.
Jerry, get into my bedroom, quick.
No one must know you're here.
If they ever suspect that you're in this, it'll be in every newspaper in an hour.
Well, gentlemen, this is a pleasant surprise.
A small matter of great import has come to our attention, sir.
I am up here in your interest and to protect the hotel.
- We wish to avoid any scandal.
- Scandal?
Yes, in connection with a certain slap in the face.
The young lady refuses to divulge why she slapped you.
Well, she didn't slap my face.
Who did she slap?
Why, it was... Who?
It was he, my valet.
Me, sir?
Why, of course. Don't argue with me.
How did it happen?
Possibly we had been a little imprudent, sir.
Of course. You see, we had been a little imprudent.
But you said it wasn't you.
Not Mr. Hardwick.
Gentlemen, we take all the blame myself.
And there we are. There you are.
You see, it was just a mistake.
I'll take him to task personally.
- Thank you, sir.
- Not at all.
- Good night.
- Not at all.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Bates, thank you.
You know, really, you are an invaluable assistant.
Thank you, sir. Allow us, sir.
Thank you, Bates.
- Your coat, sir.
- Really?
This is like old times, isn't it?
Your helping me with my coat, I mean.
It's a pleasure we have missed, sir.
- Thank you, Bates.
- Thank you, sir.
How is our lumbago this evening, sir?
- It's so much better, Bates, thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Bates.
- Yes, sir?
There's a crisis afoot.
Couldn't we bury the hatchet?
I mean, couldn't we forget all about the ties?
Sic transit gloria mundi, sir.
- Bates.
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Travers is in trouble.
He's practically put his foot right into a hornet's nest.
But, hornets' nests grow on trees, sir.
Never mind that.
We have got to do something.
What about rubbing it with butter, sir?
You blasted fool, you can't rub a girl with butter!
My sister got into a hornets' nest and we rubbed her with butter, sir.
That's the wrong treatment.
You should have used mud.
Never mind that!
Mr. Travers is in trouble.
It is liable to develop into a scandal that will involve all of us.
There's a young lady in the room below us.
I've seen her, sir.
I want you to find out all you can about her.
Follow her wherever she goes.
Never take your eyes off her.
- Never, sir?
- Never.
- Whither she goes...
- Thither I, sir.
Right you are, sir. Whither or thither.
- What happened?
- It's all right. I fixed it.
But things are getting involved.
This is a deep-laid plot.
Nonsense. Why should this girl want to involve me?
Why, for money, of course. Publicity.
Anything to create a scandal.
I'm going to see her and buy her off.
You're not. If anyone's going to buy her anything, I am going to do it.
No, you stay right here.
I'll clear this all up myself.
It's probably some little thing you did... carried away for the moment, that offended her sense of decorum.
If I did, I'm going right down and do it again. Goodbye, old boy.
Come along, cara mia.
- Get me a taxi, quickly.
- Taxi.
Follow that cab.
Come in.
Where's the young lady that has this room?
She's gone, sir.
- Gone?
- Yes, sir.
You don't mind if I get on with me work?
I gotta get these flowers out in the morning's rubbish.
That's all right, go ahead. Go right ahead.
Jerry, do you realize that we have less than an hour before the show opens?
We've got to get out of here. Come on.
Women do strange things sometimes, don't they, George?
Yes, sir.
- That first act was simply marvelous.
- Good.
Everybody's crazy about it.
The critics are raving.
I've got some more good news.
- Did you find out were she's gone?
- She? Oh, that girl.
No, but, Jerry, please.
The entire Thackeray Club is out in front.
You don't suppose my dancing has disturbed them?
I don't think so. They didn't say.
Of course not. It's perfectly all right here.
Second act begins, Mr. Travers.
Thanks. I'll be there.
Really, the second act.
A lot of telegrams for you.
I'll be right back as soon as the act is over.
My word, I never read my own telegram from Madge.
Isn't it too bad she isn't here tonight?
The biggest night of my life and she isn't here.
- What does she say?
- All kinds of good wishes for our success.
Sorry we can't fly down to Italy after the performance to meet her friend.
Her little friend is in London, staying at my hotel.
Her name is Tremont.
Tremont? Wait a minute. Let me see that.
Horace, hire a plane right away.
We're leaving for Italy in the morning.
One minute, Mr. Travers.
You can't do that. The seats were sold out for months in advance.
How long does it take to fly there?
Seven hours. You have to be back
Monday for a performance.
Charter a plane for the weekend, we'll be back in time.
You're on, Mr. Travers.
I will not jeopardize my position.
If you want this show to run two nights, get me a plane now.
- What kind of a plane?
- One with wings.
I'll go look for Madge and see you later for cocktails.
- Dale, when did you get down?
- Just now.
Good. Have something to drink.
Horse's neck.
- It's grand seeing you.
- And it's grand seeing you.
Now tell me, did my husband look you up?
- Yes.
- How did he impress you?
I think he is very fascinating.
Fascinating?
You know, every once in a while, the effect
Horace has on people surprises me.
He sort of surprised me, too.
I'm glad you liked him.
He will be here today.
No. He can't...
What's the matter? Did he flirt with you?
He sent me a room full of flowers.
That was sweet of him.
But, Madge, you don't understand, he...
- He chased me in the park.
- Really?
I didn't know
Horace was capable of that much activity.
Did he catch you?
- Yes.
- Good for Horace.
Why, Madge, you shock me.
Horace flirts with every attractive girl he meets.
He doesn't mean anything.
That's a funny way to take it.
My dear, when you are as old as I am, you'll take your men as you find them.
If you can find them.
And another thing, Jerry.
The gossip at the hotel was that this man, Beddini... was supplying her with everything.
Money, clothes, flowers.
No, Horace, you provided the flowers.
I? I never did anything.
I didn't even know her.
Don't be ridiculous.
But anyway, as soon as we land,
I'm going to see Madge... and I am going to find out from her just who and what this Tremont person is.
I only want to find out where.
Now, Jerry, I warn you... you don't realize the trouble a designing woman can make for a man.
Now, I know all about these things.
I wouldn't tell this to anybody.
I am the victim of a designing woman myself.
- Surely you don't mean Madge?
- Why, certainly, who else?
Not Madge. She doesn't know anything about it either.
Her name is Violet.
She is what the French call a passade.
I see. Little ships that pass in the night.
Ships? Yes. Exactly.
I met her at the birdhouse in the zoo.
She was a very pretty little thing and she seemed to be quite frightened.
Of the birds?
Yes. You see, she had led a very sheltered life.
It was the storks in particular that worried her.
I took her to a cinema... and then we had dinner and then I took her to another cinema.
Then I fear
I forgot myself and let her kiss me.
That must be his plane now. Come on.
No, I'd rather not.
Come on. If I were you...
I wouldn't miss this opportunity of seeing the early worm get the bird.
You know, Dale, I haven't told you the real reason I asked you down here.
Haven't you?
No, I feel I've known you long enough to have the right to talk to you this way.
In spite of the fact that all men are males... there is no feeling so secure as having a good, reliable husband. I know.
- Jerry.
- Hello, Madge, I'll see you in a minute.
Where did Miss Tremont go?
- Dale didn't tell me she'd met you.
- Yes, we've met.
Fine, I've arranged a little dinner party for all of us.
Let's eat now.
Leave the child alone, she's a little upset about something.
- Really?
- Yes. Tell me, how did Dale strike you?
- Right between the eyes.
- Good.
- Where's Horace?
- I left him struggling with the baggage.
The hotel's crowded and both of you will have to bunk together tonight.
Dale's with me.
- Did you get that room for my husband?
- Si, signora, but I am so sorry... because of the carnival, the only thing available is the bridal suite.
- The bridal suite.
- How romantic. Thank you.
Signor, are you Horace Hardwick?
Thank you, I am. How do you do?
- I am very displeased to meet you.
- Really?
What do you mean, displeased?
Signor, I warn you.
For men of your kind, this is not a healthy place.
My dear fellow, this is one of the healthiest spots in Europe.
The air, the breeze, the flowers.
So it is funny tricks you're being.
I warn you... never let your path criss-cross mine again, or the heart...
- Horace.
- How do you do?
Madge, darling.
My, your passion frightens me.
- Been practicing?
- Yes. Well, scarcely. No.
Madge, what do you think has happened to me?
- I know. You got your first long trousers.
- Madge, please.
There's something down here that I have to investigate... and Jerry thinks that I...
Maybe I better tell it anonymously.
You know, it sounds as if you were about to confess something, Horace.
Does it? What would I have to confess?
You really want to tell me about Dale Tremont, don't you?
Yes, but then again, no.
You see, as a matter of fact,
I haven't even met her yet.
- You haven't met her?
- No.
If that's your story,
Horace, you stick to it.
I suppose you weren't in the park, either.
The park, my dear girl, it happened in the zoo. What?
The zoo... Yes. The zoo was in the park.
How did you know I was there?
- A little bird told me.
- The stork?
I think, after the trip
I better clean up a bit.
- Of course, I understand just how you feel. - Yes.
- What's the matter?
- It's Madge.
- Has she been chasing you?
- No.
Jerry, I think she's found out about Violet.
And I just had my life threatened.
But what did he say?
He just lied in a straightforward manner, and said he'd never met you.
- He did, did he?
- I told you he'd forget all about you.
I'll make him remember me in a manner he'll never forget.
Has Horace been away from you lately for any length of time?
Well, he was alone on the Continent last year.
Connect me with Mr.
Hardwick's apartment, please.
Madge, have you any objections if I scare your husband... so that he'll never look at another woman?
Dale, no husband is ever too scared to look.
Hello.
Hello, where are you?
So you do remember me?
He remembers me all right.
- Are you alone?
- Completely and desolately.
Fine. I'll be right up.
Horace, she's coming up.
She's coming up here?
She can't do that. It isn't proper.
- She wants to see me alone.
- Alone? Jerry.
What did I tell you?
She wants to compromise you.
Rack your brains, please.
Couldn't you have met that girl someplace else before?
I could have met her in Moscow.
- In Moscow. You see?
- But I've never been to Moscow.
Couldn't you have met her in Paris?
The last time I was in Paris,
I was 10 years old.
Jerry, I don't think it's safe for you to see that girl alone.
I don't think it would be quite proper for you to receive her that way.
Hello.
I know you'll think this is a little unconventional of me... but I just couldn't wait to see you alone.
I'm awfully glad you came up.
My darling.
Hello. How have you been?
I've been missing you terribly.
I came down on the fastest plane I could get.
No, I meant before yesterday.
- Before yesterday?
- Yes, of course.
Don't you remember?
Should I?
Have you forgotten...
- what we've been to each other?
- No.
What we've been to each other...
I knew yesterday in the park, when I was dancing in your arms...
- you remembered who I was.
- Of course.
Who are you?
Then you still don't remember?
I can try to remember something.
How could you forget that funny little house... and the suspicious concierge... and that quaint little room?
We used to have tea and muffins in front of the fireplace... watching the shadows leaping on the ceiling.
And those long walks down that twisty cobblestone street to the river.
Paris is heavenly in the spring.
So that's where we met.
Yes, last year.
In Paris.
Why, of course.
It's all coming back to me now.
Is it?
Yes, but you weren't calling yourself Dale Tremont.
- Wasn't I?
- No, it was...
Madeline, that was it.
I called you Mad for short.
You've put on a little weight, haven't you?
Remember that night on the Left Bank... you had on that little blue dress
I bought for you?
And to think that I almost forgot you...
Tell me something.
Do you still have that awful weakness for diamond bracelets?
I suppose I do.
Make yourself comfortable, darling.
I'll order some cocktails.
A little later on, we'll have supper up here, just we two.
It'll be like old times, won't it?
I think I'd better be going.
I'll let you go on one condition.
Promise me, now that I found you again... we can be to each other what we were in Paris.
There, you see? I was right.
Of all the scheming, brazen creatures... trying to pretend that she met you in Paris.
Do you realize that she's deliberately trying to trap you?
- What are you going to do about it?
- Marry her.
Jerry, this is no time for you to be funny.
All right, then, you be funny.
I'm going down and ask her to marry me right now.
Jerry, please wait.
Now, before you make a complete fool of yourself... promise me that you won't ask her... until I find out from Madge more about her past.
All right, you find out all about her past... and I'll go down and plan her future.
- Remember, that's a promise.
- All right, it's a promise.
What happened? Did you scare him?
No. He scared me.
What did he do, make faces at you?
You know, sometimes
I get up in the morning... and I take a good look at him and he frightens me, too.
He mistook me for someone called
Madeline he'd met in Paris.
Really?
Madge, do you think you ought to let him go away from you alone?
I don't believe he was nearly so innocent in Paris as you seem to think.
Darling, you interest me.
I must send him to China next year.
But, Madge, you don't seem to understand.
I'm trying to tell you that I'm afraid... that we're carrying this thing too far.
You know, I wonder if you've seen something in Horace... that I've never seen.
I wonder what's keeping Horace.
What's the matter?
I'm afraid I'm going to have a headache.
Don't go. This is a meeting
I've been planning a long time.
Good evening.
It's nice to see you again, Miss Tremont.
You've robbed me of the pleasure of introducing you two.
You've already met.
Yes, we've met last spring.
I hope you see a lot of each other.
You know, Madge is the most understanding person.
She seems to know instinctively the kind of girl that interests me.
I don't know what I'd do without her.
That's sweet of you, darling.
You two run along and dance, and don't give me another thought.
That's what I'm afraid of.
I think Madge is a very brave person.
Yes, I have a tremendous admiration for her.
Well, if Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.
Neither do I, all I know is that it's...
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
You know we never met in Paris.
I know. I'm afraid
I haven't been quite fair with you.
You see, I know who you are.
What difference does that make?
- So that doesn't make any difference?
- No, why should it?
I don't know who you are, and I don't care.
That's big of you.
Well...
Well, what?
Aren't you now supposed to say... we should think only of what we mean to each other... that we're entitled to live our own lives?
I don't think I'd say it that way exactly, but aren't we?
Go on.
If it weren't for a promise I made in a moment of weakness...
I would go on.
You made a promise.
That shouldn't make much difference to you.
That's right. Forget it, marry me.
How could I have fallen in love with anyone as low as you?
She loves me.
- What are you doing?
- Packing.
I'm leaving. You don't know what a mess we've got into.
Why, what's the matter?
Your husband.
- He wants to divorce you and marry me.
- I see.
He wants to do right by both of us.
Did he mention any settlement?
No.
That'll come later.
He'll probably want me to pay myself alimony.
Now listen, Dale. I don't want you to go.
That won't solve anything.
I can't stay here under the circumstances.
Here or there, as long as you remain a spinster... you're fair game for any philandering male.
You know, what you really should have... is a husband you can call your own.
Seriously, I mean it.
But what are we going to do about your husband?
Don't worry, dear. I'll do it.
Come in.
Darling.
All I said was darling and she smacked me.
Jerry, how does it look? Tell me frankly.
It looks like a sunrise by Maxfield Parrish.
Jerry, that's terrible.
I can't go around now like this.
Put a piece of raw steak on it.
That'll take the swelling down.
It would?
- A steak?
- Sure.
Yes, sir.
- Order a steak.
- A steak. Very good, sir.
You know, Jerry, I can't imagine what's got into Madge recently.
She's never hit me before.
Maybe she just never thought of it before.
Room service.
Yes. This is the bridal suite.
Yes, will you please send up a nice, juicy steak?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, mashed potatoes, and carrots... and spinach. Yes, of course, coffee...
As soon as you get your eye fixed, we'll go down and see Madge.
Where do you want it, sir?
- Want what, Bates?
- The steak, sir.
On my eye.
On your eye, sir?
My word, why do I always have to say things twice?
On my eye means on my eye, doesn't it?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Don't argue!
Jerry, you see what I'm up against.
The man has a sluggish brain, always wants to debate things.
First it's a maniac, and then it's Madge, and now it's Bates.
I give you my word, if anything else happens, I'll go insane.
We are a grand success.
Every woman, she's saying this dress, she's wonderful.
This Beddini is the tops.
I'm so happy.
No, but, cara mia, it's not the dress, it's not Beddini.
It's you who wears it.
Thank you, Alberto.
What is it? Is it Adam again?
His Garden of Eden... he has made you sad?
It's just that I'm all mixed up, that's all.
Why worry about this man?
I think I'm worrying more about his wife.
Beddini does not like to see you so sad.
Alberto, you seem to be the only one left I can turn to.
Why don't you marry Beddini?
He'll make you happy.
Why not? I'm rich, I'm pretty... and then this Hardwick will leave you alone.
I'll marry you if you really want me to... but let's do it right away.
First of all, we'll get you straightened out... and then I'll ask Madge about Dale.
Mr. Hardwick, dear sir, one of our guests has informed us... that he is to be married this evening.
We wondered if you would give up your bridal suite.
- Give it up? Why we...
- We've hardly settled in it yet.
- Have we, angel?
- No, and all our clothes are... Please.
- Of course you may have it.
- Thank you, sir.
I shall remove you elsewhere.
Come on, dear sir, brace up.
Madge has merely heard something about this Violet girl.
We know it isn't the truth, you tell her yourself... that's all she's waiting for.
I know. That's what I'm afraid of.
Always remember that the truth has never hurt any man.
Jerry, you are right.
Anyway, if it does,
I'll go to the hospital with you.
Horace, what is this, Halloween?
Madge, Horace has a little confession to make.
I've been waiting for this for some time.
Come right in and get it off your chest.
You'd better take your glasses off.
Sit down.
You see, when Horace was in London, he met a certain young lady.
And, Madge, you must have had an inkling of this or...
- Or you wouldn't be telling me now.
- Never. What? Certainly.
What Horace means to say is... that he'd like to make a clean breast of the whole thing.
- Before I find out the truth.
- Exactly. Madge, this girl was... What?
Dear, I'm all mixed. Where am I?
- Hello.
- Madge, darling...
I wanted to call you and tell you I just got married.
You got what?
I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you.
It sounds just as if you said you got married.
- I did.
- Where are you now?
Going to the bridal suite?
Very proper place for a bride and groom, isn't it?
Darling, I must compliment you on your speedy work... but who on earth did you find to marry you so quickly?
Alberto? You'd better hang up, Dale, dear.
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Dale.
What was that?
- Dale Tremont married?
- Yes, to that dressmaker.
- Good.
- Good? What did you have to do with this?
- It's all his fault.
- My fault?
Yes, she told me how you chased her in the park and she slapped your face.
Yes, but I'm the one she slapped.
She's been mistaking me for Horace all this time.
No wonder she thought
Horace was fascinating.
No wonder. I resent that.
- Madge, where is she now?
- On her way to the bridal suite.
Bridal suite.
I'll see you later.
But, Jerry, you can't do a thing like that.
It isn't fair.
All is fair in love and war, and this is revolution.
- Yes, this is very pretty.
- Thank you, dear sir.
We are very proud of our bridal arrangements.
Is there anything else, sir?
Yes, would you please ask my wife to join me here?
It is a pleasure, dear sir.
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, but this is my room.
- Yes, but this is my room.
- But I have the key.
But I have the key.
- But I am Beddini.
- You got me there, pal.
We will see who is the owner of this room.
But, Jerry, you shouldn't be in here.
- It isn't cricket.
- No, Horace, it isn't tiddlywinks either.
Signor, there is a man in my bed.
It's too bad. He's not here yet.
I'll just wait until my uncle returns.
Thank you.
Why, Jerry, I didn't know that you had an uncle here.
- Didn't you know?
- No.
I haven't, but this room is just above the bridal suite.
He's not here, signor.
If he returns, you will call us.
If he returns, I will kill him.
We Beddini have the motto:
For the woman, the kiss.
For the man, the sword.
Dale, you are lovely.
Like a flower I am afraid to crush.
Don't be afraid.
Alberto, make him stop!
Who is it? You know?
Yes, it's Horace.
Horace Hardwick, that interloper.
I'll stop him.
For the man, the sword.
Mrs. Hardwick's apartment, please.
- He's coming.
- Is he?
You keep this up and hold him here as long as you can.
I will.
Madge, you'd better come over and rescue Horace.
Alberto has gone after him with a sword.
Why, yes, of course.
I'm sorry to break in like this, but I simply had to see you.
Will you please stop annoying me?
But you've been mistaken about me.
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- All right, then.
I'll stay right here and there will be a scene with your husband.
He'll be furious if he finds you here.
Then please come with me for a few minutes.
I've simply got to talk to you.
And so you see, my dear chap,
I am definitely the wrong person.
- But you are Horace Hardwick, no?
- Yes, of course I am Horace Hardwick.
Then you are not the wrong person. Prepare.
Don't mind me.
I just came up to see the fun.
Madge, explain to this maniac that he is making a very serious mistake.
He may be making a mistake, but it's not serious.
Go right ahead, Alberto.
No, I cannot kill him before a lady.
If you're going to pull out on us, Alberto, maybe it's best that you don't kill him.
I may want that pleasure myself someday.
But why didn't you tell me who you were?
After all, I mean, you never gave me very much of a chance.
Mr. Travers!
Help, somebody.
I am so sorry.
I really did not want to kill you.
- You must forgive me.
- I forgive you.
Go right ahead, boys, don't mind me.
Not tonight, Alberto.
Some other time when I'm feeling stronger.
Thank you.
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it? What's the matter?
What have you been doing?
Pardon me, sir,
Mr. Travers and Miss Tremont, sir... they're drifting out to the bay in a gondola, sir.
There. That ought to make you feel pretty small, accusing me.
- He's kidnapped her.
- Kidnapped her?
You are in this plot.
You are cahooting with him.
I've had just about enough...
Children, if Dale and Jerry are drifting out to sea... don't you think the best thing we could do is rescue them?
Yes, come.
Isn't it marvelous to have some brains?
I'm always so helpless.
Don't answer me like that. Do something.
- Jerry.
- That isn't Jerry.
That's right. Make a fool of yourself.
It's no crime to look, is it?
- I think there is no gas left.
- My word, no petrol?
Perhaps I'd better look at the engine, where is it?
They may have hidden it up there under the hood.
This is the first time
I ever had to walk back from a boat ride.
Jerry, you mustn't come with me.
I'd rather talk to Alberto alone.
Alberto will have to get accustomed to talking in front of me.
No, seriously,
I'd rather you wouldn't. Please.
When am I going to see you again?
I don't know.
Mr. Travers, they went after you, sir, to look for you, sir, in a motorboat.
- Mr. Beddini, too?
- Yes, sir, all three of them... but they won't be back this evening, sir.
We took the precaution of removing the gasoline.
Thank you, Bates.
What is it, my good man?
Yes. I'm masquerading.
Don't you understand English?
You don't understand English?
Well, I've been waiting for an opportunity like this since my childhood.
You frozen-faced flatfoot.
And grazie to you if it comes to that, you stultified shrimp.
Can I help it if you look like a mildewed donkey?
I'm adoring this.
And grazie to you, since you insist.
You see, I happen to be breaking the law.
I admit it wholeheartedly... but, of course, you would never know that, you fish-faced nincompoop.
Good night.
I arrest you for masquerading as a gondolier.
I further charge you with insulting an officer with vile names... according to Rule Three, Section Three of the law dealing with delinquents.
Beg your pardon, signoro, the carnival is beginning.
Shall I serve now or will you wait for the groom?
I don't think the groom will be here tonight.
- Very good, sir.
- Very good? It's perfect.
I still feel a little guilty being here with you... while Alberto's out looking for us.
Let's eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we have to face him.
The hour of reckoning is at hand.
Beddini is about to settle his accounts.
Skipper, will you tell my husband we're here?
He's the one with his mouth closed.
Listen, you two idiots,
Alberto is as mad as a drunken toreador.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the room.
If you take my advice, you'll take the first plane back to London pronto.
Not until I've asked Mr. Beddini for his wife's hand. Do you think he'll accept me?
- Mr. Hardwick.
- What do you want?
I regret to report, my dear sir, that your manservant has been arrested.
- Bates? Really?
- Yes, sir.
He would have spent the whole night in jail if I had not bailed him out.
You don't mean it.
Come in.
At last.
The little birdies have come flying back to the rooster.
Mr. Beddini, we want to explain this whole thing to you.
I will not listen to any excuses, not even the truth.
Jerry, Madge,
I have the most amazing news.
A few days ago, my invaluable manservant, Bates...
Allow me to tell them, sir, please.
Quiet, your turn will come later.
A few days ago, my invaluable manservant, Bates...
The needle has gotten stuck in a crack.
You tell it, Bates.
Thank you, madam.
You see, Miss Dale, Mr. Hardwick thought you were a dangerous woman.
And he asked me to follow you in case you did something dangerous.
- Follow me?
- Yes, miss.
And in order to put you off the scent,
I thought of many little disguises.
This evening, I met
Mr. Beddini and Miss Tremont... and fearing that they might recognize me...
I turned my collar around... like this.
And very cleverly, I became a clergyman.
You are the one who married us.
Yes, sir.
Then we've never been really married?
Precisely, miss.
Well, Mr. Beddini... what are you doing in this young lady's room?
$1.60, lady.
Well?
I've only got $1.55.
Oh, yeah?
All right, lady, give me the $1 and keep the change.
But...
Listen, lady, don't ever argue with a taxi driver. Some of us is hard eggs.
I've had a couple of kids me-self.
I know what it's like to be a mother.
Thanks.
Good luck!
St. Anne's Hospital.
Room 46? Yes, hold the line.
Dr. Koenig sent me.
St. Anne's Hospital.
Mrs. O'Connor?
Yes. An 11-pound baby boy.
This way, please.
St. Anne's Hospital.
Be seated. Mother Angelica will see you in just a few minutes.
Your name is Dora Nichols?
Yes.
And your address is
1014 Brooks Avenue, Bronx?
Yes.
And your husband,
Mrs. Nichols?
My husband was killed two months ago.
I'm so sorry, my poor child.
And now, if you'll wait outside a few minutes.
Scared?
Stiff.
You and me both.
Ain't women darned fools?
Will you come in, please?
Yes.
Your name is Sally Trent?
Yes.
Your address is
816 East 97th Street?
Yes.
And your husband?
I haven't any husband.
You'll have to give me the name of the baby's father.
No, I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
I'm sorry, I'll have to go somewhere else.
Sit down, my child.
Good.
And how are you feeling this morning?
Swell!
Think you'll care for a little breakfast?
What have you got?
What would you like?
Have you got any cantaloupe?
I think so.
Some cantaloupe, ham and eggs, and some toast that should be buttered.
And some gooseberry jam.
We must have plenty to eat.
I hope the Trent girl pulls through. It's such a nice baby.
Don't leave me, Mike!
Don't leave me, Mike!
Don't go!
Isn't there anything more you can do for her, Doctor?
Mike!
What she needs is a new body with some strength to it and Mike.
Come closer.
Mike.
Mike.
Mike.
It isn't a Mike.
It's a Sally.
Why couldn't you have been a boy?
This world's such a tough place for a girl to come to.
Good morning, everybody!
Good morning.
Hello.
Hello, Dora.
And how are all the little mothers this morning?
Just fine.
That's good!
And where is my son?
I'll get him for you.
Well, we are all set, kid.
Did you find an apartment?
Did I? Wait till you see it! It isn't so big, but it's a lovely neighborhood for the children, and the view as far as your eyes can see.
The river?
No, garbage cans.
Dora, I hate to sponge off you like this.
Don't be dumb.
I got a job to go back to.
Well, I'll have one before long.
There'll be a lot of shows opening soon.
Sure there will.
Besides, honey, you know nothing about babies, and I know nothing about babies, so we got to stick together!
He's all ready, Dora.
Oh, no, he isn't!
Not again!
He's wonderful that way.
What's the bow-wow doing?
Sally's not going to cry.
No, Sally's a big girl now.
She loves to take her bath. Yes.
There, it'll be all over in a minute.
Yes, and it'll feel so good.
There.
Where's my soap?
Bobby, where's my soap?
Where's... Here it is!
There's the soap. Yes, there.
Did you see
Bobby steal the soap?
Did you see that naughty boy?
There, there!
Now, it's all over.
It's all over.
It's all over, honey.
Up we go.
Come on. There!
It's all over. Look.
You're not gonna cry.
Look what a good boy Bobby is.
He didn't cry one bit.
When Mommy comes home, I'm going to tell her how good you've been.
Yes.
Look, and Sally's such a big girl.
You lay off my daughter, you little flirt!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!
Don't be a crybaby
But the boogeyman will get you
If you let him catch you
Starting to sing the blues
Don't be a crybaby
Hello, Dora.
What's eating you?
The big stiff!
Who?
My boss, the dirty old coconut!
What did he do?
He has been creeping up on me for the past week.
Well, today, just when I was getting ready to leave, he makes a pass at me. I says,
"Take your hands off of me!"
He says,
"Don't act like that.
"How would you like to come and see me tonight
"and play hide and seek?"
I says, "Listen, you, you snake in the bush,
"if you and I was Adam and Eve,
"I wouldn't go hide and go seek you!"
Then I wallop him!
Oh, Dora!
When he open his eyes, he says,
"How you like me to fire you?"
I say, "You won't get a chance, you big bozo, for I'm leaving. "
So I slammed the door right in his nose.
What day is this?
Friday.
Good. I got fish.
Bobby!
Here, let me.
Oh, my goodness.
Now listen, boy, you'd better hurry and grow up.
You might have to support the whole family.
Hey, wait for me.
Come on!
I never heard anything so preposterous!
You don't know what you're asking.
Yes, I do.
I'm asking you to take care of
Michael's baby, his and mine.
I've tried to do it myself.
I've tried like the devil.
Don't mind me,
Miss Alden.
I'm liable to say much worse before I'm through.
There's only one thing
I care about now, to give my baby a chance.
Is that asking too much?
If my nephew is involved, as you say he is, why didn't you settle this matter with him before he left for China?
I don't know.
Maybe I had some pride then.
How do I know, Miss...
Trent, Trent.
Sally Trent.
How do I know, Miss Trent, that your claims are to be believed?
Because...
Because I'm telling you.
Very true, Miss Trent, but a woman I've never seen before or even heard of!
And you'll never see or hear of me again, I swear it!
I'll give up all claim to my little girl.
I'll sign any kind of a paper you like.
I'll even promise never to see her again.
How do you like that,
Miss Alden?
How would you like never to see your baby again?
There's some mistake,
Miss Trent.
I've never had a baby.
That's too bad.
It might do you some good!
It might soften you a bit!
Oh, no, no!
No, no, I'm sorry! I'm...
That's not what I meant to say at all.
Please forgive me! Please!
And say you will take her.
I'm sorry, Miss Trent, but I'm not interested.
Have you exhausted every possibility?
Yeah, I even did that.
Well?
She wasn't interested.
Baby.
What became of Dora?
Baby.
Dora was swell to me, but she lost her job, and she decided to marry a boy from out West.
Dora's the kind of girl that some guy always wants to marry.
I get a lot of proposals, too, but marriage isn't one of them.
I'm sorry.
Well, kid,
I'll be a seeing you.
Baby.
Sally, you understand that if you give up your baby it will be completely and forever.
Sure I do!
Let's get it over with!
I'll go and get the papers ready for you to sign.
I haven't been much good to you, have I?
Maybe you...
Maybe you'll take a mother's advice before she goes.
You might as well.
That's all she's got to give you.
Don't ever let any man make a sucker out of you.
Make them know what you're worth.
Anything they get for nothing is always cheap.
There's just one thing, Mother.
Would you fix it so her name will always be Sally?
It's sort of... It's sort of silly not to know your own kid's name, isn't it?
Of course, my dear.
I promise.
Is that all?
That's all.
Baby. Baby.
I only know
That I can't go on, darling
And here lies love
Well, Miss Benton...
You don't have to say it.
I was terrible.
No, no, no.
Your voice is okay.
What you need is experience.
What kind of experience?
Well, you know, see something of life, learn how to suffer.
A woman must suffer much before she can sing a little.
I see.
Come back to me in about a year.
All right.
In the meantime, watch me suffer.
It's a long dark night
Come on home, Daddy
'Cause I'm lonely and blue
You know I worry, Daddy
Won't you hurry?
Mama's waiting for you
Now you know it ain't right
To fool me, baby
'Cause I'm faithful and true
And I won't struggle
If you want to snuggle
Dear, I'm waiting for you
Although you've kept me yearning
I hope my yearning is through
I've kept those home fires burning
So give your devil her due
Come and hold me tight
You great big baddie
And do, do like you do
It's, oh, so cold out
I can hardly hold out
Still I'm waiting for you
Miss Benton, you are marvelous!
So you think I've suffered enough, do you?
Waiter, bring me a telephone, please.
I want you to be hostess in my night club.
Are you tied up here with a contract?
I'm not tied up anywhere.
I'm as free as a bird on the wing.
CARLOTTl: Splendid!
Lend me your pencil, please.
Thanks.
This is
Tony Cummings speaking.
Cummings, of the
American Radio Corporation.
I wonder if you'd care to take luncheon with me tomorrow.
No, no, I'll stop by for you.
Why don't you ring me at noon and verify this?
My number is
Vanderbilt 39970.
I look forward to it.
And now about terms.
Yes, terms.
But I warn you, I'm going to cost you a lot of money.
That'll be okay.
I'm a slave to you
Don't you want the heart I gave to you?
You can have me if you want me
But you must be mine alone
Give me liberty or give me love
You're so dear to me
I wish I was like that.
I'm in heaven
If you were,
I'd smack you down.
When you're near to me
You can have me if you want me
Carlotti, she is superb.
Yes.
But you must be mine alone
I give her her chance.
Give me liberty or give me love
I'm only a slave to you
Now you can have me if you really want me
Give me liberty or love
You're so dear to me
When you are near to me
You can have me
But you must be mine alone
Give me liberty or give me love
You've been kind of strange
Why the sudden change?
Do you want somebody new?
I'd be glad to share...
How do you like her?
I don't care for any woman as notorious as Mimi Benton.
What has her private life got to do with it?
It isn't private.
It's a public scandal.
Well, Mrs. Judson, those stories are very much exaggerated.
I want you both to meet her.
Yours to have and hold and call your own, dear
You can have me if you want me
But you must be mine alone
Give me liberty or give me love
Give me liberty or love
Of course you don't want to dance with me, my dear.
Not with you, Andrew. You have no rhythm in your soul.
However, if Tony would care to join me...
Care? Why, Mrs. Judson, this is one of the big moments of my life.
I'm Mimi Benton.
How do you do?
Miss Benton,
I'm afraid I'm all right.
I'm Andrew Judson of the
Judson Pure Food Corporation.
No!
Yes.
That's marvelous!
I've heard Tony speak of you 100 times.
Yes?
Where is Tony?
He's fighting... I mean, he's dancing with my wife.
Tony's very fascinating. Aren't you afraid you'll lose her?
I don't think there's a chance.
I've been asking Tony for weeks to bring you up some evening.
Yeah? Well, that's funny.
He never said a word to me about it.
No? Poor Tony!
He's such a jealous boy.
Jealous of me?
That's nonsense.
Look here, I'm giving a little party tonight. Tony'll be there.
Don't you want to come over?
I'd love to, but...
Bring Mrs. Judson, of course, yes, if you think she'll be amused.
She wouldn't. No, she wouldn't. I'm sure she wouldn't.
You come up anyhow.
I've so wanted to meet you.
Say yes.
Say yes?
Yes.
I want you to tell me all about
Pure Foods. We'll talk until dawn.
I don't stay up that late on account of my lumbago.
Lumbago?
I have something grand for lumbago.
Yes?
Yes.
I'll fix you up.
I am Edwardo Pasquale of the Baltimore Opera Company.
I must see the big man from the radio, Mr. Cummings.
Good afternoon, Miss Benton.
Hello, Helen.
I'm sorry, but Mr.
Cummings is busy.
Hello, Dorothy. Mr. Cummings is busy, Miss Benton.
All right. Well, you just tell him I'm here, and I'll wander around.
All right.
I don't think he's telling me the truth.
Excuse me.
Yes? Who?
My apologies to Miss...
Tell the young lady I'll see her in just a moment. Thank you.
I want to know everything that happened.
Well, Mrs. Judson,
Mimi spent the entire evening treating your husband's lumbago.
I hope I never have the misfortune to encounter that wretched creature!
Forget it, Julia.
We came here to listen to our first Pure Foods' broadcast, not to talk about Miss Benton.
Will you pardon me just a moment? Why, certainly.
Thank you.
Tony, darling!
What's the matter?
What brings you down here so early?
The Judson
Pure Food broadcast.
Juddy told me all about it last night.
You know me, anything for a laugh.
He didn't ask you down here, did he?
Well, yes and no.
Is that so?
Well, you'd better make yourself scarce around here.
Mrs. Judson's in there with him.
Oh, goodie!
I want to meet her.
No, you don't, Mimi.
Come on now.
Yes, I do.
Hello, Miss Benton.
Hello.
What goes on here, a marathon race?
She's an expert in child psychology.
In a few seconds, she's facing the mike for the first time.
It looks as if she's facing a firing squad.
Hello. Miss Spaulding, time to go on.
Now, now...
That's not going to bite you.
You go in there and knock them cold!
If only I could knock them as cold as I am right now.
Go on.
Little boys and girls of Radioland, you are going to hear the first program we are sending you by Aunt Jenny.
Now, Aunt Jenny is going to tell you all about lovely Oatina, made by the Judson
Pure Foods Company.
Aunt Jenny will sing you songs, tell you stories and play games with you, just like your own auntie.
Here she is, kiddies.
Good evening... little children.
This is your Aunt...
No, no.
Here I am, darlings, your Aunt Jenny.
You know what interrupted me just now?
A big dragon sneaked up behind me and grabbed me by the shoulder.
"Listen here,
Aunt Jenny," he said,
"you can't talk to all those boys and girls
"because maybe some of them have been bad,
"and the bad ones belong to me. "
So I said to him,
"What do you mean, bad?
"Maybe some of them are naughty once in a while, but who isn't?"
When I was a little girl,
I was pretty naughty myself, but no bad dragon ever got me.
And do you know why?
Because I always ate Oatina, so you see...
It makes everybody feel like singing, and there's nothing dragons hate so much as a song.
So just to spite that old grouch, I'm going to sing.
You're wanted in the control room immediately.
Tell him I'll be there in a minute. Yes, sir.
And now, good night, children.
Be sure and tune in again tomorrow night and hear Aunt Jenny.
This program has come to you through the courtesy of the Judson Pure Foods Company, sponsoring Oatina.
That was marvelous!
Congratulations, my dear Tony.
The woman you picked for Aunt Jenny is a winner.
Thanks. Such refinement and such charm.
I always say you can tell a true gentlewoman by her voice.
Have her in, Mr. Cummings.
I must meet her.
Yes, by all means.
With this woman at the microphone,
Oatina should be a sensation.
A positive sensation!
What's the matter, Andrew?
Nothing.
Yes, Tony, we must meet her, by all means, but some other time.
Come, dear, I have a very, very important engagement.
I'm sorry you have to go.
So am I.
Goodbye, Mrs. Judson.
Can't you have dinner with us tonight?
Sorry, I'm sponsoring a new program.
I'm so sorry.
Another night soon?
I'll be very glad to.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Tony.
Goodbye, Juddy.
"Such refinement!
Such charm!"
I suppose you know what you've done.
Sure, I've been having the time of my life.
I could kill you.
You could?
That's gratitude.
Where would your Pure Foods hour be if it weren't for me?
Mimi, dear, you were wonderful, but you've got to understand my position.
What is it?
Supposing word got around that the most notorious torch singer in town was broadcasting to kiddies.
Well, who's going to tell them?
That's not the point.
Listen, boy, I only tell bedtime stories to grownups.
Now, come on, I've wasted enough time around here.
But, Mimi, listen, you've got to be reasonable.
Take me to 21.
Mimi, don't you understand?
What's going to...
No!
Good morning, Carrie.
Well, in the name of say, you can't come in here!
I'm in, Carrie.
No, sir, Mr. Cummings. I wouldn't take the responsibility of trying to get Miss Benton up out of bed at this hour of the morning.
No, sir.
I wouldn't have it on my conscience.
See what you can do. Yes, sir, Mr. Cummings. I sure will.
Miss Benton.
Miss Benton, honey.
Time you was getting up, sweetie lamb.
What time is it?
Land sakes, honey, it's going on 1:00.
Why, you!
Miss Benton, don't throw that clock at me.
Mimi, it's Tony.
So that's who it is!
Waking up people in the middle of the night, who does he think he is, Paul Revere?
I'll tell that one where to get off!
Why, you big...
Pure Foods!
Listen, Mimi, we... I wouldn't listen to Gabriel's trumpet before I've had my coffee.
Coffee?
No, thanks.
Juddy? No, thanks. I believe not.
Carrie!
What do you want, honey?
Coffee before I murder you.
Coming right in, sweetie lamb.
Mimi, will you listen to me for just one second?
Sure I will. Why don't you say something?
It's about your broadcast.
What about it?
Mr. Judson and I want you to continue as Aunt Jenny.
That's a panic, Tony!
This is not a joking matter.
Why, Mimi, you were a sensation.
Telegrams, letters and the telephones we've received.
Are you two boys trying to kid me?
I was never more serious in my life.
If the Judson Pure Food hour is to continue,
Miss Benton, we simply must have you.
Take a look at this contract, Mimi.
I'm sure you'll be pleased with the terms, Miss Benton.
Now, look, every day at 5:00 you broadcast in the studio for only 15 minutes.
Not me!
What?
Studio's out.
You have to bring the microphone to my apartment.
Now, Mimi, be reasonable.
You know that's impossible.
What do you mean? It's not impossible for opera stars, is it?
Anything that's good enough for a prima donna is good enough for this prima donna!
Now, listen, Mimi dear.
No. If I'm going to tell bedtime stories,
I'll tell them from my own bed.
Excuse me, Miss Benton, but the men have come about your radio.
There's nothing the matter with my radio.
They've got the wrong apartment. Send them away.
Wait a minute.
Send them in.
Have you forgotten?
You've got a broadcast.
Broadcast?
Well!
What do you mean, broadcast?
Yes! What are you trying to do, put one over on us?
Well, what is this all about?
Listen, children,
I've got a surprise for you.
You'd better hang around.
I've got a new racket.
I'm telling bedtime stories for the Judson Pure Foods Company.
All right, boys, set it up in the other room.
MIMl: Look at her, she's dying.
Come on, kids, out, out.
You can't stay here while Mimi's broadcasting.
Come on.
Don't be like that!
Come on, gather around, children.
Your Aunt Jenny's going to tell you fairy tales.
One, two, three, four.
Okay.
Everything all set, Harry?
All right, Mr. Cummings.
All right, Mimi. Here's your script, Miss Benton, and the lullaby.
Lullaby?
All ready.
Listen, if you think I'm going to say this, you're nuts.
Give me a drink, somebody, will you?
I'm so nervous!
Quiet, please!
Little boys and girls of
Radioland, here we are again, and here comes Aunt Jenny who's going to talk to you, sing to you and tell you some more about Oatina.
Here she is, boys and girls.
Good evening, my darlings.
Your Aunt Jenny almost didn't get here to talk to you this afternoon.
Do you remember that green dragon
I was telling you about yesterday?
Well, he followed me right up to the studio.
He's here now, my darlings, and he brought along with him a lot of very naughty boys who are determined to spoil Aunt
Jenny's program. But they won't.
No, they won't.
Naughty boys have often tried to tease your Aunt Jenny.
Sometimes they've teased her till she had to give in, but she won't this afternoon.
And do you know why?
Because Aunt Jenny has a dish of lovely Oatina in her hand.
I want you all to try it. You'll be surprised how it'll make you grow.
And now, my darlings, it's bedtime for most of you, so Aunt Jenny is going to sing you a good night song.
Baby's boat's the silver moon
Sailing in the sky
Sailing over the sea of sleep
While the clouds float by
Sail, baby, sail
Out upon that sea
Only don't forget to sail
Back again to me
Baby's boat's the silver moon
Sailing in the sky
I tell you, Mike,
I've combed this old town.
I've talked with every theatrical manager of my acquaintance, and I can't find a trace of her.
Well, that may be, but a girl can't just disappear off the face of the Earth and not leave some trail behind her.
You'd be surprised!
I've employed hundreds of girls in my shows and all sorts of things happen to them.
One out of 100 gets to the top.
Some stick in the chorus and some get married and lose their identity that way.
That's what I thought would be the fate of Sally Trent when she met you.
At least, I hoped it would.
She was a swell kid.
One of the best.
You know, every time I get near one of those radios,
I have to listen to one of those confounded bedtime hours.
Would you mind...
Sure.
Thanks.
Mike, what happened?
Well, I was just a plain fool, that's all.
You see, I had to leave for China in a hurry.
Instead of marrying her then and there and taking her with me,
I went alone.
Then, when I did write, asking her to join me, I got no reply.
My letters were returned. No such person known living there.
You know, I'd give anything if I could find her.
I'll try again, old man.
Mr. Cummings sent these letters over.
All right, Dolly, that's swell. Thanks.
Read them out.
Sugar, looks to me like you've gotten to be famous.
You bet your life.
Known from coast to coast as "Everybody's Auntie!"
"My dear Aunt Jenny.
"My nephew and I are crazy about you on the radio.
"Your voice comes over like a million dollars.
"I would dearly love to meet you sometime.
"Hopefully, Uncle Edgar. "
"Dear Aunt Jenny.
I am a little girl.
"I am five years old.
"I like you, Aunt Jenny. You sing pretty, too, Aunt Jenny.
"Well, goodbye,
Aunt Jenny. Sally. "
That one's kind of sweet, ain't it?
Let me see.
"Dear Aunt Jenny... "
That's enough.
Never mind. Never mind.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm looking for a little girl named Sally.
My name is Sally.
What's your name?
My name's Aunt Jenny.
Did you get my letter,
Aunt Jenny?
Yes, darling.
I used to have a little girl once whose name was Sally.
Was she black like me, Aunt Jenny?
Darling, it was so long ago,
Aunt Jenny wouldn't remember.
Guess what I've got here.
Candy.
That's right.
Would you like some?
Aunt Jenny, that's swell.
Aunt Jenny, will you tell me a story?
Yes, darling.
You bet I will.
Now, let's see.
Once upon a time...
Keep the party clean, whatever you do.
Mimi! Hello!
Boy, are we having fun!
Listen, kids, listen.
I've got to broadcast, and I'm so darned tired now.
Be nice and clear out, would you?
Come on, don't be like that.
We want to stay!
Yeah, we want to stay.
All right, then stay.
I don't want to seem inhospitable, but as long as you're here there'll be no broadcast.
Well!
Let's go down to 22. We've been put out of better places than this.
That's a very good idea.
Come on, everyone.
Hello, Tony!
Hi, Tony!
Say, you'd better be careful.
We just got thrown out.
What's happened?
What's the matter?
Come on, kids. Say, how does she get that way?
Where's Mimi?
When they get famous, they all get that way.
Never mind, forget it. We'll have a lot of fun before the day is over.
Hello, Tony.
What's the matter, dear?
I had a shock this afternoon, Tony.
One of those letters you sent over was from a little girl named Sally.
Well, what about it?
That was the name of my kid.
All of a sudden you remember you're a mother.
Well, strange as it may seem to you,
I've never forgotten it.
I gave her up four years ago completely and forever.
Those were the conditions.
I've lived up to them.
But now I've got to do something about it.
Tony, I didn't realize it at first, but every time
I broadcast, maybe...
Maybe I'm talking to my own kid.
That letter today signed
Sally, don't you see?
I'm sorry, Mimi dear.
If you're suggesting using the radio as a means of finding your child, it can't be done.
It's out of the question.
Well, what do you mean?
Don't you understand?
You're a torch singer.
I'll give it up. Carlotti can find someone else to take my place.
I'll tell him tonight.
Even if you give it up, you're still Mimi Benton.
I'm sorry, dear.
I hate to be so blunt about it, but business is business.
You understand that, Mimi?
I see.
All right, Miss Benton.
That's what I am?
Just a voice.
All right, Tony, a contract's a contract.
I'll never do anything to embarrass you, but I'm going to find my kid.
And now I have a surprise for you.
I don't know of anything that little girls and boys love so much as a birthday, so Aunt Jenny has plans for a birthday club.
Right here on the table beside me there's a great big hat filled with hundreds of names.
I'm going to close my eyes tight, and I'm going to draw the name for our first birthday club.
Just a moment now.
Here we are.
And what name do you suppose
Aunt Jenny has drawn?
Sally!
I want all the little girls named Sally to write in and tell me their birthdays.
That's very important, and don't forget your addresses, because you're going to get a doll.
Aunt Jenny's going to have a special doll made, just the loveliest doll you ever saw.
And now, my darlings, I'm going to sing you a little song that I used to know a long time ago.
Don't be a crybaby
You've nothing to lose
But the boogeyman will get you
Hey, Mickey, let's go out and play.
Starting to sing the blues
Don't be a crybaby
Whatever may be
'Cause I never will desert you
Nothing's going to hurt you
You can depend on me
You can depend on me
You can have me
But you must be mine alone
Give me liberty or give me love
You've been kind of strange
Why the sudden change?
Do you want somebody new?
I'd be glad to share
All of your grief and care
Sally!
But never will
I ever share you
I'll be all your own, dear
Yours to have and hold and call your own, dear
You can have me if you want me
But you must be mine alone
Give me liberty or give me love
Mimi Benton!
Give me liberty or love
Where you going?
Where do you think?
Come in.
Well, look who's here!
I hear you've been away.
The trip must have done you a world of good.
You look simply swell.
Sally.
So you remember the name!
Do tell me about China.
It's a beautiful country,
I hear.
Is it so, or is it so and so?
What's happened to Sally Trent?
Sally Trent?
Let me think.
Please stop acting.
You know I loved you.
Oh, no!
I can't believe that Michael
Gardner, Boston's gift to China, could ever have loved that shabby little chorus girl.
Well, I'll tell you what happened to her.
While you were touring China, she went through hell!
It's a nice place.
You must go there someday.
It's all right, Mike.
I got along without you then, and
I can get along without you now.
Darling, listen to me.
I love you a thousand times more than I ever did before.
Does that mean anything to you?
Yes, indeed!
There's nothing this world needs so much as love, love, more love!
What do we talk about now?
I want to hear about you, Sally.
Aren't you nice?
There isn't anything a woman likes as well as talking about herself, especially when there's so much to tell.
Let me see, now.
Oh, yes,
I changed my name.
I got sick of being Sally Trent, so I switched to Mimi Benton.
It's a nice name, don't you think?
And then... Oh, yes,
I almost forgot to tell you.
I had a baby, not that you'd be interested.
Yes, I had your child in a charity ward!
I kept her with me until things got so bad
I was afraid what might happen to her.
Well, why didn't you go to my family?
I thought of that, too.
Miss Agatha Alden of Beacon
Hill wasn't interested.
So I took her back where we started, the charity ward, and signed her away just like that.
Well, where is this place?
You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
I've got to know!
Well, make the rounds.
That's what Ihad to do before I found one that would take me in.
I'm sorry, Sally.
I've made a lot of rotten mistakes, but I'm trying to make up for them.
The first thing I did when I got back was to try and find you.
I didn't expect you to believe me, but I did hope that you'd meet me halfway.
You've changed, all right.
You're selfish, hard.
Sure I am.
Just like glass.
So hard nothing will cut it but diamonds.
Come around someday with a fistful, maybe we can get together.
I don't see how you could have done it, Aunt Agatha.
But this girl had no means of proving her claim.
How was I to know... You could have taken a chance.
That having failed, at least you could have cabled me.
I'm glad I didn't. A girl like this
Sally Trent would have ruined your life.
I was in a position to save you, and I thank heaven for it.
That's fine.
The next time you go in for rescue work, pick out someone who wants to be saved.
I don't.
I love Sally Trent, and I'm going to win her back.
And I'm sending you a Sally doll for your birthday.
With love and best wishes,
Aunt Jenny.
Is that your last one?
Yes, Miss Benton.
Excuse me, Miss Benton, but
Mr. Cummings is on the wire.
Well, you take the message,
Carrie. I'm busy.
Did you call the express company?
Yes, Miss Benton. They'll be here the first thing in the morning.
Good. All right, girls, finish what you're doing and we'll call it a day.
Excuse me. Mr. Seymour from the detective agency is here.
Have him come in, please.
All right.
Hello, Mr. Seymour.
How do you do?
I've been waiting for you.
Have you got some good news for me?
Here's your check from the charity hospital.
What's the matter with it?
Mother Angelica won't take any more of your money.
She says they're always glad to have freewill offerings, but she can't take bribes.
I can't go on taking your money, either, Miss Benton.
Why not? I'm not bribing you, am I?
I'm not saying you are, but
I can't help you anymore, see?
You haven't tried very hard, I imagine.
I don't lay down on any job, Miss Benton.
I haven't got a ghost of a chance.
What do you mean?
I've turned this town upside down, and there's not a trace of your child.
How do you know she's in New York?
For all we know, she may be in another part of the world.
For all you know, she may even be dead.
Thanks for reminding me.
I didn't mean it that way.
I owe you a week's salary, don't I?
You don't owe me anything.
Yes, I do.
Good night.
I'm sorry.
For all you know, she may be dead.
Maybe he's right.
Aunt Jenny!
Bedtime stories!
What a laugh!
Carrie, give me a drink.
No, no, get me my black velvet dress.
What are you going to do, honey?
I'm going places!
Atta baby!
Little boys and girls of Radioland,
I have some bad news for you again.
It isn't likely that
Aunt Jenny will be here to talk to you tonight at
5:00 as she is still ill.
However, we have every hope that tomorrow she will be with us once more.
You don't seem to realize, my dear Julia, that if Miss Benton continues to hide herself we'll simply have to abandon the Oatina program.
Well, I still think it's very strange, Mr. Cummings, that you can't find someone else to take this woman's place.
My dear Mrs. Judson,
I have had 100 women up here the last three days, each one worse than the one before.
There's only one Mimi Benton.
Well, that's something to be grateful for!
Miss Benton needs us much worse than we need her.
She's trying to make every effort to find her child.
You know this Sally birthday doll idea?
Why, only this morning, we received a letter from a child which...
Well, it's too disgusting!
To think of that disreputable woman talking every evening to
America's dear little kiddies!
Rats!
She's an evil influence invading a million decent homes!
More rats!
How would you like to have such a creature in your home?
I'd love nothing better!
Yes?
Speaking. What?
They've found her. Where?
185 East. Certainly, I'll be right over. You stay right there.
Okay.
Come on, Juddy.
Andrew Judson!
Are you going in search of that dreadful woman?
Yes! And if I thought you'd be of any earthly use, I'd drag you along.
What?
You don't know your luck.
That new mink coat you have on, Mimi Benton.
Those diamond earrings,
Mimi Benton.
And if you want to know the truth, that dreadful woman is all but keeping you!
Hello, Mimi.
Hi, Tony.
Sit down and have a drink.
Mimi, let's get out of here.
No.
What for?
Well, I don't like this place.
That's right.
It's a terrible joint.
I know a swell place over on...
You know, over on...
We'll ride around, we'll we find it.
All right.
Who's this guy that's got his arm around me?
That's Mr. Judson.
I think he's drunk.
I want to sit down.
Mimi, dear, we've got to get you home.
What's the big idea? We've got all day, haven't we?
What's the big idea?
Listen, dear,
I have a letter here.
I know some letters.
"A," "B," "C... "
No, but listen. This letter is from a little girl named Sally.
Sally who?
Well, it's her birthday,
September 2nd.
It may be your little Sally.
September 2nd.
My Sally.
Come on, Mimi dear.
Pull yourself together.
You've got a broadcast in less than an hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I gotta.
Yeah. Come on, Tony.
Yeah.
Taxi.
Miss Benton, honey,
Carrie's brought you some nice, hot, black coffee.
Take just one little sip, won't you, honey?
I don't want coffee.
She'll never make it.
Oh, yeah?
What do you know about it?
Good evening, little children of Radioland.
Have you had your Oatina today?
This evening your
Aunt Elizabeth will...
Miss Spaulding, just half a second, please.
How much time have we got, Harry?
About a minute. All right. Fine. Hold it.
Give me that, Carrie.
I'll take care of her.
Mimi, listen to me, dear.
Mimi, you're due on the air any minute.
Come on, pull yourself together.
Mimi, you said you'd never let me down. Now, come on.
I'm trying.
Mr. Cummings, we're due on the air.
All right, Harry.
Ready, Miss Spaulding.
Little boys and girls of Radioland,
I'm sorry to keep disappointing you about Aunt Jenny.
She wanted us to bring the microphone to her bedside, but the doctor refused to allow it.
However,
I have a pleasant surprise for you.
Your Aunt...
Your...
Your Aunt Jenny speaking.
I couldn't bear to be away from you any longer, so as soon as the doctor left,
I got out of bed, and here I am.
Yes, darlings.
I've been ill, so I can't talk to you very long, but before I say good night,
I want to wish a happy, happy birthday to a little girl named Sally, whose birthday is September 2nd.
I have her letter here, but there's no address.
Won't Sally please call me on the telephone as soon as the broadcast is over?
The number is
Murray Hill, 29969.
I have such a lovely doll to send, but I must have the address.
Are you sure you have the number, darling?
Murray Hill, 29969.
And now, good night, my dears.
Aunt Jenny is so glad to be back with you once more.
That's all for tonight, boys and girls.
I know that you are all glad to have
Aunt Jenny back with you once more.
So be sure, children, to tune in tomorrow at this hour for Aunt Jenny and her Oatina program.
Take it easy, Mimi.
Give me a cigarette, Tony.
I wonder why she doesn't phone.
She'll phone, dear.
Maybe she won't.
Maybe she's sick!
Or she hasn't had time to call, dear.
Hello?
What?
What number do you want?
No, wrong number.
Now, now... Tony, what if she wasn't listening in?
No, I'm sure she was listening in. She was?
Now, be patient, darling.
Hello.
Yeah?
Hello?
Yes, darling.
Is this Sally?
Now tell Aunt Jenny where you live.
No, no, wait a minute, darling.
I didn't hear you.
Now, say it again, very slowly, will you?
85 East...
Do you think you'll be all right?
Sure.
Good luck.
Hello, Daddy.
Isn't it time little girls were getting ready for bed?
Not yet, Daddy.
Do you know, the most wonderfulest thing happened to me today.
You could never guess.
Come on, tell me.
Aunt Jenny's coming to this house specially to see me.
Aunt Jenny?
Beg pardon, sir, Aunt Jenny is here to see Miss Sally.
Daddy, you can go bring her in while I fix my children.
All right.
Sally!
Well, I guess the joke's on me.
I don't know what miracle's brought you here or what all this Aunt Jenny business is, but now that you are here,
I'm not going to let you go.
It's no use, Mike. I didn't come here to see you.
Forget me. There's a kid in there who's waiting to see you.
Don't disappoint her.
Mike!
Yes.
She's been here a week now.
She belongs to me.
I want to see her.
Are you Aunt Jenny?
Yes, darling.
Hello, Aunt Jenny.
I'm Sally.
Hello, Sally.
Don't cry, Aunt Jenny.
This is my birthday.
Aren't you going to kiss me?
Yes, darling.
Look, look at what Aunt Jenny brought you, darling.
She's beautiful!
Thank you, Aunt Jenny.
Sally. Sally, dear!
I'm coming.
Miss Thomas!
Look, Miss Thomas!
Aunt Jenny brought me the most beautifulest doll!
Isn't that nice?
Come on, darling.
We go to bed.
Goodbye, Aunt Jenny.
Goodbye, darling.
Isn't she lovely?
She's adorable, no thanks to me.
No thanks to either of us.
Don't go, darling. I've got so much to say to you.
There's someone out there waiting for me.
But I must talk to you.
The maid says Michael
Gardner lives there, sir.
The club.
Yes, sir.
So you see, darling, she needs both of us.
I'll be the best father to her I can, but I couldn't possibly be a mother to her.
Could I?

In the Caspian Sea, a boat is shipwrecked during a storm.
During two days, the current drives them southward.
Two days and two nights, the current carries them southward.
In the south of the Caspian Sea, in Soviet Azerbaijan...
...there's an island.
What a nice island!
Nice? Really think so?
Don't you agree?
Alyosha, look.
But, what are they doing?
How should I know?
An interesting posture!
They're women!
- Women?
- Of course, women.
You can't even shoot a dead duck... and when you go out hunting, people have to duck.
"Soar higher, seagull...
"...night is falling over the blue sea...
"Hasten your flight and find out...
"... how my loved one fares.
"Tell him how much I miss him...
"... and that my love will never cease."
Alyosha, we risked death... at least 11 times in the storm... and I was never afraid.
But saying "I love you" to a woman... scares me.
How about you?
Anybody here?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Who are you looking for, comrade?
I was looking for someone from the kolkhoz directorate.
- I didn't find anyone!
- Well, here I am.
- And this?
- My orders.
- What orders?
- Mine. Read it!
There's nothing left!
In summary, what is it you want, comrade?
Didn't you write asking for a mechanic?
- Yes-
- Well, here I am.
- Mechanic?
- Mechanic.
- Really?
- Yes.
- That's fantastic!
- Why are you so glad?
We were afraid that we couldn't go out to sea tomorrow.
- Where are all the men?
- Serving.
In the far East... in the Pacific fleet!
I'll stay for the duration of the fishing season.
- Who are they?
- Members of my brigade.
- They're afraid of me.
- I don't think so...
Akim, the mechanic's here!
- Are you really a mechanic?
- Yes.
At last!
He's the kolkhoz president.
Welcome.
Masha, take him to see the motor boat.
Let's go.
Here you are.
- Nice!
- Nice?
Very nice!
- Right, very nice?
- Gorgeous!
Well, have a good look if you like it so much.
And what's there to look?
I can handle everything!
Motorcycles, cars...
- Planes too?
- Yes.
Liar!
And this?
My favorite necklace!
Go get it!
Jump in!
Go get it!
You little...!
He'll find it, you'll see.
He's a very good swimmer.
Don't worry.
Meanwhile, come with me to the office.
I have the orders.
Here they are!
This one's also empty!
- What?
- It's also empty.
No, the page number and the stamps are here. The letters disappeared!
Why don't you come with me meanwhile?
He'll find it.
Don't worry.
Alyosha... Hurry up!
Understand?
Thus their life began at the
"Lights of Communism" kolkhoz.
Losing your appetite over a girl you only saw once!
That's never happened to me!
Don't talk rubbish!
You're also crazy over her!
You like her too!
You're wrong.
I haven't lost my appetite.
You're the one who's smitten!
It's so obvious!
Listen, let's finish this up.
Wait here a second.
I'll be right back.
Bon appétit.
Every morning, with the blinding sun...
... with the tempest and the squall...
...when the cold north wind blows, or with the burning hot one...
...that comes from India...
...our friends set out to sea...
...with the fishermen from the island.
And one day...
"Through the bad weather in the fall...
"I roam through your places.

"But why do I dream about you, Nastya...
"...in blue-laced ribbons?
Alyosha didn't come on board.
- What do you mean?
- He's not...
I'll go look for him...
Says he's feeling ill.
Doesn't want to go out to sea.
No way is he feeling ill!
He's as healthy as an oak!
What's wrong with you?
The motor boat can't leave without you.
What's the matter?
Are you crying?
You can't start crying just now...
With all this heat!
What's the matter?
Does it hurt?
Should I call a doctor?
Should I?
It's very hot today...
...it won't be fun.
The fishermen will have to go out with the oar boat...
Alyosha! The motor boat can't leave without you!
Come on! Push!
All together!
Come on! Push!
At night, when the fishermen return from the sea...
...Alyosha returns to the city.
Excuse me.
We have to talk.
If I were to talk...
...to an iceberg about the great suffering...
...in my heart...
...even the iceberg would melt.
Why are you staring like that?
Don't stare at me that way.
Tell him not to look at me that way.
I want to talk to you about my friend...
...my best friend and comrade.
There he is!
A liar and a slacker.
Take a good look at him!
Alyosha, I begged you to come with me!
Instead, he...!
Was crying!
"Should I call a doctor?"
He: "No, it's useless."
We all...
...told him...
"Come, Alyosha, come!"
"Come!"
He didn't budge.
But then he went out.
And where did he go?!
To the city, to buy...
...a necklace.
Stupidity!
You're the only mechanic here!
Do you understand that?
No, you don't.
We couldn't set out on the motor boat.
And how many fish did we catch?
Five times less than usual.
How could you betray the kolkhoz?
And me!
Let me speak now.
You know something? I think you should marry Mashenka.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Me?
Alyosha... Tell me...
Are you serious?
I'm marrying her!
I'm marrying her!
It'll be a wonderful life for me!
You know... Me and Masha...
...will be like two bodies and one soul.
We will sail the sea together.
We'll have children...
...so many children...
... one, two, three, four, five.
Do you know how I'll celebrate my wedding?
Imagine. The sea, the seagulls...
...ten boats, one after the other...
...in each one, 22 musicians.
And you'll conduct the orchestra.
And this is what you'll play...
What a beautiful song!
Even the fish will stop and listen!
And we'll be sailing, sailing...
No, not sailing!
We'll be flying like seagulls.
So good!
No...
...I'm not marrying her.
I won't do it. For you.
Listen, let's be frank.
Enough foolishness.
You're not marrying Masha.
Prick up your ears!
I'll never allow you!
And you think I will allow you?
I'll never allow you to marry Mashenka!
And you think I will allow you to do it?
I'll duel over her like
I did in the war!
I'm so scared! And what's the shouting all about?
I'll teach you!
No, not this way!
What are you doing?
Let's ask her.
What a horrible day!
When the fishing season's over...
...Yusuf and Alyosha must return to the city.
There's a festive mood everywhere...
...except at the "Lights of
Communism" kolkhoz...
The sea has taken from us...
...a beloved comrade.
It took away our valiant brigade boss from us.
Mashenka is no longer...
...with us.
We lost a very dear friend.
Who died?
Tell me!
- You died.
- Yes, you.
To the number one female brigade boss! Mashenka!
Comrades! There are better stakhanovites among us than I!
Let me down!
Comrades! Please!
Alyosha! You're my friend, right?
Stop it! My head is spinning!
You're my friend, right?
Stop, comrades, please!
Thank you, comrades.
I have things to do now.
Alyosha is waiting for me.
Comrades... He has to try the suit on.
Maybe it's not his size.
Or he doesn't like the cut.
You're right. He's got to try it on.
Perhaps it won't fit.
It's not necessary!
It's my size!
Don't you listen when I speak to you?
Mashenka!
I want to tell you something.
Alyosha's waiting!
Can't you understand?
- He'll wait!
- Fits me fine! Stop torturing me!
No! Don't take my pants off!
Grandpa! They're taking away the woman I love. Do you understand?
But, what are you doing?
You've got to try it on.
My own happiness could be at risk!
Don't tickle me!
Enough! I tell you it fits fine!
Are you ready?
Alyoshka!
Don't be afraid.
I'm not going with her.
And I say you should go.
I can't now. Maybe some other day.
I'm going, then.
- Where are you going?
- Let me through!
Open!
- What's wrong?
-  Nothing, nothing!
All right!
Grandpa, I told you I didn't need to try it on.
Did you see what happened?
- I love you, Masha.
- What do you mean you love me?
That I love you. Just that.
What are you saying, Alyosha?
Darling, good, brave...
I don't love her.
What about her?
- I think she loves you.
- Liar!
Ask her yourself.
You don't love her at all or only a little bit?
Sit down.
We have to talk.
Yes, let's talk.
We'll go by the sea.
I wanted to explain everything to Alyosha, but he left.
Listen carefully and you'll understand.
Yes, I'll understand.
I love you, Mashenka.
I'm in love with somebody else.
Forgive me. He lied to me again.
- Who?
- Alyosha. He said that you loved me.
- Wait!
- Leave me alone!
Look.
Your brother? Nice looking guy.
He's not my brother.
He's my fiancee.
I promised I'd marry him.
He's far away now...
...in the Pacific.
So what? I love you so much.
I love you!
You have to understand! If you were called for military duty...
...and had to go far away, to the frontier...
...and your girl found someone else?
If she got tired of waiting for you...
...would you not suffer?
Think about it.
You're right.
But I love you a lot more.
Come a moment.
Goodbye, Lyuba.
Goodbye, Petka.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
There's fishing there too.
- And the motor boat?
- You take charge.
Goodbye, Alyosha.
Goodbye, Petka.
My regards to everyone at the kolkhoz!
I'll send the boat with the fishermen back tomorrow!
- Who set out to sea?
- Alyosha.
Where's he going?
He's going back home.
Alyosha's going back home!
Wait for me!
Mashenka, then...
I'm also going back home.
Give my regards to everyone at the kolkhoz!
With all my love.
- Don't tickle me!
- I'd forgotten...
She doesn't love either of us.
So what do I care!
She's not even pretty!
Why are you lying?
She's very pretty and nice.
And you love her, and so do I...
...it's just that she was already engaged.
A fiancee?
He's serving. They've sent him to the Pacific.
He left four years ago and she still thinks about him!
And what about us, if we had a fiancee...
...and they sent us to the Pacific?
Huh?
And if your girl were to find another man?
Your heart would suffer.
We'd be feeling bad.
Very bad.
Don't you agree?

MEN [SINGING] :
Rolling home, across the bounding blue
So, boys, give her class
And start rubbin' the brass
We're roll, rollin' home
Rolling home, come on, you lazy crew
Our whole course is set
To race over the wet
We're roll, rollin' home
Oh, can't you see
The light in your mother's eye
When that son of a gun, her roving son
Attacks a piece of pie?
And can't you taste
The lips of a certain miss
When her pride and her joy, her sailor boy
Smacks her with a kiss?
And can't you hear
Them cheering on the pier?
So quick, gobs, get on your jobs
And tell the engineer
We're rolling home
Our chores are nearly through
So step lively, pals
You'll soon be with the gals
We're roll, rollin' home
Just think of it, no more hardtack
No more beans
No more salt horse
And canned sardines
We've sailed all the seven seas
We've crossed every pond
Oh, from now on, it's duck soup
And a pure platinum blond
So no more labor, no more toil
No more Mother Sills
And no more castor oil
No more spending the night aboard
Instead of ashore
Will we ever do it again?
Quoth the raven:
"Nevermore"
I still could swear
When I think of the fair
Venetian maid I met
'Neath stars above
She taught me to love
At least to love spaghet'
But when I tried
To return to her side
And visit her on the Lido
The chief said no
And sent me below
To polish his pet torpedo
It's the worst of breaks
When the captain makes
You polish his pet torpedo
I hate romance
When I think of the chance
I missed at Honolula
I scanned the beach
And there was a peach
Enjoying a hula-hula
I could plainly see
She was flirting with me
And my heart was filled with hope
But how can I show
I'm a Romeo
Through a rusty periscope?
Nope, you can't even register hope
Through a rusty, dusty periscope
We're home, boys, we're home.
-Surface.
-Surface.

-WeII, do you think she'II recognize you?
-Gee, I hope so.
I haven't changed much. Except that
I've stopped biting my fingernaiIs.
She doesn't know you're coming home.
I know that. I'm gonna surprise her.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna rush up to her and say:
''Jenny, your man is home.''
Boy, I've waited four Iong years for this.

You know, I came from a smaII town myseIf, same as you.
Were you a dancer?
Yeah, a marathon dancer.
-That's where I met my husband.

Yes, we were partners in a marathon dance.
About the 28th day, business dropped off, so the management offered a cash prize...
...to the coupIe that'd get married during the contest.
WeII, gee, dancing with the same guy for 672 hours...
...naturaIIy, I thought I was in Iove.
But I was just tired.
Two days after we were married, he came home in a saiIor suit.
-A saiIor suit?
-Yeah, he joined the Navy.
That was four years ago and I haven't seen him since, the rat.
Mommy.

Come on, back you go. There.
This is my IittIe girI.

Oh, I get it. But after the parade's over, you Iike to waIk home aIone?
Oh, not aIways, but I do have a good sense of direction.
Oh, is that so?
WeII, how about you finding us a pIace to sit down together, hm?
AII right.
But, Jenny, ain't you gonna kiss me or something?
I'II shake hands with you.
Is that aII I get after four years?
-What did you expect?
-WeII, after aII I'm your husband.
Yeah, I don't know whether I Iike the idea of marriage.
You don't? Do you reaIize that marriage is a nationaI institution?
That 50 percent of the married peopIe are women?
Yeah, I'II think it over.
In the meantime, what do you say if we go home, huh, Jenny?
-Home?
-Yeah, where we Iiving now, baby?
Uh, weII, you see, Gunny, aII I got is a singIe room.
That's aII right, I've been sIeeping in a hammock for years.
AII right, I'II send you one.
I'm getting out of the service in two weeks.
I was reading they're going to strengthen the Navy.
-Hey, do you Iike actors?
-Better than saiIors.
-I'm gIad to hear you say that.
-Why?
Because I'm an actor.
BIush when you say that, mister.
I don't have to. I got taIents.
I've got an inventive mind.
Yeah, most saiIors have.
I'm inventing something right now.
When I get it working, I'm gonna seII it to the government for pIenty of dough.
What's that?
I'm crossing parrots with carrier pigeons.
-What for?
-What for?
So you can send verbaI messages.
I don't know. Maybe you have the wrong impression about guys who wear uniforms.
WeII, it's improving.
Oh, thanks.
-But you know any soIdiers?
-One.
-WeII, do you Iike him?
-Yes.
-WeII, do you know any other saiIors?
-Besides you? No.
WeII, do you Iike him?
Yes.
WeII, which do you Iike best, the soIdier or the saiIor?
Oh, I never make snap judgments.
TED:
WeII, no, no, what I mean is--
When you go to the footbaII game, who do you root for, Army or Navy?
-The Army.
-Why?
Because they aIways win.

WeII, wouId you Iike to be married to an Army man?
No.
-Think you couId be true to the Navy?
-What?
WeII, weII, you know what I mean.

-Aye, aye, sir.
-Why wasn't this deIivered?
-It was his wife's fauIt.
-His wife?
-Yeah.
-Do you know what this means?
-No, sir.
-Do you?
-No, I'm not quite sure, sir.
-And how about you?
-I give up.
WeII, there you are.
-You sent for me, sir?
-Yeah.
-Put Saks in the brig.
-Aye, aye, sir.
I'm Saks.
HoId everything.
My mistake, men.
Now, Iet that be a Iesson to you.
WeII, what do we have to have?
A dime. You got a dime, Nora?
-I think so.
-Now, you Iook right through there.
Yes, here's one.
There you are.
-Can you see?
-Yes.
Mommy, whose boats are they?
Oh, they're UncIe Sam's, darIing.
Our UncIe Sam, Mommy?
Yes, dear. On your father's side.
-Is Daddy with UncIe Sam now, Mommy?
-Yes, dear.
Mommy, what does UncIe Sam do for a Iiving?
-Oh, weII, um, he's a coIIector.
-Is he rich?
You sure have a job on your hands.
Look, you run aIong and pIay
Iike a good IittIe girI, huh?
There you go.
Phew, she's a probIem.
Just at the age where she wants to know everything.
She can't understand about that feIIa I'm married to.
WeII, why don't you teII her?
WeII, I can't tiII I know more about him myseIf.
Why not?
WeII, when you're picking a father for your chiId, you've gotta be awfuIIy carefuI.
When he proves he's worthy of SaIIy, then I'II teII him. But untiI then....
Gee, I hope I can keep him from finding out about her whiIe he's in port.
Jenny...
...is the fIeet Ieaving soon?
I don't know.
Why, does that worry you?
A IittIe.
I never thought this couId happen to me.
Gee, kid, I hope you haven't done something you'II be sorry for.
So do I.
WeII, what did you do?
I feII in Iove.
You reaIIy Iike that guy?
Gee, I'm crazy about him.
-When you gonna see him again?
-Just as soon as I can.
Maybe tonight.
MINISTER:
And now I pronounce you man and wife.
SALESMAN:
Yes, my friends...
...words Iike that mean perfect happiness to every newIy married coupIe.
So if any of you contempIate marriage...
...do so at once and carry your bride across the threshoId...
...of the Harmond Honeymoon Cottage...
...the ideaI home for newIyweds.
This is the Iast demonstration of the afternoon.
We invite your carefuI inspection.
Thank you.
How do you do? May I have the pIeasure of showing you our IittIe masterpiece?
-Okay.
-Pardon me, just for a moment.
I think we have a better pIace for this over here.
[BUTLER GASPS]
Oh, yes.
The unIimited resources of a mammoth department store...
...finaIIy soIved the vitaI probIem of how to furnish a honeymoon cottage.
CoIor harmony is the answer.
CooI bIues and quiet grays and greens are the main motives...
...whiIe the vioIent cerise has been used mereIy as an accent.
You wiII notice that everything is done to soothe the frayed nerves...
...of the scurrying businessman.
To offset the noise and confusion of our heIter-skeIter existence, yes.
Notice the theme in the window hangings.
They're white chiffon, a medium fuIIness.
With over drapes of green pIaid chintz and caught up with a gorgeous bow.
Breathtaking, isn't it?
Making a perfect symphony in coIor, yes.
Oh, you must notice the carefree abandon and careIess profusion of the peIargoniums.
Oh, yes, geraniums to you.
You know, fIowers are Iike IittIe chiIdren.
They refIect the happiness that shouId be in every home.
And music. Music.
The duIcet tones of the Harmond Honeymoon Grand.
Nothing quite so soothing as music, especiaIIy after a meaI.
EspeciaIIy a meaI prepared in one of our modern kitchens...
...eaten in one of our cozy dining rooms...
...and digested in one of our superIative Iiving rooms.
It brings on a feeIing of contentment and Ianguor...
...that Ieads us eventuaIIy to the bedroom.
Isn't it ravishing?
Oh, it's beautifuI.
-Where's the other bed?
-Other bed, sir?
We beIieve in the doubIe bed and a Iasting marriage.
Yeah, weII, I don't--
No man couId sIeep in that.
It's got an awning on it.
I beg your pardon, sir, but that's imported siIk voiIe with baII fringe.
WeII, I don't care what it is,
I couIdn't sIeep there.
-It's too short for me.
-Oh, no, sir. It's standard.
WouId you care to try it for size?
-No, no.
-Oh, don't be bashfuI, sir.
Many of our cIients insist on trying the bed,
I assure you.
-They do?
-Oh, yes, sir.
-WeII, hoId this, Nora.
NORA: Mm-hm.
-See what I mean?
-Yes, sir, a perfect fit.
Not very wide, either.
No, I assure you you're wrong.
I-- Oh, do you mind?
No, I'II show you, sir, reaIIy.
There you are, sir. PIenty of room.
Besides, it's awfuIIy comfortabIe, isn't it, sir?
AwfuIIy comfortabIe.
Try it, sir, won't you?

DINGBY:

Now, men, this afternoon, we are permitting visitors to come aboard...
...for a theatricaI pubIicity stunt.
We are to receive the briIIiant young musicaI-comedy star...
...Miss Lucy James.
[MEN CHATTERING]
Quiet, pIease.
AIthough this may seem rather unusuaI,
I, uh-- I see no objection to it.
MEN: No.
-Quiet, pIease.
As a gentIe reminder and a warning...
...and so this crew, of which I'm very proud...
...wiII appear at its very best...
...I want you aII, when this beautifuI young Iady comes aboard...

For your information
Miss James is a dream
MEN: Miss Lucy James

Just a combination of peaches and cream
MEN:
Ahoy
Ahoy, Miss Lucy James
And welcome to our submarine
Most glorified of dames
Good morning, miss
And how do you do?
And how's the captain
Not to mention the crew?
Well, as far as I know
The crew is all right
But the captain had a big night last night
Yes, yesterday
He drew his pay
So the captain had a big night last night
But don't be cross
With the dear old boss
'Cause he had
A very, very big night last night
Now, since you asked me about my crew
It gives me pleasure
To present them to you
Boys, meet Miss--
Oh, I'm so awful at names
Why, the name of the lady
Is Lucy James
Lucy James, got another papa
You got another papa
But he's bad at names
'Cause he had a very, very big night
Miss James
Now, since we all have met
And formalities are through
May I present
My heaven-sent
-Cheeky-Peeky-Poo?
MEN: Who?
Love me, love my Pekingese
Spite of your antipathies
If you want to cultivate me
Gotta love Cheeky
MEN:
Howdy, little Cheeky
Cheeky, he's my chaperon
Never lets me be alone
So when you invite me to tea
Gotta have Cheeky
MEN:
Nasty little Cheeky
Cheeky barks, Cheeky bites
Cheeky goes in for neighborhood fights
Cheeky, like all gentlemen
Is a tease
MEN:
Cheeky, please
But be warned before you start
If you want to win my heart
Don't bother to buy me big rings
Or other extravagant things
Get something chic for Cheeky
My Pekingese
MEN:
We love you, Cheeky
You squeaky little Pekingese
Oh, captain, what a IoveIy submarine.
Oh, yes, yes.
It's the pride of the Navy.
TeII me, how Iong can your submarine stay under water?
WeII, now, it aII depends.
Once, we submerged with the hatches open and we didn't come up for two weeks.
-ReaIIy?
-PositiveIy.
[ALL LAUGH]
Quiet, pIease.
Wait a minute, boys.
How do you do, Captain Dingby?
How do you do?
Oh, perhaps you don't remember me.
I'm James McKay, personaI representative for Miss Lucy James.
Uh, we had Iunch together yesterday.
Oh, yes, yes. How do you do, Mr. McKay?
I've been expecting you.
Fine. WouId you mind posing for a picture with Miss James?
Not at aII, I shouId be deIighted.
That is, if Miss James doesn't object.
-Oh, captain, I'd be thriIIed.
-Oh, so shouId I.
-Fine, fine, now you step right over here?
-With pIeasure.
McKAY: AII right, boys, excuse me, just a minute. Fine.
Now, captain, Miss James, come right over here by the raiIing. Fine.
-Now, captain, take Miss James by the arm.
-PIeasure.
That's it. Fine. Now, hoId it. That's it.
-You aII set boys?
PHOTOGRAPHERS: Yep.
-Ready?
-Just a moment.
Captain, wouIdn't you Iike to hoId my IittIe Cheeky for the picture?
Oh, deIighted.
McKAY:
SmiIe now, captain.
A IittIe more.
That's fine now. HoId. AII right.
Cheeky. Someone save my Cheeky.
Dog overboard.
Everybody get ready to submerge.
Morning.
Look at that.
Look at that.
What a break.
''U.S. saiIor rescues actress' Pekingese.''
What an awfuI picture of me.
What are you taIking about?
You can't buy pubIicity Iike that.
You drop your pooch overboard, the whoIe U.S. Navy dives in after it.
HeadIines in every newspaper in the country. What a break.
-Wait a minute. That gives me an idea.
-What?
Cook up a romance between you and that saiIor.
Too bad he isn't an officer.
No, no, better this way, beIieve me.
More heart interest.
PubIic wiII go for it. They Iike the idea of you faIIing for an ordinary gob.
-CindereIIa angIe.
McKAY: ExactIy.
Maybe I'II Iike it, Mac.
WeII, that's up to you.
No fear. It's ridicuIous.
Lucy, I'II teII you what you do.
Be seen with him a few times.
PubIic pIaces, night cIubs, cabarets.
That'II start the gossip coIumns.
I'II pick it up there.
-And deny it?
-Sure.
That'II keep your name in the front page for months.
-What's the name of that boy again?
-Barker, Ted Barker. And don't forget it.
Wish I couId think of some way to get that saiIor shore Ieave.
-I can arrange that.
-You can? How?
Why, the captain's dying to do me a favor.
Fine. ''Famous actress in Iove with gob.''
What an angIe. The pubIic wiII eat it up.
-It's kind of a dirty trick.
McKAY: Yes, but a good one.
I guess you're pretty proud of yourseIf tonight, aren't you?
WeII, who wouIdn't be sitting here with you.
Thanks. But I meant about having your picture in the paper with Lucy James.
Oh, oh, weII, it's just a IittIe....
I'm awfuIIy gIad you saved her dog.
Oh, you are, huh?
TeII me about her.
Is she nice?
Yeah, weII, I guess so.
You guess so?
WeII, didn't she thank you?
Oh, sure. Yeah.
Maybe someday you can do as much for me.
What do you mean?
Oh, when I'm a star.
You're reaIIy going on the stage, huh?
WeII, I've aIways wanted to.
I'm Iooking every day.
You know, it's funny, but once I get started...
...think I've got a pretty fair chance of making good.
Of course you're gonna make good.
You're gonna have one big booster.
I'II be down in the front row opening night.
You'II be many miIes from here my opening night.
Oh, no. My time's up in three weeks.
I'II be out of the Navy after that.
WeII, what are your pIans then?
Are you Ieaving New York?
No, I kind of think I'II stick around now.
I'm gIad, Ted.
-Nora.
-Yes?
WeII, you reaIIy wanna go on the stage?
WeII, I hope to.
WeII...
...success and aII that, do you think that'II change you?
Of course not.
Why do you ask?
Oh, I don't know.
It just seems that that kind of success aIways does something to peopIe.
-At Ieast, I've noticed it.
-Just recentIy?
Oh, Nora, the difference between you and girIs that--
That amount to something?
I wish you knew what you amounted to with me.
TeII me.
[SINGING] I know too well
That I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you'll hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For you'd be
So easy to love
So easy to idolize, all others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep any home fire
Burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be
Oh-so easy
To love
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep any home fire
Burning for
Oh, how we'd bloom, how we'd thrive
In a cottage for two
Or even three, four or five
So try to see
Your future with me
'Cause they'd be
Oh-so easy

[MUSIC RESUMES]
[MOUTHS]
Let's go.
TED [MOUTHS] :
Well, look at that.
[THUD]
[TED WHISTLES]
TED:
Hey, Gunny, come here.
-WeII, we're going ashore.
-What, so soon?
Yeah, the captain's sending the report again.
He sure is an optimist.
Ted wants me to go to LoneIy Hearts CIub for him.
Anything you want to teII your wife?
-You gonna see my wife?
MUSH: I wasn't, but I wiII.
Hey, why don't you go yourseIf.
Listen, I gotta report to Lucy James at the CIub ContinentaI.
-But it's the captain's orders.
-At the CIub ContinentaI?
-Yeah.
-What's the Navy coming to, anyway?
I don't know, but if this gets around town, it'II be over-enIisted.
WeII, anybody that wants it can have my share of the Navy.
Look, uh, Gunny...
-...how are you fixed for dough?
-Pretty good.
Yeah, I was wondering if you couId Iend me 1 0 bucks.
-I'm fIat broke and I'm--
-AII right, here.
Oh, thanks.
You sure you won't need this?
-Not whiIe he's in there.
-Oh, that's right too. So Iong, Gunny.
-Hey, Mush, wiII you do me a favor?
-What?
-When you see my wife, kiss her for me?
-A pIeasure.
-HeIIo, foIks.
JENNY: HeIIo, Mush.
-How are you?
-Okay.
-Got a message for you from your husband.
-What is it?
Any answer?
Yeah.
Where is Gunny?
-In the brig.
-Something serious, I hope.
-I got a message for you too.
-From Ted?
He came ashore with me...
...but he's on speciaI detaiI.
-Captain's orders.
-Oh.
But he wants to see you when he's through.
Where?
In CentraI Park.
CentraI Park's awfuI big, saiIor.
He said he'd meet you at the usuaI pIace.
Honest? What time?
Ten o'cIock sharp.
[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Let's dance, shaII we?
WeII, I don't know, I'd--
It's kind of Iate. I--
Don't you think we'd better go?
AII right, if you want to.
Oh, waiter.
-Yes, sir?
-Check, pIease.
Yes, sir.
It's been a IoveIy evening.
You know, I'm beginning to change my mind about saiIors.
WeII, thanks.
I'm sorry, sir, but your check is 1 1 .80.
Yeah, it's 1 1 .80.
WeII, my mistake.
WeII, I'm a IittIe shy.
That's what I Iike about you.
[JENNY HUMMING]
Nora.
Nora.
Oh, what's the matter?
Lucy James, huh?
So that's it.
Hmm. That dame's first name shouId have been Jesse.
I can't understand Ted doing this.
Oh, honey, they're aII aIike.
If you get a good one, it's a Iong shot.
If you don't, it's a consensus of opinion.
It's aII very funny.
Just yesterday
I tried out for Lucy James' show.
WeII, what happened? TeII me.
Nothing, except I registered for the chorus...
...and to be her understudy.
Oh, gee, I hope they caII you.
Be a good way to get even with these nibs.
You mean Daddy, Mommy?
JENNY:
No, darIing.
WeII, you aIways caII Daddy nibs.
You see how it is?
It's impossibIe to speak before her.
-You finished with your breakfast?
-Yes.
You may Ieave the tabIe.
I wanna taIk to Nora.
Oh, go ahead, Mommy, I won't Iisten.
-O-day ou-yay eak-spay ig-pay Atin-Iay?
-Es-yay.
Ood-gay. I ought-way o-tay isit-vay the ubmarine-say ithout-way AIIy-say.
Oh, you do, do you? I'd Iike to see you visit the submarine without me.
Now, how do you Iike that?
SaIIy, you're gonna drive me to stop drinking.
Now, you gotta go. Come on.
-Am-scray.
-Oy vey.
Are you reaIIy going to board the submarine?
-CertainIy, tomorrow.
-But why?
WeII, I owe it to Gunny whiIe he's in the brig.
And besides, whiIe he's in the brig,
I'm safe.
WeII, so is SaIIy. He'II never see her.
That's right, we'II aII go.
Not me.
I don't want any part of Ted Barker.
-Aunt Nora.
-Yes, dear?
You're wanted on the phone.
-Who wants me?
-I didn't ask.
It's the first time you minded your own business.
Excuse me.
-HeIIo?
-Nora.
Oh.
DarIing, I want to expIain about Iast night.
See--
WeII, when I got to the park, I--
Nora? Nora?
Atkins and McKay. Who's caIIing?
I'm sorry, Mr. McKay can't be disturbed, he's taIking to himseIf.
I mean he's in conference.
AIrighty, I'II teII him you caIIed.
Atkins and McKay. Who's caIIing?
Oh, heIIo, OpaI.
WeII, say, ain't you working today?
Your boss is gone and everybody took the day off?
WeII, ain't that Iife. When the cat's away, the mice act Iike rats.
Oh, say, guess who I seen at CIub ContinentaI Iast night.
Lucy James with that saiIor she met through a Pekingese.
BeIieve me, he's a sea-going thriII if I ever seen one. What's he Iike?
WeII, taII, sort of the answer to a maiden's prayer on stiIts.
Honest, he must be 6'4'' and that's just two inches shorter than a totem poIe.
Oh, but he's got a smiIe
Iike concentrated vodka.
Vodka. Oh, it's a Japanese drink made out of panther bIood, I think.
What's Lucy James Iike?
WeII, she's taII and bIond, with a Iimousine body.
AII I can say and stiII be a Iady...
...is I can't see what she's got that I ain't, outside of a Pekingese.
Why, haIf the Navy dives in the water after her pooch.
I couId be drowning with a Saint Bernard and get nothing better than water wings.
Oh, I never seen such Iuck.
I guess it's kismet.
I said, kismet, OpaI.
That's Latin for ''spinach.''
WeII, of course, I speak Latin:
sic transit gloria mundi.
Don't I sound sweII?
What does that mean?
It's Latin for ''he opened the door and in fIew a dead duck.''
At Ieast, that's what my boyfriend said it meant.
CouId I see Mr. McKay, pIease?
Mr. McKay ain't in.
He's out.
WeII, are you sure he's out?
He went out 1 5 minutes ago, won't be back for haIf an hour.
Where was I at, OpaI?
Look, he asked me to come in here.
-I don't know--
-Oh, it's you, Mr. Barker.
Oh, weII, just a moment pIease and I'II ring him for you.
You're a saiIor, ain't you, Mr. Barker?
I got saItwater in my veins.
My uncIe used to work on a tugboat.
It's a smaII worId, ain't it?
Mr. McKay, the dogcatcher is here.
I mean Mr. Barker.
AIrighty. He says you can go right in,
Mr. Barker.
Thanks very much.
HeIIo. How are you?
-WeII, I'm gIad to see you.
-Hi, Mr. McKay.
-Sit down.
-Thanks very much.
Say, by the way, I've just been reading about you in Hector's coIumn.
Boy, you're a something.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's Lucy James.
WeII, it's kind of siIIy, isn't it?
SiIIy? No, it's great.
I taIked to Miss James over the teIephone a IittIe whiIe ago. Boy, she Ioves it.
-It's not so hot, though.
-Why?
-WeII, I just don't Iike being made a fooI of.
-You're not.
You shouId have heard what she said a few minutes ago.
-What, about me?
-Sure.
And she's not the type that faIIs easiIy.
-What do you mean, she kind of Iikes me?
-Kind of Iikes you? She's nuts about you.
Oh, no. WeII, that's no good, though.
Why?
-WeII, you see, I'm not nuts about her.
-Oh, she'II grow on you.
-WeII, I don't want her to grow on me.
-Barker, you've been in the Navy too Iong.
Have a cigar.
Oh, thanks.
Uh, Mr. McKay, I don't want to change the subject or anything...
...but I was wondering if you couId do me a favor?
What?
When does Miss James' new show go into rehearsaI?
-Oh, next week.
-Next week, huh?
CouId you use the worId's greatest dancer?
My boy, Miss Lucy James is the worId's greatest dancer.
No, I don't think so.
No, the girI I'm taIking about just wants a chance.
Anything. You can put her in the chorus.
I'd Iove to do you a favor, but I can get the chorus girIs I want for a dime a dozen.
You can't get this girI for a dime a dozen.
Listen, she is the most marv--
You wait tiII you see this girI.
Ted, I'II teII you what you do.
Have her phone me for an appointment.
WeII, oh, no, I couIdn't do that.
You see, you'II have to phone her.
-What, can't she remember numbers?
-I don't want her to know...
...that I came here and asked you to give her a break, you see?
I understand.
Where can I get in touch with her?
Oh, weII, here, you can caII her right at this number.
-There, right there.
-Fine.
You won't teII her that I came in, you know--
No, certainIy not.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
I beg your pardon, sir.
You'II frighten the fish.
-Any Iuck, captain?
-Say, I Iost the biggest fish you ever saw.
-Just now?
-No, when we were in San Francisco.
You sure do a Iot of fishing, don't you?
Yes. I expect to run for president someday.
MUSH:
You better hurry up.
-What are you doing?
-That message to Rear AdmiraI Stubbins.
-What about it?
-I couIdn't find BrookIyn.
You couIdn't find BrookIyn?
I was in Yonkers aII day before I found out it was Yonkers.
-Doing what?
-Looking for the BrookIyn Navy Yard.
There must be a man in my crew who knows where BrookIyn is.
-Saks knows.
-Saks? How does he know?
He was born there.
At Ieast, Iooks Iike he was born there.
-He does? Where is Saks?
-In the brig.
-What's he doing in the brig?
-Three days, sir.
Who put Saks in the brig?
Why, you did.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Got a match?
I feeI uncomfortabIe about going aboard, Jenny.
I hope I don't meet Ted.
Listen, baby, when a horse throws you, you gotta get right back up and ride him.
I won't even Iook at him.
That's wrong. Act Iike nothing happened.
If you want a Iesson in seIf-controI, just watch me with Gunny.
TED:
Attention.
Where's Saks?
I'm Saks. Captain, you're aIways getting us two mixed up.
Are you two men twins?
I don't know about him, but I'm not.
I want this deIivered to Rear AdmiraI Stubbins...
-...at the Navy Yard.
-Yes, sir.
-You were born in BrookIyn.
-Yes, sir.
-What part?
-AII of me.
-DeIiver that message at once.
-Aye, aye, sir.
MAN:
Listen up.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING]
Are you the guide?
No, madame, I am the captain.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I beg your pardon.
WeII, couId I pIease visit the brig?
There's a man I'd Iike to see in it.
I mean there's a man in it I'd Iike to see.
I'm sorry, madame, but visitors are not aIIowed beIow deck.
-Oh!
-Oh, Jenny, that's a shame.
Oh, weII, we'd Iove to Iook around.
CouId we go visit the crow's nest?
Under no condition, madame.
This is the mating season.
Oh, weII, Iet's go Iook anyway. Come on.
-Did you see what I saw?
-What?
Gunny. He's not in the brig.
I can't Iet him see SaIIy.
If he finds out he's her father...
...his chest wiII be bigger than his head.
Jenny.
-Jenny.
-What are you doing here?
-Why, I work here.
-Yeah, but I thought you were in the brig.
-Jenny, ain't you gIad to see me?
-WeII, yes and no.
Gee, now we're getting somepIace.
WeII, heIIo.
WeII, I'm gIad to see you again, Nora.
I'm awfuI sorry about what happened.
I can expIain if you give me a chance.
I'm reaIIy not interested.
-HeIIo there.
-HeIIo.
Say, who's IittIe girI are you?
Mommy's girI.
Yeah?
What do you mean, ''yeah''?
How oId are you, IittIe girI?
Three and a haIf.
Three and a haIf?
Run aIong, SaIIy, and pIay.
That's a good girI.
-Say, who's her mother?
-I am.
What?
Why, certainIy it's her baby.
Isn't it, Nora?
AbsoIuteIy.
-Oh, Nora. Don't teII me you're married.
-WeII, I wouIdn't dare teII you I wasn't.
Yeah. No, you wouIdn't, wouId you?
Oh, SaIIy.
Oh, she's aIways getting into troubIe.
Just Iike her father.
That's right.
Gee, I wish that was my kid.
-Gosh, I envy her father.
-Oh, you needn't. He's a saiIor too.
Oh, the poor kid.
Oh, don't worry about us.
We'II get aIong aII right.
Of course, taking care of a chiId nowadays costs money.
-That's why I was so anxious to find work.
-WeII, I hope you get it, Nora.
I've got it.
-What, aIready?
-Mr. McKay notified me yesterday.
I'm to be Miss James' understudy.
What, he toId you that?
Yes, that's what I tried out for a few days ago and I got the job.
-WeII--
-You'II be there opening night, of course.
-Sure.
-In the front row.
Yeah.
Supposing I shouId kiss you.
I'd Iike it.
-That's what I'm afraid of.
-Why?
WeII, I wanna find out first if I Iike it.
Then if I Iike it, I'II Iet you kiss me.
Gee, I hope you Iike it, Jenny.
Yeah, weII after four years,
I think it's time I found out.
HoId stiII.
How was it?
I didn't Iike it.
WeII, I Iiked it.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING]
-HeIIo, Jen.
-Oh, heIIo, honey.
I ordered for you.
Thanks.
How are rehearsaIs going?
Oh, aII right, I guess.
OnIy I'm not getting the kick out of it
I thought I wouId.
Why not?
Ted hasn't been near the theater.
Oh, weII, did you expect to see him around?
WeII, yes, I did, but I guess I was wrong about him.
You know, I can't figure him out.
He hasn't seen Lucy James since we started rehearsing.
JENNY: He hasn't?
-Not once.
Then, why haven't you heard from him?
Maybe because he thinks I'm married.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Gee, I'm the one that spoiIed everything for you.
-Oh, you weren't to bIame, Jenny.
-Oh, yes, I was too.
And if I'd known then what I know now, it never wouId have happened.
You know, Nora,
I've been thinking things over.
And when Gunny gets out of the Navy, we're gonna settIe down, make a go of it.
You are? Oh, I'm so gIad.
-What did Gunny say when you toId him?
-I haven't toId him yet.
WeII, how did you decide?
WeII, I kissed him and I didn't think I Iiked it, but--
But you did.
Yeah. I did.
BeIieve me, without pubIicity you can wrap the show up.
RehearsaIs are fine.
What are you kicking about?
I'd rather pIay safe and keep the pubIic
Lucy James conscious.
But pIease, Mac, not about my private Iife.
Nothing spreads Iike gossip.
It's the best kind of baIIyhoo as Iong as you keep it cIean.
WeII, I didn't mind at first, but now it's different.
Are you on the IeveI?
Are you serious this time?
Yeah, just as you were a few months ago with Tommy Morgan.
HonestIy, Mac, I swear this is different.
-Yeah, I've heard that before too.
-Oh, forget it.
-This Barker is out of the Navy, isn't he?
-Yes.
If he's crazy about you, why hasn't he been around?
-Because he resents the whoIe thing.
-Oh, he does. WeII, that's too bad.
He phoned and wanted to see me.
That is, if it couId be arranged privateIy.
And I asked him to come here.
-Tonight?
-Any minute now.
''Cupid's Boomerang.
Actress to Wed Ex-saiIor.''
You're writing the finish first.
The man hasn't asked me yet.
But if he does and I shouId marry him, not a word in the papers about it.
What's the use if you don't get any pubIicity?
Oh, Mac, you're hopeIess.
AII right, go ahead and marry him.
Let's arrange for a divorce before the show opens.
-We need the pubIicity.
-There'II be no pubIicity.
AII right, go ahead.
Tie my hands, ruin me.
Oh.
Oh, the maid toId me to come right in.
Oh, heIIo, Ted. Come on in.
-Nice to see you.
-HeIIo, how are you?
McKAY: WeII, heIIo, Barker.
-HeIIo. GIad to see you.
GIad to see you.
Look, I hope I'm not interrupting.
Oh, no, no. Mr. McKay was just Ieaving, weren't you, Mac?
Yeah, I'm practicaIIy gone.
WeII, I'II see you at rehearsaI in the morning. Night.
-Night.
-Night.
-ShaII we go out on the terrace, Ted?
-Okay.
Anita, if anyone shouId caII,
I'm not at home. Remember that.
-Yes, Miss James.
-Thank you.
Here's to you, Ted.
-Happy days.
-SkoaI.
Uh, why was Mr. McKay here tonight?
I sent for him to put a stop to that cheap pubIicity we were getting.
Oh, weII, thanks.
That's the reason I came up here to taIk to you tonight.
I toId him if there was one more word about us...
...I wouIdn't go on opening night.
WeII, are you serious?
I've never been more serious in my Iife.
WeII, what'II happen to the show opening night?
My understudy wouId go on.
Oh, she wiII, wiII she?
She'd have to.
WeII...
...do you think your understudy can pIay your part?
Oh, I wouIdn't know about that.
TeII me, Ted, are you interested in the theater?
Oh, yes. WeII, more or Iess.
But never been active.
Mmm. WeII, I was in a Iot of shows at coIIege.
I, uh-- I pIayed the Ieading Iady.
Ted, I'm awfuIIy gIad you came here tonight. Are you?
Yes.
I've been wondering about you.
[SINGING]
I've got you
Under my skin
I've got you
Deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're really a part of me
I've got you
Under my skin
I tried so
Not to give in
I said to myself
This affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist
When, darling, I know so well
I've got you
Under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near in spite
Of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear
Don't you know, little fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop
Before I begin
'Cause I've got you
Under my skin
Men, your enIistment is up.
Today you Ieave the service.
It grieves me to see you go.
But it warms the cockIes of my heart...
...to know that the members of my crew have behaved Iike one big happy famiIy.
Men, aIIow me to wish you Iuck.
-What's this?
-The message to Rear AdmiraI Stubbins.
-Why hasn't this deIivered?
-CouIdn't find the rear admiraI.
-Saks, if you--
-Captain--
Don't teII me, don't teII me. I know.
-You're Saks and he's Tracy.
-That's right.
If you weren't getting out,
I'd put you in the brig.
-You know what this means?
-No.
-Do you?
-No, sir.
WeII, there you are.
There must be some way of getting this to Rear AdmiraI Stubbins.
Put it in a bottIe and throw it overboard.
It'II take too Iong to reach him.
I've forgotten what's in there.
-Open it and read it to me.
-Yes, sir.
''Dear admiraI, I have two box seats...
...for the opening of Lucy James musicaI comedy on Wednesday night.
Park your battIeship in the harbor.
Join me and we'II make a night of it.
Very sincereIy yours,
PercivaI Dingby.''
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[SINGING]
You'd be
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize, all others above
You'd be so worth the yearning for
And, honey, you'd be so swell
To keep every little home fire burning for
We'd, we'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be
Oh-so easy to love
[NORA HUMMING]
So try to see
Your future
With me
'Cause you'd be
Oh-so easy to love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So easy to love
[AUDIENCE CLAPPING]
He's pretty good. Where'd you find him?
The Navy didn't take up his option.
I got him cheap.
There's Iots of taIent in the Navy.
You ought to know.
WeII, the show Iooks great.
I have a feeIing in my bones we're gonna have a hit. If you--
If you're gonna start on Ted Barker, save your breath.
-I know the speech by heart.
-Oh, Lucy, use your head.
You know how vaIuabIe pubIicity is to a show before it opens.
Let me run a story about you and Ted in the papers--
No. PositiveIy no.
One more word in the newspapers and I don't go on opening night.
Now, you remember that, Mac.
WeII, how's it feeI to be out of the Navy?
-I don't know. I'm Ionesome.
-So am I.
-Say, have you seen Nora?
TED: No.
WeII, she's married.
I guess that Iets me out.
-Why, have you seen Jenny?
GUNNY: No. It's no use.
I don't know, Ted.
Maybe I'm just a man's man.
I'm getting disgusted with married Iife.
Is this what I'm supposed to wear in the opening?
But that's the finest creation we ever made.
I don't Iike it.
-But you okayed the sketches--
-I won't wear it. Make me something eIse.
-We haven't time, you have to wear it.
-I don't have to do anything.
-Hey.
-PIease, Miss James.
Where's that arrangement for me?
-Here it is, Miss James.
-What are you waiting for? PIay it.
[PIANO MUSIC BEGINS]
Stop it. Stop it.
I couIdn't dance to that. Nobody couId.
-Are you trying to ruin me?
-That's a sweII number.
-The more you hear it, the more you Iike it.
-It's awfuI.
If that's the best you couId do,
I won't even bother to rehearse.
WeII, I may be crazy, but I think it's a great number.
Nora. Come here.
-Did you hear that number?
-Yes, sir.
Can you dance to it?
WeII, I think so.
Go ahead and try it.
But, Mr. McKay, are you sure Miss James won't mind?
Go ahead and try it. Let's have it.
AII right.
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
[TAPPING]
LUC Y:
Stop it.
[MUSIC STOPS]
Just what do you think you're doing, making a fooI out of me?
-But I didn't mean--
-I don't care what you meant.
When I want 5- and 1 0-cent store dames doing my numbers, I'II Iet you know.
Are you trying to show me up in front of the whoIe company?
We'II see about that.
Fire her this minute, do you hear me?
-CaIm down.
-Get rid of her.
-She's your understudy.
-I don't need one.
I've got a fortune in this show.
-You can't teII me how to run my company.
-I can't, can't I?
WeII, take your choice.
Either she goes or I go.
I'm sorry, Nora...
...but I'II have to Iet you go.
PIease, Mr. McKay.
It wasn't my fauIt, reaIIy.
I know.
And the tough part of it is there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm sorry.
-WeII, heIIo, Jenny.
-HeIIo, Ted.
WeII, weII.
Ted, something terribIe has happened.
-What is it? Something happen to Nora?
-WeII, yes.
WeII, what is it?
WeII, I might as weII start at the beginning.
In the first pIace, Nora isn't married.
She isn't married?
No, she just said that to heIp me and beside that, she Ioves you.
She Ioves--?
WeII, what about that baby?
Oh, that's my baby and I'm gonna teII
Gunny just as soon as I see him.
-Oh, Gunny's the father?
-Yeah. Ain't nature wonderfuI?
WeII, what about Nora?
-Nora was fired today.
-Fired?
Lucy James made Mr. McKay fire her.
-Oh, she did, huh?
-Yeah.
Just kicked her out of the show, huh?
-Isn't that a dirty trick?
-WeII, how do you Iike that?
-Can you keep a secret?
-I'II try.
I'm gonna get Nora a better job.
Come on.
[PHONE RINGING]
HeIIo.
It's Mr. McKay.
HeIIo, Mac.

I've got a surprise for you.
Yeah, what is it?

Dismissed.
Boys.
Remember this, when Mr. Butterbass calls you to attention...
...I want to see every eyelid snap.
- Yes, sir.
Take your posts.
- Good morning, young ladies.
- Good morning, Mr. Hammerstein.
About face.
That is one thing
I will not tolerate in this hotel.
Dismissed.
And now, the band.
Right over here.
Good morning, Popeye.
How dare you speak when I have not asked you a question.
Now then, I have had several complaints about all of you.
That's funny.
No one has complained me.
Silence.
I will dismiss, discharge and disqualify...
...any employee who gets familiar with the guests.
But what happens if the guests get familiar with us?
- Quiet.
- Please.
I have been imported from Switzerland by the management of this hotel...
...to enforce discipline...
...and I will.
Where is the boss of this outfit?
Where is that loafer, Roger Bond, and his assistant loafer, Fred Ayres?
Coming right down.
Yeah.
- How do you feel, boy?
- Yeah.
Well, this is all in one piece.
That's more than we'll be if we don't get to that hotel in 29 seconds.
Come on, kid, will you?
Well, why don't he put a kitchenette and bath in here?
- Crazy, I guess.
- Crazy nothing. That guy writes songs.
Well, that's screwy, ain't it?
It's so screwy that he can buy a plane just like this.
No touch.
In just 10 seconds they go on the air.
If those two loafers aren't here
I'm going to fire them.
One, to make ready...
...two, to go...
Five, six, pick up sticks.
Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Roger Bond and his Yankee Clippers from the Date Grove of the Hotel Hibiscus...
...at Miami, Florida.
We offer for your pleasure as our first selection...
..."Music Makes Me," with a complete vocalization...
...by that charming, bubbling, effervescent little lady...
...Miss Honey Hale. Contact.
In me you see a sinner
And dancing is my crime
It seems a sin I've got to give in
To syncopated time
It makes me lose my dignity
It makes me lose my poise
Some folks call it music
My folks call it noise
I like music, old and new
But music makes me do the things
I never should do
Oh, I like music, sweet and blue
But music makes me do the things
I never should do
My self-control was something to brag about
Now it's a gag about town
The things I do are never forgiven
And just when I'm living them down
I hear music, then I'm through
'Cause music makes me do the things
I never should do
I like music
I like it old
I like it new
But it makes me do the things
I never should do
I like music
I like it sweet
I like it blue
But it makes me do the things
I never should do
My self-control was something to brag about
Now it's a gag about town
The things I do are never forgiven
And just when I'm living them down
I hear music, then I'm through
'Cause music makes me do the things
I never should do
When I hear music
Hey, Rog.
Go easy, will you?
Don't bite the job that feeds you.
Just what am I doing?
That Swiss bell ringer is on the level about not fooling with the cash customers.
Hold your hats, boys.
Here we go again.
The Latin type.
Belinha, my head aches so badly.
I think I will go and eat an aspirin.
You will excuse me.
Do not rise.
- Titia, shall I go with you?
- No, stay.
But while I am gone please do not introduce to Belinha...
...too many American customs.
Rog.
Hey, Rog.
The last time you had that look...
...all we had to live on for two weeks was a can of prepared dog food.
His father owns the sunny side of Wall Street.
And writes the preferred list.
They say if he'd only give up airplanes, songwriting and leading orchestras...
...that he could name his own figure.
He could name mine any time.
You know, if a Brazilian girl was half as interested in him as you are...
...and had half your freedom...
...she'd...
- She'd what?
- She'd get him over here, just for you.
- Oh, yeah?
You mean, she'd try?
Watch me.
Oh, Rog.
What is he doing now?
He just fell into the trombone.
You'd better have a heart, Belinha.
You'll break up the whole orchestra.
Whenever a Brazilian girl starts something, she must finish it.
- Yes, madam?
- A pencil.
Yes.
Thank you.
Remember the dog food.
And it was the kind they made out of fish.
Mr. Bond?
For you, sir.
From the lady, sir. The dark one.
After all, look at her.
What have I got to lose?
Only 20 jobs.
Since when is dancing a familiarity?
Perhaps it's a formal resignation.
She's smiling at him.
What have these South Americans got below the equator that we haven't?
- Excuse me, sir...
- Tell Senhora De Rezende...
...that her niece is dancing with the orchestra leader.
Hurry, please.
Oh, waiter, tell De Rezende that Belinha is dancing with a musician.
- Yes, sir.
- Go on. Make it snappy.
Here, boy, tell Rezende the kid is dancing with the drummer.
Okay, pop.
Tell the old sea lion that baby is hoofing with a piccolo player.
- Oh, madam. Oh, madam.
- Yes?
Mademoiselle is going in a big way for a gigolo.
Belinha? A gigolo?
My niece.
Is it possible?
The flower of the womanhood of the
Alves Lima De Castro Pimenta De Rezende.
Isn't it terrible?
Titia.
- This is my aunt.
- Oh, how do you do?
My niece thanks you for your politeness, young man.
She will not require any more of your services this afternoon.
Is the usual rate higher?
I am not familiar with such matters.
No, no. It's quite all right.
It's very generous.
I think. Oh, just a moment.
- Thank you, sir.
- With my compliments.
The quaint young man has given me an orchid.
In my country they grow like weeds, you know.
Come, Belinha.
Senhora, would your niece prefer a geranium? Or a begonia, perhaps?
Pull in your apples, boys.
Here comes William Tell.
Well, Roger's done it again.
Yeah, and just as I was getting caught up with my alimony too.
That Sir Galahad has gotten us kicked out of every job from Maine to Miami.
I wonder where we go from here.
Heads we go north, and tails we go south.
And the quarter goes to the bellhop.
- Hey, that's my case two bits.
- Here comes Fred.
Boys, boys and girls, and you too, Honey.
Have I got a surprise for you?
- It couldn't be money.
- Well, what is it?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is really good news.
Rog has outdone himself.
I'll bet he's broken both legs running after two women at the same time.
Nothing of the kind.
He's landed us a job in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro.
The Hotel Atlantico.
- We'll be flying down any morning now.
- And swimming back in the afternoon.
I'm taking my water wings.
Will one of you boys pass out these salary checks?
- Gladly.
- I said one of you.
Well, I can pass them out.
Here, Eddie, you do it.
Get in line, you guys.
Oh, I beg your par...
- Good morning.
- Mr. Bond, I'm so sorry.
- I had no idea I was making trouble.
- Think nothing of it.
I'm just accepting a new engagement, and not to dance either.
Please don't be angry with me.
I'm sorry.
I must send this.
You see, we missed the plane to Rio de Janeiro...
...on account of Titia's headache.
- Did you say Rio de Janeiro?
- Yes.
Father is not so well and wants me there right away.
What a strange coincidence.
It happens...
It just so happens that I have a friend who's flying his own plane down south.
How far is he going?
Just as far as you want him to.
If he could fly me to Port-au-Prince, I could still catch this morning's plane to Rio.
Do you think he'd take me?
Take you?
Well, I think I could persuade him.
Oh, how nice of you.
I'll go right up and tell Titia to pack at once.
No, just a moment. You see...
...my friend's plane is very small, and it only has room for one passenger.
- Oh, dear.
- Are you afraid your aunt won't let you?
She'd have to for Father's sake.
Dear Father.
Titia can take the next plane.
I'll tell her.
- Hi, Rog. Everything all set?
- I hope so, baby. I hope so.
Shall I lay out your heliotrope coveralls, or the pink ones with the tan grease spots?
Well, I usually fly with you, don't I?
Or am I just a fly in the carburetor?
Well, I tell you, Freddy, old man, you see, it's this way:
I met a friend, a very old friend who asked me as a very special favor.
You know how it is.
You'll have to fly down with the boys.
You don't mind, do you? See they have a dill pickle with their box lunch.
Oh, and send this wire saying we're coming, and I'll see you in Rio.
"Flying Down to Rio."
Boy, what a title for a new song.
You like that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And the very name for that new number too.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, see you in Rio, boy.
Yeah.
Is this the plane of the gentleman who is taking a lady to Rio?
Yes, ma'am. If you're the lady who expects to go to Rio with the gentleman in the plane.
My niece is going.
- Kindly conduct us.
- Yes, ma'am. Right this way.
Are you the conductor?
Have you the proper credentials?
Are you married?
You have children?
Why does he not speak?
Is he a deaf mute, or only dumb?
Please, Titia, he's doing us a favor.
I don't know.
He does not appear to be quite right.
Perhaps I'd better go along.
No, you can't. You see, it won't fly with more than two aboard.
Here we go.
Step right up, miss.
There we are.
- Wait, I have not kissed my niece yet.
- Don't worry, lady.
He'll take care of that for you.
Belinha, do not speak to him unless it is absolutely necessary.
Oh, dear me. Something tells me
I should never have let her go.
Rodriguez, get them down.
Go after them.
Senhora De Rezende,
I was a good coachman.
You made of me a chauffeur, but you cannot expect me to be an eagle.
Do I have to fly all the way to Haiti on a piano bench?
Do I...?
Just a gigolo
Everywhere I go
Was that a close shave.
Wasn't it fortunate this convenient beach was at your disposal...
...when the motor went wrong?
Or perhaps your plane always makes a forced landing when you have a lady passenger?
I don't think it's anything serious.
Probably just the gas line.
We should be off in no time.
I'll believe you when we're in the air again.
- So you're going to be a sap and fix it, huh?
- What?
When was there a better opportunity for dirty work at the crossroads?
Throw away a part of the motor.
She'll never know the difference.
Listen, your suggestions have been getting me into messes all my life.
And I'm the one who ends up getting his face slapped.
All right, but don't keep reminding me of the opportunity you missed.
Well, I suppose I'll never hear the end of it unless I do as you say.
This is gonna be more serious than I thought.
Of course he's deliberately trying to keep you here.
That's why he picked a deserted island.
Isn't that what you want?
I can't let him know that.
After all, I must maintain my reserve.
You and your reserve.
If people knew you as I do, they might be a little bit shocked.
Now give her your bag of tricks.
You know how we always do it.
Start with your music.
- I don't think she'll fall for that old line.
- We haven't met one yet who didn't.
What will I play?
Can't you get an inspiration by just looking at her? Look at her.
She's like an orchid.
And there's the moonlight.
"Orchids in the Moonlight."
There, I've given you another title for a song.
If they only understood themselves as we do.
Isn't it silly how humans deny themselves the things they want most?
To satisfy stupid convention.
But we can speak the truth.
I can say I love you.
Oh, I didn't mean this.
I don't know how it happened.
What difference does it make?
It happened, isn't that enough?
No, you don't understand.
I haven't the right.
My life has long been arranged.
Don't tell me anything so 18th-century as a family arrangement could...
We do things so in my country.
Then I'm going to institute some radical changes in your country.
But my fiancé has even built me a beautiful home on Rio bay.
But you love me.
- You're taking a lot for granted.
- And I love you.
You don't even know my name.
You must forget tonight.
Now you're talking a lot for granted.
I'm determined that you'll never see me again.
If I have to turn the country upside down,
I'll see you.
- I won't permit you.
- We'll see about that.
- You'll do just as I say.
- Oh, will I?
- You will.
- I will not.
Your family, your fiancé, the army, the navy, and all of South America can't stop me.
And if you're silly enough to think that...
I've stood about enough from you.
Oh, miss.
Oh, miss.
Good morning.
I'm just going down to the corner drugstore to get some breakfast.
Is there any special way you like your coconut juice?
Say, listen...
...l'm not going to spend the rest of my days with a dumb wife.
Well, if you're going to act that way,
I've got some looking around to do.
Mr. Bond.
Mr. Bond, where are you?
Where are you?
Roger, where are you?
Where have you gone?
- What's the matter?
- Wild men. Cannibals.
Where?
Roger. Roger, darling. Roger.
What happened?
I don't know.
Oh, I say.
I beg your pardon, sir...
...but it is strictly against the rules to move the ball.
Say, what kind of a desert island is this, anyway?
- Where are we?
- This is Haiti, sir.
Port-au-Prince Golf Club.
I was availing myself an early morning practice...
...for the caddy's tournament, sir.
- But I saw wild men.
The bellhops taking their morning dip.
Wild men, fancy that.
Say, is there any place near here where I can get a mechanic to fix my plane?
Oh, certainly, sir.
The airport's a five-minute jaunt from here.
If you'll listen, you can hear them warming up the Rio plane.
We caught up with yesterday's plane?
Oh, yes, sir.
It spends the night here.
- It leaves in 10 minutes.
- Splendid.
I'll get my bag and take the Rio plane the rest of the way.
Thank you so much for the lift, Mr. Bond.
It was lovely of you. Goodbye.
- Come.
- Right-o.
Say, wait a minute.
I can fix my plane in a jiffy.
- To Rio.
- Right-o.
If you're looking for the part of your motor you threw away...
...you'll find it on top of the piano.
Oh, this isn't just another girl, Julio.
This is the real thing.
Old man cupid didn't fire an arrow this time.
No, sir. He sunk a harpoon.
- So this time it's a Brazilian girl?
- And what a Brazilian girl.
I'm goofy about her.
I am crazy for her.
As a matter of fact, I like her.
I met her in Miami at the Hibiscus Hotel.
Yes, she was traveling with one of those Dona Elenas.
And talk about luck.
The day you sent for me, her father got sick and she had to hurry back here to Rio.
And you'll be seeing her here, of course?
No, that's the catch.
She wouldn't tell me her name or address.
Then it's all on your side.
In a pig's monocle.
She's dizzy about me.
Did she tell you so?
She didn't have to tell me.
I can take a hint.
I tell you, Julio, she is exquisite.
She has a face like a flower, a rose.
What am I talking about?
She's like an orchid, a white orchid.
- She sounds enchanting.
- Enchanting, bewildering.
Bewitching, intoxicating, devastating.
I tell you, Julio, every time I think about her
I want to bite myself, and that's news.
She has beautiful black hair and big brown eyes, eh, Roger?
How true, how true.
And has she got:
And when she smiles there's a funny little curve to her mouth?
That's right.
But how would you know?
And, Julio, that wonderful night we spent on the beach together.
Just the two of us alone, not a soul for miles and miles.
- Was there a moon?
- A glorious moon.
There would be a moon.
- It all comes back to me now.
- Yes?
- I took her passionately in my arms.
- Yes?
- And as I drew her to me...
- Yes?
No, it was too beautiful.
Too sacred to talk about.
Roger, what happened after you took her passionately in your arms...
...and drew her to you?
- That's when I ran into difficulties.
- Difficulties?
It seems the poor kid is already engaged to some local cluck...
...who signed her before she knew any better.
A poor, defenseless child in a baby buggy.
And now the mug is trying to hold her to it...
...by squawking about some shack he's knocked together for her on the waterfront.
- Did you ever hear of a heel like that?
- No.
Thanks.
Julio, I want you to do something for me.
I want you to help me find her.
- Who, me?
- Yeah.
Oh, no, Roger. I could not do that.
- With us an engagement is very serious.
- Serious?
Don't you think it's serious when every time
I think of her I wanna bite myself?
Boy, am I suffering.
Well, here's to her.
And happiness.
Thanks, old man. Thanks a lot.
Hey, Rog? Oh, Rog, the boys are downstairs.
We're waiting for you.
Hey, hey, no more of that bathroom drinking.
Listen, we have to go and hear the Turuna Turuna band tonight.
I can't go hear anything.
I gotta go find someone.
Go find someone?
That look in his eye.
You don't mean the senhorita?
After that frosting you got in Miami?
Boy, she made him look like an angel cake.
Well, I guess it's no use.
I see you've got your hunting suit on.
Say, keep out of jail, will you?
They throw the keys in the bay down here.
So long, fella. Nice guy, but he takes his work too seriously.
Pardon me, Rog.
I must make a phone call.
Sure, help yourself.
Make yourself at home.
Julio. I was just thinking about you.
But you're going to see me tomorrow night at the Aviator's Club.
I must see you tonight.
It's very important.
Wait, dear, I'll ask Titia.
Julio wants to see me tonight.
Have him come over.
Julio, darling, I'm so sorry.
Titia says no.
You see, we're so busy.
You do understand, don't you?
Oh, you're such a dear.
Good night.
We are so busy thinking about a band leader.
Darling, Titia...
...you know I'd never do anything to hurt Julio, don't you?
But, darling, mayn't I have just a little fun before I settle down...
...and start having all of those thousands of children?
Belinha!
What's the matter?
- Didn't she have a friend for you?
- Yes. Oh, no.
- We are just making some plans.
- No, thanks.
There's going to be a ball at the Aviator's Club tomorrow night.
- I want you and Fred to be my guests.
- Swell. Maybe she'll be there.
It's possible.
Say, that would be a great place to try out my new song.
Listen, I'll show you how it goes.
I call it "Orchids in the Moonlight."
I wrote it for her.
- It's a nice cozy little spot you have here.
- Thank you.
I personally myself will escort you to your table.
This way, please.
I also have the honor to visit your country once.
I play vaudeville.
I played Milwaukee, Cincinnati,
Newport News...
...and Schenectady.
- Schenectady?
- Yes.
- You ever play Syracuse?
- Syracuse, sure. I play four, five times a day.
- Nice work, if you can get it.
- Yes, and the most astonishing thing was...
- Did you play there?
- Yes. No. Yes.
The most astonishing was that the audience always laughed.
Laughed. You're telling us.
I also have reserved those tables for your Clippings.
Clippers, if you don't mind.
Yes, thank you, Clippings.
And this table here, please.
This table for you.
Senhorita, sit down.
Now, I want you to admire my greatest attraction, the Turunas.
Turunas? They look like a bunch of zombies to me.
So that quartet's a band.
Well, if that's our only competition...
Don't hurt the old boy's feelings.
We have some distinguished visitors from our sister continent, North America.
- Shall we play them a foxtrot?
- No, we want the Carioca.
- Play the Carioca.
- The Carioca. Play the Carioca.
- Carioca.
- Why don't you play the Carioca?
What's the matter with the foxtrot?
Pardon me, senhor. The American foxtrot is considered too tame, too dull.
- Our people prefer the Carioca.
- I see.
- You mean, they prefer it in public?
- Sí, senhorita. Everybody in Rio.
Very well, then.
Boys, the Carioca.
If that's all they can do, we're a cinch.
Our band will be a sensation.
- Think they've got something.
- They have.
This stuff is swell, but we can't do it.
So that's the Carioca.
- What's this business about the foreheads?
- Mental telepathy.
I can tell what they're thinking about from here.
The trick is to keep your mind a blank.
With that music?
Oh, Freddy, is my mind red.
- Our stuff can't top this.
- I guess Roger's gotten us in bad again.
It'll be a long walk back home from here.
Just how much does it cost to get home from here?
Home nothing. I'd like to try this thing just once.
Come on, Honey.
We'll show them a thing or three.
It's a Carioca!
Say, have you seen the Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of a new rhythm
A blue rhythm that sighs
It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacki-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love
There'll be true love in her eyes
You'll dream of the new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and sigh
You'll dream of the new Carioca
When music and lights are gone
And we're saying goodbye
Two heads together
They say are better than one
Two heads together
That's how this dance is begun
Two arms around you
And lips that sigh
"I am yours, and you are mine"
While the Carioca carries you away
Mine while we Carioca
Till the break of day
Say, have you seen the Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm
A blue rhythm that sighs
It's got a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacki-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love
There'll be true love in her eyes
You'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
I'll say, you're gonna dream
Of the new Carioca
When music and lights are gone
And you're saying goodbye
Boy, no wonder it never gets cold in this country.
Kind of hot.
Let's try a little of that, babe.
Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula
And bamboola are through
Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with your new love
There'll be true love just for you
You're gonna dream of the new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
I say, you're gonna dream
Of the new Carioca
When music and lights are gone
And you've said goodbye
Those shadows are here again.
- Who are they, Antonio?
- They're Greeks.
A gambling syndicate from Monte Carlo.
They want to take this hotel over.
How can they get it away from De Rezende?
They look like they could take anything away from anybody.
Speaking for myself and my colleagues at the bank...
...we anticipate some difficulty concerning the gambling permit.
The permit will be arranged.
Wires will be pulled.
Myself and my colleagues would feel considerably embarrassed...
...should Carlos De Rezende be able to meet his obligation in spite of everything.
That contingency will not arise.
Steps will be taken.
Speaking for myself and my colleagues...
...we will give the matter our personal attention.
Listen, I'd recognize her a block away.
You're looking for a noodle in a haystack.
Cookies!
Come on, we've got to think up an idea that will top that Carioca.
I know. Supposing we do a number with musical saws...
...and we could end up by sawing Honey in half.
I'd much rather split a banana split three ways. Come on.
Well, you two work it out.
I'll go and find her.
- She's probably miles from here.
- That's right. Sure she is. I know she is.
- You do?
- Yeah, I feel psychic.
Look. Walk straight ahead three blocks, then turn left three...
...then to your right two, then bear left four.
Then to the right, then to the left.
- I'm gonna settle this thing right now.
- Oh, Freddy.
How did you ask for little tarts in Portuguese?
Don't heckle me.
Try the Culbertson System.
Good afternoon, senhorita e senhora.
You remember me.
I'm Roger Bond's friend.
You had us thrown out of Miami.
This man, take him away.
You have insulted my patrons, senhor.
You are in the wrong part of town.
Scram.
Hiya, Tarzan.
Been having fun?
If you even speak to that girl they throw you out on the sidewalk.
Boy, is that class.
Want a cookie? Take your choice?
Not bad.
Pardon.
- Hello, Fred.
- Hello, Julio.
- Where's Roger?
- Where's Roger?
I haven't seen him.
I thought he'd be with you.
No, I haven't heard a word from him.
Well, shall we try the jails first, or the asylums?
- I hope he gets here soon.
- So do I.
The junior members are putting on a special tango to his new music.
Fred, I want you to meet my fiancée,
Senhorita Rezende. This is Mr. Ayres.
- How do you do?
- Yes, how do you do?
And her aunt, Dona Elena De Rezende.
Mr. Ayres.
- Belinha, is that not the young man?
- Of course.
We met Mr. Ayres today in the pastry shop quite by accident.
He left rather suddenly and without saying goodbye.
Yes. I said goodbye but you didn't hear me.
I was out on my...
I was outside at the time.
Well, I guess I'd better go and stop Roger...
I mean, I think I know where to find Roger.
If you'll excuse me.
It's awfully nice to have meeting you.
The boys are here again.
It's okay with me.
Darling, I thought you had deserted us.
I was looking for the mayor.
Is this the new composition?
Oh, yes. They're playing it for the first time.
Will you excuse me for a moment?
Did you say something to her?
Not a word. Pardon me.
Oh, let them be alone.
After all, the child has been away so long.
They'll soon be married.
Anything wrong, dear?
No. Oh, no.
It was so warm in there.
- Romantic music, isn't it?
- Isn't it?
The words are romantic too.
And dangerous.
For instance, in the moonlight on a tropical island...
...they might make any woman fall in love with any man.
When orchids bloom in the moonlight
And lovers vow to be true
I still can dream in the moonlight
Of one dear night that we knew
When orchids fade in the dawning
They speak of tears and goodbye
Though my dreams are shattered
Like the petals scattered
Still my love can never die
There is rest in the twilight
When the day is through
But the shadows that fall
Only seem to recall
All my longing for you
There's a dream in the moonbeams
Upon a sea of blue
But the moonbeams that fall
Only seem to recall
Love is all
Love is you
Belinha.
Julio. Oh, Julio, marry me right away.
Of course, darling.
Hiya, boy. You seem to be doing all right with my song.
Belinha, I want you to meet my friend, my best friend.
Mr. Roger Bond.
This is Senhorita Rezende, my fiancée.
Your fiancée?
But this is the...
- Then you're the...?
- Yes.
I'm the local cluck who built her a shack on the waterfront.
Say, this is going to be just too bad...
...for one of us.
Oh, Mr. Ayres.
Isn't this our dance?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. As a matter of fact, I was just looking for you.
I am so glad you came along.
Thanks. But I guess
I'll be going along any minute.
Why?
Well, maybe those shock troops at the door won't see me with you out here.
I knew it.
Look, Belinha is dancing our tango with an americano.
What laundry do you send your shirts to?
Say, this is a kind of tough spot, isn't it?
I don't know.
Things like this usually straighten themselves out.
Shall we let nature take its course?
Yes, nature and common sense.
Well, I guess I'll just stick to nature.
Anyhow, the girl usually does the deciding, doesn't she, Julio?
Gentlemen...
...my colleagues at the bank and I are perfectly satisfied...
...that De Rezende's opening will be a failure.
The mayor is away.
Without an entertainment permit the hotel will be a fiasco.
In a week we should be able to turn it over to your syndicate.
- Good morning, Freddy.
- Hello, Honey.
Where did you get the dog-and-pony act?
It's worse than that.
The MacCarthy sisters.
A bicycle act from Brooklyn.
I found those two on the American consul's doorstep.
That one was left behind on a world cruise for school teachers.
And last but not the least, we have the yes girls from that Carioca cabaret.
Cheer up, Freddy.
They teach kangaroos to box.
Well, toodle-oo. If you need me, send one of the MacCarthy's over on her bicycle.
All right, girls. Now, sit down and we'll talk this thing over.
Now, the first thing we've got to do is concentrate, understand? If we don't...
Hey, boys.
Wait a minute, will you?
Now, the idea is...
Hey, Rog.
Listen, girls...
Hey, Rog, how do you expect me to teach these follies girls if you don't...?
Listen, girls...
Now, girls, listen.
The idea...
- You always was good, Fred.
- Thanks.
Listen, girls, you got a routine to learn here, you understand?
Oh, you like it? Great, great.
Listen, girls...
Oh, thanks very much. Thanks.
And you too, son.
Listen, now, girls, why not take this thing...
- No, senhor.
- No? Maybe you'll like this one better.
- No, no.
- You're right. That's terrible.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
- What is it? What's happened?
- Senhorita Rezende.
- They say the rehearsals must stop.
- What?
It seems my father has no entertainment permit.
Oh, is that all? Well, in my country...
Hey, Rog, give me 50 bucks.
No, don't. That's a prison offense.
Belinha, your robe.
Senhor Rezende. The police tell us you forgot to get a license for the show.
Oh, I did not forget.
I have a license for the original opening date.
I did not know there would be trouble about opening earlier.
But a new license cannot be issued without the authority of the mayor...
...and he has gone on a trip to the interior.
Nobody knows why or when or for how long.
What about the acting mayor, the district attorney?
The commissioner of parks and buildings?
- Sure, there must be someone.
- I have tried everything.
I am afraid there will be no opening.
I hope you will forgive me.
Come, darling.
Hey, Rog, we gotta do something about this.
And I know just what to do.
- Where's Julio?
- At the Aviator's Club
That's perfect.
Now, listen, this is terrific.
If we can get all the members of that organization to cooperate with us...
...then the president of China can't stop us.
Back off, girls.
- Everything fixed, Julio?
- Yes.
- Hello, boy. Hello, babe.
- Hello.
Oh, this is swell.
Look at all the planes.
Behold. As you requested, the gentlemen of the Aviator's Club at your service.
Julio, you're marvelous.
Now all we have to do is sales talk the girls into coming across. Come on, let's go.
And in conclusion, girls, I want to say that I'm not asking anything of you...
...that I wouldn't ask of my own sister.
Now, will you do it?
I'll do it. Sounds like a new thrill.
- Come on, girls.
- That's the stuff.
So that's the way it is, girls.
And I'm not holding a thing back. I know you'll all come through. How's about it?
- Okay with me.
- Why don't you do it yourself?
That's just what I'm going to do, you little witch.
Come on, girls, let's go.
It's a new game, girls, and it's just too ducky for words.
Now, let me see.
Now, the rest of you girls turn your backs.
That's right.
Now, don't you dare peek.
Oh, this is going to be more darn fun.
- Blindman's bluff?
- That's right.
- I thought so.
- Oh, you did, did you?
See that they're all fastened on tight.
We don't want any slip-ups.
All right, hold still, girls.
- Say, do you think it's safe?
- I hope these straps will hold.
It's a good thing my parents don't know about this.
To think I'd ever come to this.
- I don't know whether I like this.
- We can't make the same mistake twice.
- Up you go.
- Okay by me.
Oh, not so tight, please.
That hurts.
Something tells me this is the wrong thing to do.
I'll try anything once.
Senhor Bond, one moment of your precious time.
Senhor De Rezende send you this.
Oh, thanks.
Saint Christopher.
I seem to have walked into something this time.
Oh, Mr. Fred.
Everything's all right at the airport.
How's the house?
Look, the American tourists from the other hotels.
I persuaded them to come here.
That's great, and they all look as if they could pay their checks.
- Good day, Senhorita Belinha.
- Good day, Senhor Vianna.
I came to express my sympathy...
My best wishes to your dear father.
Thank you. I will take you to him.
Not many people here for a grand opening.
Nice beach you have here.
That's what I always say.
There's nothing like a nice beach.
We have nice beaches at home too.
We have Rockaway Beach and we have Revere Beach.
- Check your package, sir?
- It's my medicine.
- Check your...
- My lunch.
- Check...
- Am-scray.
How do you do?
- What are all these packages?
- It's my laundry.
This is a present.
Oh, no, no, no.
I insist that she must be checked.
We had a hard time getting her asleep.
I am a patient man, but this is beyond endurance.
Who are all these strange people with those bundles, my dear Carlos?
Why, they're guests of the hotel, my dear Alfredo.
Where is Roger?
It's time for him to lead the flight.
- I don't know. I haven't seen him.
- Senhor Julio.
The young American requested me to give you this, this and this.
Thank you. Pardon me.
"Dear Julio, this one is on me.
You can fly as well as I can, so you lead the parade and be the hero.
I'm taking a plane down to Buenos Aires.
So long, Roger.
P.S. Why don't you marry the girl?"
- What shall I do?
- Do?
Do exactly as he says and you'll be doing everybody a favor, particularly that P.S. Part.
"Why don't you marry the girl?"
- Elope. That's it. You and Belinha elope.
- Elope?
- Yeah.
- In Brazil we do not elope.
It's against the law. It's bad taste.
In Brazil it takes two weeks to be respectably married.
Listen, I've heard somewhere, and what's more I believe it...
...that the pilot of a plane is exactly like the captain of a transatlantic liner.
Twelve miles out of port he can marry you.
As soon as this party's over, you grab Belinha and a plane...
...and put an end to all of this nonsense.
Come on, Julio, use your Brazil nut.
What a pity it is that you cannot have some entertainment.
With such a distinguished guest as you,
Senhor Vianna...
...there is no need for anything else.
- Look.
- Oh, look.
I trust, my dear Carlos, you are not doing anything...
...which might offend the authorities.
I trust not, dear Alfredo.
Roger, what are you doing here?
Well, Julio's leading the planes. I'm...
I'm going away.
- You're going away?
- Yeah.
Belinha, I thought everything would work out for us...
...but things are different down here in Brazil...
...and I realize now that...
...well, you never could belong to me.
Yes, Roger, you're right.
Here we belong to our families and our promises.
Even though all we want in the world is beautiful, crazy happiness.
I guess I should have checked out when I first learned about Julio.
So...
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Any of you fellows like music?
- Sure.
Well, let's tear it wide open.
- Are you ready, boys?
- Ready.
Take it.
An old sailor in old times
Would sing an old song
Rolling down to Rio by the sea
A young sailor in these times
Would sing a new song
Flying down to Rio, come with me
Where the lovely Brazilian ladies
Will catch your eye
By the light of a million stars
In the evening sky
My Rio
Rio by the sea-o
Flying down to Rio
Where there's rhythm and rhyme
Say, fella
Twirl that old propeller
We've got to get to Rio
And we've got to make time
You'll love it
Soaring high above it
Looking down on Rio
From a heaven of blue
Send a radio to Rio de Janeiro
With a big hello
Just so they'll know
And stand by there
We'll fly there
My Rio
Everything will be okay
We're singing and winging our way
To you
- The mayor.
- Hey, mayor!
Carlos, Alfredo.
Sit down, gentlemen, please?
My dear, dear Carlos.
A tremendous success.
My congratulations.
I saw the sky writing at Teresópolis, and I hurried down here at once.
Vianna, you and your colleagues ought to be very happy.
- Yes?
- You must buy us all champagne.
I insist. I insist.
Oh, very well. Waiter.
Hey, how do I get out of this?
What's the combination?
- Come, Belinha.
- But where? Why?
This time, I'm taking no chances.
- Julio, where are you taking me?
- On your honeymoon.
Don't be silly. I'm not married.
You will be before you know it.
Can you legally marry people?
Well, yes, if they're fools enough to ask for it.
Fine.
- Is this the young lady?
- Yes.
- And this is the young man.
- Oh, fine.
Roger, her happiness is my happiness.
Good luck.
Oh, look, look.
Look, here comes Julio.
Gosh, that gal don't care who she gets thrown out of what.
[ENGLISH]
Stop that. Why, the idea.
Voulez-vous me to call the police?
- What does that mean in English?
- The same as it does in French, monsieur,
All right.
Comme ca, a little brook.
Comme ca, a little river.
Comme ca, a little brook.
Comme ca, a little river.
Where is Petrov?
Please, can you not see
I am busy being a wave?
Comme ca, a little river,
comme ca, a little brook.
Where is Petrov?
Look here, I don't want to be bourgeois and remind anybody... that I'm the owner of this company... but if somebody doesn't tell me where Petrov is... there'll be trouble for everybody.
He's in his private room, practicing his grand leap.
Thank you.
- But he does not want to be disturbed.
- Thank you.
- What is this?
- Hi, Jeff.
Stop it. Stop that.
- What on earth are you doing?
- I'm just having fun.
Fun? The great Petrov doesn't dance for fun.
The great Petrov doesn't, but I do.
- Pete Peters, remember me?
- Oh, that awful name of yours.
I was born with it. it isn't bad.
Pete Peters, Philadelphia, PA.
How do you make that exasperating noise?
What have you got on those shoes?
- Taps.
- Taps?
- On your ballet shoes?
- Sure.
Sacrilege. At last I'm beginning to understand... why you wanted a private room to dance in.
All this time I thought you were practicing your grand leap.
But, Jeff, I haven't neglected anything.
Look, the entre-chat trois.
Lovely, beautiful.
But how much more effective it is this way.
Lovely... I forbid that.
- That's not art.
- Maybe it isn't.
Perhaps it's just the Philadelphia in me.
Jeff, I wish we could combine the technique of the ballet... with the warmth and passion of this other mood.
Mood, what other mood?
You mean this jazz business?
Jazz went out with the flapper.
That isn't jazz.
After 15 years of the hardest work... you want to dwindle into a shimmy dancer.
Well, forget all that nonsense.
Here, look at this, do you realize we ought to be sailing?
Do you realize the Metropolitan in New York City is getting nervous?
I'm sorry, but I have to stay in Paris a while yet.
Stay in Paris? What for? Why?
That's grace, that's rhythm.
What is that? What have you got there?
Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she lovely?
So that's it.
Who is that girl? Who is she?
Where did you meet her?
That's it, I haven't been able to meet her yet.
But I hope to dance with her someday.
- Dance? With her?
- Sure.
Are you mad?
Are you sure that she hasn't tried to persuade you to stay on here?
I told you, I haven't even met her, but I'd kind of like to marry her.
I think I will.
Thanks, Jeff.
You are so beautiful when you are angry.
Pardon, mademoiselle,
I cannot help what I cannot help.
Neither can I.
You cannot let us up like this.
- It not up she let us, it is down.
- Up or down, she lets us.
- It is all your fault, you kissed her.
- But it is in the play.
You kissed her out of the play, too.
Go home, all of you.
Go home!
Well, hello, my little darling.
What have you got there?
It's Mr. Miller, miss.
He just arrived from New York.
- Hello, Arthur.
- Hello, Lynn.
You better go.
If I ever walk on a stage again...
- How did you get here?
- By rail.
I hung over every inch of it.
A new experience for you, you usually have your foot on one.
Yes, Lynn.
Of all the humiliating experiences.
Did you ever dance with a man you didn't care about...
- and who's in love with you?
- No, Lynn.
Why do actors have to take the author's lines literally?
And why must there always be a kiss at the second-act curtain?
As long as I live, I hope I never see another hand-kissing, heel-clicker.
Careful, Lynn.
You know, I come from a long line of heels myself... but we've never clicked.
And it's all your fault, too.
I was a happy, peaceful girl until you discovered me.
Fame, name in lights.
I never should have listened to you.
I'll quit.
- I'll retire from the stage forever.
- Again?
It does you good to break an engagement.
Engagement?
Engagement. That's what I'll do, Tai.
Send a cable to Jim Montgomery.
Tell him I want to see him desperately... and I'm coming back on the Queen Anne tomorrow.
- Yes, miss.
- Now, Lynn, don't lose your head.
- You have to stay in the theatre.
- Never.
I refuse to be a bowl in a gold of fish.
You mean a fish in a bowl of gold.
That's what I said, a bowl in a goldfish.
- Just a moment, please.
- Thank you.
Petrov? What's a Petrov?
Just the Russian ballet's greatest dancer.
Fine, tell him to go back to Moscow.
The gentleman seems very anxious to see you, miss.
I've got enough troubles without adding a dizzy Russian to them.
Just another dancer to swoon in my arms.
That's all I need to make things perfect.
A simpering toe dancer.
Get rid of him.
He probably only wants to say he's seen a picture of me... and can't live without me.
I am Petrov.
Charmed. I'm Linda...
- Linda...
- Linda Keene.
- Yes.
- How do you do?
So glad you came, Mr. Petrov.
Not mister, Petrov, alone.
- Just Petrov.
- And why not?
Just Caesar, just Napoleon, and only Garbo... so Petrov, too, she's enough.
Just about enough.
And you, I understand you want to dance with me.
Of course, I cannot blame you... but I will not permit it.
Who told you that?
A little bird she tell me so.
Not in the least.
What, you do not want to dance with the great Petrov?
Don't be a silly horse.
Maybe you could twist for me once... like so.
No, I don't...
- Twist.
- Better twist.
Get up, I hate these discords.
She is horrible, nyet?
Well, that kind of settles it.
With me, nothing is settled.
Well, I must go now. I must go to Moscow.
- Funny, nyet?
- Very.
It kills me.
That lunatic's dangerous, they ought to lock him up.
Am I glad I'm sailing on the Queen Anne tomorrow.
No, Denise, no.
I can't take you back as ballerina.
Why, you've done absolutely nothing for four years.
And everything's been so peaceful since you left.
It wasn't my fault.
Peter just refused to fall in love with me.
Peter, darling.
Why, Denise...
- or should I say Lady Tarrington?
- No, it is Denise again.
Denise wants to come back to the ballet.
She does?
Well, that sounds like fun.
I didn't know you felt that way.
Why, of course, Denise, you're engaged.
- You go downstairs and get your contract.
- Thank you, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey, may I speak to you a moment, please?
- You'll excuse us?
- Of course.
And I'll let you know about the rehearsals the first thing in the morning.
Of course, we can't give her anything important to do at first.
- You want me to stay, don't you?
- Why, what a question.
- Well, then get rid of her.
- Get rid of her?
Remember all the trouble she caused the last time?
But you just told her,
I heard you myself.
I was only being polite.
Oh dear, and I've given her my word.
Look, Jeff, I'll make a deal with you.
You want me to go to New York, don't you?
Why, naturally.
I'll sail on the Queen Anne tomorrow providing you get rid of her.
Tomorrow, oh dear, that's so sudden.
I wouldn't know what to do.
I wouldn't know what to say.
- All right, I stay here in Paris.
- But I'll think of something.
I'll connive, I'll connive something good.
Good.
Peter.
Hello, Denise.
I feel very bad because I'm not going with you.
- So do I.
- Is your wife going with you?
My wife, I haven't any wife.
Jeffrey told me it was a secret for professional reasons.
Oh, Jeffrey.
Did he mention how long I'd been married?
Yes, he did.
Immediately after dear Tarrington took me away from you.
Dear Tarrington.
- Is she sailing with you?
- Who?
Oh, my wife, yes, of course.
I'd love to meet her.
Well, you couldn't.
She's busy with the children now.
Children? But Jeffrey didn't tell me.
Jeffrey doesn't know everything.
Imagine, married four years.
Imagine.
- And how many little ones are there?
- Five.
- Five?
- Well, twins.
- How wonderful.
- Isn't it?
- All visitors ashore,
- Well, goodbye, Denise.
- Sweet of you to see me off.
- Goodbye, Peter.
Bon voyage,
Miss Keene, I know, wants me to tell you... how much she hates leaving her dear Paris.
She's enjoyed everything about it, and everybody in it.
All visitors ashore,
Monsieur Petrov, a picture, please.
Thank you.
- One more, please.
- All right.
I certainly do envy you, Pete, going home at last.
I kind of like the idea myself.
All right, so long, fellows, thanks for everything.
Bye-bye.
Miss Keene.
Why, just Petrov.
You come to see me go, nyet?
Yes, isn't it sweet of me?
I know you come.
Petrov, I have been looking all over for...
- I beg your pardon.
- Miss Keene, my friend, Jeffrey Baird.
- How do you do?
- Really, Miss Keene...
What did you say?
Me? Nothing.
What's the matter with you, you got a cold?
No, I feel like you say, good.
Well, you don't sound so good.
What's the matter with you?
Doesn't Mr. Baird understand Russian?
- Not a...
- Yes.
What?
What sort of a game is this?
It's just a game little
American boys play.
I beg your pardon, sir.
- We can't find Mr. Petrov.
- Well, you've got to find him.
He's probably practicing that jiggling somewhere.
I've looked everywhere, sir.
Splendid service, that's all I can say.
Bring the world's leading ballet dancer aboard this ship... and he disappears from his stateroom under your very nose.
Well, he might be in someone's else's stateroom, sir.
What would he be doing in someone else's stateroom?
That would be entirely up to him, sir.
You aren't really serious about that marriage idea, Lynn?
No, Arthur?
What about me?
I'm sorry, but I'm facing real happiness for the first time in my life.
Yes, and I'm facing bankruptcy... for the third time in my life.
- Steward, miss.
- Come in.
I ordered lunch for us.
You can put the table right here.
I guess we won't be having many more of these together.
Lynn, I still think you're a sap to walk out on me just to get married.
No, I'm tired of living the kind of life
I've been leading.
Look, Lynn, I'll give you $10,000 more than I gave you last year.
You don't understand, your kind never does.
Money, isn't everything.
But, Lynn, after all these years together.
Arthur, I'm tired of being pawed.
I beg your pardon.
My compliments, miss... and as for you, sir, shame.
You misled me, you tricked me.
You knew that she was going to take this boat.
I'll admit the charge and plead in extenuation my extreme youth.
And where have you been all day?
With that woman?
Not that woman, Jeff. The woman.
But I wasn't with her, and furthermore, she hasn't left her room all day, darn it.
Probably one of those night prowlers.
But she's not going to prowl too near you... because I intend to accompany you all evening.
- Good, maybe she's got a friend.
- Really?
What's the matter, what are you doing?
What are you weaving about like that for?
- Weaving?
- Yes.
I'm not weaving.
It's the boat.
You mean this boat's doing that?
Of course, it must be getting choppy out.
Of course.
- Why, Jeff, what's the matter?
- Nothing, I'm all right, I think.
I guess.
- You look terrible.
- Do I?
Why, yes, you're all white, sort of green, kind of yellowish.
- Maybe you ought to go to bed.
- Maybe.
No, maybe I better get some air.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- What's the matter, old man?
- It's the boat.
The whole boat is weaving.
There, is that better?
I don't know, really, I don't know.
- Straight lemon juice, please.
- I wouldn't drink that.
- No?
- It'll make you seasick.
What this gentleman needs is champagne.
Champagne? No, I've never touched champagne in all my life.
- I refuse to touch it.
- You can watch me, then.
- Keep them coming.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing.
Tell me the truth, do I look bad to you?
To tell you the truth, I don't know you well to tell you the truth.
Miss Keene, you remember the night we met in Paris?
Yes, I remember.
Wait a minute, please.
I want to explain.
You see, I once saw a photograph of you... and I decided right then and there that I simply had to meet you.
And I tried every way but... nobody in Paris seemed to know you and...
Everybody in Paris knows Linda Keene... everybody worth knowing.
Of course, but I just don't seem to know the right people yet.
Couldn't you do something about that right now... as one Yankee to another?
I'm from the South.
Maybe you all's from the North.
It's funny, dogs have an instinct for the right people.
How do you like that?
It's marvelous how you can do it with so many at one time.
- Let's drink to that.
- Steward.
Another bottle of this lemon.
He's gone to bed, must be late.
What time is it?
What does your watch say?
It says tick-tick-tick.
Hey, Jeffrey.
Hello, good morning.
What's the matter, you lose something?
I got great news for you, old man, you're not going to be seasick.
The captain just told me this will continue to be the smoothest trip in 10 years.
I don't see why you should have such a big head.
- You only had one glass.
- Yes, but you kept filling it.
Your breakfast, sir.
What'll I do?
Before you do anything, you'd better put that breakfast away.
That'll save me an extra trip.
Come here, darling.
What has happened?
You ruined your sweater, now I'll have to fix it.
Isn't it wonderful being here tonight like this?
Still on the same boat together.
I seldom change boats in mid-ocean.
I mean, look how lucky I am.
The first time I find myself on a boat with somebody like you... it turns out to be you.
Fellows, listen to this.
"Lady Tarrington left this morning on the S.S. Marseilles,
"for a trip to America to visit her friends Mr. and Mrs. Petrov...
"who are aboard the S, S, Queen Anne,
"Upon further questioning...
"it was learned that the Petrovs have been married for some time...
"their marriage not having heretofore been disclosed for professional reasons."
That is news for your morning bulletin.
That must be the musical comedy star he's with so much, Linda Keene.
By George, you're right.
Sparks just told me that ballet dancer,
Petrov, is secretly married.
- I'll wager it's to that American dancer.
- Righ to.
- Will that be all, Miss Linda?
- Yes, thank you, Tai.
And he's been secretly married to Linda Keene for some time.
They're a lovely-looking couple, don't you think?
My dear, I knew it.
- How do you do?
- Good evening.
That's what I like about boats, everyone's so friendly.
A toast.
Wake up, Petrov.
We're going to have a baby?
- What?
- Why did you keep this a secret from me?
- What are you talking about?
- It's all here in the ship's bulletin.
It says you've been married for years to Linda Keene.
And the editor announces:
"it is rumored that a blessed event is imminent."
Why did this have to happen to me?
To you? it hasn't even happened to me.
Lady Tarrington.
Do you realize that you're the father of my child?
Of course, that's ridiculous, that's impossible.
It's very simple.
You told Denise I was married... somebody selected a wife, and now I'm going to be a father.
- Isn't that cute?
- Cute? it's a miracle.
I warned you association with that
Keene woman would get you into trouble.
I warned you I was gonna fall in love with her. I have.
It's your fault, go and explain it to her.
I'll do nothing of the kind.
If you want me to dance at the Metropolitan... you go to Linda and clear this thing up.
In that case perhaps I had better.
I'll take care of this.
Operator, get me Mr. Petrov.
What? Don't you dare congratulate me.
Come in.
I've come to tell you, Miss Keene, that we will not tolerate your insinuations.
Stay where you are... while I compose myself.
I suppose you and that toe dancer think this whole thing's a good joke.
It was not altogether the toe dancer,
Mr. Petrov's fault.
It wasn't?
A man in Petrov's position is besieged by women.
Naturally.
And there was one persistent wretch who...
Well, to get rid of her, he said he was married to you.
- To get rid of her?
- Exactly.
He had to choose somebody, and he felt that a person like you wouldn't mind.
- So he used me to...
- Exactly.
You see, it wasn't altogether a joke.
Good morning, little mother.
Good morning.
I want to book passage on that mail plane.
I'm sorry, but that's against government regulations.
But I must leave the ship.
It's absolutely urgent that I leave.
Well, I understand, but it's just a little irregular.
I'm quite sure the government would understand.
Well, perhaps under the existing circumstances, madam...
Not madam, miss!
Where's Linda?
Pardon me.
Take a good look.
Gosh, and I could have explained everything.
You couldn't have explained her embarrassment and humiliation.
Thanks.
Now she's going to get married.
- Married?
- Yes.
Married to a Park Avenue cluck... with the longest yacht and the shortest chin ever christened.
- You've driven her to that.
- Me? I didn't do anything.
Only told somebody you were married to her... just to get rid of another dame, only used her, that's all.
- Who said I did?
- Your impresario, Mr. Baird.
Oh, he did?
Excuse me, gentlemen... in a few moments the fire bell will ring, but don't pay any attention to it.
- A fire drill for the ship's crew.
- Right.
He's probably in here.
Did you tell Miss Keene that I used her to get rid of a woman?
My very words, dear boy.
One of these days you'll thank me for doing it.
Thank you?
If I didn't need you to explain to her...
What is the matter with you?
Haven't you any feeling of responsibility for your art, your company?
Do you realize because of your lies... the best musical comedy star is quitting show business?
Is that so? That's no loss.
It'd be if Petrov were mixed up with that cheap vaudeville.
However, I've scotched all that, and I'm proud of it.
You scotched it all right.
This boat is getting terrible.
What is that noise?
- It's a fire, the boat's on fire.
- Is it?
This boat?
Of course, yes! What are we going to do?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Stay where you are.
- Stay where you are.
- Don't move.
- Don't move, but hurry. My word, yes!
- You'd better get into this.
- I'm going to sue the company.
- If we get out alive.
- I'll sue them anyway.
Take the Thermos, you may get stranded on an island.
We'll need this for cold nights.
I feel the flames, they're getting nearer.
Now let's keep our heads.
What else do we need?
- Hats.
- Of course, hats.
- We don't want head colds.
- No.
Gentlemen always dress, even on a tropical island.
- And this basket of fruit to eat.
- Of course.
I'll pick up a few blankets. No, wait.
The clock, so I'll know when it's bedtime.
Petrov, I know they've lowered our boat.
Take this. We may be stranded for a while.
Time will hang heavy on our hands.
- We will vary it with a little golf.
- A little golf, yes.
- Go ahead, Boat Station 4.
- Station 4. We got everything?
- Everything.
- Come on, don't forget the blanket.
- I'll get the blankets.
- And don't get excited, just follow me.
Come on, follow me.
Come on, Petrov, hurry up.
I'm all right. Don't get excited, anybody.
Everybody keep calm.
My boat's Number 4.
My boat's Number 4, where? Four?
All right, I'm here. Let it down.
What are you waiting for?
Miss Keene? She's back already?
Goody. Miss Keene's back.
Give me her key, will you, please?
Thank you, very much.
- Welcome home, I'm so happy to see you.
- Thank you, Cecil.
You're in sooner than we expected.
Are you alone?
Certainly, and who else would be with me?
You are the one, miss, keeping it a secret so long.
- There is no secret.
- No, not now but...
There never was.
Very well, miss.
I know professional people.
You'll find me the very soul of discretion.
Yes, indeed.
Just one moment, please.
I've got a surprise for you.
Voilà!
- Jim, I'm so glad to see you.
- I received your cable, Linda.
You're looking very well, considering.
- You look grand, too, Jim.
- Thanks, I'm lucky that way.
Nothing shows in my face.
But why didn't you tell me, Linda?
Tell you? There's nothing to tell.
- Then somebody's wrong.
- Oh, that.
Lot of false malicious gossip.
Petrov? On his way up? Splendid.
- Cecil Flintridge.
- No, Jeffrey Baird.
I beg your pardon, Cecil Flintridge.
I beg your pardon, Jeffrey Baird.
No, Cecil Flintridge.
I don't like to disillusion you, old man, but I am Jeffrey Baird, Petrov's manager.
And I am Cecil Flintridge.
You mean you are Cecil Flintridge?
- Yes, that's what I mean.
- Well, what of it?
What?
- Cecil of the hotel?
- Yes, of the hotel.
Of course. Well, how are you?
How are you? How do you do, indeed?
I've been at great pains to make you and Mr. Petrov comfortable.
- Have you really? That's very kind.
- I thought it was kind of me.
Your suite is right next to
Mrs., or shall I say, Miss Keene?
Miss Keene? What!
You blundering blunderer!
Petrov.
- Do you know where we are?
- Wait a minute, don't tell me.
New York.
Yes. No, we're right next to Linda Keene.
- Good.
- That's what I thought.
Nobody's interested in what you think, if you do.
I'm only trying to do my best, sir.
Do your next best and move us to another part of this hotel.
Why shouldn't married people have adjoining suites?
- Because they're not married.
- Not married?
Arthur.
Linda, I've only kept the roof open in the hope you'd come back.
Since you left,
I haven't had one revue there.
I couldn't find a big enough name.
Arthur, I'm not that good.
You're right, Linda, you're not.
Seriously, the crowds who haven't been on the roof since you left think you are.
- Arthur, I forgot to tell you something.
- What, Lynn?
I'm going to be married to Jim Montgomery.
Well, I guess I'm licked.
If you have your mind made up that definitely... there's nothing more I can say to influence you.
No, I'm afraid there's not.
Except to wish me luck.
Well, you know I do, Lynn.
All the best, the very best.
Thank you, Arthur.
There's just one thing I insist on doing for you.
What's that?
Give you and Jim a farewell dinner, tonight, on the roof.
We'd love it.
So nice of you to think of Jim.
I think of him constantly.
We've had our dinner.
What are we doing up here?
You'll find out when I do.
Yes, Mr. Petrov,
Mr. Miller's expecting you.
This way, please.
- Take this to Evans.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you, Arthur.
And now, Miss Keene has graciously consented to dance for us.
But not alone.
Those who've never seen her famous partner... have at least heard of him quite a bit lately.
Petrov.
- What am I supposed to do?
- Twist.
I've got to keep that marriage story alive, Charlie.
It's the only way I can stop Lynn from marrying Montgomery.
Then you'll have to get a new angle.
The newspapers are cold on this secret marriage, it's too secret.
They've told the boys to lay off unless they can furnish absolute proof.
If I can only hang onto this combination.
The public would climb up the side of the building... to see Lynn and Petrov dance together now.
- We've got to do something.
- Yeah.
Furnish the proof that they're married.
That ought to be easy.
I have an idea that's so dastardly, it's beautiful.
You remember the dream idea that sculptor sold us on for Lynn?
The one we spent $5,000 on and never used?
Yes.
Here's where we're going to collect on it.
- Lynn never saw that model, did she?
- Not that I know of.
It breaks my heart to do this... but with a few slight changes, I'll turn that dream stuff into a nightmare... that'll make history.
Poor Lynn! Look.
- Good morning, Tai.
- Good morning, Miss Linda.
Have you no shame?
- Why, I...
- How can you look yourself in the face?
But I...
Here I emphatically deny your marriage... to the boys and they flash these pictures on me.
The humiliation of it.
Lynn, I never thought you'd double-cross me.
Double-cross you? I didn't pose for those.
I suppose that's an old tintype of your grandmother.
It could be. it's certainly not me.
Linda, I've trusted you.
I've done everything I could think of.
Didn't I even bless your proposed union with Jim?
What a way to treat me, your best friend.
Don't go.
You're the only one who can help me.
I've done everything I could.
- But you've got to.
- Not anymore.
You must. All right, I'll sue the paper.
I'll get to the bottom of these pictures.
You mustn't get involved in this.
I can't let you down in this crisis.
I'll handle the whole thing for you.
Thank you, Arthur.
I knew you'd stand by me.
Get me Mr. Petrov.
Hello.
Oh, it's you.
Good morning.
How?
What?
Why, no, I haven't.
The papers?
I'll be right over.
What is the matter?
When you shout like that you frighten me, old fellow.
Take a look at this, old fellow.
I read the paper this morning, Mr. Petrov.
You won't have to run through the hallway anymore.
Compliments of the management.
Cad.
I suppose you're going to say this is Jeffrey's fault.
I suppose you're going to say this isn't you.
I can't very well, and neither can you.
Can you?
No.
You don't, by any chance, walk in your sleep, do you?
What... How can you say such a thing?
Well, it's my bed, and I'm asleep.
Hello. What?
You want a statement?
- Well, let me tell you, if you think...
- Wait a minute.
You'd better not say that.
It might be libel.
Let me talk.
Maybe I can put it more gently.
Hello.
Who is this, please?
Oh, the editor.
Listen, you and that cheap outfit that published those pictures.
I know, but wait a minute, I'm talking.
What?
Jim.
Jim, why didn't you phone?
I would've been dressed.
I suppose you've seen the morning paper?
Oh, that. Lies, ridiculous lies.
Now, Linda, I let you talk your way out of that other picture... but that's no joke sitting on that bed.
It's you.
Me? That's not me.
Do you think I'd be caught dead in that cheap negligee?
That's irrelevant.
In the picture I'm looking at, there's no corpse.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Jim, this is Mr. Petrov.
Mr. Petrov, this is Jim...
Jim Montgomery, my fiancé.
You've heard of Mr. Petrov, haven't you, dear?
Yes.
Isn't he the man you were telling me about?
Yes, he's the one.
Yes, I'm the one.
I'm glad to see you, Mr. Montgomery.
Linda, the editor said he'll be very happy to retract his statement... but how about those pictures?
Yes, as I was saying, how about those pictures?
Yes, how about those pictures?
Now, Linda, I don't want to upset you or anything... but don't you think this is a poor time to announce our engagement?
I mean, couldn't we wait until things get a little more straightened out?
Yes, Jim, of course, it's only fair to you.
Glad to have met you, Mr. Petrov.
Me, too, Mr. Montgomery.
Charming chap.
I'm awfully sorry, Linda, but we'll manage this somehow.
But how?
Mr. Petrov, the lobby is simply bursting with reporters.
They're on their way up, what shall I do?
Stall them off, Cecil.
- We'll sneak down the freight elevator.
- Stall them off.
Get dressed.
We'll meet in the park in 15 minutes.
All right.
Let's go back. I'm tired.
Gosh, I can't keep this up much longer.
I haven't been on skates since I was a kid.
- It was your idea.
- Yeah.
How much longer do we have to stay out here?
The reporters will probably leave by dark.
I guess it would look kind of funny... if we denied the marriage now, wouldn't it?
I don't know what to do.
I don't either.
The word is "either."
All right.
The word is "either."
No use squabbling.
That'll get neither of us anyplace.
The word is "neither."
Yes, it was my idea.
- Have you any more of them?
- No.
Read all about the secret marriage!
Paper, read all about the secret marriage!
Did you hear that?
We're about the only two people in the world... who don't think we're married.
We don't "think" we're not.
We both "know" we're not.
Except me.
I'm beginning to have my doubts.
Don't tell me I have to convince you, too, that we're not married.
We might just as well be.
We certainly can't afford to deny it in the face of those pictures.
No, I'm afraid not.
The only difference between us and other married people is... that we can't even get a divorce.
If I really could get a divorce from you before I marry Jim... that would put a stop to all these embarrassing falsehoods.
It certainly would.
Peter, you've got to marry me.
Why, Linda, this is so sudden.
If we get married now, I could start divorce proceedings in the morning.
I don't know.
You got me into all this, the very least you could do is marry me.
It wasn't my fault any more than it was yours.
All right, it's my fault... but you've just got to marry me.
I'd like to think it over.
But why? There's nothing to think over.
All right.
But where can we get a license?
Everybody in New York knows us now.
- Why don't you try New Jersey?
- Thanks.
The name of the bride is?
My real name is Linda Thompson.
And the name of the groom is?
Peter P. Peters.
I beg your pardon... but what are grounds for divorce in this state?
Marriage.
Good afternoon.
Lady Tarrington, your suite is ready.
Will you announce me to Mr. Petrov?
- Is Mr. Petrov expecting you?
- Yes, indeed.
Room 2601.
I'll have you announced.
Petrov, where are you?
Why didn't you telephone?
It's not Petrov. it's the desk.
What do you want?
Lady Tarrington?
Yes, have her come right up.
Did you say Lady Tarrington?
Oh, my word, she can't come up here.
Tell her to go back to Paris.
She's already on her way up?
It's calamitous.
Oh, dear, let me talk to the floor manager.
Cecil Flintridge speaking.
It's you, Mr. Baird.
How are you?
That doesn't matter.
Now, you stop asking questions and listen.
There is a woman on her way up here... who started the whole silly rumor about Petrov's marriage.
Yes, I said "rumor."
Did you say "rumor"?
Yes, I said "rumor"!
They are not married!
Denise. it's you.
- So, they are not married.
- Yes.
That is, not exactly. No.
My journey is going to be more exciting than I thought.
Oh, dear, you... You're not going to...
Yes, indeed I am.
That's Petrov now.
I don't wish to shilly-shally, but I want to know once and for all... is Petrov married or is Petrov not married?
Yes, he is not.
Johnson.
Change that lock!
Gardenias, 10 cents.
Right here, please.
A corsage for the bride.
- It's all right.
- Thank you, sir.
Tomorrow, we'll be all straightened out.
You'll be on your way, and I'll be on my way.
Where?
I've got to get back to being a bachelor again.
Sort of catch up with my usual gay life.
Forget all this.
I hope you enjoy your gaiety.
Thanks. I hope you enjoy your divorce.
Thanks.
I didn't know getting married was so depressing.
I'm sorry now I asked you.
That's all right. I'll get over it.
Of course.
I guess the honeymoon's over.
Wouldn't you like to come in for a drink?
No, I don't think so.
Good night.
Maybe you'd prefer a cigarette or something?
No. Thanks just the same.
I just wanted to thank you for everything.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Sorry.
It's way past my bedtime.
Good night, Linda.
Come in.
It's you, Cecil.
Yes, may I come in?
Isn't it way past your bedtime?
Yes, but I haven't been able to sleep a wink.
I've been waiting up to see you.
- To see me?
- Yes, I...
I must acquaint you with the varying state of my mind.
It feels like a veritable pendulum, to and fro.
Then a moment later, it swings fro and to.
Tell me, Miss Keene, are you Mrs. Petrov?
Or should I say...
Mrs. Petrov, are you Miss Keene?
I'll tell you, Cecil. We are married.
Mrs. Petrov, my best congratulations.
Thank you.
Now I can go to bed with a clear conscience.
So can I.
Mrs. Petrov, I hope you will forgive me... but in the storm and stress of other circumstances...
I rather willfully changed the lock.
But may I present you with this?
Shall we call it the new key to your happiness?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good night.
Come in.
Peter.
Why, Denise. Look, you can't come in here.
Why?
Afraid your wife will object?
Yes, exactly.
Peter, please.
Think of a new one.
But I'm married, really.
Save your breath, Pete.
Jeffrey told me the truth.
But even Jeffrey doesn't know.
Are you sure your wife knows?
Please go away, will you?
I don't believe you.
And I won't budge under any circumstances.
Peter, you're so worked up.
And I love it.
Linda.
- Wait a minute.
- Yes, don't go.
This is Lady Tarrington.
This is my wife, Mrs... Miss Keene.
I've heard about you.
I hadn't heard about you.
Why have you been so secretive about this one, Peter?
I didn't think you'd be interested.
How silly of you.
I imagine Lady Tarrington is quite charming... when you get to know her.
Yes, she is, I mean...
Then, you really are married to Peter?
Yes, really.
- Do you mind?
- No.
But I do think it'd be awfully pleasant... if you would divorce him.
No, I'm sure I'll never divorce him.
You know, you're a lot more intelligent than you look.
Why, thank you.
I wish I could say the same of you.
Good night.
Tai!
I'm sorry, Peter.
No, don't apologize.
You've really done me a great favor.
I certainly didn't mean to.
- Bon voyage,
- Are you going away?
No, but I thought maybe you were.
- I'll send for you, Tai.
- Yes, Miss Linda.
- Good luck, Peter.
- Thanks, Denise.
Linda, Linda darling, she's gone.
May I come in just long enough to tell you... how happy I am that you're not divorcing me?
At least, tell me where you are going.
All right, Linda, if that's the way you feel about it.
Good luck and bless you.
- Now, what?
- Linda, she's walked out.
This time for good.
For whose good?
Not yours or your creditors'.
- Creditors?
- Yeah, creditors.
You know, the people who come up because the customers didn't.
This is Arthur Miller.
Send up a case of champagne.
Arthur, have you heard from Linda?
- She just phoned.
- Where is she?
She wouldn't tell me but left a message for you.
Something about a Lady Tarrington... and that she was going through with the divorce as planned.
Why didn't you do something to stop her?
I'm all worn out stopping her marriage to Montgomery.
What did you do to stop her marrying him?
Don't you read the papers?
I proved she was married to you so she couldn't marry him.
- You proved?
- Yes.
You took those pictures. How?
As long as she wasn't marrying Montgomery...
I thought I could get her in my revue.
But no, you had to horn in.
- So now I've lost her.
- You mean I've lost her.
Petrov!
You're here. Let me tell you...
How do you do, Miss Keene?
You may be interested to learn that we have no show.
Shake hands with Arthur, he hasn't either.
Really, I'm glad.
The Metropolitan has cancelled our engagement... because of the scandalous notoriety... occasioned by your association with that woman.
Oh, my word, she's fainted.
It's just a dummy.
I know she's a dummy.
I've said so all along.
A tap-dancing dummy.
You mean a dumb dummy, of course.
That picture in the paper...
You know where we are, don't you?
We're right here in New York on a wild goose chase... with a whole company of ballet artists and no show.
All because of you and your practical dummy jokes.
Say, maybe Arthur and I can help you out.
Maybe we could use your boy in our show.
My what?
What do you say, buddy?
Suppose we could find a spot for you?
You vandal.
Petrov, the great Petrov, in one of your cheap medicine shows.
What's the matter, Pete?
You look worried.
I'm still trying to get an idea for the ballet.
- There's just something missing.
- Yeah, Linda Keene.
There's a man outside who wants to see Mr. Petrov.
He looks like a process server.
Shall I let him in?
Nobody is to go near Petrov.
Those are my orders.
Yeah, but the man insists if he don't see...
Arthur.
I'm going to dance with Linda Keene.
- Is she back?
- No, but that wax figure gave me an idea.
We'll have masks made to look like her.
If I can't dance with one Linda,
I'll dance with dozens.
I think you've got something.
The man says that if he don't see Mr. Petrov...
You go out and tell the man you're Petrov.
- Like a game, you mean?
- Yes, like a game.
What's troubling you, my good fellow?
Are you Peter P. Peters, known as Petrov?
What an amusing alliteration.
I am.
Here's a present for you.
Thank you very much.
Now I begin to see the idea of the game.
You see, I'm not Peter P. Peters, neither am I Petrov.
Wise guy, eh?
Leave these premises at once.
I'm waiting to speak with Mr. Arthur Miller.
I'll speak with Mr. Jeffrey Baird.
This is Cecil Flintridge.
Yes, I'll wait.
Hello.
Hello, Jeffrey. Yes, are you there?
Of course, I'm here.
Now, don't shout at me. I'm in jail.
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm in jail for battery and I want you to get me out.
I'm at the Susquehanna Street Jail.
Susquehanna.
S-U-S-Q-U...
"Q!"
You know, the thing you play billiards with.
Billiards!
B-I-L-L...
What is this, a spelling bee?
No, "L" for larynx.
L-A-R-Y-N...
No, not "M, " "N."
"N" as in neighbor.
Neighbor. N-E-l-G-H-B...
"B."
You know, the stinging insect.
Insect!
L-N-S...
"S!"
"S" for symbol.
S-Y...
"Y!"
Why? Don't ask me why.
Look, Jeffrey, I'm in jail.
Wait a minute.
What jail did you say this was?
Susquehanna Street Jail.
Thank you indeed, thank you very much.
I'm in the... The...
Jeffrey, listen closely.
Do you know where the Oak Street Jail is?
You do? Fine.
I'll have them transfer me there in the morning!
Look, Linda, I insist that you give up this idea of making a spectacle of yourself.
Yes, Miss Keene, it was entirely unnecessary for you to return.
- Our men will serve Petrov.
- Your men have had their chance.
Besides, I'll derive a great deal of pleasure in serving this summons personally.
Linda.
- It was swell of you to come.
- Hello, Arthur.
I want you to meet my attorney,
Mr. Russell.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
He said if he couldn't dance with you, he'd dance with images of you.
Arthur, take me backstage.
Why, Mrs. Petrov.
Or should I say Miss Keene?
Hello, you're back. What do you want?
What's the matter, Cecil?
Arthur, please.
Happy New Year!
Hey, there's wine in Lotta's Fountain!
Free wine!
Hey, Mr. Duane. Mr. Duane!
You want any more?
- Sure, all of it. Empty the warehouse.
- You bet.
- I'll take a dozen pints at the same price.
- Hello, Blackie. Happy New Year.
- Hello, Duane. Happy New Year to you.
- Yeah.
- Some sight, huh?
- Yeah. Some advertising.
Hello, there, Blackie!
- Happy New Year and many of them.
- Happy New Year, Della!
Happy New Year, girls!
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Everybody that's worth knowing.
Hello? Fire!
Where's the fire?
- Where's the fire?
- On the Barbary Coast.
Maybe it's my joint.
Stand back. Keep clear.
Give them a chance to work, boy.
Clear out for the hose!
- It ain't your joint, Mr. Norton.
- No. It isn't hot enough for my joint.
Oh, God, the kids!
Help! Save us! Please, save us!
Up pressure, up pressure.
Hurry! Hurry!
- Is everybody out of there?
- Okay. They're all out, Mr. Norton.
- Well, happy New Year.
- Same to you.
- Hello, Blackie. Happy New Year.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, Romeo!
- Hello. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year to you, Blackie.
Happy New Year, Blackie.
- Hiya, Blackie, happy New Year.
- Hi, Blackie, happy New Year.
- Where's the fire, boss?
- Dupont Street. The old Bristol house.
- Happy New Year, Blackie.
- Happy New Year, honey.
Gee, I want it to be happy.
- That fire was at the Bristol.
- Oh, that trap.
- Hey, Blackie, your shoes are all muddy.
- Yeah, I know.
- Here, put them up here.
- You know, that makes... the third fire we've had in one week.
- Hello, Blackie.
- Hello, Jim.
Yeah, if it keeps up, we'll have to get ourselves some asbestos suits.
Yeah. I'll say so.
I thought I told you not to wear that thing.
Gee, honey, I think it's nice.
Yeah?
Well, I think it makes you look cheap.
Now, don't wear it anymore.
Blackie doesn't like it.
Say, Blackie...
Mrs. Forrestal's here with a party of swells.
She's been asking especially for you.
- That so?
- Yeah.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Blackie.
- Oh, I want you to meet my husband.
- How do you do? Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year to you.
- Thanks.
- Mark this on the house.
- Okay.
- Happy New Year.
- Thanks.
- Throw him out!
- Come on, pal. Let's go.
- I don't like his singing.
- But you mustn't hurt the artist's feelings.
His feelings? Who is he against so many?
Say, where are you from?
- Los Angeles.
- I thought so.
I beg your pardon.
Are you the manager here?
Well, I kind of run the joint.
What do you want, sister?
- I'm looking for work.
- Oh, just get to town?
Oh, no. No. The place I've been living at was just burned down.
- Oh, yeah. That trap on Dupont Street.
- Yes.
Well, that's tough.
Yes. I've been looking for work uptown, but there doesn't seem to be anything... so I thought I'd try the Barbary Coast.
- I've been to several places, but there...
- How about a little drink?
Thank you, but if you don't mind,
I'd like to see the proprietor.
- Oh, you would?
- Yes.
All right.
This is The Paradise?
I'll say it is.
The hottest spot on the Barbary Coast.
- Hello, chica!
- Watch yourself, brother.
Wait here a minute, honey.
Say, Blackie, there's a little lady out here looking for a job.
She was burned out in that fire at the Bristol.
- Yeah?
- She's not bad.
All right, bring her in.
- This is Mr. Norton. He owns the joint.
- How do you do?
- Well, sister, what's your racket?
- I'm a singer.
Let's see your legs.
I said I'm a singer.
Well, all right. Let's see your legs.
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's see them.
A little thin for down here.
You know that number?
- Yes.
- All right. Let's hear you sing it.
I care not
For the stars that shine
I dare not hope to e'er be thine
I only know
I love you
Love me
And the world
Is mine
Well, you got a pretty fair set of pipes, kid.
What do you say to $75 a week?
I guess she fainted.
Yeah. Give me $75 a week, and I'll drop dead.
Hello, kiddo. Did you get some rest?
- Yes. Thank you.
- Good.
- Joe, get rid of this, will you?
- Yes, sir.
I want to thank you, Mr. Norton, for your kindness in...
Now never mind the etiquette.
Well, it was so stupid of me, fainting like that... but I haven't eaten much today and I...
But, it's true, isn't it?
You did offer me a job?
What's the matter? You want it in writing?
Well, no, but...
You're all right, honey.
- What's your name?
- Mary Blake.
Mary Blake, eh? Well, that's catchy.
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right with you.
- Where did you hail from?
- Benson, Colorado. That's near Denver.
- I see. Been here long?
- No, just a few weeks.
- Where have you been working?
- The Benson Public Library.
Singing?
No, I sang in the church on Sundays.
- Oh, so you sang in the church choir?
- Yes.
You see, it was my father's old church, and...
And your father is a preacher?
Well, yes. He was.
Was? Oh, he got onto himself, huh?
He died four years ago.
I get it.
The orphaned child of a country parson, eh?
Well, after all, Mr. Norton, there are such men as country parsons.
Sometimes they do have daughters.
Well, now that sort of puts me in my place, don't it?
- Well, who brought you to San Francisco?
- No one. My mother helped me get here.
Oh, I see.
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Why, sure, sure, I believe you.
You're all right, Mary.
Tomorrow we're going to get rid of those Benson glad rags... and dig you up some swell, new scenery.
You got all the makings, kid.
Why, you're going to do great.
What's the matter?
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.
Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You don't have to stall me, honey.
Well, you know,
I wrote that old spiel you just pulled... parson father, sacrificing mother, the whole thing, years ago.
I guess you got some John on the string.
Is that it?
Please let me go.
I see.
How much is the railroad fare here from Benson?
I paid $16.80.
Tomorrow morning I'll have Babe give you an advance in salary, $20.
And you can send for that mug you're stuck on.
You know, if there's anything I admire, it's a woman you can trust out of town.
Getting late.
You could bunk here, if you want to.
Try the sofa.
Good night, sucker.
Hey, Blackie, that professor's waiting for that new girl to show up for rehearsal.
- She hasn't showed up.
- That so?
- I guess we can forget her, huh?
- Yeah, forget her.
- Oh, am I relieved.
- No good, huh?
I'll say she's good.
Her father was a preacher.
What, are you falling for an old preacher gag?
Maybe her father was a preacher.
Oh, so you still believe in Santa Claus, huh?
Trouble with you is you don't believe in anything.
No, that's where I'm smart.
- Did you say smart?
- That's what I said.
I'm a sucker if I'll ever learn anything.
For 20 years, that big mug has been mauling me around... making a chump out of me, and I always come back for more.
Well, he got to bed earlier than you did last night.
Come on, get up.
I'm not going to move from this spot till you're out of the building.
All right, kid. So long, mug.
- Goodbye.
- That guy packs an awful wallop, don't he?
Yeah.
Is he gone?
- Look at the parade.
- Hello, Blackie.
- Hello, Mat.
- Hello, boys.
Blackie, would you like to...
Yeah, thanks.
Someone just showed me to a seat.
- Mat, get me my robe, will you?
- Okay.
Blackie, we've looked you up to complain about that fire... last night on Dupont Street.
Complain? Why, I thought it was perfect.
What do you boys want in the way of a fire?
Listen, you talk better at the meeting, sitting down.
Hey, listen, Blackie.
Jim Sullivan's kids got trapped in that fire last night.
- They had to jump for it.
- Yeah, I know. I saw them.
They pulled it off like circus performers.
Mr. Norton, you ain't got no kids.
I got plenty kids.
Luigi, Pedro, Maria and little Tony... and maybe one or two more when I get home.
Well, don't go home.
Well, look, boys, put me down for $100 for Jim and the kids, and tell them...
That isn't what we came for, Blackie.
We want you to let us run you for Supervisor.
- What?
- That's right, Blackie.
The only way to get some decent fire regulations on the Coast... is to force them through the Board of Supervisors.
And you're the only man on the Coast with the...
- Authority.
- To do it.
Sure, and there's nobody else crazy enough to fight... lxnay, shut up.
- Yeah, and maybe I'm not, either.
- I think it's a great idea.
- Hello, Father, good morning.
- Hello.
Why, certainly. It's dynamite.
Supervisor Norton.
Why, it'll get the joint a million dollars' worth of publicity.
- Well, what do you say?
- Where you gonna get the dough from?
We'll back you, Blackie.
- That's right.
- Up to the limit.
- Father Mullin, you speak to him.
- You like a fight, Blackie. Go on.
- Have you all gone crazy?
- I can't do anything with him.
I've been trying for 20 years.
Maybe you fellas can.
- So long. Good luck.
- Bye, Tim.
Well, Blackie, what about it?
- Come over to the bar. Let's have a drink.
- All right.
Can you imagine what that chesty
Nob Hill guy is going to say...
...since there won't be any competition.
- Mr. Norton, I tell you what.
The next boy my Maria give to me,
I name him Blackie after you.
Oh, name the next half-dozen after him.
You think it won't be a battle?
Say, he'll have all of Nob Hill floating around him like bees.
No, I think you fellas have all gone crazy.
- Oh, Mr. Norton.
- Yes? What is it?
May I have that job?
- Well, didn't I say so?
- Yes.
Well, how many times do you want me to say it?
Come on around here. Come on.
- What will you have, boys?
- Make mine a little whiskey.
- Whiskey.
- Whiskey. That's good.
Open your Golden Gate
You let no stranger wait
Outside your door
- Hiya, gentlemen.
- What'll you have to drink, Mat?
San Francisco
Some chloroform.
- Water for me.
- Water?
Here's looking at you, Blackie.
Gentlemen, thank you.
Other places only make me
Love you best
- Ain't she singing kind of slow, Blackie?
- Yeah.
Hope you ain't gone and signed her up.
Why? So you can grab her off for your joint?
Wait a minute. What do you think
I'm running here, a funeral parlor?
But, Blackie, with a voice like hers, it ain't so easy to...
Go on, go on. Get out.
Give it this.
Put something into it. Heat it up.
- That's what it's about, San Francisco.
- Oh, but I can't sing like that, Mr. Norton.
Well, that's the way you're going to sing... or you're not going to sing it for Blackie.
Hey, Mat.
- Go tell Babe to dig up a contract.
- A contract?
Yeah. I'd better sign that girl up before I change my mind.
Change your mind? Well, you've lost it.
I'd like to see Burley's face when he hears about it.
Open your Golden Gate
You let no stranger wait
Outside your door
Well, here's to Supervisor Norton.
Here is your wandering one
Saying, "I'll wander no more"
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me you're the heart
Of all the golden West
San Francisco
Welcome me home again
I'm coming home to go
Roaming
No
San Francisco
Open your Golden Gate
You let no stranger wait
Outside your door
San Francisco
Here is your wandering one
Saying, "I'll wander no more"
- Good evening, Mr. Burley.
- Good evening.
Show Mr. Burley and Signor Baldini to a box.
Yeah, sure. I was just going to.
All right, just a minute.
Blackie Norton around?
- Yeah.
- Tell him I'd like to see him.
Come with me. I'll take you right to him.
- Boss, couple of gentlemen to see you.
- All right.
- Hello, Blackie.
- Oh, hello, Burley.
Mr. Norton, Signor Baldini.
- How do you do?
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Gentlemen, what'll you have to drink?
- Maestro, my name is Hansen.
I played under your direction one night in Dresden.
- Really?
- Yes.
- I haven't been in Dresden in 20 years.
- Yes, that was the night.
- I'm happy, very happy, to see you again.
- Thank you.
Me, I'm nothing, but, Maestro, we have down here a voice... a voice that would delight your soul,
Maestro. A voice that would...
Professor, how about going on with the show?
Yes. Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Norton.
Maestro, this voice, if you could only hear it... is something good.
If you could hear it as I have heard it...
Professor!
We're trying to give a show tonight.
Yes. Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Norton.
Maestro, this voice,
I would like to have you hear it.
- Well, how about it?
- Yes. Yes. I'm going. I'm going.
- I guess you know why I'm down here.
- No.
I heard this afternoon you're going to run for supervisor.
Yeah, that's right.
- I wouldn't do it if I were you, Norton.
- Why not?
I don't think you'll like it.
I'll love it.
Well, now, have you ever stopped to consider...
Just a minute, Burley.
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir?
Tell Babe to go backstage and see what's the matter.
Yes, sir.
Something seems to have gone wrong with the...
Jack. Jack, that girl got a voice.
- Yes.
- She had some training, too.
Say, boss, you gonna let that crazy dame boss the show around?
Pipe down.
- Listen, Blackie...
- Beat it! Beat it!
Okay.
Then let music ring
While three voices sing
Pleasure is mine
Echoes repeating, measures retreating
Song of a heart light and free
Not a thought, not a care
With a heart debonair
I am free as the sea
Like the lark who at dawn
Bid the darkness be gone
So I sing merrily
With a laugh and a dance
My design to entrance
For I know not what will be
And the things that I bring
And the words that I sing
Is the song of a heart
That's free
- Bravo. Bravo.
- Brava. Brava.
- How long has that girl been down here?
- Just started.
- What's her name?
- Mary Blake.
What did I tell you, Maestro?
Was I wrong?
- Or was I...
- Will you get back to that piano?
Yes. I'm going.
And I don't care if you fire me.
At least I've had the opportunity to help a great...
Well, who said I was firing you?
- Now, come on. Get going.
- Yes. Thank you, Mr. Norton. Thank you.
I'd like to meet that girl.
- Waiter.
- Yes, Mr. Burley?
See if Miss Blake will meet a respectful admirer.
Yes, sir.
I haven't had her working the boxes yet, Burley.
I'm glad of that.
One never knows where one's going to find talent.
No. No, one never does, does one?
Yes, and I quote from Plautus.
Yeah. You took the words right out of my mouth.
Mr. Burley?
It's very gracious of you to allow us this privilege, Miss Blake.
- Thank you.
- May I present Signor Baldini?
- How do you do, signor?
- Good evening, my dear.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Waiter, a bottle of Cordon Rouge '94.
You bet, sir. And the usual for you?
Yes. A little water.
Hearing a voice like yours in the variety theater... has been for me a great experience.
Thank you, signor.
But you might have heard me under more favorable circumstances.
I sat in the outer office of the Tivoli for six days once.
Really?
- So you want to sing in opera?
- That's why I came to San Francisco.
- You have the training, too, huh?
- Yes, with the best teacher in Denver.
I led the Bach Choral Society,
I won first prize at the Schubert Festival... and I've done, Violetta, Marguerite...
Puccini's Mimi, and Tosca. I love Puccini.
Did you ever hear of Puccini, Norton?
Yeah. Didn't he run a joint down on Dupont Street?
There's no law against an opera singer being slender and young and beautiful.
What do you think about giving Miss Blake an audition?
Yes, by all means.
Say, that's darn sweet of you, Burley... to take an interest in the little lady, and you, too, signor... but, unfortunately, she's under a two-year contract.
- To whom?
- To me.
- Two years?
- Yes.
But I'll have her notify you the minute it runs out.
But surely you wouldn't let that stand in her way to sing in the Tivoli.
Why? She's doing all right here.
- I'm sorry, Miss Blake.
- Mr. Norton's quite right.
After all, Paradise is just as important to him... as the Tivoli is to you.
What would happen to the Tivoli... if its artists were allowed to walk out anytime they pleased?
You are a very loyal girl, Miss Blake.
No, I'm very grateful to Mr. Norton.
Well, I'll be going.
We don't have much time between numbers.
Thank you, signor.
This has been the happiest night of my life.
Goodnight. Thank you.
- Bye.
- I haven't given up yet about the Tivoli.
- You don't know Mr. Norton.
- You don't know me.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Just a minute. I want to see you.
Who told you to sing that highbrow number?
No one.
Well, now that you've made your impression, don't do it again.
Blackie doesn't like it.
Wait a minute.
Friend of mine runs a joint around on Kearney Street.
I want you to hurry around there, tear off a little number for him.
All right. Where is it?
St. Anne's Mission, just around the corner.
- St. Anne's?
- Yes. Ask for Father Mullin.
I guess you'd know all the hokey-pokey they sing in those traps.
Well, come on, get going. You've got a number to do back here at 10:30.
- We won't need that now.
- Thank you.
Burley, you don't want me to run for supervisor, eh?
You know as well as I it's not practical to rebuild the Coast.
No? Why not?
The Coast is picturesque.
People come down here slumming.
They don't want to feel like they're in a spotless town.
- Yes, but that isn't your real reason.
- That's one of them.
But the main one is you don't want to spend your dough... to make your property down here safe.
If I did what you wanted me to, to my property... it would be a calamity for the Coast.
- How do you figure that?
- In the first place... the Burley Estate has got to make certain interest on its investment.
I'd have to raise rents.
Why, you boys couldn't live.
You'd have to charge 10 cents for a glass of beer.
You know, I don't get him, Mr. Baldini.
He tosses a fortune every year into the Tivoli Opera House.
But that's not business.
That's for San Francisco.
- Yeah, the Coast is San Francisco, too.
- That's why I wouldn't change it.
Well, Burley, these little mugs down here are my people.
And I'm gonna see that they get a square deal.
So I'm not pulling out of this fight.
I don't want to fight you, Norton, but you're asking for it.
I'm not ducking anything.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
- You're wanted on the phone, boss.
- Okay.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Tim.
I've finished the service, so why don't you come on over?
What for?
For the organ recital and to hear the young lady sing.
She'll be coming back here to sing the things I like.
All right, have it your own way.
I was just sort of hoping you'd make my evening complete.
If I had you here now, I'd hug you and then I'd knock your block off.
I guess I don't have to tell you again how I feel about the organ.
- Forget it.
- All right, Blackie. Goodbye.
- Oh, Father, that was simply marvelous.
- And that little boy, wasn't he sweet?
It's pretty late now.
Can you get home all right?
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hey, Mike.
- Yes, Father?
- Got any money?
- Sure, Father. Me wife's got a job.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.
- Good night, Father Mullin.
- It was very nice of you... to leave your work and come to our rescue.
It made me feel good being here.
You're not the girl whose father was a preacher, are you?
Well, yes. How do you know?
Blackie told me.
Come in here, won't you?
I'd like to talk to you.
- Oh, but I'm afraid I'll be late.
- That's all right. I'll fix it with Blackie.
- Will you join me in a cup of coffee?
- Yes. I'd like to. Thank you.
I make good coffee.
How are you making out at The Paradise?
- Well, I've only just started.
- I see. Sit down there, won't you?
- Thank you.
- How do you like Blackie?
I'm afraid of him.
And he's someone to be afraid of.
He's as unscrupulous with women as he is ruthless with men.
But why did he send me down here?
I don't understand him.
- You don't, huh?
- No.
What's the matter?
You probably understand Blackie... a whole lot better than he understands you.
You see, I don't think Blackie ever knew your type of woman before.
But there's nothing to be afraid of, unless you're afraid of yourself.
Are you?
No.
No, I guess I'm a little dazed.
You see, I've been in San Francisco for over six weeks... and nothing ever happened.
And then, within the last 24 hours, the whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
Makes me feel like running home.
Well, if you are afraid, you'd better run home.
How about it?
- I'm going to stay.
- That's right.
You're in probably the wickedest, most corrupt... most godless city in America.
Sometimes it frightens me.
I wonder what the end is going to be.
But nothing can harm you if you don't allow it to... because nothing in the world, no one in the world, is all bad.
Do you know who gave the chapel that organ we've been dedicating tonight?
The most godless, scoffing and unbelieving soul in all San Francisco.
Blackie Norton.
Yes, Blackie heard one night that I was saving for an organ.
The very next morning men arrived to plan the installation.
Cost him $4,000.
You know, if that monkey would save his money for a couple weeks... he'd be a rich man.
He's a tremendous force, Blackie is.
If he were only a force for good instead of evil.
I've tried to do something with him for years... but I haven't had any luck.
Maybe I'm not the right one.
You've known each other a long time, haven't you?
Oh, sure, sure.
Blackie and I were kids together.
Born and brought up on the Coast.
We used to sell newspapers in the joints along Pacific Street.
Blackie was the leader of all the kids in the neighborhood... and I was his pal.
Our families used to try to get us to go to mass on Sunday... but we generally ducked.
That reminds me, that Rooney kid ducked mass.
And then I got so I wanted to go.
Blackie thought I was crazy.
And when I made up my mind
I was going to study for the priesthood...
I wanted to talk to Blackie.
I wanted to see if I couldn't get him to understand... to feel a little bit as I felt... but he just said, "Well, good luck, sucker," and that was all.
We never were able to have that talk.
I came back from college... and found Blackie deeper than ever in the life of the Coast. He's gone right on.
But he has a code. He's always had, ever since he's been a kid.
He never lied, he never cheated... and I'm sure he never took an underhanded advantage of anyone.
There's a picture of us together when we were kids.
Don't let him know
I told you about the organ.
- Boy, he'd never forgive me.
- Oh, no. Oh, no, I won't.
He's that way, Blackie is.
Ashamed of his good deeds as other people are ashamed of their sins.
But nobody in the world will ever make me believe... there isn't a whole lot more good than there is bad in Blackie Norton.
Holy smoke! The coffee.
Ladies and gentlemen... introducing the President... of the Ladies' Blackie Norton Club...
Miss Della Bailey!
Girls and boys, I just want to tell you that the ladies of the Coast... wish to go on record as endorsing Blackie Norton... right up to the limit!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I will now introduce that great guy... our candidate.
Born on the Coast, raised on the Coast... lives on the Coast, a-vying for the Coast... our champion, Blackie Norton!
Thanks. Thanks.
I'm no politician.
I didn't ask for this, but now that I'm in it...
I won't stop until I get some decent fire laws... for our people down on the Coast.
Wait a minute, Norton.
What I want to know is, what construction company... is paying you for trying to rebuild the Coast?
Yeah. That's right. How about it, Blackie?
Why are you going into politics?
Go on, Norton, tell us.
Here's the answer you can take to your boss, Jack Burley.
We've tried long enough to get a square deal... from those potbellied landowners up on Nob Hill.
Now we're going to go after it on our own!
Wait a minute. Tommy, come here.
This is Jim Sullivan's kid.
Last New Year's Eve... he and his sister had to jump three floors out of a burning building.
Are we going to go on letting these Nob Hill stiffs... make fire dancers out of our women and kids?
Not if I can help it!
And now, free beer on me!
Kiddo, you were swell.
I'm so proud of you, I...
Yeah, yeah, now thanks.
You run along and get yourself some beer.
But, Blackie, aren't we going to be together?
Well, I told you I'd be busy when I brought you out here.
- I'll wait for you.
- Over there by that first beer truck.
You get yourself a drink. That's a girl.
Professor, will you do a favor for me?
Sure. What is it?
Go over there and get Trixie and take her back to town.
- To town?
- Yeah.
She's hanging around those beer trucks getting stiff.
Then what about Miss Blake?
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do?
You know, I brought Miss Blake out here.
That's all right.
I'll see that she gets home all right.
That's awful pretty. Know the name of it?
Would You?
Would I what?
- Glad you came?
- Yes.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Do you mind going a little faster, please?
I promised Father Mullin I'd stop by if I had time.
Yeah, sure.
Go on. Giddap, Dan.
You and Tim seem to be hitting it off pretty well.
Oh, yes.
- What do you talk about?
- Lots of things. His work, mostly.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
You believe in that hocus-pocus, don't you?
Yes.
Even if I hadn't believed, the faith of a man like Father Mullin would make me.
Yeah, that's the trouble.
It gets hold of people that are all right and makes monkeys out of them.
It lost me Tim Mullin.
Why, he'd have made the greatest gambler the Coast has ever had.
The only mug I ever wanted to hang on to.
He loves you more than anyone else in the world.
Yeah? Well, he blew me for a lot of plaster saints.
You know, I don't go for that sucker competition, Mary.
Blackie's got to be number one boy.
But it isn't competition.
I think people who believe in something can love each other more.
Yeah. Honey, if that's what you believe, it's all right with me.
I don't hold it against you.
- Say, who's that mug you're stuck on?
- No one.
- Well, didn't there used to be?
- No.
- Never?
- Never, no.
Whoa.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
Well, I'm a sucker if I ever knew a girl like you before.
Come on. Get along there, Dan.
You must have had to do some fast footwork... to side-step those dudes out there in Benson, Colorado, huh?
It wasn't so difficult, Mr. Norton.
Blackie.
Blackie.
That's better.
He holds her in his arms
Would you? Would you?
He tells her of her charms
Would you? Would you?
They met as you and I
And they were only friends
But before the story ends
He'll kiss her with a sigh
Would you? Would you?
If the girl were I
Would you? Would you?
And would you dare to say
Let's do the same as they
I would
Would you?
Well, that lets me out.
- That all your dough you got left?
- Every dime.
Here's $100, Edgar.
Go get yourself a cup of coffee.
Gee, thanks, Blackie.
I guess I'm gonna get some sleep.
- Hey, Chick. Put this stuff away, will you?
- Okay.
- Hello, Mr. Burley.
- Good morning.
Well, good morning, Burley.
Anything I can do for you?
Yes, I want to buy that contract that you have with Miss Blake.
What makes you think it's for sale?
I don't see why you're so stubborn about it, Norton.
- You might be needing money.
- I'm doing all right.
You may be in for a few difficulties down here.
What do you mean difficulties?
Did you ever hear of the Johnson-Addi gambling ordinance?
Yep.
You know you're operating against the law.
Well, so's every other joint in San Francisco.
Well, I'm just telling you, that's all.
You've taken quite an interest in the little lady, haven't you?
I'm only interested in making her a useful member... of the Tivoli opera company.
Yeah. Now isn't that sweet of you?
I'll tell you what I'll do, Burley.
If the little lady wants to leave me, you can have her contract for nothing.
- Mary.
- Yes?
Come here a minute, will you?
You're taking a long chance, Blackie.
Yeah. Maybe I got an ace or two in the hole, too.
- Oh, Mr. Burley.
- Good morning, Miss Blake.
- I'd like to thank you for the lovely roses.
- I'm so glad you liked them.
Sit down, kid.
Mr. Burley wants to buy your contract from me.
I told you I wasn't giving up.
You really think I'm ready for the Tivoli?
Yes, but what's more important,
Baldini thinks so.
What do you say, kid?
Would you like to sell my contract,
Mr. Norton?
Nope.
I'm very sorry. I can't accept.
Too bad, Burley.
I hope I can do you a favor some time.
Thanks, Norton.
Would you thank Signor Baldini for me?
You've both been more than kind.
It's been a pleasure.
And I hope to show you another side of San Francisco, if I may.
Thank you.
- Goodbye, Norton.
- So long.
You wouldn't take $5,000 to tear up that contract, would you?
- Nope.
What are you trying to do?
Make an impression?
I told him he could have your contract for nothing... if you wanted to leave me.
I'm afraid the Tivoli will have to struggle along, Burley.
Did you do that, Blackie?
Sure. You made your own choice, kid.
And I hope you'll never be sorry,
Miss Blake. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
That was awfully generous of you.
About the contract, I mean.
Oh, forget it. Say, look, kid.
You've heard a lot about the Tivoli opera house... from a bunch of mugs that never get anywhere.
Now I'm going to tip you off to a few facts about The Paradise.
Come on.
- Never been in here, have you?
- No.
Well, I don't do much office work, but here's where I keep my records.
Take a hinge at those cups.
Every year, the wine agents in town...
Freddie Duane and all the rest of them pull off an event called the Chicken's Ball.
- Did you ever hear of it?
- No.
I thought not.
You know what happens at that ball?
They have a competition and give a prize of $10,000 in gold... to the proprietor of the joint who puts on the most artistic show.
And you know the joint that's won it three times running?
The Paradise.
- Well, that's fine.
- Yep, for artistic achievement.
That's what they said in the speech when they slipped me the trophy.
Artistic achievement.
- That's wonderful.
- Well, isn't that telling you?
I'm gonna win it the next time, too.
And the dough goes to the campaign fund... for those little mugs down here on the Coast.
You know,
I like to look into those big lamps of yours.
You know, if you ever decide to cut any of this, I'll put some in my watch.
I'm crazy about you, kid.
You know it, don't you?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- You look kind of scared.
- I guess maybe I am.
- Of what?
- You.
Are you sure it's me you're afraid of?
Well, kid. What do you think we ought to do about it?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Because you don't want to, maybe.
If that's it, don't be afraid to spill it, and we'll call it a day.
- Oh, but it isn't right.
- What isn't right?
For a man and a woman to be stuck on each other?
Have you anything better than that out in Colorado?
If you have, I'd like to take a whirl at it.
It must be immense.
How does it feel to feel like a woman and be afraid of it?
Oh, Blackie, listen.
If you're going to preach, Mary, please sing.
That's what I believe in.
Your voice. The way you move.
The way you stand on those pretty little feet of yours.
That's what I believe in.
Don't you believe in anything more than that?
- What more is there?
- God.
God?
Hey, isn't he supposed to be taking care of the suckers... that come out of the missions... looking for something to eat and a place to sleep?
I've seen them down on their knees asking for things... they should stand up and fight for.
I don't see God coming down and giving the suckers a shortcut.
That's not what I want.
I want to push over the mugs that stand in my way... before they push me over.
What I believe in is not up in the air.
It's in here, and in here.
But maybe that's not right.
Maybe it's not right to feel alive, like you and I feel this minute.
But I think it's right.
You know, Mary, I want to get a kick out of things I can see.
Like lights on the harbor, or a good fight, or a woman worth looking at.
Did you ever taste a fog in your mouth like it was salt... or take hold of someone and feel your blood rushing up like a river?
What more does a man need, or a woman, either?
You know, I never tried to kid you, Mary.
You take me as I am, or you don't take me.
Tim doesn't try to change me, because he knows he can't... and you can't, either.
Nothing can.
You know what I've been waiting for?
I've been waiting to hear you say that I'm all right with you the way I am.
Maybe you're ready to say it now.
Are you?
I don't know.
Well, it's about time.
It's going to be swell, baby.
I'll make you queen of the Coast.
You'll ride through town in your own carriage... and everybody will know who you are.
I'll plaster your name and face clear to the Golden Gate.
You and I together, Mary... are gonna find out that we don't need anything else but us.
Look.
How about going upstairs and having some chop suey, huh?
Come on.
Will you watch me, and keep your mind on my feet?
Watch this wing.
See? That's it.
Then you do a sort of a...
What's the matter with you?
Come on, let's...
Yeah, that's right, Trixie.
You can knock off.
Everybody's gonna have champagne on me!
Dig up some of that Pommery Sec for the boys and girls.
All we've got is Semillon.
That champagne is starting to make me fizzy.
Fast or a guy gets killed.
Can I order you some breakfast, Blackie?
No, thanks. Mary and I are gonna have some chop suey upstairs.
Mary, I have another new number
I'd like to have you try out.
Oh, no, no. Not this morning.
Hey, Mat! Tell Charlie to...
No, never mind. I'll tell him myself.
Stay right here, honey.
I won't be a minute.
Gee, I haven't had any champagne since...
Nice going, sister. You done all right.
Knock off there, Maggie.
You're going to have champagne.
- Me, too?
- Well, I'd like to know why not.
Mr. Blackie, I haven't had any of that for a long time.
Well, you're gonna have some right now.
Here's to Blackie!
All right, drink.
- Where's Mary?
- I guess she went upstairs to set the table.
And here's to you, darling.
And I wish I had me youth.
I wish I'd never had mine.
- Nix, nix, Trix.
- Why, Trixie. That's not nice, baby.
Tell Mary here's to her!
- Babe.
- Yeah.
- When that runs out, open up some more.
- You bet I will.
Tell Mary here's to her, Blackie.
Sure. "Everyone to his own taste," the old lady said as she kissed the cow.
Ain't that a...
What's the matter, no sense of humor?
Oh, Blackie!
Hello, Tim.
I just came over to talk to you about the campaign, kid.
Oh, well, look, Tim, do you mind coming back a little later?
Sure. Sure.
By the way, Blackie, I just saw Mary.
Yeah. I put her in a cab.
She said to tell you goodbye... and that she was taking you up on your offer to let her out of that contract.
What? What's that?
Well, you said she could go, didn't you?
- Well, yes, but...
- She's gone to the Tivoli.
And I'm glad you did it, Blackie.
This was no place for her.
- Oh, you think not, eh?
- Of course not.
Neither did you, did you?
I guess you think she's better off at the Tivoli... under the management of Jack Burley, huh?
She'll be safe with Burley, Blackie.
You see, she doesn't love him.
Hey, look, Tim.
You like chop suey, don't you?
- Chop... Sure.
- Come upstairs. We're gonna have some.
- Good evening, ladies.
- Oh, hello.
Good evening, and get out.
The child has a performance to give.
Oh, no, please.
We've got to thank him for all this.
Do let him stay.
- Alone, I suppose.
- That's right.
Come on, Louise.
In my day, the opera came first.
- My mother's out there tonight, Mary.
- Is she?
Yes, she came all the way back from New York.
I guess she got tired of reading about you in my letters.
Well, in a few hours, you'll be famous.
Before the whole town is at your feet,
I want to put in my bid.
I love you, Mary, and I want you to marry me.
I've always wanted you, from the moment I first set eyes on you... but I didn't realize then how I wanted you.
- Well, I...
- Please don't try to answer me now.
I just wanted you to know how I felt.
Good luck, darling.
- How you do, Mr. Burley?
- Good evening.
- How do you do, Mr. Burley?
- Fine, thank you.
- How are you, Mr. Burley?
- Fine, thanks.
Thank you.
I'll be right with you, darling.
Want to take a look out front.
Hello, there, Mr. Burley.
- Hello, there.
- Jonathan.
- What a thrilling first night.
- I hope so.
Good evening, Mr. Burley.
- We can't wait to hear the new star.
- Good evening.
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello.
- Have you seen Signor Baldini?
- Not yet, sir.
- Hello, Jack. Big night, eh?
- I hope so, Senator.
- Hi.
- Good evening.
Hello, Norton.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- I didn't know you were a first-nighter.
- I am tonight. I came to close you up.
- You came to what?
- Close you up.
You got a girl appearing here that's under contract to me.
No, you're wrong.
You abrogated that contract.
You gave her permission to leave.
Sure, sure, I gave her a choice, and she said she'd stay with me.
So the contract stands.
Look. See that man over there?
The one with the big black mustache?
Well, that big, stupid-looking man represents the law... and he's got a piece of paper in his pocket... that's going to stop your prima donna... right in the middle of her first cantata.
- Now, isn't that just awful?
- You wouldn't do that.
Well, I'm sorry, Burley, but I thoughtlessly got the man started... and I can't do a thing with him.
- Well, I guess I'll get my star.
- Wait a minute.
She doesn't go on till the second act.
What? Now that's not very good showmanship.
We'll wait. I don't want to listen to those others mugs.
Well, while you're waiting, would you have a cigar?
Yeah, thanks.
Pardon me. I'll get them.
Excuse me. I want to speak to Mr. Baldini.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
What is it?
Hello? Hello, Central. Fillmore, 2871.
Norton's outside with the Sheriff to stop Mary Blake.
- Stop her?
- Yes. During the performance.
He can't do that.
Hello, is Mr. Davis there? Maybe he can.
Hello, Davis? This is Jack Burley.
I want you to hurry over to the Tivoli Opera House... with a restraining order to hold up a process.
What's that? I don't care if the office closed 10 hours ago. Find him.
But I've got to have it.
- But what is it?
- You go backstage. I'll see what I can do.
- Well, here you are, Norton.
- Oh, thanks.
Thank you.
- Have a peanut?
- No, thanks.
- Cameo here, huh?
- Yes.
I didn't think you knew that brand down at The Paradise.
Yeah, that's right.
You know, you needn't have bothered to call up Davis, Burley.
I could have told you that deputy of his was away on a deep-sea fishing trip.
He's just crazy about fishing, so I chartered him a boat.
How about you and I make a deal?
I'll give you $15,000 for that contract.
Well, I'd like to oblige you, Burley, but, you see, the thing is out of my hands.
That process server is the meanest man west of the Rocky Mountains.
He'd push his mother off a ferry boat for half a dollar.
Yeah, he'd turn the air off in a baby's incubator... just to watch the little sucker squirm.
Well, Jim, what do you say?
The quicker I stop her, the quicker we get home.
Remind me not to order any of these for The Paradise.
Right.
That's kind of pretty, ain't it?
Yeah.
Sit down.
Hey, what's the idea?
I didn't come to this opera to hear the opera.
Sit down.
Blackie, I think she's great.
Yeah, not bad.
Seems a kind of shame to choke her off, huh?
Yeah.
He's gone around back.
It's all right.
There's nothing to worry about. Just him.
Thank you.
Thank you so much. Darling!
Wonderful!
- Blackie.
- Hello, kid.
- Madame Albani...
- Oh, I understand.
It looks like Burley's getting a little careless... putting things down on paper.
Yes. He's asked me to marry him.
No. On the level?
You know, you were all right tonight, kid.
- Did you really think so, Blackie?
- Yes.
Say, who am I to hold out against these 3,000 mugs... that went goofy over you?
See, I never caught this opera racket up to now.
- How long has that been going on?
- Only about 150 years.
No fooling?
Well, it's all right.
You know, I was proud of you tonight.
- Is that all?
- AII?
- Don't you love me?
- Sure, sure.
Well, you haven't said so.
Well, I love you, kid.
Do you know, I never sprang that line but once, 25 years ago.
Who was she?
Just a girl I knew. I haven't seen her lately.
She's up in San Quentin.
So I'm the second?
No, you're the first.
Will you marry me, Blackie?
Marry you?
Well, I'm a sucker.
If you ain't the most domestic woman...
Well, I suppose if that's the only thing in the world would make you happy.
You know, the gang always said I'd be a sucker.
Oh, Blackie.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Come in.
- Hello, Blackie. How are you, boy?
- Feeling pretty fit.
- Mary, you were great.
- Thank you.
I had to battle my way through half of San Francisco to get here.
Father Tim, Blackie and I, we're going to be married.
Yup. That's right.
The little girl harpooned me.
Well, I guess you know how I feel about it, don't you, Mary?
So she harpooned you, huh?
A girl that any man in San Francisco would give his right arm for... but she had to harpoon you.
Blackie, I'm not going to wish you the best of everything... because you've got it already.
Thanks, Tim.
Now I know you folks would like me to stay... but I really have to go.
Really. I'm sorry.
- Of course if you insist, I could stay.
- Will you get out?
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry, Father.
Mary, you haven't changed yet.
Well, Norton.
I just thought I'd come back and congratulate my fiancйe.
Your...
I'm sorry, Jack.
Gee, you better get out of that rig, baby.
The gang are waiting to celebrate your homecoming.
- Where?
- Down home in The Paradise.
They're waiting to hear you sing San Francisco.
- At The Paradise?
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
You don't mean to say that you're going to send her back there now?
Well, sure.
What kind of a chump do you think I am?
I'm going to marry her, ain't I?
Well, what do you want, kid?
Me or this?
- Evening, Father.
- Good evening.
- Great business tonight.
- Tell Mr. Norton I'd like to see him.
Thank you.
- Blackie back here?
- Yeah.
- Where is he?
- Where do you think? In there.
Come in.
Gee, she looks pretty sharp, huh?
She's all right.
Say, Blackie, Father Tim's out there.
He wants to see you.
Well, all right. Bring him back.
Okay.
- You know, you're a funny kid.
- Why?
Why, the way you act, anyone would think that it wasn't becoming.
- Are you happy?
- Yes. Yes, yes, I'm happy.
That's good.
Blackie, Blackie, let's set the date for our wedding now... so we can tell Father Tim when he comes in.
Yeah, sure. Any time.
Oh, but, look, it's got to be after election.
Really?
Sure, sure, the mob down here know how I've always kidded that sort of thing.
I can't back down now... and make a fool of myself just before election.
It would lose me too many votes.
It means a lot to me to win this fight, honey.
Not just for putting it over on Burley, but for the Coast.
You understand?
Yes. Yes, I do. I do understand.
But the first chance I get... we'll sneak off to Sacramento... and I'll let you slip the halter on me.
Say, I never thought
I'd be so goofy about anyone.
Come in.
- Hello, Tim.
- Good evening, Father.
What's wrong?
Are you out of your mind?
Why?
Showing Mary like this to that mob out there.
Like this? What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with her?
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong with my being proud to show her off?
Blackie, don't you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
Wait a minute, Tim.
I'm making her queen of the Coast.
You see those posters there?
Five thousand of them will be plastered... all over San Francisco by tomorrow morning.
And 10,000 other ones for ashcans and the front of trolley cars.
I'm not going to let you do this, Blackie.
I don't get you, Tim.
You never butted in on me before.
Well, I am now.
You're not going to exploit this girl.
Come here, Mary.
Will you tell his holiness... that you made up your own mind to come back?
I love him, Father.
That isn't love, Mary.
Is that so? Well, it happens to suit me.
It isn't love to let him drag you down to his level.
Say, wait a minute, Tim.
I'm going to marry her.
Not if I can stop you, you're not going to marry her.
You can't take a woman in marriage and then sell her immortal soul.
Immortal soul?
Now, look, I don't go for that kind of talk, Tim.
Don't believe in that nonsense and never have.
You better get back to the half-wits that do.
Blake's on next.
Come on, Mary. Come with me.
Just one minute. I'm running this joint.
You take care of your suckers.
I'll take care of mine.
She's not going out there.
I've listened to this psalm-singing blather of yours for years and never squawked.
You can't bring it in here. This is my joint!
Miss Blake. Miss Mary Blake.
She's not going out there.
The place is crazy without you.
Get out there, kid.
Wait a minute.
You leave now, and you're never coming back.
Hey, Blackie. Hey, Blackie, it's Burley.
He's giving the joint the works.
- I told you, you can't buck a guy like...
- Shut up.
Blackie, come on. Take a gander at this thing, will you? Look at it. Come on.
Hey, Blackie, break it up!
Look what they're doing to our joint.
You see what they're doing, Blackie?
- Good afternoon, Mr. Burley.
- Good afternoon, Allen.
- Mrs. Burley in?
- Yes, sir. She's in the small salon.
- What do you think of our little shack?
- But it's magnificent.
We really only have one real treasure.
She's waiting to meet you.
You needn't sneak up on me.
I know you're there.
Mary.
This is my mother.
- How do you do, my dear?
- How do you do, Mrs. Burley?
Well, Maisie, have you been in the house all day?
Oh, sure, I just got back from the races.
Why, you're even prettier close to than you were from me box at the Tivoli.
- So are you, Mrs. Burley.
- Go on with you. Get out.
- Get out? Me?
- Certainly you.
If I have to sell this amazing, beautiful creature... the idea of joining the Burley family... sure I got to tell her lies about us that, heaven help me... no son should hear his mother speak.
Will you call me as soon as you've made the sale?
Get out! Get out!
- Sit down, my dear. Take off your coat.
- Thank you.
Now tell me, why won't you marry my boy?
Mrs. Burley, you belong to the aristocracy of San Francisco.
I'm just the daughter of a country parson.
I haven't had the advantage
Jack deserves in a wife.
Wait a minute, darling.
I didn't mean what I said just now about telling lies.
You and I are gonna speak the truth to each other.
I think I know what it's all about.
It's that rapscallion, Blackie Norton, you were working for... down on Pacific Street.
Now listen, Mary.
I'm an old lady, and I've been through a lot in my life.
I came to San Francisco in the winter of '51... in a sailing vessel around the Horn.
When I got here, there were 150 males to one female.
And if I do say it, I shouldn't,
I wasn't so hard to look at.
I started business in a shack near Portsmouth Square doing washing.
Do you know how long me business lasted?
No.
About 45 minutes.
They busted me tub to smithereens, and there was a free-for-all fight... between five of the big swells of the town to see which one would take me to lunch.
So, you see, I got to know men.
I knew all kinds in them early days... and among them was a man like Blackie Norton.
He was a selfish and sinful... and adorable scoundrel.
So, you see,
I've had my Blackie Norton, too.
And you gave him up?
Yes, yes, I gave him up.
Because he was killing me soul.
Killing your soul?
And I pulled myself together, and one day I married Burley.
Burley was a good, solid man.
He never got used to wearing his coat till the day he died.
But he built me this mansion... and every cuspidor of the place was 18-carat gold.
And there came a time when I was glad I married him... because he loved me.
After a while, Jack was born, and I had me peace.
Look, Mary, you say we're the aristocracy of San Francisco.
We are.
Listen.
Come here, Mary.
Listen to that.
That's the McDonough mansion.
Aristocrats.
And that party's been going on for two days and nights straight running.
There isn't a rougher joint on the whole Barbary Coast... than that home right here on Nob Hill.
They call this the wickedest city in the world... and it's a bitter shame, it is.
For deep down underneath all our evil and sin... we've got right here in San Francisco the finest set of human beings... that was ever rounded up on one spot.
Sure, they had to have wild adventure in their hearts... and dynamite in their blood to set out for here in the first place.
That's why they're so full of untamed deviltry now.
But we can't go on like this.
Sinful and blasphemous, with no fear for God in our hearts.
That's the reason why I want my boy to have a good woman near him... and raise fine, beautiful kids for the glory of our heritage.
You can make a fine man of him.
And maybe one day... you'll be proud that you met up with the family... of old Maisie Burley, the washerwoman.
- I'm glad I know you now, Mrs. Burley.
- Maisie to you, darling.
Maisie.
Jiggers! Jiggers! The joint's pinched!
- Wait a minute. Where you going?
- It's closing here.
It's gonna be closed, so where you going?
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- Go on, you kids. Get back to the stage.
- Get out!
- Come on!
- No rough stuff now. Nobody get hurt.
- Good evening, Charlie.
- Good evening, lad. Sorry I have to do this.
- What's the charge?
- Serving liquor without a license.
- We've got a license!
- It's been revoked.
- What'll the rap be, Charlie?
Probably $5,000 fine and a year in jail.
- You know Judge Cardigan.
- Yeah, I know him.
But Burley knows him better.
I'd like to help you, but you know
I have me wife and me kids to care for.
Yes, yes. I understand, Charlie.
Look, I've been counting on winning that prize money from the Chicken's Ball.
Will you give me a couple hours to rustle up bail and get my entertainers out?
Well...
How about being at the station before 6:00 in the morning?
Okay, I'll be there. Thanks.
It's an outrage.
Burley's timed this so that you can't cop that prize money tonight.
- Come on, Babe, let's take a ride.
- Will you bring me back?
- That's up to him.
- I'll have you all out in plenty of time.
Well, Blackie, had enough?
- Hello. What's eating you?
- We can't fight Burley, Blackie.
So he's got you buffaloed, eh?
It's tough, but if we trail along with you we'll get just what you're getting.
And none of us can afford to be raided.
I'm not here on my own.
The boys sent me.
The district's full of little mugs who are counting on me to go through for 'em.
- And I'm going through.
- Now wait a minute.
You haven't done any business since they started raiding you.
Where are you going to get the money to carry on your campaign?
Whoever wins that $10,000 tonight could carry us clear through the campaign.
- Not if I win it.
- Why not? It's a good investment.
We'll build a new Coast that'll top anything San Francisco's ever known.
The old Coast has been pretty good to me, Blackie, yes... and it's been pretty good to you, too.
Up to now.
Well, I'm not going to quit.
Are you fighting for the Coast, or are you fighting Burley for a personal reason?
We think that it's personal. And we've had a bellyful of this boudoir battle.
So long.
Get away! Don't you dare take my purse!
- Want anything from inside, Blackie?
- What?
No.
Well, I guess I might as well turn out the lights.
By golly, that's right.
There's no use of running up your light bill.
You can't do that!
You know, that's the first time the joint's ever been locked.
I threw the key away the night it opened.
See you before 6:00, Blackie.
Come on, let's get going here, now.
Come on.
- Come on. Break it up.
- Paper!
Get your early morning paper!
- Hiya, Blackie.
- Oh, hello, Bill.
- Have a paper.
- Yeah, thanks.
That's all right. It's on me tonight.
Paper!
Get your paper! Early morning edition!
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.
- Oh, you're jealous.
That's the matter with you.
- Mary, I love you.
- I'm glad.
Mr. Burley, the caterers are here from the Poodledog Restaurant.
Fine. Have them put the tables on the stage.
Yes, sir.
- You'd better look after things, dear.
- Right, as usual.
Oh, wait. You forgot to ask the stagehands for the banquet.
- Did I?
- I asked them.
Darling.
- All right, boys. Let's start the music.
- Father Mullin.
- Mary.
- Were you out front tonight?
Your last night?
I'm glad someone of the old crowd remember me.
I got my invitation to your wedding, Mary.
- Are you coming?
- Of course.
Good.
Mary, are you happy?
Yes. Yes, I'm happy.
Then everything's all right.
- Good night, my dear.
- Won't you stay and join our party?
No, I'm sorry. I must run along.
Well, good night.
God bless you.
Is madame tired?
No, no. I'm quite all right, thank you.
Come in.
- They're calling for you, dear.
- But I've got to change.
Don't bother now.
Change before we go to the ball.
- The ball?
- Why, sure.
We're going to wind up at the Chicken's Ball.
- Oh, no, Jack.
- Why not?
- Well, I...
- That's all right, dear.
I happen to know that Blackie Norton won't be there.
"Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you die."
- Dead men don't have any fun.
- That's right.
Alice, look what I found in one of the dressing rooms.
Well, I can recommend him, honey.
He's my cousin.
Good evening. Just this way, please.
Good evening, folks.
Do you mind if I sit down?
- Hello, Della. I'm glad to see you again.
- You won't be for long.
I just dropped over to tell you what I think of you.
You know, I haven't seen this woman... since she walked out on the best man in San Francisco... to marry the town's number one rodent.
- I think you better go, Della.
- Oh, no.
I've got a few things
I want to tell you, too.
Now, in case you folks don't follow me,
I'll tell you that this mouse here... has just had a padlock put on The Paradise... and thrown all of
Blackie Norton's performers in jail.
That's what Blackie got for picking this phony up out of the gutter...
- and giving her a chance.
- Come on, folks.
Hold still.
Don't think I want to breathe the air near you... any longer than I have to.
You ought to make that mouse awfully happy.
Here's a five spot, brother.
I'm buying back me introduction to you.
Ladies and gentlemen, now... that distinguished proprietor, that illustrious showman...
"Alaska" Joe Kelso presents... the Golden Gate Trio.
There's a big sensation
Going around the town
Called the Philippine dance
Philippine dance
Blackie!
Beat it, will you?
All right, Della.
How about it, kid? Did you get them out?
Well, what's the matter?
Aren't there any hockshops open?
No. It wasn't any use.
My troupe's being held without bail.
Without bail?
- There they are now, celebrating.
- Who?
Burley and your ex-nightingale.
Are they?
He won't be satisfied until you're under a wet rock.
Why don't you go over and curl that dude's mustache...
- and I'll kiss the lady with a bottle?
- Forget it, doll.
Thanks just the same.
You're a sweetheart if there ever was one.
- You know, didn't I give you this one?
- Yeah. You were just a kid.
Yeah, that's right.
Go get him, Swanee
- Where you going, Blackie?
- Over to my place.
Well, I got to pack up a few things.
I may be taking a little trip.
- I'll go help you.
- No, no, no.
You stay here and see the show.
You come over later and tell me who won.
- Blackie, they say you'll go up for a year!
- No, no. I can handle it.
But I'm worried about the others.
Gee, Blackie.
You're kind to all that you love.
Ladies and gentlemen... the last entry of the evening was supposed to have been... from Mr. Blackie Norton's Paradise.
But, as it is now 4:30, and the performers have failed to arrive... why, we'll close the show without them.
Mr. Duane.
I'm representing The Paradise for Mr. Norton.
Mary, I forbid you to go up there.
- Dave.
- Yeah?
- Know where Blackie Norton lives?
- Sure.
- Well, go get him.
- You bet.
Ladies and gentlemen, representing The Paradise Cafe...
Miss Mary Blake.
Play San Francisco.
It only takes a tiny corner of
This great big world
To make the place we love
My home upon the hill
I find I love you still
I've been away, but now I'm back
To tell you
San Francisco
Open your Golden Gate
You let no stranger wait
Who's a-knockin', who's a-knockin'
Outside of your door
San Francisco
Here comes your wandering one
And I'm saying, and I'm saying
That I'm gonna wander no more
Other places, other places
Only make me love you best
Tell me, tell me
You're the heart of the golden West
The golden West
San Francisco
Welcome me home again
I'm coming home to go a-roamin'
No more
Come on, everybody!
Join in the chorus with me!
San Francisco
Welcome me home again
Come on! Everybody sing!
Sing, everybody!
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me, tell me
You're the heart of the West
San Francisco
Welcome me home again
I'm coming home to go roamin'no more
San Francisco, open your Golden Gate
You let no stranger wait outside your door
San Francisco, here is your wandering one
Saying I'll wander no more
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me you're the heart
Of all the golden West
San Francisco
Welcome me home again
I'm coming home to go roamin'
No more
No, kid. Wait here.
Ladies and gentlemen... you are the jury who shall judge these criminals... and by your applause shall ye know them, beginning at this end!
Ladies and gentlemen, the appearance of Miss Blake for The Paradise... was as much of a surprise to me as it is to you... but, however,
I congratulate you upon your choice... and present the award to Miss Blake... for Mr. Blackie Norton with my congratulations.
Wait a minute.
There's been a mistake here, Mr. Duane.
I never told this woman she could appear for me.
You got me all wrong, sister.
I don't need this kind of dough.
- Shall I take you home, dear?
- Thank you.
Everybody stew! All right, Professor, give a little music there.
What was that?
Mary!
Blackie! Blackie!
Blackie! Blackie!
You can't go in there! You're crazy!
- Ethel, come back!
- You let me alone!
Jim! Jim!
Jim!
Hey, you better get out of here before this place falls...
Jim! Jim! Where are you, Jim?
Jim! Jim!
Jim, where are you? Jim!
Jim, where are you? Jim!
Mr. Norton.
Mr. Norton.
There. Thanks a lot. Gee.
- That was a whopper, huh?
- Yeah. You think you can walk all right?
- Yeah, I can make it.
- You know if Mary Blake got out all right?
I didn't see her.
Well, we certainly don't do things halfway in San Francisco, do we?
Yeah, that's right.
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Mildred! Mildred!
- You're hurt!
- No, I'm all right. Where are the kids?
- They're safe. You're hurt.
- Where are the kids?
They're safe in a vacant lot.
The roof fell in. The baby laughed.
He laughed? Ain't that just like him?
Oh, gee. My kid.
Mr. Norton. Mr. Norton!
Please. We're pinned under.
Please.
Connie's still alive.
I can hear her breathing.
Hey, hey, give me a hand here, will you?
Come on. They're caught in here.
Here it comes again!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- You'll get killed. Come on!
Get out of here!
- Kelly. Kelly, have you seen Mary Blake?
- I'm innocent, O Lord...
Stop that drivel!
Have you seen Mary Blake?
Leave me alone!
Have you seen Mary Blake?
Or Jack Burley?
I saw Mr. Burley.
He's over there.
I thought I'd lost you!
There, there, honey. It's all right.
You're not hurt, are you?
There, there. Don't cry, dear.
Irene!
- Irene!
- Give me a hand here, will you?
- Irene!
- Give me a hand, will you?
Irene!
Irene! Irene.
Irene.
No. No.
Irene!
Oh!
Oh, no.
Hey, Chick.
Chick, have you seen Mary Blake?
- I've lost my old lady, Blackie.
- Maybe she went home.
No, I can't find her.
My house is in the street.
Look out for live wires!
Can you tell me where they've taken the injured?
Couldn't tell you, partner.
- My house is on fire!
- Where is it?
Four blocks down on Fulton Street!
- No use, boss.
- Sorry, brother. The water main's broken.
There's no water to fight the fire.
- Anybody here?
- Who is it?
Is Mary Blake here?
She lived here, but hasn't been back since the quake.
We're getting everyone out of here.
The flames are picking up.
Mommy. Mommy.
Jimmy, I love you.
Let's get out of here.
You'll all get something to eat at Sacramento and Octavia Street.
You people will all get something to eat down at Sacramento and Octavia Street.
Push on, push on. Get it out, get it out.
- I'm sorry, friend. Good luck to you.
- Thanks.
Why can't you do something about saving what's left of my building...
- instead of destroying it?
- I can't help it, mister.
That's the way it's going.
That's my building you're going to dynamite.
- I've worked half my life for it.
- It can't be helped, sir.
We're doing it to save other buildings.
We haven't any water. It's the only way we have of stopping the fire.
We're dynamiting all the way from here to Nob Hill.
- All right, let her go.
- Fire!
Mrs. Burley?
- Mrs. Burley, have you seen Mary Blake?
- She was with my son.
He's dead, isn't he?
Well, it's God's will.
You have to move on, Mrs. Burley.
We're dynamiting.
- Can't you wait a minute?
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
- Are the wires all set?
- All set.
Everybody clear!
All ready.
Fire!
My son was born there.
Never mind, Blackie Norton.
It's God's help we both need now.
Goodbye.
Hey. You can't go through there.
Hurry up.
Fire!
Mary. Mary, my darling!
Thank God!
My prayers have been answered.
I've found you at last.
Want a lift, brother?
- No thanks. Where are you going?
- Daly City to get some milk for the kiddies.
If you see a red-headed girl in a white dress... tell her Blackie's looking for her, will you?
Glad to, and God help you to find her, brother.
Better stand back from that wreckage, neighbor.
I'm looking for the priest that used to be here.
I think he's doing rescue work at the stable down next to the car barns.
Thanks. Have you seen anything of a girl...
Sorry. I've just come down from the Presidio.
All right.
Hiya, Blackie.
Hello, Mat.
The cops couldn't hold on to me.
I got away from them.
Did you? That's great.
Yeah. It took an earthquake to get me.
How are you making it?
I'll pull through. I'll be all right.
Sure. Sure you will.
Hey, Blackie...
I hear that Mary went on for you at the Chicken's Ball.
I was wrong about her. She's a great kid.
She's all right.
Don't leave him.
There you are.
Now you're going to try to get some sleep, aren't you?
- Yes.
- With your eyes open?
That's right.
Hello, Blackie.
Thanks, Tim.
That map of yours needs some attention.
Come on.
No, no, no. I'm all right.
You haven't found Mary yet, have you?
No.
Well, you can't want her for The Paradise,
Blackie. That's gone.
I wasn't thinking of The Paradise, Tim.
Wait a minute.
Come on, mug.
I'm going to take you to Mary.
You... Is she all right?
Yeah, she's all right.
You folks will have to be vaccinated.
It's for your own good.
Joe, will you take these people over to the hospital tent?
Stiller my
song would be
Nearer
my God
to Thee
Nearer
my God
to Thee
Nearer
to Thee
Tim...
I want to thank God.
What do I say?
Just say what's in your heart, Blackie.
Thanks, God. Thanks.
I really mean it.
Fire's out! The fire's out!
The fire's out!
- The fire's out!
- The fire's out!
Come on, come on!
- The fire's out. The fire's out.
- Come on, come on! The fire's out.
We'll build a new San Francisco!
Hallelujah!
Of the coming of the Lord
He has trampled out the vintage
Where the Grapes of Wrath are stored
He has loosed the fateful lightning
Of his terrible, swift sword
His truth is marching on
He has sounded forth the trumpet
That shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the souls of men
Before his judgment-seat
O, be swift, my soul, to answer
And be jubilant, my feet
Our God is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory
Hallelujah
That's all, Gibraltar.
You keep on eating between meals, you'll ruin your figure.
And if you keep on fooling around that gorilla... he'll ruin your figure.
He's a snob. Come on.
Jeff, even though Gibraltar likes you...
I wish you wouldn't take so many chances with him.
Julie, if that would make you worry about me...
I'd move right into the cage.
It might seem a little cramped after that house of yours in Newport.
Newport? Where have I heard that before?
I remember.
That's something in my dim, dark past.
- Are you sure it's past?
- Positive.
You like running a circus, don't you?
I like everything about it. But everything.
That's what you say now... but the smell of sawdust can get awfully monotonous after a while.
Young lady, that's no way to talk to your boss.
Now the Wilson Wonder Circus presents
a sensationally new modern feature:
That outstanding star,
that exciting personality...
Miss Julie Randall!
There's my cue.
Point killer.
Step up and take a bow
Don't be modest, don't be shy
Show that thoroughbred look in your eye
Step up with grace and pride
Take that oompah, oompah, oompah
In your stride
Each heart begins to beat in rhyme
Oompah-pah, oomph in three-quarter time
Maidens swoon and ladies pine
Wonderful, isn't she?
She's all right.
But whoever heard of anyone singing with a horse act?
The audience likes it.
Be gallant
Take a bow
At this time, presenting that muscular marvel... the strongest man in the world:
Goliath the mighty!
And now the mighty Goliath... will catch three 100-pound balls shot from cannon.
I'll fix you!
Mr. Carter? Where's Mr. Carter?
Hello, Joe. What's new? Don't tell me now.
I got no time. I got to find Mr. Carter.
Hello, Nick. How's the wife?
Tell me later. I'm in a hurry.
I got to find Mr. Carter.
Hello, Sam, and that's all.
You see, Jeff, I'm in kind of a jam.
- Hey, Mr. Carter.
- Just a minute, Tony.
Something's come up.
I've got to have the $10,000 I loaned you.
But it isn't due until Saturday night.
That's right, but unless you have it for me...
I'm afraid I'll have to take the circus over to raise the money. I'm in an awful spot.
That won't be necessary, John.
I'll have your money for you tonight.
- You'll what?
- Hey, Mr. Carter.
Shut up. I'm talking. Did you say tonight?
Yes. With today's receipts,
I'll have enough to pay you off.
I'll give you your money on the circus train tonight.
That's fine.
- If you please, Mr. Carter.
- What is it?
- Can I have a month off next August?
- What for?
I just got word from my lawyer.
He got me a divorce.
And one month every year
I win the custody of my wife's parents.
Take it up with Mr. Wilson.
What's the matter, boss?
Carter making trouble for you?
He's doing the best he can.
But don't you worry about it, Tony.
You know what I say?
When you got business trouble, best thing to do is get a lawyer.
Then you got more trouble, but at least you have a lawyer.
- Thanks, Tony.
- You can count on me, boss.
I ain't got nothing, but you can always have half.
Poor Jeff. He's in plenty trouble.
Trouble...
This will bring him pretty quick.
- It's a straight wire?
- I think I bent it a little.
- Let's see.
- What's the idea, reading my telegram?
- I've got to count the words, don't I?
- All right.
Ten words, 55 cents.
You got something a little cheaper?
We've got regular form telegrams for congratulations. That's 25 cents.
That's fine. Send him:
"Congratulations. Just got a big case."
Sorry. Congratulatory messages apply only to special occasions.
For example, suppose somebody gets married.
- That's a quarter.
- It ain't worth it.
No. I mean, suppose your sister had a baby. You'd send her a telegram.
What for? She'd know it.
Come on, please take my telegram.
Here's two bits.
That's right, Antonio.
Don't let anybody on except the crew.
I got a lot of money on the train tonight, so be careful.
I watch like a hawk, boss.
Nobody gets on the train unless he's got a badge.
You bet. Nobody gets on the train unless they got the badge.
Miss Julie, she's in there.
Tony, you're a very valuable man.
Hello, Julie.
Coffee and doughnuts. A la carte.
Jeff, I'm terribly sorry to read...
- What kind of doughnuts do you want?
- The best.
You seem pretty chipper... for a boy that's just kissed a fortune goodbye.
It's been a tough struggle, but the circus is finally showing a profit.
Tonight I'm paying Carter the money I owe him.
Jeff, that's wonderful!
Now the show will be all yours again, free and clear.
You turned me down before because you said I had enough obligations.
Now the only thing standing in the way of our marriage is you.
I don't know why
I let you keep stalling me.
I must be crazy. I ought to see a doctor.
Get me a doctor.
What's the matter? You ain't tasted it yet.
Jeff Wilson, any young man as stubborn as you are... should be taught a lesson.
And I guess it's up to me to do the teaching.
When are we getting married?
When? Was I hearing things, Julie?
Did you really mean what you said?
- Every word of it, darling.
- We'll be married tonight.
We can't tonight. There isn't time.
We'll be married tomorrow.
Do you hear, Julie? Tomorrow.
Two blind loves
Two blind loves
Do we know what we're doing?
Two blind loves
Don't know what month it is
Or the time of day
Don't know if we're in Brooklyn
Or in Mandalay
I only know the sun started to shine
The day that I looked into your eyes
And you looked into mine
Two blind loves
Babes in the wood
We've got it, oh, so bad
But isn't it good?
We're on a bumpy road, it's true
But heaven is in view
For two blind loves
Two blind loves
Two blind loves
Do we know what we're doing?
Two blind loves
Don't know from appetite
Don't know fish from steak
Don't know if it's a doughnut
Or a wedding cake
I only know the sun started to shine
The day that I looked into your eyes
And you looked into mine
Two blind loves
Babes in the wood
We've got it, oh, so bad
But isn't it good?
We're on a bumpy road, it's true
But heaven is in view
For two blind loves
- Where's your badge?
- Here it is.
Okay, Professor, where's your...
Miss Julie, it's you.
All right to get on the train? I got a badge.
Sure, Jeff. Okay.
Hey, mister. $18.75.
1875. That's what I thought.
The 1940 models run much smoother.
You'll think I'm on a scavenger hunt, but I'm looking for Antonio Ferrelli.
Mr. Loophole, I'm sure glad to see you.
Tony. You old war-horse.
I haven't seen you since I stopped taking Scott's Emulsion.
You know, I was afraid you wasn't going to get here in time.
There, see? Another minute and you'd miss the train.
But now that you're here everything will be all right.
This is a big case.
You gonna make lots of money.
- This is your lucky day.
- I'll say it is.
Don't know what the trouble is... but I'll straighten it out in no time.
See you inside.
Would you hold that train still while I try to mount it?
I'm sorry. Nobody gets on the train unless they got the badge.
- Badge?
- The badge, yeah.
You mean my Lone Ranger badge.
Sorry, they took it back.
I stopped eating the cereal.
- Now let me see your badge.
- I just haven't.
You no got the badge?
Quiet. The engineer may be eavesdropping.
The circus is certainly lucky to have you for a watchdog... you old badger, you.
Where are you going?
I'm going to the laundry to get ironed out.
I'm roughdry now.
Hey, come here. I got an idea.
You know my boss Jeff Wilson?
He owns the circus. He'll give you a badge.
Say, that's fast thinking. I'll see him.
He'll give me a badge.
I'll get on the train. Fine.
- Where is Mr. Wilson?
- He's on the train.
On the train?
It was awfully nice of you floating this case my way.
It's nothing.
If you hadn't sent for me...
I'd probably be home now in a nice warm bedroom... in a comfortable bed, with a hot toddy.
- That's a drink.
- That's too bad.
If it was up to me,
I'd let you on the train like that.
But it's not up to me.
No, but it's up to my ankles.
Tadpole, you better get out of the water.
You're gonna get wet.
Nonsense. If I was any drier, I'd drown.
You better get out of the dampness, my friend.
Sure, you're my friend.
My very best friend.
Punchy, where's your badge?
Okay.
Celia, where's your badge?
Okay.
I know what you think.
Even the seal's got the badge.
And just think, because orders is orders...
I can't let my best friend on the train.
All right, I take a chance.
I don't care if I lose my job.
I'm going to give you a badge.
I'm going to give you my badge.
But promise you no tell. You swear.
They'll never get anything out of me, unless they use a pump.
Last chance. All aboard.
Aren't you going to wait for Noah?
Right this way.
Just a minute, brother.
Have you got a badge?
Of course. Naturally.
Don't you know no one gets on the train unless he has a badge?
What are you, a wise guy?
That's last year's badge.
Get away!
"Quiet is requested for the benefit of those who have retired."
Excuse me a minute, Julie.
I've got some business to attend to.
I'll be back in a minute.
You thought you had him up against a wall, didn't you?
If he pays you off tonight, you're through.
Yeah? He hasn't paid me off yet.
Professor.
Let's go.
This Loophole, he's a smart lawyer.
Maybe he figure a way out how to fire the strongman.
Then you be the strongman?
That's fine.
Lawyer, you dressed yet?
After a fashion. And a pretty old fashion.
And I wish I had an Old Fashioned.
Told you I'd give you some nice clothes.
- Takes a magician to get into this coat.
- That's who I took it from. A magician.
Don't split hairs. I'm sick of the whole thing. I'm going home.
This is a big case. This is a big circus.
You're going to get a big fee.
- Fee?
- Sure.
You're not only thoroughly detestable, but you're cute.
- Then we're friends again?
- After an Old Fashioned.
I'd like you to meet the boss.
Mr. Wilson, mighty glad to make your acquaintance.
Always wanted to meet you, sir.
Think you're the greatest circus owner since P. T. Barnum.
Isn't it a pity we never met before?
Loophole, that's not the boss.
- He isn't?
- No.
He should be. He's the executive type.
I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head, not in mine.
Where is the boss?
- Punchy. What're you doing?
- What're you doing there?
Say, either my coat is inhabited, or I'm inhibited.
There he goes.
Don't worry. He'll come back.
He's a homing pigeon.
Fine. I'll keep a light burning in my pocket.
Where's the boss?
Come on, we find him.
Folks, I want you to meet my pal, my best friend.
What's your name again?
- Loophole.
- Glad to know you.
It's your pleasure.
This meeting brings back memories.
Childhood days, lemonade, romance!
My life was wrapped around a circus.
Her name was Lydia.
I met her at the World's Fair in 1900, marked down from $19.40.
She was the most glorious creature
Under the sun
Thais! Du Barry! Garbo!
Rolled into one
Lydia, Lydia, say, have you met Lydia?
Lydia the tattooed lady
She has eyes that folks adore so
And a torso even more so
Lydia, Lydia, that encyclopedia
Lydia, the queen of tattoo
On her back is the Battle of Waterloo
Beside it The Wreck of the Hesperus, too
And proudly above
Waves the red, white, and blue
You can learn a lot from Lydia
When her robe is unfurled
She will show you the world
If you step up and tell her where
For a dime you can see Kankakee or Paris
Or Washington crossing the Delaware
Lydia, Lydia, say, have you met Lydia?
Lydia the tattooed lady
When her muscles start relaxing
Up the hill comes Andrew Jackson
Lydia, oh, Lydia, that encyclopedia
Lydia, the queen of them all
For two bits she will do a mazurka in jazz
With a view of Niagara that nobody has
And on a clear day you can see Alcatraz
You can learn a lot from Lydia
Come along and see
Buffalo Bill with his lasso
Just a little classic by Mendel Picasso
Here is Captain Spaulding
Exploring the Amazon
Here's Godiva, but with her pajamas on
Here is Grover Whelan unveiling the Trylon
Over on the West Coast
We have Treasure Island
Here's Nijinsky doing the rumba
Here's her Social Security Number
Lydia, Lydia, that encyclopedia
Lydia, the champ of them all
She once swept an Admiral
Clear off his feet
The ships on her hips
Made his heart skip a beat
And now the old boy's
In command of the fleet
For he went and married Lydia
I said Lydia
He said Lydia
I said Lydia
We said Lydia
You make a pretty good banker, Gibraltar.
- Jeff's in the next car with the gorilla.
- They should be happy together.
Jeff, are you here?
Boss, what's the matter?
What happened here?
Here, take the other side.
I'll take this side.
Come on. Put him down here on the trunk.
That's it.
- Somebody hit him.
- I'm all right.
- Who's this?
- I've got an alibi. I wasn't here.
It's lucky you were hit tonight.
He's a lawyer.
- Feeling better, Mr. Wilson?
- It's gone!
- What?
- It's been stolen. My $10,000.
$10,000? That man's hurt bad.
Stand back and give him air.
- You lose the $10,000?
- He didn't lose it. It was stolen.
I've got to get that money back quick!
Never mind the $10,000. You go to bed.
He's right for once.
Come on, let me help you.
I'll take you through here.
Go ahead, Jeff. We stay here.
We'll find the money.
Punchy. We got to find Jeff's money.
Look, we do like detectives.
We re-destruct the crime.
All right, now pay attention.
I'm Jeff. You're the crook.
No, it's just acting.
You know what I mean? Acting?
What do you call... Punchy, look out!
Punchy, that's no acting!
You're crazy.
We act out the case like they do in the police station.
You've been in the police station?
Fifty cents. See, crime doesn't pay.
All right, look, Punchy. I come in.
You follow me.
I don't know you're there.
Now, I take out my money.
I count it. What happens?
Punchy, what's the matter for you?
All right, we change it.
This time you're Jeff. I'm the crook.
That's right.
This time I'm the crook. Punchy!
I'd better break this case before you break my head.
All right, I solve this case myself.
You stand there. You watch me.
I'm Jeff. I take out my money.
I count it. Now, what happens?
You've got nothing to worry about, Mr. Wilson.
With the thief on the train and the legal eagle on the case... the money is practically in your pocket.
Just keep an eye on your pocket.
- No, you don't.
- But I've got to...
There's no use talking, Jeff.
Money or no money, you're not going to get up.
You don't understand.
If that thief gets away with that $10,000...
I lose everything.
Sorry, there's nothing you can do about it now.
Get some sleep.
In the morning you'll feel a lot better.
- Yes, and a lot poorer.
- Does it matter?
- Did you get anything?
- Yes. A bump on the head.
- How can you tell?
- You know what I think?
The guy who hit Jeff on the head and knocked him out didn't like him.
Don't let's jump to concussions.
Does anybody here look suspicious, aside from you?
Mr. Carter, the manager.
He's been making trouble.
- Carter?
- But he no steal the money.
He's too smart for that.
You know who I think steal the money?
His friend Goliath. He's dumb.
The legal eagle is on his track.
If he's guilty, he'll have to prove it.
Patois.
You said you was on Goliath's track.
This is a detour.
I'll grill her until she's well done.
She must know something, even if it isn't about the case.
She's innocent.
Now then, where's Goliath?
- In the next car.
- Where is he?
Here it is, but I ought to tell you...
Tell me nothing.
It's my job to get the facts.
This fellow will face the shrewd, relentless grilling... of the juggernaut of justice, the Casanova of the courthouse... the Blackstone of the barroom.
Now watch the eagle swoop down.
Who's there?
You'll find out, my fine-feathered felon.
Hors d'oeuvres.
Goliath? I'll get to the bottom of this.
- Well?
- Wrong room.
I'm Goliath. Who are you?
Me? Just a little nobody who wears glasses.
I can hardly see a lick.
- Who is this guy?
- That's Mr. Loophole. He's a lawyer.
A lawyer. Isn't that silly?
I've been disbarred for years.
I can show you my canceled diploma.
Smart guy, huh?
How would you like
I should break you in two?
Could I file separate income taxes?
Just what do you want?
Frankly, Mr. Goliath, when I see a wrong done...
I can't rest until it's righted, that's all.
So I brought Tony here to apologize, that's what.
Tony, I want you to tell this lovable chap that you're sorry.
All right, Mr. Goliath.
I'm sorry you knocked out Jeff Wilson and stole his money.
This coat is haunted.
Maybe I'm Captain Flag.
He's as innocent as a newborn babe, and much bigger.
That settles it.
Now we got to look for a new suspect.
- Yes, and a new lawyer.
- You're not going to quit.
As of now.
This guy Goliath, don't be afraid of him.
He's muscle-bound.
And I'm homeward-bound.
How are we going to get back Jeff's $10,000?
It's very easy. Offer a reward of $15,000.
Hello.
- Did I frighten you, Mr. Loophole?
- No. Nothing ever frightens me.
I took rumba lessons by mail.
Every time I hear a whistle, I think it's the postman with another lesson.
Jeff's asleep, so I came looking for you.
Has anything developed?
Everything's under control, except my pulse.
Jeff is very grateful for what you're doing.
It's nothing at all.
You know, if you can straighten this out... it would mean a great deal to both of us.
Both of you?
I get it. You and Jeff, Jeff and you.
Young love. A maid in distress.
Fear not, my lady.
A Loophole never deserts a sinking ship.
- Even if it's a train.
- Thank you.
I'll have this case straightened out before sunrise... before the rooster crows, before this flower fades.
Here, my lady.
If we only had a clue.
I don't need the lawyer.
All we need is a clue.
What's the matter?
No, I no smoke this brand.
I got to find the clue.
What are you doing?
I know. You smoke the cigar, you knock yourself out.
But that's no good.
I got to find the clue.
Where I find the clue?
Gibraltar? You crazy.
Gibraltar no smoke cigars.
I got to find the clue. Now, where I find...
There's a head
I'd like to have over my fireplace.
I got it.
A fractured skull, I trust.
- No. A clue.
- A clue?
Punchy find this cigar right where Jeff was knocked out.
Great. Now, then, who on this train smokes cigars?
Or heavy underwear?
I know. The strongman. Goliath.
Nonsense. It wouldn't be him.
His public wouldn't like it.
We got to think of somebody else.
Wait, I got it this time. The midget!
- A midget?
- Yeah.
- A small midget?
- The small midget.
- That's our man.
- You sure?
Can you prove that he smoked the cigar?
We'll compare smells. If they're alike, this is the rope that'll hang him.
- Adieu!
- Adieu!
Punchy, stay outside.
Let Loophole do the talking, and you keep quiet.
See that you remember that.
All we got for a clue is this cigar butt.
So I'll trap him into offering us one of his cigars.
If his cigar matches this one, he's unquestionably guilty.
- That's right.
- We mustn't let on what we're after.
- I won't say anything.
- Yes, but don't talk either.
- Shut up.
- Shut up.
What do you want?
Sure, we come in if you insist.
- Is this a friend of yours?
- I should say not. He's a lawyer.
Yeah?
Why? Do you want to make anything out of it?
Try to bully me,
I'll lick you the best day you ever had.
- What brings you here?
- Nothing important.
We just want to trap you into a confession.
Confession?
Nice work, Einstein.
That's what I call using strategy.
I know my stuff, huh?
It's kind of late to be visiting, isn't it?
We just happened to be passing your house... and we saw a firefly burning in your window.
Did you lose this?
No, I didn't lose it. Where did you find it?
Never mind that.
Are these your teeth prints?
- Tony, I guess we're licked.
- I guess so, boss.
The man is undoubtedly innocent.
No hard feelings.
None at all. Let's shake on it.
By the way, I'm all out of smokes.
Do you happen to have a spare cigar on you?
Here. I got one.
I got one for you, too, and for myself.
Thanks. Let me get you a light.
Why don't you trade your head in on a bowling ball?
Don't you realize
I'm trying to get incriminating evidence?
Let's smoke these up quickly.
- Then I'll ask for one of his cigars.
- Here we are, boys.
No thanks. Bad luck. Three, I'm a midget.
That's a superstish.
Has anybody got a match?
I asked for a match, not a forest fire.
What's going on here, anyway?
By the way, do you happen to have a spare cigar on you?
I think I got one. Here.
You're a big help, you are.
I'll clean up this case if you'll keep quiet.
Last time I saw that match, there was apples growing on it.
You got the apples, too.
Hitting Jeff on the head and stealing his money... that ain't playing ball.
I bet your father spent... the first year of your life throwing rocks at the stork.
I know how to get rid of you.
Smoke one of your own cigars.
I don't think I got any more.
Good. What a break.
Now I'll make him confess.
By the way... do you happen to have a spare cigar on you?
Wait a minute. I find one.
It's the last one I got, but you can have it.
I couldn't think of taking your last cigar.
Go ahead, it's all right.
I've carried many a torch, but never on such a large scale.
Do you realize if Jeff had been hit a little harder... the charge would have been murder.
Pronounced murder?
Yes, murder.
How would you like to go to Sing Sing and get the high chair?
You better not lay a hand on me.
You ain't the law.
You're right.
We haven't got anything on you.
Anyone can make a mistake.
No hard feelings.
- No, not at all.
- Let's shake on it.
Let's smoke on it.
Heck, I seem to be all out of cigars.
You don't happen to have a spare cheroot on you, do you?
I find one more. Are you lucky.
I thought this cigar was in my other suit.
I wish you were in your other suit and it was being pressed.
- No, mangled.
- I just remember. This is my other suit.
You know, these cigars are imported.
They're hard to get.
I haven't had any trouble getting them, not with that plantation under your vest.
Boss, you're not getting any evidence.
No, but I'm getting tobacco heart.
You better tell the truth, half the truth, and nothing but the truth.
I told you to eat corn flakes for breakfast, not the goldenrod.
Are you guys trying to wreck my house?
Wait till the finance company sees this furniture.
Are you gonna get it.
You fellows got no right coming here, raising such a rumpus.
I don't raise no rumpus.
I'm gonna sue you.
If you need a good lawyer,
I'm your man. Cheever Loophole.
Hold it.
It's all right.
I stand in the rain, and he sneezes.
They can't be mine.
That's definite. They're not mine.
- Go away.
- What? Go out from under your life?
Get away.
Playing piggyback. At my age.
You're the prettiest millstone
I ever had around my neck.
You fool.
We'll be very happy together, if my back holds out.
Put me down.
Mr. Loophole, have you met
Peerless Pauline?
No. How do you do?
- Put me down, you fool.
- Reluctantly.
All right, let her go.
Careful, you're talking of the woman I love.
Carter loves her, too. She's his girl.
I just thought of something.
Maybe Carter knows something about the stolen money... and if Pauline's his girl, maybe she knows something, too.
If she doesn't, it'll be fun teaching her.
Legal eagle.
Here it is, babe. The whole $10,000.
Why don't you quit that while I'm talking to you?
I got to break in these new shoes.
I nearly fell today.
Break them in some other time.
Take care of this money.
I think that lawyer suspects me, and I don't want to have it on me.
There he is. I bet he's up to something.
Go on, get out of here. I'll handle him.
Be careful, and find out if he knows anything.
It's me, or it's I. At any rate, it's one of us.
- Come in.
- Pauline.
Are you home?
What do you want?
If this is a spirit reading...
I'd like something good in the fourth at Belmont.
- Hello, brown eyes.
- Hello, brown...
Say, you're up early today, aren't you?
You're like a beautiful chandelier.
I'd like to be around when you get lit up.
What brings you here?
Lots of reasons. 10,000 reasons.
What are you doing?
Don't mind me.
I'm just a talent scout for Alcatraz.
Let me phrase it more delicately.
Where were you when Jeff got bopped on the conk and clipped for his roll, babe?
Why, Mr. Loophole, surely you don't think that l...
Egad, no.
Anyone who looks at you can see that you're not hiding anything.
You're a lawyer, aren't you?
- They tell me you're a great lawyer.
- Who does? Not my clients.
Certainly not the ones that were hung last week.
- Have you solved your case?
- What case?
Whatever case you're working on.
Let's not sit here and talk about little me.
Let's talk about little you.
Have you deposited $10,000 in the bank lately?
Whatever made you say that?
You know what the French say:
Cherchez la femme. Find the footprints.
- Peanut brittle?
- No, thanks.
- There's no point in my staying here.
- Don't go, please.
Perhaps you'll think I'm forward... but last night when I first saw you...
And slammed the door on my face.
...I realized that you're the man
I've been dreaming of.
What do you eat before you go to bed?
I've waited so long to find someone like you.
Someone like me?
I'm not good enough for you?
Don't say that. I'm not good enough.
You ought to know. But I really have to go.
Don't go. No, please.
- I can't stay.
- No, stay.
- I'd love to stay, but...
- Yes, please. Really.
Your father wasn't by any chance an octopus, was he?
No, I really have to go.
- Don't go, please.
- I'll be right back.
I'm back.
So sorry you have to go.
The thing I like about you is money doesn't go to your head.
I hope you solve the case you're working on.
It's out of my hands.
It's been a private investigation... but right now I could use the long arm of the law.
Law?
But you don't have to go right now, do you?
There's nothing to keep me here that I can see from this angle.
But we hardly know each other.
I can be very entertaining if I want to be.
There must be some way of getting the money... without getting in trouble with the Hays Office.
Will you walk on your hands?
Silly boy, of course not.
All right, forget about it.
Will you walk on the ceiling?
And when I'm on the ceiling, you'll run out and call...
You'll run away.
That's the farthest thought from my mind, so help me the law of gravity.
All right, I'll walk on the ceiling if you will, too.
No, thanks. I'll sit this one out.
I'm just an old groundhog.
I shouldn't even be out until February.
But it's so easy.
The bottom of the shoe creates a suction that holds you up on the ceiling.
No, I'd rather not.
I have an agreement with the houseflies.
The flies don't practice law, and I don't walk on the ceiling.
You'll love it.
Come on, Cheever.
Are you sure we're not being too hasty?
After all, I am just a boy.
- You're a trouper, an aerial star.
- You could be, too.
You're tall, you're strong.
You're nearsighted.
Hurry, Cheever.
You're not fooling, now?
You will walk on the ceiling?
Only with you.
Don't look, now. No peeky-weeky.
I'll bet you're laughing at me inside.
And to think I might have roamed the whole world over and never found you.
Ready, darling?
I know I'm going to hate myself for this in the morning.
- Why, you look like a million.
- I'll settle for $10,000.
- Suppose you go first.
- Why?
In case you fall, I'll be here to pick it up.
No. Let's go up together.
If that's your best offer, but I'm not making a nickel on it.
Once you do this you'll never forget it.
The last time I stood on a ceiling was at a lodge meeting.
The chairman had the floor.
How am I doing here?
Careful, Cheever.
You don't want to reach over and hold this thing?
Come on. Lift your body and clamp your foot on the ceiling.
A very good morning to you, Mrs. Murphy.
- Help.
- There. I knew you'd like it.
Say, I like this.
I never thought we'd be hanging around together.
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this. Shake.
I see.
Pauline, let's never lose this thrilling moment.
Think of it.
You and I, heels over head in love.
- Do you rumba?
- No.
Come on. Let's dance.
Pennies from heaven.
Pauline, help me down.
Pauline, let me have that wallet.
Pauline, I'm stuck up... Let me down.
Pauline, how do I get down out of here?
Pauline, quick. Help.
Get me down, Pauline.
Help me down.
Get me off the ceiling.
Help. I'm stuck up...
- Julie?
- Come in.
- Hi there, Mr. Wilson.
- Telegram for you.
Thanks. Excuse me.
It's nothing important.
Julie, why don't you take that job?
What job?
With the Miracle Shows.
I heard they made you an offer.
That. I'm turning that down.
Maybe you better take it.
It looks as if the Wilson Wonder Circus is gonna have to do without Wilson.
I might not be the best boss in the world... but I don't think you'll like working for Carter.
I don't intend to work for Carter.
I'm leaving when you leave.
But where will you go to?
Where you go.
- Don't you want me to, Jeff?
- Sure.
This isn't easy for me.
I've made plenty of mistakes, I guess.
But I don't want to make another.
You once said that we belong to different worlds.
You're right. You're a success.
When I leave here I won't even have a job.
Things will work out for you.
I know they will.
Until they do, until I can pay the bills...
I'm not going to drag you to any preacher.
You're pretty heavy... but suppose I drag you?
I don't think I'd enjoy life as Mr. Julie Randall.
You better wire Miracle Shows you're going to take that job.
I guess Emily Post was right.
A girl should never propose to a man.
You're some lawyer. You come here to help Jeff and Julie, and what happened?
Come, come, you know as well as I do.
And you know better.
- We've got to think.
- We tried that.
Let's review the case.
One Jeff Wilson owes $10,000.
Or let's put it another way:
$10,000 is owed by one Jeff Wilson.
It's a clear case of Jeff Wilson owing $10,000.
- Which he ain't got.
- Brilliant deduction.
If only that Mrs. Dukesbury would help him out.
- Mrs. Dukesbury?
- Yeah. She's Jeff's aunt.
The rich Mrs. Dukesbury?
Page 1 of the social register?
The Newport branch of the United States Mint?
That money is Jeff's aunt?
I usually say aunt, but I'm showing off on account of the monkeys.
But she wouldn't lend Jeff the money.
Wait, I got an idea.
You go to Newport and ask Mr. Dukesbury for the money.
Fine.
I mean, if he's alive you could ask him.
But he's dead.
He's dead, eh?
Then why don't you ask him?
Mrs. Dukesbury,
America's wealthiest widow... and yours truly, who could certainly use the money for Jeff.
Don't tell this to Jeff, but his troubles are over.
Goodbye, Mr. Chimps.
Let him go. We solve this case myself.
Punchy, I'm going to my tent where I can think.
You come over later and wake me up.
Well, shut my mouth and freeze my face.
That man don't belong to no human race.
Got a hoca-hoca-pocus and a fiddle-dee-dee... that can charm a lion or a chimpanzee.
Well, button my lip and send me quick.
That man's got a voodoo in that stick.
When he voodoo raki-sakis he can hypnotize an elf.
That man must be Swingali himself.
Zoom zoom go the cymbals
And boom boom go the drums
There's dancing feet all over the street
When that man comes
The kids from the alley
They rally round Swingali
He waves that Toscaninian hand
And zoom zoom go the cymbals
And soon Swingali sways
The basses thump
to thousands of trumpets
Sounding their A 's
Mr. Swingali
Tell me, is he man or maestro?
Zoom zoom goes your heart
When he's in command
Give that man a hand
Yeah, man
When he gives the downbeat
They swing us soft and low
Play something for me
Play it loud and corny
Oh, glory hallelujah!
Rhythm races through ya
When he rolls his evil eye
He can boogie-boo ya
Louder now, yeah, louder now, yeah
Louder now, yeah
Why be melancholy
When we got Swingali?
Hey, look me in the eye
Concentrate
Relax
Swing it
Make it rise up to the skies
And hypnotize the moon
Make it a blue
Moon
Make it a blue
Moon
Swing low, sweet chariot
Hello, Teresa.
This is Suzanna, Suzanna Dukesbury.
You are coming tomorrow night, aren't you?
Splendid. Yes. Just as the invitation read.
I'm bringing Jardinet and his famous symphony orchestra... all the way from Paris, just to play for us.
And I've invited only the 400 of Newport.
No outsiders.
Here, what is this?
It's English tweed. Wears like iron.
Now, then, where's old Lady Dukesbury's room?
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Dukesbury cannot be disturbed by anyone.
I don't want to be disturbed either.
- You can't go up there. Who are you?
- Who am I? Mr. Dukesbury.
But I understood
Mr. Dukesbury passed away.
Just a typographical error.
Passed out. What a brawl that was.
Here I am, after the brawl is over.
- I'll inform Mrs. Dukesbury you're here.
- Never mind. I'll tell her myself.
What's her room number?
Never mind. I'll find it.
I've been in bigger hotels than this, and with better-looking clerks.
What in the world...
What is the meaning of this?
Keep your sheet on.
I'm looking for Mrs. Dukesbury.
I am Mrs. Dukesbury.
Snookums!
Gracious. I don't know you.
You mean you've forgotten?
I know. You have forgotten.
Those June nights on the Riviera... when we sat underneath the shimmering skies... moonlight-bathing in the Mediterranean.
We were young, gay, reckless.
The night I drank champagne from your slipper.
Two quarts. It would have held more, but you were wearing innersoles.
- Hildegard.
- My name is Suzanna.
Let's not quibble.
It's enough that you've killed something fine and beautiful.
Suzanna. Won't you fly with me?
For I need $10,000
'cause the Sheriff's after me
Get out of this room or I'll scream for the servants!
Let the servants know.
Let the whole world know about us.
You must leave my room.
We must have regard for certain conventions.
One guy isn't enough.
She's got to have a convention.
Suzanna, at last we're alone.
Couldn't the two of us be...
How shall I say it?
A man and a woman? There. I said it.
Suzanna, if you only knew how much I need you.
Not because you have millions.
I don't need millions.
I'll tell you how much I need.
Have you got a pencil?
I left my typewriter in my other pants.
- That's Whitcomb. What will I do?
- I'll cool him off.
No, you mustn't.
This is so embarrassing. Oh, dear.
What, succotash? What's eating you?
I beg your pardon, but M. La Fontaine of the concert bureau... has phoned to say that all arrangements are complete.
- The maestro will be here on time.
- That's fine.
Here's a dime. Get yourself a clean shirt.
- He's gonna get himself a clean shirt.
- This is an outrage.
I'll say it is. That Whitcomb is a fine butler.
I phoned five hours ago and he gives you the message now.
Why, you're not M. La Fontaine?
What do you mean,
I'm not M. La Fontaine?
Do I go around saying you're not M. La Fontaine?
It must be wonderful to be associated...
- with such a great artist as Jardinet.
- It is a pushover.
- Did you say Jardinet?
- Why, of course.
Be sure when the Normandie docks tomorrow in New York...
Jardinet and his entire orchestra come directly here.
This bedroom will be awfully crowded.
Say, Suzie, hiring a world-famous guy like what's-his-name... that will run into money.
I realize that. I didn't expect him to play at my party for nothing.
You'll get your check tomorrow night as agreed.
Tell me, suppose through some strange quirk of fate... that Jardinet couldn't get here?
Would you be interested in any other form of entertainment?
Say some novel surprises wrapped in sawdust?
Why, it's unthinkable.
Jardinet must get here.
After all, $7,500 for one night's entertainment is a lot of money.
$7,500 is a pretty penny, but my client needs $10,000... for reasons that should be pretty obvious by now.
I hate to bring up money matters in a bedroom, but...
But what?
Just write me out a check for $10,000... and everybody will be happy, including the gorilla... and I do mean you.
But we agreed on $7,500.
But you do not know about the rate of exchange.
You see, in la belle France...
$7,500 is over 150,000 francs... while in this country, $7,500... is, well, $7,500.
That is fluctuation.
Very well.
Anything to make the party a success.
This will be the most successful surprise party you have ever given.
But it's not a surprise party.
What will you bet?
By this time tomorrow, you'll be in Chicago.
Then what?
It's really a swell break for you, Julie.
The Miracle Shows have a fine outfit.
They're gonna be crazy about you.
What are you gonna do, Jeff?
I'll have plenty to do.
Six days a week I'll think about you.
On Sunday I'll look for a job.
Fine chance you'll have of finding a job on Sunday.
That's just the point.
No job on Sunday, so I'll have six more days to think about you.
When Sunday comes around, no job, I'll have six more days.
Do we know what we're doing?
Two blind loves
Don't know what month it is
Or the time of day
Don't know if we're in Brooklyn
Or in Mandalay
I only know
The sun started to shine
The day that I looked into your eyes
And you looked into mine
Two blind loves
Babes in the wood
We've got it, oh, so bad
But isn't it good?
We're on a bumpy road, it's true
But heaven is in view
For two blind loves
Are you sleeping?
With all this trouble, with Jeff losing the circus tomorrow... how can you fall asleep?
You count sheep?
How many sheep do you have to count before you fall asleep?
One? You're an insomaniac.
You know, we look every place for the money... but there's one place we don't look.
That's Goliath's room.
Wait. You run away, too, like the lawyer?
You're a coward.
No, you're not a regular coward.
You're a brave coward.
Tell me, how does Goliath sleep?
With his eyes closed? That's news.
What I mean is, does he sleep good?
Like a top. I gets wise.
That's fine. Now, we got work to do.
Get your clothes. Come on.
This is Goliath's room. Keep quiet.
He's asleep like a baby.
Now we got to look for the money.
It's better we work in the dark.
We got to work fast.
I look over there. You look over there.
If anything happens, we meet right here.
That's fine. Go ahead.
Quick, hide.
We got to find the money in a hurry.
Maybe he's sleeping on it.
All right. I look in the pillow.
You look under the blanket. Go on.
You no find it? It's not in here either.
Santa Claus, it looks like a white Christmas.
If he wakes up, I pity us.
Here, hold that. Hold it. I got an idea.
This will make Goliath sleep.
What you do? Wake up.
Wake up, Punchy.
Punchy, wake up.
See? I sing a lullaby, and you wake up.
That's fine.
Maybe the money's in the mattress.
Punchy, what are you doing?
Punchy, get down.
- Porter.
- Yes?
Help!
Come on.
Let's get out of here. Come on, Punchy.
Yeah. So long.
Is there a Jeff Wilson on the train?
I'm Jeff Wilson. Why?
Long-distance been trying to get you all along the line.
- Long-distance?
- Yeah.
You can use this telephone, young man.
Ask for the Newport operator.
Hello, Jeffrey. This is the legal eagle.
I'm calling from Dukesbury Manor.
Never mind what I'm doing here.
I've got a great scheme.
Listen.
- How much?
She thinks she's getting Jardinet and his orchestra.
But I have a sneaking suspicion
Jardinet's not going to show up.
- If we can only get away with it.
- Certainly.
You play the circus right on your aunt's front lawn.
Be very quiet while you're setting the tents up.
And keep the elephants out of the flowerbed.
You take care of that end...
I'll get the circus there by tomorrow night if it's the last thing I do.
Oh, boy.
Operator.
Get me the steamship Normandie.
Where is it? It's in the water.
Why, I can't believe it.
But I tell you, the man's name is not Jardinet.
His real name is D.T. O'Connor.
There must be some mistake.
Are you sure?
It's the biggest dope ring in years, and Jardinet is the head dope.
Keep him in the brig until I can dig up some more dope.
This is operator 77 B signing off.
That is all.
It's always those three top buttons.
I'll make it. I used to be a riveter on the Golden Gate Bridge.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Now then, tell me, how do you like the bandstand?
I had it built especially for Jardinet.
Will he like it?
If he ever sees it.
Yes, Whitcomb.
Pardon me, madam... but here are the seating arrangements for your final approval.
No, Whitcomb.
Judge Chanock will sit on my left hand... and you will sit on my right hand.
How will you eat? Through a tube?
They all showed up.
Looks like no second helpings.
Ladies and gentlemen... on behalf of our gracious, charming, and lovely hostess...
I say to you:
Good evening, friends.
- And now, let's lap up the vittles.
- Monsieur, control yourself.
Find Mr. Loophole.
Tell him we'll be ready in five minutes.
Sure, Jeff. Five minutes.
- M. La Fontaine?
- What is it, my little smorgasbord?
It's 5 minutes of 10:00, and they're not here yet.
It takes time.
You know how elephants are.
- Elephants?
- Who said anything about elephants?
Give me that.
You've had quite enough of this.
Elephants. At your age.
And since Mrs. Dukesbury and her checkbook... are entirely responsible for this magnificent shindig...
I suggest we give the kid a great big hand.
I'm sure Marie Antoinette would like to say a few boring words.
Can I quote you on that?
Relax. Your entertainment is practically ready.
Go on. Get in there and fight.
- Oh, dear.
- You should cut out starches.
Please hurry.
Say, have you got a slow leak?
Now, if no one cares for more coffee, we'll all be going.
I'll have another cup of coffee.
Don't leave me, Suzanna.
Can't you see that I love you?
There. You dragged it out of me.
I love you, all of you.
I love you feverishly.
Have you got a thermometer on you?
Not here, monsieur.
I can't help it. It's just the animal in me.
Do you get it? I don't care what you do, as long as the show don't go on.
Now get going. Come on.
- So Carter has friends. You better beat it.
- Says you.
Thanks, Punchy. Just in time.
Stop that.
Help! Police!
Get him, Punchy. Attaboy.
I bet Carter's behind this.
Let's find him. Go on.
So it's you.
I'll fix you.
Haven't you had enough coffee?
My guests are waiting.
Yes, I think I've had enough.
Very well, then. We'll all be going.
I think I'll have another cup of coffee.
It's awfully good, isn't it?
Don't worry.
The entertainment is right on tap.
Are you sure? Where is Jardinet?
I knew there was something
I wanted to tell you.
- He isn't coming.
- What?
I am Jardinet.
I cross the ocean. I am called a dope ring.
I race on a train.
When I get here, what do I find?
Animals.
Mrs. Dukesbury's friends are my friends.
I'll take care of him.
- M. La Fontaine, please be careful.
- Animals, indeed.
This is the most incredible thing that has ever happened.
You're all upset. Why don't you go back to Paris and lie down?
Jardinet's symphony never has been so humiliated.
I have a notion not to play.
That's an excellent notion.
Come on. I'll put you on the bus.
But I have given my word. I will play.
Yes, I will play.
You'll play, but on the bandstand, down on the water.
On the water? But my audience.
Don't worry. You start playing, they'll come down in spite of it.
- Mrs. Dukesbury's idea.
- Crazy Americans.
We're ready, boss.
Take this bearded symphony to the bandstand...
- and see that he gets a good sendoff.
- Okay, boss.
I know you'll all be thrilled.
Jardinet's opening number... will be Beethoven's somber and spiritual first movement... of his second concerto, album three, opus four...
And number five on the hit parade.
Oh, goodness.
Open it.
She's all right. It's just the excitement.
Hurry, folks.
The fastest feet get the best seat.
See that man-eating elephant.
See the cannon that shoots a human being.
- Now?
- Now.
You monster.
You're responsible for this disgrace.
That's gratitude for you.
Most men get their sweethearts one engagement ring.
- I got you three rings.
- A circus. I'll be a laughingstock.
I see it all now.
My nephew did this to humiliate me.
He did you a favor.
I was afraid Jardinet wouldn't get here... so I wired Jeff to come and help us.
And there he is. Doing rather well, don't you think?
Step up and take a bow
Don't be modest, don't be shy
Show that thoroughbred look in your eye
Step up with grace and pride
Take that oompah, oompah, oompah-pah
In your stride
My heart began to beat in rhyme
Oompah-pah, oomp in three-quarter time
You charmed me like that Lorelei
When you waltzed by
You took my heart
And now here's to love
Take a bow
They liked the dinner you gave.
They'll eat this up, sawdust and all.
- But how about Jardinet?
- Probably on his way back to Paris.
Mrs. Dukesbury, speech!
See? You're a sensation.
I guess you're licked.
I don't pay off until this show is over... and this show ain't over yet.
And now, kiddies, if you'll all pull up your chairs...
Suzie would like to mumble a little doubletalk in Esperanto.
Here you are, sugar.
My few dear friends, I'm thrilled...
- He might kill somebody.
- That's his business.
- I'm stopping the show.
- I don't want no part of this.
Get me out of this cannon!
Keep calm, folks. It's all part of the show.
Get me out of this cannon.
Please!
We're offering a $5-prize, folks, for anyone who can pick out the ape.
Change your partners.
Help! He's got me!
I hope he's got two pair of pants with that suit.
Let me up there, you fool!
Somebody do something!
There they go.
It's a great race as they go into the back stretch.
Gibraltar leads, but Carter and Punchy are hanging on.
Will Gibraltar make it?
They're in the home stretch.
Gibraltar still leads.
Carter is second by a trapeze.
Punchy's third by a heel.
Get me out of this cannon!
Don't worry, Mrs. Dukesbury. I'll save you.
It looks like a driving finish.
And there goes Seabiscuit.
Oh, my goodness. Help me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dukesbury.
I didn't know it was loaded.
Here I come, Mrs. Dukesbury.
I save you again.
Swing your lady.
Get ready now.
When I grab your ankles, you let go.
Let go, I say.
Do you hear me?
Bring in the cage. Help me with the net.
Come on.
My dress!
Is there an insurance agent in the house?
Help! Somebody save me!
Help!
Calling Tarzan.
Jump! It's all right. Come on, jump.
Do you think that they could hold me?
Oh, dear.
Here I go!
Here goes.
Call him off! Get him away!
Look. The money.
Is it all there?

- What is it?
- Sorry to have to report... there are four stowaways in the forward hatch.
Stowaways? How do you know there are four of them?
They were singing Sweet Adeline.
Get them out of there, you hear?
But we can't find them.
And besides, they've been writing insulting notes.
So, I'm an old goat, am I? Listen to me.
Find them if you have to clear out that whole hatch!
Yes, sir.
- Captain, when do we get in?
- Wednesday!
- I beg your pardon. Wednesday.
- Thank you.
- In all my dreams
- In all my dreams
- Your fair face beams
- Your fair face beams
You're the idol
of my heart
Sweet Adeline
My Adeline
This is the only way to travel, boys.
The only way.
I was gonna bring the wife and kiddies... but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.
I was gonna bring my grandfather, but there's no room for his beard.
Why not send for the old swine, let his beard come later?
- I sent for his beard.
- You did?
It's coming by "hair" mail.
Fellas, I think I hear someone.
If it's the captain,
I'm gonna have a few words with him.
My hot water's been cold for three days and I haven't got room to swing a cat.
In fact, I haven't even got a cat.
- My grandfather can swing a cat.
- He can?
That'd make a good job for him.
Come on, men.
Someone's coming.
Come on, men. Snap it up.
Listen, fellas.
We've got to find those stowaways.
- And when we do, we'll put them in irons.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take a look in behind those cases.
You fellows, look behind those boxes.
- Never mind the barrels.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- What's that?
- I just said "aye, aye, sir."
- Never mind that. Find those men.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- They're not here, sir.
- Oh, yes, they are.
Hoist all this stuff up on deck.
- And get these barrels out of the way.
- Very well, sir.
Lower away up there.
Hurry up with that sling.
- You'll never find them standing around.
- Yes, sir.
You look in back of those bales.
- You look in those boxes.
- Yes, sir.
All right, boys.
Make it snappy up there!
Hey!
There they are!
Hurry.
You fellas, go aft.
You fellas, take a look in behind those lifeboats.
Captain, tell us about the stowaways.
I'll have them in the brig before long.
That's terribly romantic.
I'd love to meet a stowaway.
Hey, you.
Are these your gloves?
I found them in your trunk.
- Go to your rooms. I'll be down shortly.
- Who are you?
Are you the floorwalker?
I want to register a complaint.
- What's the matter?
- Matter enough.
You know who sneaked into my stateroom at 3:00 a.m.?
- Who did that?
- Nobody, and that's my complaint.
I'm young.
I want gaiety, laughter, ha-cha-cha.
I wanna dance.
I wanna dance
till the cows come home
Just what do you mean by this?
I don't like the way you're running this boat.
Get in the backseat and let your wife drive.
I've been captain of this ship for 22 years.
Twenty-two years?
If you were a man, you'd go in business for yourself.
I know a fellow, started last year with a canoe.
He has more women than you can shake a stick at, if you enjoy that.
One more word, and I'll throw you in irons.
You can't do it with irons.
It's a mashie shot.
It's a mashie shot if the wind is against you.
If the wind isn't, I am.
How about those barrels down below?
- I wouldn't put a pig in there.
- See here, you...
Not even if you got down on your knees.
And here's your gloves.
You would take them, wouldn't you?
And keep away from my office.
Now, see here, you!
How dare you invade the sanctity of the captain's quarters?
I thought you was the captain. I'm hungry.
I'm gonna find something to eat.
I'll take care of that. Hello.
- Send up the captain's lunch.
- Two.
Send up his dinner, too. Who am I?
I'm the captain.
You want to choose up sides?
Engineer, will you tell them to stop the boat from rocking?
I'm gonna have lunch.
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me? I'm hungry.
- I didn't eat in three days.
- Three days?
- We've only been on the boat two days.
- I didn't eat yesterday...
I didn't eat today, and I won't eat tomorrow.
That makes three days.
State your business.
I've got to shiver my timbers.
I got no business.
I come up to see the captain's bridge.
Captain's bridge? I'm sorry.
He always keeps it in a glass... while he's eating.
Would you like to see where he sleeps?
I saw that. That's the bunk.
You're wasting your breath, and that's no great loss.
A fine sailor you are.
You bet I'm a fine sailor.
You know, my whole family was sailors?
My father was partners with Columbus.
What do you think of that?
- Your father and Columbus were partners?
- You bet.
Columbus has been dead 400 years.
They told me it was my father.
Hop up there, and I'll show you a few things you don't know about history.
Now look. There's Columbus.
That's Columbus Circle.
Would you mind getting up off that flypaper and giving the flies a chance?
You're crazy. Flies can't read papers.
Now, Columbus sailed from Spain to India looking for a shortcut.
You mean strawberry shortcut.
I don't know.
When I woke up, there was the nurse taking care of me.
What's the matter?
Couldn't the nurse take care of herself?
You bet she could, but I found it out too late. Enough of this.
Let's get back to Columbus.
- I'd rather get back to the nurse.
- So would I.
But Columbus was sailing along on his vessel.
- On his what?
- Not on his what. On his vessel.
- Don't you know what "vessel" is?
- Sure. I can vessel.
Do you suppose I could buy back my introduction to you?
Now, one night Columbus' sailors started a mutiny.
No mutinies at night.
They're in the afternoon.
You know, mutinies Wednesdays and Saturdays.
There's my argument. Restrict immigration.
All right.
Of all the colossal impudence!
Why don't you stand up?
Can't you see he has no chair?
- Why, you...
- You better keep quiet.
We're a couple of big stockholders in this company.
Stockholders?
You look like a couple of stowaways to me.
Don't forget that the stockholder of yesteryear is the stowaway of today.
Well, you look exactly like them.
What do they look like?
One of them goes around with a black moustache.
So do I. If I had my choice,
I'd go around with a little blonde.
I said one goes around with a black moustache.
You couldn't expect a moustache to go around by itself.
Don't you think a moustache ever gets lonely, Captain?
Sure, it gets lonely.
When my grandfather's beard gets here,
I'd like it to meet your moustache.
I'll think it over.
I'll talk it over with my moustache.
Has your grandfather's beard got any money?
- Money? Why, it fell hair to a fortune.
- Now, listen!
Stockholders or no stockholders, you clear out of here!
There's someone in that room.
There's somebody in that closet, and I think it's you, Captain.
- Now, we can eat in peace.
- All right. Here's a piece for you.
That a baby.
- Beg pardon, Captain.
- How dare you enter the captain's quarters...
- while I'm eating.
- Sorry, sir.
Now I've got you!
Don't forget the butter.
You know, there's some mighty pretty country around here.
- I've...
- I beg your pardon.
- Pardon me. Is this yours?
- Why, no.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.
As I was saying, there's some mighty beautiful country around here.
- The trees are lovely.
- You bet they are. I love them.
Get out of my way!
Gibson. Come out of there.
Yes, sir.
I want to report I found a...
Gibson, you've been drinking again... and you know what my orders were.
But those stowaways,
I just caught one of them in there.
- Stowaway, huh?
- Yes. There he is.
Help! Look out!
You're choking me!
I thought so. Go to your quarters.
That's one now.
That's a dummy. Come with me.
First officer.
I'm telling you, that's him.
This has gone far enough.
Get up to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
Quiet.
I think you're right.
I know you're right.
Would you like anything before lunch?
Yes, breakfast.
Nobody eats in here.
I do.
Mustard's no good without roast beef.
Do you want your nails trimmed long?
About an hour and a half.
I got nothing to do.
You're a nice-looking gal, all right.
You got it.
Thank you.
And you can keep it.
That's a nice gal?
Somebody's coming.
Come on, boys.
You're next, Cap.
I'm looking for a couple of mugs.
- No, you boys look on B Deck.
- Aye, aye, sir.
How about a shave?
- Sure. Give me a once-over.
- Once-over, partner.
- No, a shave.
- On the face. All right.
- Wake me up when you get through.
- We'll take care of you, all right.
We take the tonsils last.
I think we work on the moustache first.
Give him a little snoop.
This side's too long.
Give him a little snoop this side.
Now this side is too short.
It's too short. The other side is too long. Snoop him up.
That's better, but the side that was too short now is too long... and the side that was too long is too short.
I think you got to give him one more snoop.
I think we better measure.
It's about a foot too much.
No, the measure's a foot too much.
Now it looks much better.
It can stand one more snoop in the middle, I think.
In the middle, one snoop.
That's fine. That's very good.
I think it's a little bit rough right here.
I fix that.
You know, I'm never going
on this boat again. The food is no good.
Of course, I no eat yet, but even
if I don't eat, I like the food good.
One more snoop.
That's beautiful?
That's what you call a work of art.
Hey, you know, I think you give him one snoop too much.
And I want you to know,
I'm fed up on your alibis.
Take it easy.
You're getting all excited.
Now where do you think you're going?
Never mind. I'm running this racket.
Just stay here and keep out of sight like I told you.
No you don't.
Now, listen to me, Mr. Alky Briggs.
You can't keep me cooped up like this.
I've played second fiddle on this ship long enough.
Now you listen. I'm not after any dames.
I'm after Joe Helton, I tell you, and he can't get away from me on this boat.
He's got to put his okay on my gang, or he's gonna get this.
Hey, who are you?
I'm the tailor.
That reminds me. Where are my pants?
You've got them on.
Pardon me while I step into the closet.
And get a load of this, if you come in again at 3:00 a. M...
- Stop bothering me. Tell it to the tailor.
- Alky!
Alky!
What are you doing in there?
Nothing. Come on in.
- You can't stay in that closet.
- I can't, can I?
That's what they said to Thomas Edison, mighty inventor...
Thomas Lindbergh, mighty flier, and Thomas Shefsky, mighty like a rose.
Just remember that if there weren't any closets, there wouldn't be any hooks... and if there weren't any hooks, there'd be no fish, and that would suit me fine.
Don't try to hide.
I know you're in that closet.
- Did you see me go in the closet?
- No.
- Am I in the closet now?
- No.
Then how do you know I was in the closet?
Your Honour, I rest my case.
Come here, brown eyes.
You're not gonna get me off this bed.
I didn't know you were a lawyer.
You're awfully shy for a lawyer.
You bet I'm shy. I'm a shyster lawyer.
Then what do you think of an egg that would give me...
You've been getting nothing but dirty breaks.
We can clean and tighten your brakes... but you'll have to stay in the garage all night.
I want excitement. I want to ha-cha-cha-cha.
You don't realise it.
From the time he got the marriage license,
I've led a dog's life.
Are you sure he didn't get a dog's license?
Alky can't make a fool of me.
I want to go places. I want to do things.
I want freedom, I want liberty, I want justice!
Madam, you're making history.
In fact, you're making me.
And I wish you'd keep my hands to yourself.
You know what I want.
I want life, I want laughter, I want gaiety.
I want to ha-cha-cha-cha.
Madam, before I get through with you, you will have a clear case for divorce... and so will my wife.
The first thing to do is to arrange for a settlement.
You take the children, your husband takes the house.
Junior burns the house, you take the insurance and I take you.
But I haven't any children.
That's the trouble with this country.
You haven't any children.
And as for me, I'm going back in the closet where men are empty overcoats.
Brown eyes.
Sir, this is an outrage, breaking into a man's home.
There'll be a letter about this in the Times tomorrow morning.
Yeah?
But you won't read it,
'cause I'm gonna lay you out pretty.
You're gonna lay me out pretty?
That's the thanks I get for freeing an innocent girl... who, although she is hiding at the moment... has promised to become the mother of her children.
And with that, sir, I bid you a fond farewell.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Come out of there. I want to talk to you.
I'm sorry, but we're using the old-fashioned iceman... and we find him very satisfactory for keeping the house warm.
Just as I thought, you're yellow, grabbing at a woman's skirts.
- I'm wise.
- You're wise?
What's the capital of Nebraska?
What's the capital of the Chase National Bank? Give up?
Now, I'll try you on an easy one.
How many Frenchmen can't be wrong?
- I know...
- You were warm and so was she.
Don't be discouraged.
With a little study you'll go a long way.
- And I'd wish you'd start now.
- Do you see this gat?
Cute, isn't it? Santa Claus bring it for Christmas? I got a fire engine.
Listen, mug. Do you know who I am?
Don't tell me.
Are you animal or vegetable? Animal.
- Get this. I'm Alky Briggs.
- And I'm the fellow who talks so much.
Fancy meeting you here after all these drinks.
- Wait a minute.
- Sorry, I can't stay.
The captain's waiting to chase me.
You can stay, all right, until I finish with you.
Alky, darling, please!
Don't "darling" me.
Get in that next room and stay there!
Get in that next room.
I'm not good enough for her, am I?
Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you?
- Yes, I'd like to ask you one question.
- Go ahead.
Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
Don't you think that although girls go out with boys like me... they always marry the other kind?
If you're gonna kill me, hurry up.
I have to take my tonic at 2:00.
I can use a guy with your nerve.
I think we could get along well together.
Of course, the first year we might have our little squabbles.
But, then, that's inevitable, don't you think?
And what do you want here?
I was just looking for him.
Do you know this guy?
I've known him for years.
He used to live in the next barrel to me.
I see. The stowaways.
I can help you bozos.
- Mr. Bozos to you.
- All right, Mr. Bozo. And you can help me.
I'm shorthanded, and I want to get a guy on this boat.
It's too late to get him on now.
Should've said so before we sailed.
Listen. This is a map of B Deck.
There's Joe Helton's stateroom.
And he's a tough egg.
And you're coming with me... while I have it out with Joe.
Do you know who Joe Helton is?
I think I'll get off this boat until this blows over.
If you know what's good for you, you'll stick with me.
You keep the windows covered while I go in. Now, move!
What is the idea of this?
It's all right. I make a move for you.
- This is an outrage!
- I'll call the captain!
- The captain don't play chess.
- Purser!
- Steward! Come here.
- Too much noise here for us.
We better go someplace where it's quiet.
Come in.
- Your cigars, sir.
- Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Thank you, sir.
Dad, now look at you.
You aren't even dressed yet.
You can do all the dressing for the family, Mary.
Old Joe Helton is taking things easy for the rest of his life.
We're big shots now, baby.
Come in.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Briggs. What do you want?
I just wanted to have a friendly talk.
I'm sort of worried about business.
Step in the other room, baby.
- But, Dad...
- Run along, honey.
Your kid?
She's cute, isn't she?
I don't think we've got anything to talk about. Get out.
Not before I get your okay on my gang.
- I'm not doing you any favours.
- Yes, you are.
You're gonna sign this.
I'm taking over your territory, or there's gonna be trouble.
I'm taking no sides.
You'll have to fight it out with Butch and the gang.
I'm stepping into your shoes as boss.
I'm not backing up any small-time chiseller.
Don't put on the Ritz with me.
Don't get cocky with me, Briggs.
I'm talking turkey.
You can't make all the dough
and then run out on your pals.
I'm not taking orders from a mug like you!
Scram!
So that's your answer? Here's mine!
So you got your gang with you?
I'll get you later.
Who are you guys?
What are you doing in my room?
That's my partner, but he no speak.
He's dumb and deaf.
You guys don't know it, but you just scared a pretty tough egg out of this room.
Sure, we're a couple of tough guys.
- Do you want to make some money?
- Money?
Money? Feel this muscle. Feel his muscle.
All right. How much you pay?
Just how tough are you?
You pay little bit, we're little bit tough.
You pay very much, very much tough.
You pay too much, we're too much tough.
- How much you pay?
- I pay plenty.
Then we're plenty tough.
And we show you, too.
Partner, show him how tough we are.
See? That's nothing. That's free.
Now we give you the real stuff this time.
Come on. Put some pep in it.
The one-two uppercut.
You know, on the button.
No downstairs button. Upstairs button.
That's fine. That's good, all right.
I tell him you're tough, and you punch like a lily. What's a matter?
You wanna lose this job?
Give him the stuff this time.
Excuse me, boss. He can do much better... but he no work good today.
He no get paid.
When he get paid, you watch him.
Come on. This time we give him the works.
Come on. Hurry up.
On the button this time.
Come on, I tell you. On the button.
Hurry up. Give me the punch.
Come on.
All right.
Come on! Punch!
That's enough. Wait.
- What do you think of us?
- You're great.
Not so loud.
You want him to get a swell head?
You guys are plenty tough, all right.
I'm spying on you.
You're just the fellows I need. You're hired.
- We're great, huh?
- You're great.
- My partner?
- He's great.
My grandfather's great.
He's a great-grandfather.
When Helton comes out of his room, plug him.
- What'll we plug him with?
- Didn't I give you two gats?
We had to drown the gat, but we saved you a little black gitten.
Here, take these, and hang onto them now.
Don't leave me for a minute.
And keep your eye on that guy that just went out of here.
You understand.
Anybody come near the boss, let him have it.
You're all right now, boss.
Anybody comes near you...
What's a matter with you? Look out.
That's all right. He was just practicing.
Get out.
Now I can take a walk out on deck and feel safe. Come on. Let's go.
There he comes now. Get him.
Don't worry. We'll get him.
I've got my finger on the trigger.
Hey, don't forget.
Anybody comes near the boss, let him have it.
It's the boss. He's got a disguise.
Take off the whiskers. We know you.
What do you mean?
Officer!
Why didn't you get him?
Not afraid, are you?
Afraid? Me?
A man who's licked his weight... in wild caterpillars? Afraid?
You bet I'm afraid.
- So...
- Hello. How are things in the closet?
You know, I still smell of mothballs.
I don't want to talk to you.
So here you are, loafing around with these tramps.
I came down to see Joe Helton.
- Don't you think we'd better go?
- What?
And leave this woman alone with her husband?
Suppose her sweetheart came in.
Alky Briggs, don't think you can keep me cooped up in that stateroom.
Because you're crazy!
You'll stay down there and keep out of my business.
Do you understand?
- Keep out of my business.
- Your turn.
You were going to show me a good time.
A good time!
I might as well have stayed home and played solitaire!
Your turn.
Pipe down. I've more important things than you to worry about.
Your turn.
You say that again and I'll scratch your eyes out!
You take this gun.
You're gonna need it more than I will.
Oh, you!
Just the man I wanna see.
If I show you how to save 20%... would you be interested?
Of course you would.
First, your overhead is too high and your brow is too low.
Interested already, aren't you?
Wait till I get through.
- I haven't got time.
- Two fellows are trying to attack you... and two fellows are trying to defend you.
Now, that's 50% waste.
Why can't you be attacked by your bodyguards?
Your life will be saved, and that's
100% waste. Now what have you got?
Me, and I'll attack you for nothing.
- What are you getting at?
- I anticipated that.
How does an army travel? On its stomach.
And you? On a ship.
Of course, you're saving your stomach.
- The same common sense...
- I don't think you realise...
I realise it's a penny here and there, but look at me.
I've worked myself up from nothing to extreme poverty. What do you say?
- I'll tell you what I say...
- Then it's all settled.
I'm to be your new bodyguard.
In case I attack you...
I'll be there to defend you, too.
When you want to be attacked,
I'll defend you 10 minutes later.
I've already got two bodyguards, but I'll think it over.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- What's the matter with you?
- I've got a frog in my throat.
- What?
- A frog in my throat.
- You've got a frog in your throat.
- Yes.
You can't do that to my customers!
Cut it out!
Say, what's the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?
Have your landing cards and passports ready, please.
- How do you do, Madame Swempski?
- Hello, boys.
- Any statement for the press?
- No, I'm afraid not.
Nothing of interest on this tour.
Is it true the opera is on the decline in Central Europe?
Absurd.
I predict they're going to have the greatest year they've ever had.
Is it true that you're gonna get married again while on this tour?
- Gentlemen, I don't know what to say.
- Gentlemen, I'd say just this.
The bicycle will never replace the horse.
But, the horse will never replace the bicycle... which is quite a horse on the bicycle if I ever saw one, and I never did.
I dare you to print that, you muckrakers.
- Have a cigar, babe.
- Okay for the picture, Joe.
Pictures? Here's a little sex stuff for your front page.
Now, hold it steady, please.
You can say it was a real love match.
We married for money.
Eh, my shrinking violet?
It won't hurt you to shrink 30 or 40 pounds.
You impudent cad!
- I'll report you to your paper.
- Let me do the reporting.
Is it true you'll get a divorce as soon as your husband recovers his sight?
Is it true you wash your hair in clam broth?
- Is it true you danced in a flea circus?
- This is outrageous!
- If you don't stop, I'll call the captain.
- So that's it.
Infatuated with a pretty uniform.
We don't count.
We gave you our best years, now you want an officer.
I don't like this innuendo.
That's what I always say, love flies out the door when money comes innuendo.
Good-bye. It's nice to have seen you, but I've got nobody to blame but myself.
- Could you tell me...
- Please...
You're awfully glum.
I was just thinking, after the boat lands,
I may never see you again.
Does it matter to you whether you ever see me again?
I can't think of anything in the world that matters more.
Mary, I'll never leave you.
Tag.
Tag.
Wait a minute!
I'm just trying to sneak off the boat, that's all.
I'm looking for the man who owns...
Where's your passport?
Wait a minute.
Let me handle this.
I don't like to speak about it,
Officer, but I happen to be... a good friend of the meat supplier to this boat.
- Well?
- Well, do you like lamb chops?
- Yes, what of it?
- This man doesn't handle lamb chops.
But the roast beef is very good today.
You fellows can't get off the boat without showing passports.
Get on back there at the end of the line and get your passports open.
Go on. Get back there.
Stuffed shirt. When he said that to me... you could've knocked me over with a feather.
He gives you service.
It looks like we're up against it.
It's up to you to get us a passport.
I got you, didn't I?
Well, you'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to steal from me.
He did get up early this morning, but you weren't here. Perhaps tomorrow?
Well, come on. Let's try another one.
What's the idea, putting your hand in my pocket?
Just a little mistake.
I had a suit that looked just like that and I thought those were my pants.
How could they be yours, when I've got them on?
This suit had two pairs of pants.
Better keep your hands to yourself.
Do you know who's on this boat?
Maurice Chevalier, the movie actor.
- I just ran into him.
- Did you hurt him?
- How do you know it was Chevalier?
- I got his passport right there.
Now he can't get off the boat.
Hey, he looks like Chevalier.
And I can look like Chevalier.
- I certainly look like Chevalier.
- But that's not enough.
You have to sing his song to get off this boat.
If a nightingale could sing like you
They'd sing much better than you do
Dandy. Sing like that, they'll throw us all off the boat.
- Well, let's try it.
- All right. Come on.
Have your passports ready. Straight out... you'll find the baggage on the deck.
Have your passports ready.
Keep in line, everybody. 945.
Keep in line, everybody.
Have your passports ready.
- Never mind.
Hey, if you want to get off the boat...
- get in the back.
- Oh, I didn't get on in the back.
- I got on in the front.
- Never mind that.
- Leave them alone.
- You're right...
- I told them to stay in line.
- Yeah? Show me your passport.
- Yeah, right here. That's my name.
- Maurice Chevalier?
Yeah.
- This picture doesn't look like you.
- Sure, I'm Maurice Chevalier.
I'll sing for you.
If a nightingale could sing like you
They'd sing much better than they do
Here, never mind that.
Get back in line where you belong.
I was ahead of you!
Your passport.
Let me have your passport.
This picture doesn't look like you.
It don't look like me from the front, but go in the back of the boat, just like me.
You're not Maurice Chevalier.
- Are you Maurice Chevalier?
- No.
Well, there you are. Wait. I prove it.
If a nightingale could sing like you
He sing much better than you do and
Out!
- No push me!
- Get out of here!
Get back in line where you belong.
Passport!
- This picture doesn't look like you.
- It doesn't look like you either.
- This man has no moustache.
- The barbershop wasn't open.
- Why, look at that face.
- Well, look at that face.
Hey, are you going to identify yourself, or else...
If a nightingale could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me
Out! Back in line where you belong!
Get off there!
- Get off the table!
- What do you think this is here?
- Put that down!
- Lunatic!
- Stop that!
- You want to break that?
Here, let it alone!
Passport. I said passport, not pasteboard.
Come on with that passport!
Not washboard!
Passport!
Chevalier?
If a nightingale could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me
And if the sandman brought me
dreams of you
I'd want to dream my whole life through
For you brought a new kind of love to me
Get him out of here!
- Put him back there where he belongs!
- Take it easy, folks.
The gangplank is to the left, please.
Don't crowd. Don't crowd.
- Take your time. Ladies first.
- Let me off the boat. I'm a sick man.
- I feel faint.
- I don't care, take your time.
I tell you, I feel faint. I'm going to faint.
- Someone get a doctor!
- Somebody fainted.
Where's a doctor? A doctor! I want a doctor!
She's sick. We'll take care of you.
Look, she's got a chill, cover her up.
No, get off. Take her pulse.
No purse, put it back. Pulse.
I think you best take her temperature.
That's good, we'll take care of you, lady.
All right.
You fools, I'm not the patient.
We're not the doctor. Come on.
Doctor! Is there a doctor on the boat?
Doctor!
- Are you a doctor?
- Sure, I'm a doctor. Where's the horse?
- A man fainted over here.
- Man fainted? I'll soon fix him.
Just my hard luck it couldn't be a woman.
Here's the doctor.
Just as I thought, smoking too much.
Here he is here, Doctor.
Don't tell me. I'll find him myself.
I can't do anything for that man.
He's fainted.
What he needs is an ocean voyage.
In the meantime, get him off the boat and have his baggage examined.
Gangway!
You all get close so he won't recover.
Right this way, please.
Step right around here.
Step lively down there.
Back that ambulance in here!
Hey!
Helton's throwing his party tonight, and this time we blow the works.
Now, you guys are going in as musicians.
And stay that way until I give you the office.
Say, what about those four guys in the house?
The ones you said were on the boat.
Don't worry about them.
They eat out of my hand.
The thing for you to worry about is that girl.
Keep your eye on her. Get me?
That ought be easy to take.
Okay.
Sit tight and I'll give you a call.
Have you guys got an invitation?
We give you invitation of Chevalier.
When the nightingale
sings like you
Cut it out! And stay away from this door, see?
Mary?
You certainly had me worried.
I thought you'd forgotten your own party.
You haven't been doing all the worrying.
I was afraid you wouldn't come.
My, but, there are a lot of strange-looking people here.
Ladies and gentlemen! Quiet, everybody.
A lady's diamond earring has been lost.
It looks exactly like this.
In fact, this is it.
I beg your pardon!
How about you and I passing out on the veranda?
Or would you rather pass out here?
Sir, you have the advantage of me.
Not yet, but wait till I get you outside.
You're pretty fresh, aren't you?
That's my wife and I don't like the way you're acting here.
If you don't like our country, go back where you came from.
I should sink that right in your scalp.
- Run for your life! The Indians are coming!
- What?
Put your scalp in your pocket. Here.
The Indians.
- Come here.
- I'll get him.
Have a good time, kid.
This is going to be a real party.
Is this a party?
The beer is warm, the women are cold... and I'm hot under the collar.
In fact, a more poisonous little barbecue
I've never attended.
You're a funny kind of a duck, but I like you.
You stuck by me, and I'll stick by you.
Sheriff, I ain't much on flowery sentiments... but there's something I just got to tell you.
Shucks, man, I'd be nothing but a poisonous varmint... and not fit to touch the hem of your pants... if I didn't tell you you've treated me square, mighty square... and I ain't forgetting.
Sheriff, I ain't forgetting.
Whoa, there, Bossie.
Whoa, there!
My friends, this is indeed a surprise.
You couldn't have pleased me better.
I want you to meet the sweetest little thing in the whole wide world.
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?
No, it's special for Mr. Helton, sir.
You see this?
Come back in a half hour, and I'll give you another look at it.
Listen. Keep your eye on Helton.
We're gonna grab his daughter and take her to the old barn.
Old barn? A fine tinhorn sport you are.
With all the good shows in town, taking a girl to an old barn!
Once we get a hold of that girl, he'll take orders from me.
- I'll show him...
- Enough small talk.
- Where's your wife, Lucille?
- Would you...
Someone's coming. I'll be back.
Be back next Thursday, and bring a specimen of your handwriting.
And, above all, don't worry.
What brought you here?
It's midsummer madness.
The music is in my temples... the hot blood of youth.
Come, Kapellmeister. Let the violas throb.
My regiment leaves at dawn.
I guess my regiment can go without me.
No, don't, my husband might be inside.
If he finds me out here, he'll wallop me.
Always thinking of your husband.
Couldn't I wallop you just as well?
I heard Alky talking about this party.
I've dreamed of a night like this, I tell you.
You tell me about some of your dreams.
Dreams? I can't even sleep anymore, wondering who he's chasing around with.
Why can't we break away from all this, just you and I... and lodge with my fleas in the hills?
I mean, flee to my lodge in the hills.
No, I couldn't think of it.
Don't be afraid.
You can join this lodge for a few pennies.
You won't even have to take a physical examination... unless you insist on one.
What a swell home life I've got.
Why, I think I'd almost marry you to spite that double-crossing crook.
Mrs. Briggs...
I've known and respected your husband Alky for many years... and what's good enough for him is good enough for me.
Emily!
Henry, carefully, somebody may see us.
I've been careful too long.
Now that you've brought it up, how long have you been careful?
- They saw us!
- Be calm, Emily. I'll talk to them.
You won't say anything about this?
Sir, are you trying to offer me a bribe? How much?
But you don't understand.
You see, I'm not happy with my husband.
He should've married some little housewife.
Madam, I resent that.
Some of my best friends are housewives.
Now, see here, if you're going to...
You're living in a fool's paradise.
You intend to spend $10 to buy this woman a ring? Look at this.
It's solid brass and $1.50 takes it away.
I know it'll fit her.
I got it from the nose of a savage.
Well? $1.50. You can have it for $1.
Fifty cents and not a nickel under.
Now, my friends, what am I offered for this fine French piece of bric-a-brac?
I know what it is to be unhappy.
How do you think I feel?
I'm stuck with this ring.
I've been married for four years, four years of neglect... four years of battling, four years of heartbreaks.
That makes 12 years.
You must've been married in rompers.
Mighty pretty country around there.
Do you think you'll ever go back?
Come here, babe. I like you.
I shouldn't. What about my husband?
That's all right.
Maybe we can get a girl for him.
Who was that? My wife?
Married to her 12 years and you ask me?
What're you doing here?
I told you to spy on Helton.
- I did spy on him.
- What was he doing?
- He was spying on me.
- Did he see you?
No. I was too foxy for him.
All he could do was spy on me.
Well, get back in there.
We're all set to cop his girl.
Okay, chief.
They got some good stuff outside.
You want a drink?
Ready, boys? Let's go.
Beat you that time.
- Very swell. Let me get you some punch.
- I'd love it.
Just what I needed.
Well, how's it coming, kid?
- Got everything you want?
- Sure, how about a job for my grandfather?
Your grandfather, what does he do?
He puts cheese in the mousetraps.
Why, we haven't got any mice here.
He brings his own mice with him.
You know, Mary, everyone seems to be having nearly as much fun as I am.
I beg your pardon, but there's someone to see you, Miss Helton.
- Pardon me, and I'll hurry right back.
- Surely.
No, you're wrong, girls, you're wrong.
In the first place,
Gary Cooper is much taller than I am.
I wish you'd announce this singer.
I can't make out the name.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to announce... that the buffet will be served in the next room in five minutes.
To get you in that room quickly...
Mrs. Schmalhausen will sing a soprano solo in this room.
That's no good.
You wanna get thrown out again?
Play something nice.
I tell you what you play.
Play...
That's it.
That's beautiful.
That's magnifico. I like that.
Mary! They've kidnapped her!
Who's been kidnapped?
Mary, my daughter! Do something!
But who could've done it?
It's that Alky Briggs!
You saw them drag her into the car.
Where did they take her?
First, they blindfolded me and then they...
Of course, they took her to the barn.
Fellows, let's all pack up a lunch and go down to the old barn.
Fred, you go down to the North Road.
Jack, you head down by Front Street.
I'll go pick up a couple of the boys.
And I'll take care of picking up a couple of dames.
Women? This is no time for women.
On to the barn!
Gee, I wish I had a horse.
Hurry it up, boys.
Come on.
Let me go!
No use yelling, kid.
Nobody will hear you in here.
You wait till my father hears about this!
He's gonna hear about it because I'm gonna tell him myself.
Take it easy!
You're not going anyplace.
Don't get all excited. Come on.
You take your hands off of me!
Listen, kid. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
You'll be out in an hour if your dad comes through.
Butch, you take care of the girl while
I telephone Joe. Come on, you guys.
You take your hands off of me!
Now, make yourself at home, but shut up!
- Here's $1. Keep the change.
- But I said $1.10.
- Give me $1. I'll keep the change.
That's a half a dollar I owe you.
You call this a barn?
This looks like a stable.
It looks like a barn but smells like a stable.
Well, let's just look at it.
Get out of here!
Have you got a girl in that hayloft?
No!
You're a bigger fool than I thought.
Beat it, I tell you!
- What'd you say?
- I said beat it!
- Pardon me. What did you say?
- I said beat it!
He said beat it.
Gee, I wish I'd said that.
Everybody's repeating it.
I'm coming down there and get you!
Don't bother. We'll come right up.
Come on. I'm going in to get him.
Here we are at the old barn, all set for a nice picnic lunch.
Gosh, the picnic is off, we haven't got any red ants.
I know an Indian who's got a couple of Red aunts.
Don't you think we'd better go look for the girl?
Let's wait till we eat, there's hardly enough lunch for two.
I don't see why she couldn't get kidnapped near a restaurant.
Some dark night, I think I'll come and lay for you if the hens don't get sore.
Here.
Go over to that filling station and get some milk. Grade-A.
Well, come on. Where's the milk?
There's a customer ahead of me.
Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- What are we doing?
What about you, kidnapping a girl?
Old-fashioned piece of melodrama... kidnapping a girl!
You've been reading too many dime novels.
Go on. You get him. I'll wait for you outside.
Keep out of this loft!
It's better to have loft and lost than never to have loft at all.
- Nice work.
- Beat it, or I'll throw you out!
- Take your face out of my foot!
- I gotcha!
So, thought we were afraid?
Thought we were afraid, did you?
Now I'm gonna give it to you guys right!
Butch! What happened?
Hey!
You, get out of that loft!
Butch, what happened?
Come up here, Butch.
Where's all those farmers' daughters
I've been hearing about for years?
Why don't you boys fight over there?
You want to break my glasses?
Come on, folks. Step right up.
Only 10 cents a chance. Attaboy!
Here you are.
Ten cents gets you in the only game in the stable.
Let's see. Number 16 wins.
And the lucky number.
There you are, young man.
Sorry you didn't get a better one.
Here we go!
Let's see what comes up.
Well, if he isn't the lucky guy. Double 0.
Two shots for the price of one.
Folks, this is the best game in all...
You're a mother, you understand.
How would you like to have somebody... steal one of your heifers?
I know, heifer cow is better than none... but this is no time for puns.
Get in that battle over there.
Here we are again at the ringside, and it looks like a great battle.
Now the boys are locked in the centre of the ring.
What a grudge fight. Zowie! Zowie! Zowie!
That makes three zowies, and a man gets a base on balls.
Ending of the first inning.
No runs, no errors, but plenty of hits.
This program comes to you courtesy of the Golden Goose Furniture Company... with three stores: 125th Street, 125th Street and 125th Street.
You furnish the girl, we tar and feather your nest.
Look for our advertisement in today's ash can.
Now the boys are at it in the centre of the ring! Oh! That one hurt!
Come on, you palookas! Stop stalling!
Oh, mama, if I only had my youth again.
Round two.
Both boys are fiddling in the ring, and I don't think much of the tune.
Briggs is bobbing and weaving.
It's nice work if you can get it.
Now they're trying. Very trying.
I copped that one from an almanac.
Now they're in the centre of the ring, and the crowd hurrahs.
Oh, Dad!
Are you all right, honey?
Good boy. Remember, old Joe Helton never forgot a friend.
This is one job that certainly was a pleasure.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for a needle in a hay stack.
Hurry, you don't want to miss the king, do you?
- You know, the king won't wait for you.
- Come along.
The king, king Ferdinand, he's coming.
What's the matter with you frenchies?
Why don't you salute the new king?
- We only salute our emperor, Napoleon.
- No Colas, come on.
♪ Alleluia, Alleluia ♪
♪ Glory, glory, god will have the strength forever. ♪
Your majesty, general Savary has arrived with messages from the emperor Napoleon.
- He hopes for an audience.
- We will receive him.
Let us hope he brings news that the French troops are leaving.
I never approved of allowing them to use our country as a... battlefield in their quarrels with the British.
His excellency general Savary, the Duke of Rovigo.
You are welcome general.
Your majesty, I've arrived just in time to add my voice to the multitude.
I, I hope that you come with good news from the emperor.
Good news and bad.
It seems that their majesties, your illustrious father and mother... feel that their abdication was somewhat forced.
Forced? Why...
Why, my father was only too happy to allow the burden to drop from his shoulders.
They have appealed to my sovereign, the emperor Napoleon.
As you know, all that my sovereign the emperor desires is peace in Europe.
The emperor feels that if your majesty would consent to a conference... it might be settled amicably.
I, I shall be most honored to receive his majesty.
Unfortunately, at the present moment the emperor cannot come to Madrid.
But if your majesty would meet him halfway say, in Bayonne...
Yes. Yes, of course.
You may tell his majesty that I shall come, I shall be most pleased to come.
I shall report immediately to his majesty the emperor.
- Your majesty, if I may presume...
- The people await your majesty's appearance.
Yes, yes of course.
They shall have food and wine for their week of festivities.
His majesty has graciously decreed that there shall be a week of festivities... with food and wine for all.
Nina Maria.
- Let me pass Etienne, I have to change.
- You've changed already.
- That's a very bad joke, let me go.
- I shall see you tonight?
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?
- I haven't time to talk now.
- But Nina Maria...
That Etienne...
Don't know he's going to be so hard get rid of.
It's the flowers señorita.
- He saw them.
- Who sent them?
- The Marquis De Melito.
- The Marquis?
- Oh, he's coming here tonight.
- Señorita?
Now I know I have to get rid of Etienne.
Who is it? Just a minute.
Etienne...
You can't put me off this way, you're coming with me tonight.
Now Etienne, try to understand, I'm tired.
Who is he? Who is he?
I demand to know my successor's name.
Your successor?
Oh, you know no one could take your place.
Why, you're charming, very delightful.
It's just that I'm tired.
You can't deceive me, who sent you those flowers?
Can't a man send me flowers without my going out with him?
If you go out with anyone tonight, I'll kill him.
Etienne, Etienne, try to be sensible.
Go on home, perhaps tomorrow night.
This is going to be settled tonight.
Oh señorita, I'm afraid he mean it.
Oh, if we could only keep the Marquis from coming here.
It would be terrible if anything happens to him.
Nothing will happen to the
Marquis, I promise you that.
If he wants to kill anyone, it will not be the Marquis.
But what can you do señorita?
I just have to make him think it's someone in there.
Come on.

- He has a lovely voice, hasn't he?
- And he sounds so happy.
Oh, don't Lola, I had to do it.
I simply had to protect the Marquis.
The señorita's dressing room is right there.
See who it is.
- Señor.
- Don Diego Manrique de Lara, at your service.
- Come out of that door, quickly.
- With pleasure.
- What happened?
- Didn't you hear me singing to you?
I mean what happened with the French officer?
Oh that, he just glared and walked out.
You haven't a minute to lose.
You must get out of here immediately.
OH, but I just came.
You're a nice young man, you've a lovely voice.
Did you like it?
Yes, but listen, I'm trying to talk sense to you, You don't seem to understand.
You've got to get out of here as quickly as possible.
You don't expect me to leave after you kissed me? I'm yours from now on.
You want to know why I kissed you?
No, it doesn't matter.
You did and I liked it.
I kissed you to get rid of that French officer and that's the only reason.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
Well, you didn't succeed, he's still there.
Matter of fact, there's 3 of them.
- I think you'd better try it again, eh?
- Please, go out the other way.
- That man is an expert marksman.
- What of it?
But you haven't a chance against him, he thinks you're his successor.
He thinks you're here to try and get me away from him.
Well, that's what you want him to think, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
Well, he certainly won't think so if I go out alone. Come on, let's show him that his right.
All right.
- Good night Lola.
- Good night señorita.
Goodbye señor.
Monsieur...
I am captain Audouy representing captain Dubois.
He feels he is been grossly insulted, he demands satisfaction..
Did he say what would satisfy him?
- Name your weapons, name the place, at dawn.
- Dawn?
Oh, couldn't we make it a little later?
Your seconds can find me at this address.
Well...
Now that we're rid of them, where should we go for supper?
- Where you live?
- Oh, just around the corner.
- I, I mean, where you come from?
- Oh, Valencia.
Well, you go back to
Valencia just as fast as you can.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I know, I know.
You cannot fight that man, he'd kill you.
Your coach?
Another one?
This is one I don't want to get rid of.
- Home.
- Yes.
- Señorita...
- Please don't fight that duel.
Well, did you find out anything?
- A little.
- Good.
These French officers are so sure of themselves it isn't hard to make them talk.
Difficult thing is getting rid of them afterward.
This last one was the worst of all but he was also the most talkative.
It seems Napoleon is sending 30,000 more troops.
That'll make 100,000
French soldiers in Spain.
What the officers been told?
Why do they think they're here?
It's always the same thing.
They're here to protect us in case the English invade the continent.
- No talk of war with us?
- No, no, only with the English.
I'm sorry. That's all they seem to know.
I'm convinced that's all any of them know in Madrid.
Nina Maria,
I'm going to send you on an important mission, the most important one you ever taken.
I've arranged for a professional appearance for you at Bayonne... where the conference between
Ferdinand and Napoleon is to be held.
You mean Ferdinand is planning on leaving the country at a time like this?
He and his counselors believe that this conference is a friendly one.
That Napoleon's only interest is the welfare of Spain.
Needless to say, I don't agree.
Napoleon wants to get control of Europe.
The only thing stands in his way is Ferdinand and his popularity.
If he can get rid of Ferdinand... he can take Spain.
Of course these are only my suspicions, I have no proof.
Well, what about Paris?
What word you hear from them?
Well, 2 of our best agents there have just been thrown in prison.
French are very efficient counterspies.
That's why I'm sending you.
I want you to mingle with the French officers at Bayonne.
Those closest to Napoleon and find out what Napoleon is really planning to do.
- When you want me to start?
- Tomorrow morning.
Then if we find this conference is merely a trap as I fear it is... we'll be able to stop Ferdinand before he crosses into France.
- And I'll do the best I can.
- I know you will.
You will stop at the inn of the golden fleece in Vitoria.
Just this side of the border.
One of our agents there will give you any further news.
- Very well.
- Are you sure you can leave tomorrow?
Well, I'll have to make some excuse at the cafe if that's what you mean.
I mean is there no one to hold you here?
- No man?
- Oh, that. No.
Nina Maria, to a man in my position you're a gift from heaven.
Never any moods, hysterics, never any entanglements.
I can't imagine any man as exciting as this service to my country.
Dri, driver,
- You think we'll reach Vitoria by tonight?
- We'll try, señorita.
Thanks.
Pedro, should I go and help the mules with my whistle?
Yes.
- Now what?
- Bandits.
Bandits?
- But I only see one.
- He's a lookout for the rest.
- Oh drive on, hurry, hurry.
- Come on Carlito.
Wait, don't shoot, don't shoot.
Is this the coach of señorita Azara?
- You?
- Ah, greetings.
Now, would you mind telling him to point that the other way?
Serve you right if you did get shot.
Scaring people to death like that.
It's all right Pedro, put it down.
- Sí señorita.
- We thought you were a bandit.
- Oh, no wonder you gave me such a chase.
- What are you doing here anyway?
Well, I came to tell you not to worry about me.
You see, I didn't fight that duel after all.
As a matter of fact, I overslept.
- You come all this way just to tell me that?
- I had to.
When went to cafe last night, you'd already left and I knew you'd be anxious about me.
Oh, that was very kind of you.
Very, very thoughtful. Thank you very much.
- All right Pedro.
- Wait a minute.
You're not going to run away from me again?
I have to, I've a very important engagement in Bayonne, very important.
- Have you any idea how beautiful you are?
- Yes, drive on Pedro, drive on.
All right Pedro... and don't worry about any bandits,
I'll be riding right here by your side.
Well, thank you very much but
I don't want to trouble you.
Trouble me? You can't help it.
You've troubled me from the first time I set eyes on you.
I picked him to get rid of that French officer, now how am I going to get rid of him?
- You don't mind my riding here, do you?
- The road is free, you can do as you like.
I might be able to entertain you on your trip.
Oh no, thank you. Was just going to sleep.
- Splendid, I'll sing you to sleep.
- We'll play for you.
How about a lullaby? Can you play that?
No, no, if you must sing, make it something with spirit.
- Something gay, something lively.
- I thought you wanted to sleep.
Oh, I can sleep through anything.
I was just thinking of the mules.

- Buenos días señor.
- Buenos días.
This way.
Señorita.
Thank you so much for making the trip seem shorter.
Oh, it was far too short for me.
Now, won't you be kind and have dinner with me tonight?
Sorry I can't, goodbye.
You know, you're a very beautiful girl, charming, alluring but you have one bad habit.
- Yes, what?
- Why, you're always saying goodbye.
Very well then,
I won't say goodbye, I'll just go.
This way señorita.
Pablo, Pablo, hurry with the baggage.
This señorita is the other room.
Now, is there anything else the señorita desires?
Oh yes, I'd like a tub with plenty of hot water please.
Sí. Right away. Pelela, Cristina.
Quick, the lady desires a bath.
- The tub, right away señorita.
- Thank you.
- Señorita...
- Oh, just a moment.
- I have a message for you.
- What is it?
The king has started, he left Madrid this morning.
This morning?
But it's been arranged for him to stop here in Vitoria.
If you get any word, you are to send it here.
We can keep him then from going any farther.
- Well, how will I get word to you?
- Go to the marketplace in Bayonne.
There will be a man selling chickens and livestock.
He will have carrier pigeons there for you, he will know you if you say, Vitoria.
Vitoria?
Hurry, hurry, you've always got the time to sleep. Come, here. Put the tub right there.
There. Here. Right here.
All right, go get more water.
Come, more water.
Ah, Pablo?
- Yes, señorita?
- Did you bring up everything, that was all?
That was all señorita.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Pablo, the señor wishes a bath too, get him a tub.
And what would the señorita like for dinner?
Oh dinner, yes. Yes, I think I'd like some fish, some salad, Valencia stew... in about a half an hour...
Leave it to me, I will have a perfect dinner for you.
- Thank you. Oh, just a minute.
- Yes, señorita?
One thing more, the most important of all.
I want a quiet, secluded table in a corner.
- Alone.
- I understand, alone.
- The poor señor, he will be so disappointed.
- I can't help it. I don't dare encourage him.
He might follow us to Bayonne.
Look how far he's already come on a kiss.
- Señor?
- Yes, come in.
And what would the señor like for dinner?
Well, you'd better ask señorita what she would like.
Oh, the señorita's already ordered.
Well, whatever she wants is all right with me.
- Is the señorita with you?
- Well, yes and no.
You know what I mean.
But the señorita said she wishes to be alone.
- Alone? Alone?
- Yes, alone.
Oh yes, of course, alone. You know, alone.
- That's right.
- Oh alone, yes.
Oh, hello.
Well, just in time.
- I'm afraid there's some mistake.
- Oh no, everything is ready.
- But I ordered a table alone.
- Well, we are alone.
There isn't another soul except...
Well, those, those troubadours there.
Shall I send them away?
That's better. Oh, excuse me.
Señorita...
- That's not what I ordered.
- Oh no, I took the liberty of adding this.
- Pablo.
- What is it?
Flaming egg omelet, my own recipe.
- But I don't see any flame.
- Oh, wait.
- Frederico, Lee, Leon.
- Sí, hombre.
This is the supreme moment.
Ready?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Taste? Oh, oh, oh, it's very hot.
What does it taste like?
- More.
- More, good.
- Want anything more?
- No, thank you.
- More food?
- No.
Wine? Isn't there anything?
No, nothing, thank you.
- Well.
- Oh, you're not going in now?
- Well, I thought I'd take a little walk.
- Oh splendid, I'll walk with you.
- Was everything satisfactory this evening?
- Yes, thank you, quite good.
Oh, look. Jasmine.
- It's sweet and fragrant.
- It's like the rest of Spain.
- Waits until the night to come to life.
- Lovely night, isn't it?
Flowers, stars, music...
Oh, you poor darling.
How would you like to go through that every time you needed a new pair of shoes?
Well, at least he doesn't have to take them off every night.
- Oh, Pedro.
- Yes señorita?
I'd like to get an early start tomorrow morning.
- Yes, señorita.
- About 5 o'clock then?
Yes, señorita.
- All right, good night.
- Good night señorita.
Good night darling, you better try and get some sleep now.
Are you coming with us señor?
No. No, you'll have to be our protector from now on.
Señor is far too important, far too busy a man... to be wasting his time following us around the country.
I didn't say a word.
Now you listen to me... you're a very charming, very amusing young man but you are not going with me to Bayonne.
You mean, you could send me home, put me out of your life so easily?
I'm afraid I could.
Oh, now, wait, wait.
It's much too lovely a night to go to sleep.
- Let's sit out here and talk for a while.
- Sit?
Oh yes. Here, it's lovely.
Come on, right here. There you are.
- Comfortable?
- Yes/.
Now, wait a minute, I'll give you a nice, soft cushion.
- Here, you lean against that, how's that?
- Oh, that's wonderful.
Tell me, what do you do when you're not following young women around the country?
Oh, I don't follow young women around the country.
- No?
- No, just you.
Oh, well, I mean aside from that.
Well, my family left me a little money so I travel around and amuse myself.
That satisfy you?
Is that all you want of life?
It was.
Till I met you.
Well, now you're not going to try to get romantic here?
Why not?
What's wrong with this place? Why, it's one of the most romantic spots in the world.
Listen to that song.
- What is it?
- It's Italian song, don't you know it?
No, lovely though.
What more could you want?
This place is full of romance.
Why, it's, it's like Venice.
- Venice?
- It is Venice.
Look at that moon, where could you find a moon like that?
And look up there, you see the dome of St. Mark's?
The one with the pigeons?
- No, I don't see a thing.
- Of course not, you got your eyes open.
Close them.
Now you see it?
No, I don't see the dome but
I just heard one of the pigeons.,
Gondolier, take us to the grand canal.
Now we're pushing off.
Do you hear the lapping of the water against the sides of the gondola?
- Do you feel the motion of the boat?
- Yes.
Do you, feel the sea breeze?
- Now where are we?
- Right back in the barnyard.
Oh no, we're in Venice.

- Now don't you believe in Venice?
Now don't you believe this is the most romantic spot in the world?
- Very nice.
- Nice? Nice? Is that all you can say?
Why, you should be overwhelmed.
You should be swooning in my arms.
- Yes, but I don't feel swoony.
- Well, perhaps I better sing it again.
Oh, no, no. No please.
You see, you see, I'm not the only one, think we'd better get out of here.
- You awakened the whole place.
- Now, wait, wait.
You can't tell me you weren't a little moved by my song.
- I saw it in your eyes.
- Well, yes I was.
- I knew it.
- Just once.
You know that part where you sang...

You know that place just before the high note?
- Yes?
- Well, I was wondering.
- Yes?
- I guess I better not tell you.
- Oh no, come on, come on please.
- Well, I was wondering.
- Yes?
- I wonder if you were going to make it.
Oh wait, you're the most discouraging person.
Goodbye.
Oh, but you're not going to leave me here stranded in Vitoria?
But I have to.
Honestly, when am I going to see you again?
Honestly, you go back to Madrid... and when I return from Bayonne maybe I won't be so discouraging.

- Well Lola, how's that for a start?
- Señorita...
That Don Diego, I thought he was going to spoil everything.
Don't worry about him.
He'll not trouble me after tonight, I saw to that.
Well, she certainly trained her guns on you colonel.
Oh, nonsense.
- Well, I must be going.
- Going? So soon?
Nothing but work for an adjutant.
But, colonel... your hat.
- Oh yes?
- Shall I get it for you sir?
No no. No, I'll pick it up myself.
Good night gentlemen.
Oh major... why don't you stay a while and enjoy yourself?
- Thank you colonel.
- Gentlemen.
Good night sir.
New hat, new uniform.
Hasn't been a colonel very long Lola.
- When he arrives you slip out quietly.
- Sí señorita.
Colonel de Rougemont's compliments to the señorita.
- And may I...
- Oh, come in.
Señorita.
Forgive me for having run off with your hat, was stupid of me.
- Not at all.
- You're not angry?
I'm honored.
Then I'm going to tell you the truth, won't you sit down?
I took it deliberately, I wanted to see you.
Well.
I was so terrified tonight. You know, this is the first time I've ever played in France.
And you were so gracious. You helped me through an ordeal and I wanted to thank you.
No one could've guessed you were nervous señorita, you were delightful.
Oh, do you think so? It's so hard to tell, everything is so different here.
Tell me, were those the right songs?
Is it the sort of entertainment they enjoy in Bayonne?
I know I enjoyed it, I can't answer for the rest of Bayonne, I've just come here myself.
- From Paris?
- No, unfortunately just Bordeaux.
Bordeaux? Oh, but that's just as exciting.
Isn't that where the emperor Napoleon is?
- Yes.
- Oh, did you see him?
Well, as a matter of fact, I've just been made one of his aides.
May I touch you?
Oh, I can't tell you what this means to me., if you only knew how I felt about Napoleon.
I hope you can learn to feel just as warmly about one of his aides.
- So sorry, will you excuse me?
- Of course.
How lovely.
- And this note, señorita.
- Thank you.
The gentleman told me it was urgent, I should wait for an answer.
- Well, would you excuse me?
- Of course.
Thank you.
Tell the gentleman I decline his kind offer.
Just someone wanting me to have supper with him.
I should ask you to have supper with me but unfortunately, I have urgent business that...
Oh, that doesn't mean you have to go to Bordeaux?
Oh no, I shall be here for some time.
At least until after the conference.
- Conference?
- With your own king Ferdinand.
He's on his way here from Madrid.
- Oh, is he?
- Yes.
But a conference, that sounds so serious.
I hope that doesn't mean trouble.
Is just awful if anything like that happened after I'd made my debut in France.
Why, they might even send me back home.
We can't allow anything like that to occur.
As a matter of fact we hope it'll bring about a closer alliance between the 2 countries.
I can think of nothing more pleasant than a close alliance between France and Spain.
I agree, In fact I think we should set an example ourselves.
Do you think that would help international relationships?
- Tremendously.
- Then I suppose we should consider our duty.
- Well, shall we start with dinner sometime?
- When?
Shall we say...
- Ah, what were you saying?
- How about...
This is dreadful, please forgive me.
- The gentleman said...
- The same gentleman?
- Yes.
- Tell him I gave him his answer, no.
No more flowers and no more messages.
- That's a very persistent young man.
- Yes, isn't he?
- Will you dine with me tomorrow at 1?
- I'd love it.
They say there's a delightful cafe.
Wouldn't be more pleasant dining tete-à-tete?
Say, at your quarters?
I was going to suggest that later, may I call for you?
I think it'd be a little more discreet if I came by myself.
I'm at the Chateau Neuf, Rue Dasinalle.
Goodbye señorita.
- Goodbye.
- Until tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
- Oh, colonel.
- Yes?
Your hat.
Thank you.
Señorita.
Oh, I couldn't help it Gianina Mia,
I didn't know I was jealous until...
Apples, fresh red apples, apples.
Apples.
Yes mademoiselle, can I help you?
Pigeons, ducks, some delicious rabbits.
Rabbits? Are they nice?
- Well, these pigeons are they fresh?
- Oh fine, lovely bird mademoiselle.
They told me at Vitoria you had good birds here.
- Vitoria?
- Yes, Vitoria.
Have you been in Spain recently mademoiselle?
Yes, I stopped at the inn of the Golden Fleece just 2 nights ago.
This is a particularly fine bird.
Plump, tender, look.
- The king will reach Vitoria tonight.
- Tonight?
They have persuaded him to stay there until he gets some... further assurance of good will from Napoleon... but when he gets it, he is determined to continue on his way.
I hope to have some word of my own that will stop him before that happens.
Let us pray that you will señorita.
Will one be enough señorita?
Oh, perhaps you'd better let me have two just in case of something unexpected.
I'll let you pick them out, you know which one is the best.
- Well, why not take these two?
- All right.
These are excellent birds and
I assure you they'll go right to the spot.
Well, good day señor.
Lola, have we go everything?
We have about a half hour left.
- Let me try another one.
- Here's one, here.
Lola, take a carriage and go home with those things, I want to get some air.
Sí señorita.
Oh I, I, I beg your pardon.
I was just trying on some hats.
Very becoming.
- I thought you weren't speaking to me.
- I wasn't.
Oh, forgive me.
- The man will be back in a moment.
- I wasn't, but...
- I am now.
- You mean you've forgiven me?
- What did it?
- That hat.
- Does monsieur desire the hat?
- Keep it for me.
I want to have it framed.
Flowers madam? Flowers for the lady monsieur?
- May I buy you some flowers?
- Oh, I think you might.
Anything but, roses.
- Violets, primroses, Jasmine.
- Jasmine would be nice.
- Jasmine please.
- Oui.
- Merci.
- Thank you.
Oh, what you doing here?
I had some shopping to do and thought
I'd take a walk around, see the town.
Come on, let me show you the sights.
- Are there any?
- Are there any?
Why, on my right is one of the most famous buildings in Bayonne.
- So?
- You see that balcony up there?
- Yes.
- And that open window?
Well, in that very room is where
Don Diego spent that night of torture... when he thought his
Gianina had thrown him down.
- Funny, I don't see any tablet.
- Oh, they knew he wouldn't like that.
- You see, he was a very modest man.
- Are you sure is Don Diego?
Oh yes. Why, they even have the bed he tossed in, the chairs he broke in his anguish.
Why, there are even some of his remains there.
- Remains?
- The hair he pulled out.
Strawberries, strawberries.
- Nice fresh strawberries for mademoiselle?
- Oh, aren't they luscious?
You like some? There you are.
Oh, just a minute. I'll get you your change.
All right.
- They're good.
- Aren't they?
- Chestnuts monsieur?
- Chestnuts?
- Want some?
- About a half-dozen.
- I'll tell you what we'll do.
- What?
We'll get a bottle of wine and some cheese and we'll go down to the river and have lunch, eh?
I'd love it but I can't.
I have an engagement.
- With the colonel?
- Yes.
- I thought so.
- Oh no, don't act like that.
After all, I'm in France and my audience is made up of French officers...
I have to be nice to them.
- Your chestnuts monsieur.
- Thank you.
I don't like to see a good Spaniard making a fuss over the French.
I, I didn't realize you were such a good patriot.
I didn't realize it myself until now.
Colonel de Rougemont is a very important man, can do a lot for me.
Colonel de Rougemont never did anything for anyone without them paying for it.
- Oh, I found out all about him.
- Monsieur, monsieur.
- Your change monsieur.
- Thank you, here you are.
Oh, thank you monsieur.
Well, at least you don't have to go off this minute.
- No.
- Let's see the rest of the town.
Oh, we can't walk along the streets like this eating things.
Why not? People who know you will think it's charming.
- How about the people who don't know me?
- They'll wish they did.
There you are, not a chestnut left.
- Have you any more?
- I got just one.
Oh, but it's not for you.
- Come on, sit down.
- All right.
Don't pay any attention to them, they'll go away.
- Lovely, isn't it?
- But it's not Spain.
No, no, it's not Spain.
- What's that?
- Oh, that.
Well, that's an old medallion my father gave my mother the day they were married.
I remember when I was a little girl begging my mother to let me play with it but... she never take it off.
- Look, my mother and father.
- They're lovely.
- All I have left.
- What happened?
Our hacienda was in direct line of attack when the French invaded Spain 20 years ago.
I should think that would make you feel very bitterly toward the French.
Oh no, no, that was a long time ago.
Look.
Well, is that any way to talk to a lady? Go on, go on.
He wants another chestnut, give him one.
Oh no, I got one more left, he's not going to get it, is for you. Here.
Go on, eat it before he sees you.
Oh, it's no use, you don't fool him. Here, come on.
There.
That's all, now go on, run away.
I haven't any more, see? All gone.
No, that was my last one, honest, honest it was.
Oh no, got one more. Here.
- Oh, look, look, it's gone.
- Oh, you?
You're laughing, haven't you any heart?
- Does it hurt?
- Of course it hurts.
Look, he's probably eating the end of my finger right now.
Oh look, it even scratched.
- There isn't much feeling there.
- All right.
- That better?
- A little. Oh, but it isn't well yet.
I like it. Oh, I mean the song.
Go on, sing it, makes me forget the pain.

- Vive I'empereur.
- Vive I'empereur.
- Napoleon?
- I must go.
- Go?
- Oh yes, my engagement is getting late.
- Nina Maria, don't go to that man.
- But I must, you don't understand.
- If I ask you not to?
- Please I, I can't explain.
- This isn't just jealousy.
Nina Maria, I'm not thinking of myself.
Don't go please, I beg of you.
Nothing will come between us, I promise you.
Here. Take this, as a sign of my love...
And with it, my whole heart.
Try to understand and believe in me, please.
- Are my things laid out?
- Sí, señorita, but...
But what?
- I'm afraid something terrible is happened.
- What is it?
A soldier brought this letter a few moments ago, from colonel de Rougemont.
Colonel de Rougemont?
Beg your forgiveness, but due to unexpected developments... must postpone our delightful tete-à-tete...
4 or 5 days.
I know.
It's Ferdinand's refusal to come any further that's caused all this.
4 or 5 days.
- Do you suppose...
- What señorita?
That'd be just time enough... for de Rougemont to reach Vitoria with Napoleon's message and get back.
Oh señorita, if you could only see that message.
I don't have to see it, I know what will be in it, a lot of empty promises.
Anything to get our king into France.
What I want to know is...
What are Napoleon's orders in case
Ferdinand doesn't believe that message.
In case he refuses to come?
Lola, I'm going to keep that engagement.
Oh, señorita...
And if de Rougemont doesn't expect me so much the better.
- Colonel de Rougemont?
- Yes but...
Tell him señorita Azara is arrived.
But, señorita, the colonel is not here.
Not here? Oh, that's curious.
- You're expecting him?
- Yes señorita, he said he be back.
Yes, well then, I'll just wait, thank you.
But señorita I...
If I had known the señorita was coming
I should've had the place more orderly.
- Oh, it's quite all right, don't bother.
- Is there anything you would like?
- No.
- A little wine?
No, nothing, thank you, thank you.
Duval, Duval...
- What's the matter with you Duval?
- Yes sir?
Get my equipment together.
I will start as soon as...
You, señorita?
You seem surprised, had you forgotten?
Oh no, but I sent you a note, to your hotel.
Oh? Well, I was out shopping.
What was it? What did it say?
I had to ask you to postpone our engagement.
- Postpone it?
- Can you forgive me?
Something unexpected is happened... the emperor ordered me to go to
Vitoria to take a message to your king.
I must escort him into France.
Well, I suppose since it's my own king, I'll, I'll have to forgive you.
Oh, it's sweet of you to understand but it's only a postponement.
I'll be back in 4 or 5 days at the most and then perhaps, we can continue...
- Unless something else unexpected happens?
- Nothing else unexpected can happen.
I promise you that.
Duval. My orderly will take you back to your hotel.
- Oh, you're not leaving this minute?
- I'm waiting for some dispatches.
I must be ready to start when they come.
Then I'll...
I'll just wait here and say goodbye to you.
- At your order sir.
- Ready?
Yes, sir.
- Duval, you might open that door a little.
- Yes sir.

I like everything about you.

Perhaps I'd better go.
If you only knew how I'd looked forward to having you here alone.
- Yes, it would've been nice, wouldn't it?
- It will be nice.
- Yes, but sometimes when the mood is broken.
- Oh Nina Maria, don't say that.
You're making it very difficult for me to go.
- Dispatches colonel.
- Any orders sir?
- Has the escort arrived?
- Be here presently sir.
Thank you captain.
- I suppose that means you must go now.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
- Well...
Wouldn't it be,
Oh here, let me help you with that.
Thanks.
These, I should hate them.
- They're really coming between us.
- Nothing can come between us Nina Maria.
Promise me that you'll meet me here when I return.
I promise.
Nina Maria.
- I must go.
- Yes, of course.
Can you forgive me if I let
Duval take you back to your hotel?
Certainly, I understand.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Did you see him señorita?
- Yeah, get the code, quickly.
Oh señorita.
Squeeze that lemon.
Marquis was right, Lola.
- This conference is a trap.
- What?
Colonel is carrying 2 messages.
One is probably a letter of reassurance, the other an order for arrest.
Arrest?
They haven't any mean to lure the king into
France with their promises of goodwill... and they'll take him prisoner as he crosses the border, get me the pack of the birds.
- Is the colonel started señorita?
- Yes.
But he won't get there before late tomorrow night.
Our message should be there in 4 hours at most.
Time to warn the king so he can turn back.
Now the pigeons.
What is it? What's wrong?
This is not my bird, the markings are different.
- Señorita?
- Someone changed it.
But they couldn't I, how could they?
I've been here all the time.
Except...
- You did go out?
- Yes.
The concierge asked me to look in another room where he thought you'd be more comfortable.
That's when they did it.
Let me see the other one.
Concierge?
But it couldn't be he.
No, you see? You see, they changed them both.
They substituted their birds for mine so that my message would go to them.
But who do you suppose could've done this?
Someone who knew my every move.
Someone who knew I had the birds... who knew when I went out and bribed the concierge to get you out of the room.
But if they knew all that why haven't they done something before?
They had to get evidence before they could take me.
If I'd sent this message, they would had it.
Can't you do anything?
Can't you get word to the king?
I don't know.
I might try the man in the market but...
- still, if they knew about the birds they...
- How about Don Diego?
- I'm thinking about him.
- He'd do anything for you.
He knows the roads, he rides fast.
If he leaves now, he could reach Vitoria before the colonel, he could warn the king.
What is it?
He might be the very one who's doing all this.
- Señorita?
- Oh, I know, I know.
But who else could it be?
Marquis said the French had...
- very efficient counterspies.
- But Don Diego? It couldn't be he.
Oh, I hope and pray you're right Lola.
Here, clear up all this.
Destroy everything, get rid of the birds.
- Don't leave a trace of evidence.
- Where are you going?
I'm going to the marketplace.
And if that fails, I'll go to Don Diego.
Pardon me.
The man who owns that store, where is he?
The police came and took him away madame, just a few minutes ago.
The police?
Yes madam, I don't know why but they just came and took him away.
- That's too bad, eh?
- I'd find another store, thank you.
She's coming up here, put those reports away.
Go in there.
Yes, sir.
She's probably coming to you for help.
Just remember, she'll be suspicious.
She's discovered those birds have been changed.
So, be doubly careful.
Make her believe that you're ready and eager to help her, get her to talk.
If she'll confide in you, confess what's she's doing that's all we need.
Very well sir.
And put a better face on it.
You've been long enough in the service to know there's no room for sentiment.
I'll be in there.
- Nina Maria.
- I've, I've come to see this historic site.
- Come in.
- Are you alone?
Yes, yes. Come in, come in.
- What happened to the colonel?
- He had to go to Vitoria on duty.
- Oh, then you didn't have lunch with him.
- No.
Oh, you must be starved, let me get you something, some fruit, wine?
A little wine please, I'm really not hungry.
- Sure?
- Yes, thank you.
How charming?
I didn't know you could find a place like this on such short notice.
- Oh yes, wasn't I lucky?
- Yes.
I wasn't sure I'd find you here,
I was afraid you might be out.
Oh, I came right back here after you left me at the riverbank.
You've, you've deceived me Diego.
- Deceived you?
- Yes.
Yes, you told me I'd find all the chairs broken from that night of anguish.
Oh, yeah.
But everything was miraculously healed today.
- To us.
- To us.
- Getting late.
- Oh, nonsense.
Why, it's only 3 o'clock.
We've several hours before you have to go back to the cafe.
Yes.
- Diego.
- Yes?
You, you meant what you said to me today on the riverbank, didn't you?
Oh, you know I did, Nina Maria.
I'm going to ask you to do something for me.
How long did it take you to get here from Vitoria?
Oh, a day and a half.
Of course, I was riding very hard.
- Why?
- I want you to take a message for me.
- A message?
- Yes/
I'll, I'll write it for you.
Oh, I'll get you some paper.
- Pen?
- Thank you.
Will you get your things?
I'd like you to leave immediately.
- Where am I to go?
- To Vitoria.
- Vitoria?
- Yes.
Here.
- You haven't told me whom this is for.
- Read it and see.
I'll take that captain Andre.
- Captain Andre?
- Of the French military intelligence service.
- French?
- Yes Nina Maria, I'm French.
It took us a long time to find out... who was getting information from our officers in Madrid.
It was captain Andre who first suspected you.
You're a very clever woman señorita but not clever enough.
We've caught you.
- But I, I don't know what you mean.
- Yeah?
Reserve one table alone.
Order one flaming omelet.
I'll be at your place in 3 days.
What's this?
I happen to like flaming omelets.
You mind?
I'm sorry you were disappointed in my note.
As a matter of fact I was about to write another, a much more personal one.
But I wanted first to see what would happen when I handed him this.
Just a moment señorita.
We know very well what that personal message would've been.
We know you're a spy.
Why, monsieur...
Don't think because you outwitted us this time that you can go on with your activities.
You go right back to your hotel and pack.
I'm giving you until 9 o'clock tonight to get out of this country.
And I warn you, don't ever set foot in France again.
Your warning is entirely unnecessary monsieur.
After what I have experienced today I've no desire to return.
Goodbye, better luck next time.
Have you come to see that I leave the country?
- I came to bring you this.
- Thank you.
I know you hate me for what I've done.
You're wrong, I've the greatest admiration for you.
You're a very valuable agent especially for following women.
You sing love songs beautifully and...
Your lovemaking is very convincing.
I deserve everything you think of me but I must tell you, at first, I thought of this as any other assignment.
I even thought it'd be fun.
- Well, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was, for a while.
And then I fell in love...
I wanted to tell you what I was to warn you but I was under orders.
You must believe me Nina Maria,
I do love you and I always will..
I'm afraid I can't believe anything you've ever said.
You're French, that's all I need to know.
Drive on Pedro.
The emperor Napoleon of France makes known to the people of Spain... that Ferdinand VII has abdicated.
- King Ferdinand abdicated?
- What's happening?
In his place,
Joseph Bonaparte will rule as king of Spain.
King Joseph Bonaparte will enter the city of Madrid... on the 20th day of July.
His majesty is to be received with royal honors.
You are to hang tapestries from your balcony.
You're to strew flowers on the street before the king.
You're to be on the streets to welcome the king.
Every man, woman, and child.
You mustn't feel that way.
Perhaps our people needed something like this to stir them out of their lethargy.
There is war and rebellion Nina Maria.
You'll be needed more than ever.
You mean, you still have faith in me after this, this failure?
Oh yes, of course.
You'll have to drop out of sight for a while.
They know you now, it would be too dangerous.
But don't worry, you'll get your chance when the time comes.
I shall live for that time to come.
Are we going to let them take our country from us?
Are we going to let them kill our women and children?
No. No. No.
The British, the British.
Powerful England, powerful England.
This gentlemen, will be the decisive battle of the whole 5 years campaign.
You see the positions of the
French forces holding Vitoria.
The enemy's artillery, here, here, here.
They have command of every bridge, every road, every mountain pass.
And for the first time, we're facing their consolidated forces.
- That means more than 80,000 men.
- Theirs against our 50,000.
With food rations for only half that number, situation seems desperate mi lord.
No no, we've pushed the invaders back this far.
We will not stop now, not if it costs the life of every Spaniard...
That is exactly what it would cost.
And even that wouldn't give us victory.
We must rely on strategy.
May we ask...
For the time being it's best to keep it secret.
But hold all your troops in readiness for an order to attack.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Captain, ask the Marquis de Melito to come here.
Yes mi lord.
- You sent for me mi lord?
- Yes, any word yet?
Only that she's behind the
French lines as a camp follower.
- She's been there a week.
- A week?
These things take time sir.
- She must reestablish certain connections.
- Yes, yes, of course.
I have the utmost faith in her, she's waited a long time for this opportunity.
I know she will not fail.
Continue.
- Bring that girl to headquarters.
- Yes general.
Thank you, what can I sell you all?
- Some wine, tobacco, sweets or wine?
- Let's have wine.
- Yes, give us wine.
- Let's have wine.
Hey, you there.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- The general wants to see you.
- Oh, what's wrong? I, I've permission.
- Come on, and don't be long about it.
- All right, but I've to take my cart.
Sorry.
- Your coat mademoiselle.
- Oh thank you monsieur.
- Come on.
- All right, all right, all right.
Come on Angelino, the general wants to see us.
Goodbye.
- All right.
- All right.
Enter.
Come in.
Thank you captain Pierlot.
Nina Maria.
- I didn't think you'd remember.
- I remember very well.
I remember that you had an engagement with me at Bayonne 5 years ago.
- And when I came back you had vanished.
- Yes.
Just after you left I had some very bad news.
- I had to leave in a few hours' notice.
- But you might have left me some word.
I was so upset, I was so nervous I...
I didn't take time to do anything, not even to leave you a note, sorry.
And now I find you again, a cantinera following our army.
- Had to make a living some way.
- How long have you been doing this?
Since the war.
Spanish found out I was a French sympathizer and turned against me, so...
Well, everything else may have altered but you haven't changed a particle.
You're more beautiful than ever, if that's possible.
And you're less, how shall I say it? Less... unapproachable.
Was I ever unapproachable with you monsieur?
Oh Nina Maria, why didn't you come to me long ago?
I was afraid, you...
- you were so important.
- Well, you're going to be important again.
You're going back with us to Madrid.
And this time you won't have to worry about pleasing the Spaniards.
You'll have lovely clothes and jewels just as you used to.
No more of this sort of thing.
Duval, Duval.
What's the matter with the fella?
Duval...
- Yes your excellency.
- Now Duval... go down to the major's wife, present my compliments and tell her there's a lady in distress.
Ask her if she'll be kind enough to lend her a... a...
- A complete change of wardrobe.
- Yes sir.
And then bring her some champagne, some of my good champagne.
Yes your excellency.
We must celebrate our finding each other again.
- Years since I've had champagne.
- Ah, you've come just in time.
We've ordered some special wines from Paris to celebrate our victory.
- Is there going to be a battle?
- Not a battle, a rout.
The greatest rout of the war.
Oh, how I should like to see that.
How I should like to see you leading your troops.
- You would, would you?
- Yes.
Take me with you please.
This is not going to be a tournament, you know. Battles aren't a very pleasant sight.
Oh, but I want to see.
You've no idea what it's been like back there behind the lines.
We get our orders, we go here, we go there but we never see anything.
I want to be part of the excitement.
I want to see what's really happening.
Do you think I'm going to risk having something happen to you... just when I've found you again?
Oh, but surely there must be some safe place where I could watch.
Yes, yes.
- A complete change of wardrobe sir.
- Wait, let me see.
A dress, slippers, hat.
- Where's the...
- Here sir.
What you got there?
What is it?
A note, a soldier gave it to me to keep for him.
Why was it sewed up in your coat?
I hadn't any pockets.
I wanted to be sure was safe.
Give it to me.
- Well, the soldier said...
- Give it to me.
It can't be anything important.
The soldiers are always giving us things to keep for them.
- He said he'd be back for it but...
- Where did you get this? I want the truth.
I'm telling you the truth. Why? What is it?
A map of our lines.
- Oh, it couldn't be. Why, he wouldn't...
- And what is this written in code?
I don't know. I tell you, I don't know.
Captain Pierlot.
Yes, excellency.
Get me lieutenant Vancour of the intelligence service.
Lieutenant Vancour is off-duty, sir.
- Who is on-duty?
- Captain Andre sir.
- Andre?
- Captain Francois Andre.
Ask him to come here at once and call the guard.
Yes excellency.
Nina Maria, if you're telling the truth you have nothing to fear.
But if you had anything to do with this... you're going to get the quickest court-martial and execution on record.
Enter.
Captain Andre sir.
Send him in and tell the captain of the guard to stand by for further orders.
Yes sir.
You seem to know this girl.
- Yes your excellency.
- I remember your face.
Where have I seen you before?
- In Bayonne, your excellency.
- Bayonne?
Oh, of course, you were the man with the flowers.
- Were you in the intelligence service then?
- Yes your excellency.
I was detailed to follow the señorita.
We suspected her of obtaining information for the Spanish espionage... but we never could get any proof.
Well, we have it now, there it is.
Captain Lagarde?
- At your order sir.
- Place this woman under arrest as a spy.
Search her and her belongings and prepare an immediate court-martial.
Yes your excellency.
Proceed.
That was a close call.
- So, what do you make of it?
- That's an authentic map of our lines.
Every regiment, every battery, almost every piece of artillery.
- She didn't make this map.
- How you know?-
This is a section of an
English general's staff map.
English? Then the English know our position.
- Seems so.
- Where did she get it?
What was she going to do with it?
Wait a minute, maybe this message will explain it.
Seems to me I've seen this code before, let me see.
The first word is...
- Verify.
- Verify?
That's why she wanted to get to the front lines.
Well, decipher that message as quickly as you can.
Yes sir.
- There's something under there.
- Take that board out.
Proceed.
Finished.
- It did come from English headquarters.
- Verify this map and return.
Will attack dawn of the 21st, dawn?
It's in about 5 hours.
- Send the chief of staff here at once.
- Yes sir.
- Any further orders sir?
- That's all captain Andre, thank you.
Carrier pigeons.
Yes sir, we found them among her possessions.
Oh, captain Andre remain,
I may have need of you..
Yes sir.
- Put them there.
- Yes sir.
- You heard what happened?
- Yes your excellency.
That makes it imperative that we change our entire formation before dawn.
Dispatch the following orders...
Withdraw 2 brigades of infantry from each right and left wing... and place behind the ninth, in the center.
Center.
Concentrate all reserves for a center attack.
Center attack.
15 minutes past 4 o'clock.
Captain Andre, I want you to write a message on that map.
Yes, sir.
Put it in the same code.
Write positions correct...
Except for center.
Center weak.
When they attack that center, they'll get a reception they'll never forget.
- Ready?
- Yes sir.
Attach that map to one of those birds and prepare it for flight.
Enter.
Your orders have been executed your excellency.
The troops are now occupying their new positions.
Good. That bird ready?
- Yes your excellency.
- Open that window.
Bon voyage.
- Thank you captain Andre.
- You may now report back to your post.
Well colonel, we're ready, come on.
- Come to see the prisoner.
- Yes sir.
I've only a moment,
I must get back to my post.
- But I had to speak to you alone.
- Why?
You've done your duty, your conscience is clear.
Conscience?
As if I cared about my conscience.
All these years I've dreamed of you, of a time when this terrible war would be over.
When we were no longer enemies, when I could come to you and make my peace, and now... now to be the one who... why did you do this? Why did you come here?
Why did you do this? Why did you come here?
Didn't you know you'd be recognized...
- put to death if you were caught?
- Yes, I knew.
And I was willing to take the risk.
- It was madness.
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps not.
- I'm not going to let you die.
I love you Nina Maria, my life would be over if anything happened to you.
I'll not let you die.
The battle started.
Yes captain Andre, the battle for Vitoria.
That sounded closer.
Something is wrong.
They're not attacking the center, they're attacking this wing.
Nothing is wrong, everything is exactly as was planned.
Planned?
Wellington never intended to attack through the center but he wanted you to... think he was he was going to so you'd weaken your wing position.
What do you mean?
He couldn't have defeated you in the formation you were holding... but he has a chance now that that formation is been changed.
That's why I came up here with that map... came here where you were, where de
Rougemont was. I wanted to be caught.
My instructions were to be discovered with the map but never to send it.
We left that bit of strategy for you.
You mean that carrier pigeon, the British know that we're the ones who sent it?
Yes and they know as well as you do... that you never would've sent it had those been your positions.
Nina Maria. Guard. Guard.
That's right captain Andre, go back to your regiment.
They'll need you, they'll need every man they can get.
Nina Maria.
Oh. Oh, no.

Can't be.

Ammunition, cannons, supplies, everything.

A man...
He fell out there.
They took him away.
I don't know whether he's alive or, or...
Oh, tell me his name,

No, I must go.

No, but he may be in one of the other shelters.

Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Let us pray for His Most Excellent Majesty,
Henry VIII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, defender of the faith, now lying at the point of death.
Almighty and most merciful Father...
- How is the King?
- Three quarters dead, milord.
I doubt he will speak again soon.
Passing of a tyrant.
Before he came each man fought for himself under the white rose or the red.
When he goes...
...there will be many struggling to grasp the threads of power...
...that fall from those hands.
- And among them Milord Warrick.
- You should know me better, Gates.
I don't struggle.
- Well, brother?
- The Prince is still at Hertford.
We start for Hertford as soon as...
- Are the horses saddled?
- Waiting.
They'll not wait long.
Seymour's in the lands.
Edifying but unusual.
And Lord Edward prays...
...for the King's end, the next move, and his own hopes.
Let him pray.
What are those in the shadows?
Ghosts? Headless ghosts?
No, sire, your Council.
Oh, my Counselors.
With heads. Nothing in them.
Fetch them to me.
Milords!
Nearer! Nearer!
It grows dark.
The sound of my own voice is strange.
A last command for you...
Edward, the Prince, my son, succeeds me.
After him, his heirs.
Failing them, my daughter,
Mary Tudor and her heirs.
Failing them, my daughter Elizabeth and her heirs.
Failing them, my sister's grandchild,
Jane Grey.
Jane Grey on the throne?
And the bar behind them.
Who speaks?
Warrick.
No conscience and no fear.
And Edward Seymour.
So great a hypocrite you deceive me when yourself.
And brother Thomas, of some little wit but no judgment.
Thomas, go where your wit will serve you...
...and your lack of judgment not bring you to disaster.
I know you.
All of you!
And I know for what you wage.
But you heard my will!
Edward, Mary, Elizabeth, Jane.
And I lay my curse...
...on any that shall abuse their power over these children... and intrigue against the successors
I have named.
May everything he holds dear betray him!
May his soul perish in the everlasting fires!
May he die a traitor's death!
His head rot on London Bridge, the crows pick out his out his eyes!
Milords, the King is dead.
Why let them get to the start?
As a soldier, Gates,
I've won several campaigns...
...always by waiting till the enemy made a mistake.
There will be many mistakes made in this realm in the next few years.
And much profit to be gained by them.
That is why we wait.
For the moment.
For Edward the Fox and Thomas the Peacock.
They've hated each other from the cradle with nothing in common but their parents.
They'll fall out.
With a little help at the right time.
- They're children. I'm sorry for them.
- Spare your pity.
Their heads may wear the crown of England.
- If they have heads to put it on.
- A delicate point.
We must be behind the head that wears the crown.
- Aren't you afraid?
- You heard what he said.
- A man without fear.
- I heard more, his dying curse.
His curse?
What is a curse but words?
And what a word but breath...
...can be at his last breath?
What, man?
No, I am not afraid.
Your Highness.
Anyhow, the Captain of the Guard says that bows and arrows are done for.
Soon everybody will fight with these new guns.
As if anyone would ever fight with their guns instead of a bow and arrow.
But I want a gun.
Hello, uncle.
Why won't Father let me have a gun?
- Your father would know best.
- That's what he always says.
I'll get round him.
I can accept him when he has doubts.
Edward my boy,
I have news for you.
Sad news, Your Majesty.
Majesty?
Why do you call me that?
- Because you are the King.
- King?
My father's King.
God rest his soul.
- My f...
- Edward, my boy...
We must all die.
Your noble, gracious, and most pious father, in his dying breath entrusted you to my care.
- Indeed his last words...
- His last words were...
...that you should in all things obey me.
For your own good and for the good of the Kingdom over which you now rule.
- Uncle...
- Yes?
- If I am King...
- Well?
I can have a gun.
My Lords, it gives me great happiness...
...to name my beloved uncle,
Edward Seymour,
Lord Treasurer, Earl Marshall, and Duke of Somerset, and I do take him, as Lord Protector of this realm,
...to follow his advice in all things.
Duke of Somerset, Lord Treasurer,
Earl Marshall and Lord Protector.
How much we must indeed be proud of such a brother.
- My lord, you read my very thoughts.
- But your looks belie them.
Your many friends are disappointed in you, Thomas.
Have I so many?
All your brother's enemies.
- I'm fortunate.
- Then make the poise of it.
You lack ambition.
I thought better of you, Thomas.
A drop of poison.
It works.
Eduardus Rex.
That means Edward the King.
And what's the use of making you Protector if you won't let me do anything I want?
You keep me here in the country, you don't let me have any money.
And you won't even let me have that gun.
- One day you will thank me.
- What for?
For teaching you to have no wishes of your own.
No desires but to do your duty.
I'll not sign it!
I've written Eduardus Rex in hundreds and hundreds of papers and my hand aches.
And I don't know what they're about anyway.
And I've sat here for hours.
I don't want to sit here any longer.
And I'll not!
If I could get a new Protector, I would!
After all, I am the King.
What do you want?
Your Majesty.
A gun!
For me?
What's the use of being a king if you can't have everything you want?
And more and have it, and then one more and have that too.
And so helter-skelter to the top of the ladder till there's nothing more to want.
How do you load it?
For truth to tell I mistrust these new fangled things myself.
He'll return soon enough, chastened and obedient.
The voice of his own conscience will speak louder than anything we can say.
I hit it! Oh, look,
I hit it, I hit it!
Look, look!
- Edward, what is it?
- Nothing.
Only sometimes everything goes black. I can't get my breath...
...and my heart goes like horses galloping.
I'm hot and cold, and I'm wet through.
It's as if I'd fallen into the moat.
- Have you told your uncle Edward about this?
- No, I'd never tell him.
Let's shoot this again.
What is this?
It's a new gun Uncle Thomas has given me.
Thomas, I have to speak with you.
Barnaby!
Oh!
You heard my orders not to come here.
- Orders? But my dear brother,
I am also the King's uncle...
- Why have you come?
- To bring my nephew something he wanted.
Understand this!
While the King is in my care...
- Your loving and disinterested care?
- I intend to do my duty!
A most painful duty, Duke of Somerset,
Lord Treasurer,
Earl Marshall, Lord Protector, and anything else you can make yourself!
My lords!
Oh!
Edward, what ails you?
Nothing, uncle, nothing.
I must have bruised myself with the gun.
I'll not have you fire it again.
Barnaby! Barnaby, help His Majesty within.
Thomas, I give you warning.
Brother or no brother, a solemn warning.
Leave here at once, and you show yourself again at your peril.
Brother, the King is yours.
I'll not seek to see him.
So great is my concern for you and for him.
- This means a journey north.
- Milord, why so?
My brother looks so far ahead he fails to see what's under his very nose.
Edward VI will be dead within the year.
- Dead?
- I'll stake my future on it.
- Then it's Mary Tudor.
- A Papist, a Catholic?
- No, they'll not have her.
- Then Elizabeth.
The Commons have declared her illegitimate.
- It's Jane Grey.
- Jane Grey?
That poor child seems likely to be overlooked.
So, we ride north.
So you want to take my daughter back with you to London. May I ask why?
- Don't be a fool, Henry.
- I beg your pardon, my dear?
Don't beg my pardon, beg your daughter's.
For not realizing what Thomas is offering her.
He's offering to take her to London,
I realize that.
- But surely I'm entitled to ask why.
- Lord, give me patience.
You see, milord, I feel a lady so charming, so accomplished, so highly born as your daughter, should not spend all her youth away in the country, however charming her home.
Now, if she were to come to London, under my rule, bringing with her, of course, anyone you may choose to care for her, she might make a more than advantageous match.
- So you'd marry her to someone?
- In good time.
Anyone particular in view?
We can look as high as we will and need look no lower.
- So...
- I wish you wouldn't talk in riddles.
- I have the answer, my dear.
- Oh, you've no lack of answers.
May I remind you that my mother was a sister of Henry VIII?
- You do frequently.
- Blessed Mary!
My mind is naturally more attuned to Lord Thomas' than yours.
There is one other person who might perhaps be consulted.
- And who is that, my lord?
- Lady Jane herself.
What she thinks might be of some matter.
You mistake, my lord. What my daughter thinks is of no matter.
Caeser, De Bello Gallico.
Construe.
Caesar Upon the Gallic Wars.
Why the plural? Bello, Gallico, singular.
Caesar Upon the Gallic War.
Read.
I wonder who it is with Mother and Father.
I wonder who... what?
They're talking in there now.
Whatever they talk of can have no possible concern for a child like you.
That's all very well, but if Jane is to go to court, she'll want a lot of new dresses...
...money to spend. I'm not a rich man.
Milord, I wouldn't dream that you should be the loser.
If I'm granted so great a privilege,
Shall we say two thousand pounds?
Two thousand pounds?
Well, of course I...
No, I don't like it.
You're not asked to like it. Lord Thomas isn't offering to take you to town.
Confound it, she is my daughter.
I happen to know that's true but I often marvel at it.
- Well, the whole thing wants talking over.
- Shall I withdraw?
Leave him to me, my lord.
I have no doubt of the outcome.
- Construe.
- I mean, in our tongue, the Gauls.
They've been there for hours.
Ellen says it's a high personage.
May I enter?
And who may you be?
The high personage.
This is my tutor, Dr. Elmer.
Thomas Seymour, at your service.
I make a rule a lesson must not be interrupted.
I will not break your rule, Dr. Elmer.
I wish to examine her ladyship on her works of the great Cicero.
- Caesar.
- Caesar.
- I think her parents would not approve.
- I think I may answer for them.
If your lordship so desires.
Why did you do that?
Well, I thought perhaps you might like a holiday.
Ovid, Aristotle, Plato, Euclid.
Is that all you learn?
Oh, no!
But besides Latin and Greek,
Dr. Elmer teaches me French,
Italian, Spanish, and a little Hebrew.
And I have master heading for knowledge of divinity and gravity of manners.
Lord preserve us, I should be dead within a week.
Oh, no, you'd get used to it.
But I doubt you'd be good at gravity of manners.
Jane...
Would you like to take a holiday from gravity of manners?
- Most gladly.
- And come to London?
London!
Oh, no.
- No, my parents would never allow me.
- You see that door?
At any moment now it will open, and your father will come in, and he'll say...
'Jane, you are to go to London.
I've been talking it over with your mother and I've made up my mind.'
Oh, there you are, milord.
I, er...
I've been talking to my wife and...
I've made up my mind.
A night of ill omen, this.
You mark my words.
London's a place of sin.
Ellen, aren't you longing to be there?
If it wasn't to look after you, the whole
King's army wouldn't drag me there.
The devil's playground.
Mother!
Yes, I've come to say good night, but tomorrow's a great day for you.
Ellen says its day of ill omen and London's the devil's playground.
Ellen, how dare you put such ideas in the child's head!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
There's shame in me, but not for myself.
I forbid you to meddle with things you don't understand.
There are things I understand too well.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night, mother.
We're giving you a great chance, your father and I.
There's no knowing what may come of it.
Look. That's his barge.
And that's her.
- London Bridge.
- With hundreds of houses on it.
Ellen and I shall be happy here.
I know I shall.
Two hours without a bite.
- And when they do bite...
- They're not more than fish themselves.
My humble dwelling.
And you are very welcome.
I'll not hear it again.
The devil with it all.
...to be a thing repugnant to nature.
I mean not only that the Lord hath spoiled women of authority and dominion, but also that man hath seen, proved and pronounced... just cause is why that should be sought.
Men, I say, in many cases blind, tough in this behalf, see very clearly,
...for the causes be so manifest that they cannot be hidden.
For who can deny that it is repugnant to nature...
...that the blind shall be appointed to lead and conduct such as you see?
That the foolish, weak, and impotent persons...
...shall nourish and keep the full and strong.
And finally, that the foolish, mad, and fanatic... shall govern the discrete... and give counsel to such as the sovereign of my kingdom.
And such be all women, compared with men.
For their sight is of such blindness...
- Milord.
- We listen to godly words.
I have news for you.
No news can have such importance as godly news.
News of your brother.
- Jane Grey? He must be daft.
- Thomas is ambitious.
Not a word of this.
For the peace of the realm, keep silent.
- I know my duty.
- The godly words.
Listen yourself awhile.
You may derive much profit from them.
# Passetyme with gude companye #

- Well?
- The Lord Protector is here.
Shall I bring him to you?
No, I'll come to him.
- You know this air?
- Very well, my lord.
Then take my part.
It is a soothing sound.
# Youth wyll have nedes dalyaunce #
# Of gude or yll #
Edward!
Cheer, good brother.
An Italian design. I find it pleasing.
Jane Grey is with you.
Entrusted to me by her parents.
I warned you that I should stop at nothing if you dared interference.
Interference?
But you desired, if my memory serves, sole control of the King.
- And to that you're welcome.
- It is too near the throne.
It is a direct threat to the government.
Treason!
- Edward, how you jump to conclusions.
- Jump to conclusions? You drive me to them.
# So God be pleeyd #
# thus lyfe wyll I #
This is beyond forgiveness.
I've been long suffering beyond measure.
My patience is at an end.
And mine?
Edward, I'm tired.
You have a very pleasant home of your won.
- One last word.
- Let it be the last.
Last and very truthful.
And by your bearing, Thomas,
I think you have a little knowledge of what it is.
Clearly, say it and go!
You fool.
Many a thrashing have I given you as a boy.
And all to no purpose.
But this new folly will cost you more than a thrashing.
It will cost you...
...your head.
The last word has been said.
And this is the last time that we shall ever speak together alone.
My lady!
The guilt of this and the blood are upon your own head.
Guilty of what?
Whose blood?
No matter, my dear.
Nothing to worry your head about.
He seemed so strange.
Yes, a strange man.
He surprises me sometimes.
- I'm frightened.
- Frightened?
Is he going to do something dreadful to you?
Why should he?
After all, he is your brother.
A most loving brother.
Halt!
Thomas Seymour, I arrest you in the King's name.
So loving a brother that he sent his friends to fetch me.
- What does this mean?
- Jane, I believe your Ellen's right.
This place is indeed the devil's playground.
And the devil has some ugly tricks.
- But, My Lord, I...
- Now listen!
I may not return to this house... for some little time.
And if I do not, you must go back to the country.
- Don't you want me here?
- I think you'd be better in the country.
I want your solemn promise you'll go back.
If you'll come and see me.
- As often as I can.
- You sound so serious!
Serious? My dear child, there's nothing in life worth being serious about.
Or in death either, for that matter.
Captain, at your service.
The end of my master.
- The end?
- Tower Hill and the ax.
Milady, there's but one person in the whole world can save him, yourself.
- Me?
- You're the King's cousin, his own age.
Will you go to the King and beg mercy for my Lord Thomas?
- Oh, I will, I will!
- Your Ladyship!
He has shown me nothing but such goodness and kindness.
And now... now he's in danger of his life.
Oh, forgive me if I presume too much.
But you are the King.
You are my cousin.
I beg of you not to allow anything so unjust, so cruel, so wicked.
Have no fear, cousin Jane.
Lord Thomas shall be set free.
We give our royal word.
Send the Lord Protector to me.
And when he comes,
I'll be alone with him.
Hurry!
You sent for me?
I have been informed, my Lord Protector, that you have placed my uncle Thomas under arrest...
...and that you intend his execution.
Well, you mustn't do it.
You must let him go.
It is our royal command.
Edward.
- Do you know what Thomas has done?
- No, Uncle.
Do you suppose that I should stain my hands, perhaps my soul, with a brother's blood without good reason?
- But Uncle...
- Edward, my boy, in high politics...
...we have to set aside all thought of self.
And this you must learn from my example.
But what has he done?
That which in the eyes of men and of the angels cries out for death.
And now, before you weaken me in my resolve to do my duty, out of my sight.
Go to your room, to your bed!
Whereas Thomas Seymour,
Baron Seymour of Sudeley, is in stand of the tainted, convicted and condemned of high treason...
...and other high crimes.
The Court condemns that he be taken this day to the base of execution...
...upon Tower Hill to be put to death by the severing of his head from his body.
And that in the evening...
...his head be placed upon the gate of London Bridge.
This is not justice!
It must be stopped!
Pray, good friends, listen to me!
The King himself has pronounced against this wickedness.
- The King?
- The King.
If it goes forward it is because the tyrant
Edward Seymour overrules the King!
- Down with the Protector!
- Down!
High stakes already, Gates.
In a few minutes one Seymour will have lost his head the other his popularity.
As I foretold, we win by waiting.
Put that down! Do you hear me?
Put that down!
That's the property of milord
Thomas Seymour.
The property of Thomas Seymour traitor is forfeit to the Lord Protector.
Drunk wolves, vultures, ghouls!
Can you not even wait till the deed of shame is done?
But he's there, on the scaffold.
You'll hear the cannon any moment now.
- Cannon?
- They fire a cannon when the ax falls.
No, no, this can't happen. It won't!
The King said he would never allow it.
The King?
A message, milady.
- From the King?
- From milord Thomas.
I left him on the scaffold.
He reminds you of your promise and asks your forgiveness.
But the King said he wouldn't allow it.
He gave me his royal word.
The King my cousin gave me his royal word.
Even now, even this last moment he will stop it, he will. I know he will.
He'll send my lord to return to his home.
Why do you stand there staring at me like that?
Why don't you say something?
He'll set him free!
He'll come back to us! I know!
And it came to pass, when there was a gather in the fields, that Cain rose up against his brother...
...and slew him.
And the Lord said unto Cain, where is Abel thy brother?
He said, I know not.
I am nigh my brother's keeper.
And he said,
What hast thou done?
The voice of thy brother's blood cries onto me from the ground.
Get the King.
We start for Windsor.
I am in the place where I am demanded of my conscience that I speak truth.
So I ask of ye.
Is there no man who will turn the wrath of heaven and avenge a brother's blood?
Milord, Master Knox hurls his thunderbolts, and with shrewd aim.
He looks to you, milord, as do we all.
To me?
Seymour has gone to work, to Windsor with the King.
A strong man to lead us, and we'd hunt him to the death.
Milord, you take me off my guard.
I am no politician.
Nor do I wish to meddle with one.
A plain soldier.
The country bleeds under his toe nails.
You persuade me, Arundel, against myself.
So for the love that I bear you and this land of ours, make what use of me you can.
To your posts, all of you!
Captain, will you hand the castle over to Warrick?
Order your men to their posts.
Mutiny?
Place this officer under arrest.
You will assume his command.
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
- What's the matter?
There's going to be a fight.
Warrick and the Protector.
Come on, Look!
He's coming with his army.
Look!
Edward! Edward, you must come and speak to your soldiers.
- Me, why me? You're the Protector.
- Their King must speak to them.
They never heard me talking, now you do it yourself. You told me to keep quiet.
Listen, my boy, there's not a moment to be lost. Exact your royal authority.
There's mutiny in the castle but for you they'll defend it.
If they don't want to,
I don't see why they should.
- But we shall be in Warrick's hands.
- I'm not afraid.
Yes, but my boy, you don't understand.
It's on me that he'll have no mercy.
You showed no mercy for Uncle Thomas.
I shall lose everything.
In politics, Uncle, you set aside all thoughts of self.
- That I learned from your example.
- Your Majesty, my lead, my royal master, out of your great mercy, out of the gratitude that you owe me,
I implore you, come before it's too late.
It is too late.
A poor run you gave us,
Edward the Fox.
Take him away.
Your Majesty.
- Are you afraid?
- Not very.
I'm here to offer myself as your Protector.
I pray you, Edward the King, name me so.
Will there be any more sermons?
No, Your Majesty.
- May I shoot with my gun?
- You may, Your Majesty.
And may I ask cousin Jane to the palace?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
My Lord Warrick, you are a Protector after my own heart.
- That's good!
- Could you do that?
- Well, I've never tried.
- You could do it as well as they do.
They do it all the time where they come from.
My Captain's brought them from Hindustan.
I am glad you could come.
I wish you weren't going home tomorrow. Must you?
- Yes.
- Why?
I gave my promise.
I must keep it.
I like Warrick.
He's the best Protector I've had.
He lets me do everything I want.
He let me ask you here.
And you know, they wanted to cut off
Edward Seymour's head.
But I said no. Cutting off one uncle's head off is bad enough.
What are you looking like that for?
- Something I heard.
- What?
That something is going to happen.
And this banquet was arranged just to keep you out of the way.
No, no. Warrick would never do that.
I'm really King now.
I get my own way.
I even drink wine at banquets.
I don't like it but I'll get used to it.
You watch.
My Lord Warrick.
I drink to my Lord Warrick.
My Lord Warrick!
Here! I want you here!
Your Majesty.
What was that cannon?
An execution, Your Majesty.
Edward Seymour?
Your Majesty would be more correct to speak of the late Edward Seymour.
You said you wouldn't kill him.
You promised you wouldn't.
I told you not to!
I commanded you not to! I...
Well?
- Milord, the King's state is grave.
- How mean you grave?
There is a certain lymphatic humor in the blood.
- A certain...
- Enough! Will he die?
Assuredly, milords, as we all shall.
Oh, vanity words with me, you dolts, you...
You are one of the most learned physicians in the land.
Use all your skill, devise your most potent remedies.
The King must be restored and speedering.
See that I am obeyed.
Milord, we would obey you in all things.
But in all humility, the poor boy is beyond our physics.
You pack of senseless fools!
You dolts, you knaves!
Out of my sight!
I command you!
Your thoughts, Gates.
Well man, have you lost your tongue?
May his head rot on London Bridge.
May the crows pick up his eyes.
A man with no conscience...
...and no fear.
I should be well equipped to fight both the living and the dead.
This boy shall not cheat me by his death.
We shift our ground.
That's all.
I'm going now.
I came to see how you were.
Was it that I ate too much?
I could eat twice as much.
And I often faint.
I'll be well in the morning.
You were right about Warrick and wanting to go back to the country.
Wish only I could come with you.
- Couldn't you? Just for a while?
- He wouldn't let me.
Oh, cousin Jane, they use me for their own advantage.
I no longer know truth from lies.
But it'll be easier being King when you're older.
You go away from this place as soon as you may.
Nothing could keep me here.
Good night, cousin Edward.
Good night, cousin Jane.
Where do you go?
- Home, my Lord.
- I'll have you stay here awhile.
But my Lord...
Apartments will be prepared for you here in the palace.
- But, my Lord, I must go home.
- That is not possible.
- By what right do you speak?
- In the King's name.
- The King has just said I may go.
- The King is a sick boy.
I can have but one concern, his well-being.
My physicians tell me that your presence here in the palace will speed his recovery.
So... you will stay.
And so, milord, I ask for your consent to the betrothal of your daughter to my son.
My Lord, you do us great honor.
And your son, milord, is he of the same mind with yourself?
My son has not been told.
But when he is told, he will do as he is told.
Well, Arundel, horse-riding and here I am.
- And welcome.
- My father sent for me.
- He did?
- For what?
For what? Milord Warrick will tell you that himself.
Whenever my father sends for me
I have no pit to my stomach...
- ...and my blood runs cold.
- What mischief have you been about?
I?
It's what he's about.
- An intriguer from his birth.
- Milord!
Indeed I have little doubt that he selected his own parents...
...and arranged to be born in the best bed chamber.
- Where's Jane Grey?
- About the palace. Our men watch her.
- Why do you watch me?
- Watch you?
- Why should I watch you?
- You're one of Warrick's spies.
Most certainly I'm not.
Do you hate him too?
Well, er... He's not always easy to get on with.
- I ask your pardon, sir.
- Oh, don't go.
Tell me.
Why do you hate this Warrick with such violence?
He said it was for the King's sake
I should stay here.
Yet I have not seen the King, not once.
- And now everywhere I'm followed.
- Followed?
I reach a door my way is barred,
I know not why.
I'm afraid.
I wake up at night with the sound of his name in my ears.
My Lord Warrick, my Lord Warrick, my Lord Warrick!
My Lord Warrick will speak with you, milady.
- Arundel.
- Milord?
- Who is that girl?
- Jane Grey.
- Jane Grey? What do they want with her?
- Milord Warrick will acquaint you.
- When?
- In his own good time.
Mother, all my life till now
I've availed you in everything.
But I'll not avail you in this.
Jane, I'm amazed that you should be so willful, so headstrong, so undutiful!
- Father!
- My dear, you must be guided by us.
But I'm not being guided by you.
My Lord Warrick has arranged this for some purpose of his own.
- You will obey your parents in this.
- I will not!
- You will marry my son...
- I will not!
- ...the betrothal will take place tomorrow.
- I will not!
- At noon.
- I'll not!
- All arrangements have been made.
- I'll not, I'll not!
I'll not, I'll not, I'll not!
I'll not.
Guard!
Guard!
This way!
Who is it? Halt!
- Why do you follow me?
- Your pardon, my lord.
Thank you for saying it was you.
Well... it was me.
But, er...
What were you doing?
I was running away.
Warrick again?
They want me to marry his son.
I'll never marry him.
But... why haven't they told...
Warrick's son.
Haven't they?
No.
How did you know that?
Well... I know him.
My Lord, who are you?
Ask me more of Warrick's son.
Don't mention his name again.
I hate him as I hate his father.
I'll not marry him.
If you'll not marry him, he'll not marry you.
I know this Guildford Dudley better than anyone in the world. I'll vouch for him.
So... your word you'll not try and escape tonight.
Your word, I pray you!
You have it.
And I'll keep it.
As I know you will.
The solemn deed of covenant and betrothment... between, on the first part, the Lord Guildford Dudley, son to Sir John Dudley,
Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warrick and Duke of Northumberland,
Knight to the most noble
Order of the Garter, and in the second part,
Lady Jane Grey, daughter to Sir Henry Grey,
Baron of Ashley, Bonneville and Harrington.
Marquess of Dorset, and Duke of Suffolk,
Knight of the most noble
Order of the Garter, and of his wife, the Lady Frances Brandon. daughter to Mary, Queen Dowager of France, and sister to His Late Excellent
Majesty Henry VIII,
King of England and Lord of Ireland.
How is it with Your Majesty?
Sleepy, Warrick, I couldn't sleep.
You must rouse yourself to sign your name.
What is it?
A deed naming as your successor,
Jane Grey.
I'll not sign it!
I'll not sign it.
She should never be Queen, never!
She wants to live in the country where she's left alone and she's happy.
And she shall!
I won't make her Queen!
To be treated as I have by people like you!
Who care nothing for us, nothing for England, nothing for the people!
Only your own power.
I'll not sign it!
I'll not sign it!
You can't make me!
I'll die first!
Die!
I'll beat you that way!
Paste the King's signature on this.
You shan't do it!
Come back!
Come back! You shan't do it!
I'll tell them what you've done.
I'll tell everyone in England.
I'll tell them all what you are!
I'll tell them...
How lovely it is. How peaceful.
And most blessed of all, how far away from London.
I feel I never want to see
London again.
You're happy, aren't you?
It's lovely to be able to look into the future.
It can be so full of joiety one wants to laugh.
I'll race you back to breakfast.
What means this?
It means His Majesty Edward VI is dead...
...and that your wife is Queen.
Queen Jane of England.
Queen?
No... it can't be.
It can't be.
Your Majesty, your cousin before his death made his last will...
...naming you as his heir.
But I don't wish to be Queen.
In the name of all here present, we swear ourselves as your loyal and faithful subjects, ready to serve you in all things.
My lords and gentlemen, I thank you, all of you.
But I refuse.
A refusal is impossible.
There is no escape from this.
My Lord, I'm no longer still a child.
- No longer in your palace.
- Your Majesty, hitherto we have met only, I fear, as enemies.
But today there is a vital need that we should act in complete accord.
I have no wish to act in accord with you.
Your Majesty, you must think of your country, not of yourself.
Today you are acclaimed Queen in London.
The bells are ringing, the streets are full with people shouting your name.
If you refuse, though Mary Tudor is hated by the people, there are those that will raise an army on her behalf.
It would mean... civil war.
Will you bear the responsibility for that?
Your Majesty, it is not only your right, it is your sacred duty to take your place on the throne.
If so be, it is my duty.
I will rule over my people...
...as well as I'm able.
And as gently...
This I can promise you.
There will be no more of revenge, and cruelty, and bloodshed.
Amen to that.
God bless Your Majesty.
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Who comes?
- Whose men are you?
- Mary Tudor's.
- Lead me to her.
My Lord.
You must go no further down the road, madam.
Warrick's men wait for you in ambush.
It is my duty. My brother has sent letters desiring to see me.
Your brother is dead.
Dead?
- But the letters?
- Forged by the milord Warrick.
He has put the child Jane on the throne and seeks to entrap you while he may.
Those forged letters were the bait, so I beseech you go not a step further.
Back now to safety. Then you can raise the eastern counties to your cause.
- This will mean blood.
- Peace, Father.
Have I not courage to shed blood if it be my duty?
In God's sight I am Queen.
And in His name will I raise my standards.
You have earned our thanks.
Let the torches be put out.
We ride back.
Tomorrow we hold Council... and shall be proclaimed Queen.
Whereas our most mighty sovereign and ruler
Jane, Queen of England and of Ireland, does this day intend and purpose to enter into her capital city of London, and proceed to her palace of the Tower,
- The Queen's most excellent...
- God bless Queen Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the...
Your Majesty's keys.
I'll tell you, milord, what it will be like if not.
Last night bonfires burnt in every street...
...and the people danced around them shouting Mary.
- Mary the Queen.
- And take over an English fool?
Mary Queen might be a danger.
I have sent Gates to put her under arrest.
- Even now she is his prisoner.
- Milord!
She had tidings of my approach and fled to Suffolk.
The eastern counties have flocked to her support. We are as good as lost!
- Unless we act at once!
- How would milord Arundel act?
Take course for Mary's camp.
Throw ourselves on her mercy.
That from the man who's the first to kneel to my daughter.
Our decision was a wrong one, we have yet time to undo it!
Quiet, milords!
You are losing your heads now in such a way...
...as to make sure of losing them later on the scaffolds.
If by your pleasure in deceit you stray to Mary, which one of you will be able to wipe your hands clean...
...of what you have already done?
So...
If there is any one of you that will feel more safe with Mary, let him go now.
Good.
I ride this this hour to meet the rebel army.
If you remain united behind me,
I have no doubt of the result.
I leave the Queen's majesty here in your keep.
Why did this have to happen?
When will we run our horses now...
...galloping back to breakfast?
We were looking into the future then.
How little we knew.
But the future's still ours.
Have your horses saddled and be prepared to ride full-armed within the hour.
My Lord!
The rebel Mary has dared to raise an army against your men.
But must you take my husband?
Jane... he is my son.
And I believe my love for him is as great as yours.
I take him with me because that's where his duty lies.
Say your goodbyes and come.
Must you go?
If I did not go, I should be a coward.
Jane, we're both doing what we must.
Our duty.
And we must help each other, without flinching.
Fair you well.
Your Majesty.
- No news, no sign? Nothing?
- Nothing, Your Majesty.
But there's no need for you to fret.
Milord Warrick never yet lost a battle.
Thank you.
Warrick is taken!
Mary's army marches on London!
Milords!
The bells! That means he's back.
My husband's back!
I pray so. Nine days a queen and little but trouble to show for it.
- My Council's sitting. I must ask them.
- My dear, best stay where you are.
A queen doesn't go ask for news, it is brought to her.
No, I can't wait.
You can come down from there, my dear.
You're no longer Queen.
Warrick is defeated, Mary is proclaimed, and all your counselors have deserted you.
- And my husband?
- Alive and unhurt.
Then... we can go home.
Jane Dudley, I arrest you in the name of Her Majesty Queen Mary.
- A pretty end, milord.
- Not quite the end.
- Ellen!
- My dear, you must be patient.
Now that Mary is crowned Queen, she will be merciful.
I'm not patient.
I fear for my own courage.
Her Majesty, Queen Mary.
Cousin, you have done that for which I as Queen can have but one answer.
There must be no shadow of doubt in the mind of any...
...that for high treason there can be but one punishment.
- You wish my death?
- I do not wish it.
You are young and I think less guilty than those around you.
Though I may feel pity,
I can show no mercy.
Your Majesty, myself I admit my fault.
I have done a great wrong against you.
But my husband, what has he done?
- He is your husband.
- It's his father's business.
- Which makes his case the poorer.
- He had no choice.
I have no choice. Security of my kingdom demands that he shall die.
Why must you all build your greatness on the graves of others?
Why cannot there be triumph without...
...suffering?
Child, you speak out of your ignorance.
You forget the verities of government.
If I should spare your husband and yourself, there are those who would lead an army on your behalf...
...and then two thousand would die in the place of two.
Now you understand.
You and your husband must die.
Then...
...he will meet his end bravely.
As I hope I shall.
Cousin Mary.
Bare me no malice.
In what I did I meant you no harm.
I was Queen...
...for so short a while.
We're ready... milady.
Is it cold today?
It is, milady. Bitter cold.
My cloak.
I mustn't seem to shiver...
...lest they think I'm afraid.
Will your ladyship forgive me?
Most willingly.
Jane, would you like to take a holiday from gravity of manners and come to London?
We're giving you a great chance, your father and I.
There's no knowing what may come of it.
The devil's playground.
I think you'd be better in the country.
I want your solemn promise that you'll go.
You were right about Warrick and wanting to go back to the country tomorrow.
So, you will stay.
You will obey your parents in this.
You will marry my son.
So, your word you will not try and escape tonight.
We're only doing what we must.
Our duty.
Long live the Queen!
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills...
...from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved, and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord Himself is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy defense upon thy right hand
The sun shall not smite thee by day...
...neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil.
Yea, It is even he that shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in...
...from this time forth.

Okay. Say, Jones and Barry are doing a show.
That's great!
Jones and Barry are doing a show.
Jones and Barry are doing a show.
Jones and Barry are doing a show.
Jones and Barry are doing a show.
Jones and Barry are doing a show.
- Jones and Barry are doing a show.
- Testing, testing.
Jones and Barry are doing a show.
You're telling me?
Well, of course, I'm not a lawyer.
I'm in the Kiddie Kar business.
I don't know much about contracts... but it looks good to me.
It's the biggest contract I ever signed.
Thanks to you, Mr. Dillon.
Aw, you could have your choice of a dozen shows.
A pretty girl like you.
Not with this depression.
If not for you and your Kiddie Kars...
Oh, now, Miss Brock...
Dorothy, I mean.
You don't mind my calling you Dorothy, do you?
Why, of course not.
Well, Dorothy,
I'd like to do something for you.
You've done entirely too much for me already... and I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
No, no. I mean...
I mean, I'd like to do something for you... if you'd do something for me.
Why, Mr. Dillon, of course
I'd be very glad to... but what could I possibly do for a big man like you?
Call me Abner.
When we got Dorothy Brock, we got a great break.
Abner Dillon guarantees to finance anything she does.
These days, stars like Dorothy Brock are a dime a dozen.
That's what we got you for.
Julian Marsh, the greatest musical comedy director in America today.
What do you mean, today?
All right, tomorrow too.
Say, with your reputation...
Did you ever try to cash a reputation at a bank?
I'm in this for one reason only:
Money.
Money? You?
With all your hits, you ought to be worth plenty.
I ought to be, but I'm not.
Did you ever hear of Wall Street?
Excuse me, Mr. Marsh, there's a phone call for you. A Dr. Chadwick.
- I'll call him back.
- He says it's urgent.
About your examination.
Use our private phone, Julian.
What is it, doc?
You have?
Good Lord, you're not a machine!
That body of yours will stand just so much.
There's no other way.
You're not just headed for another nervous breakdown.
Any undue strain on your part might easily prove fatal.
Sorry, doc, but I've got to risk it.
Anything wrong?
- You won't have another breakdown?
- The contract's signed.
- That doesn't matter.
- That's all right. It holds.
You'll get your Pretty Lady.
You haven't got anything to worry about.
I'm not gonna let you down... because I can't afford to.
I've given everything I've had to that gulch down there.
It paid me, sure, in money I couldn't hang on to... fair-weather friends, women, headlines.
Why, even the cops and the newsboys recognize me on sight.
"Marsh the Magnificent."
"Marsh the Slave Driver."
Actors tell you how Marsh drove them, bullied them... and tore it out of them.
A few would tell you how Marsh made them.
They've all got something to show, except Marsh.
Well, this is my last shot.
I'll make more actors, but this time
I'll sock my money away so hard... they'll have to blast to find enough to buy a newspaper.
That's why I'm going ahead with Pretty Lady.
Pretty Lady has to be a hit.
It's my last show, and it's got to be my best.
You're counting on me.
I'm counting on Pretty Lady... because it's got to support me for a long time.
- Wait!
- Remember... my contract makes me boss with a capital B. What I say, goes.
Now, make the chorus call for 10:00 tomorrow.
He'll drive us crazy before we get this show on.
Yeah, but suppose that guy should pass out on us?
New York will see its first triple funeral.
Good morning.
Mr. Marsh will be here soon.
Quiet now. Quiet, please!
Quiet, everybody, quiet!
Hello, Jerry. How are you?
Hello, Andy.
It's too good to be true.
How's the turnout, Mac?
About 50-50. Half are dumb and the other half are dumber.
Andy! Hello.
He's so busy.
- Lorraine has been hitting the bottle.
- The peroxide bottle.
You wanna get me canned?
You're set, you're in. Now scram.
Darling, you're just too sweet, the way you keep spoiling me.
I beg your pardon.
It's okay. This is a two-way street.
I beg your pardon.
But are you, by any chance, the?
What is the word?
The stage manager?
Hey, Ann, come out from under that accent. I see you.
Lolly!
Darling.
You remember Ann Lowell?
Not Anytime Annie?
Who could forget her?
She only said no once, when she didn't hear the question.
You been abroad?
Andy?
Where's Andy Lee?
Yes, Mr. Marsh. Coming right up.
- Good morning, Mr. Marsh.
- Good morning.
- Line them up.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, girls, line up. Come on.
Quiet, now. Quiet!
Come on, now. Quiet, girls.
I want all the dancers to line up and double-lined out front.
Showgirls can double-line in back of them and the boys in back of them.
Don't spread out!
Come on, girls, hurry up.
I really had a charming summer in Deauville, dear.
Yes, but don't you find Sir George impossible at times?
Get a load of "Minnie the Mountaineer."
It must have been tough on your mother, not having any children.
That's telling them.
Oh, dear.
You looking for somebody, or just shopping around?
Where will I find the gentleman in charge?
First door to your left, dearie.
I know, but...
- He's expecting you.
- But that's the...
Our mistake. The other door.
- Oh.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, what's the idea?
Oh... They said...
Weren't you expecting me?
Well, not exactly, but I'm afraid you'll do.
Well, I don't understand.
I don't either.
What are you looking for?
Well, isn't this the...?
Wait till I get my clothes on.
I'll show you where it is.
It isn't an "it," it's a "he."
Maybe I'm wrong about the whole thing.
Let's start over again.
I'm Billy Lawler, one of Broadway's better juveniles.
Oh. I thought you were important.
That's the way most people feel about juveniles.
Only most of them aren't so frank about it.
- You're new to show business?
- Oh, I've had experience.
- How many shows?
- Why, any number of them.
- Come on, now.
- To tell you the truth...
I want the truth.
This'll be my first, if they take me.
If they take you? Say, you can't miss.
I'll take you in myself.
I'll steer you right up to the stage director.
Come on, let's go.
A short order of ham, coming out.
Not good, but loud.
Honey, take a good look at them now.
Because after they make that back line, you won't see them again.
If it isn't Little Lord Fauntleroy and the village maiden.
Just a minute.
Where are you headed, sister?
- She wants to see Marsh.
- That'll make Marsh's day perfect.
Come on, girls, inside.
There's the boss right there.
His name is Julian Marsh.
He's the fellow with the light green felt hat. Go over and talk to him.
Quit shoving.
Lift the skirts up a little higher.
Come on, come on.
Afraid I got a run.
- First door to your left.
- In my stocking.
First offense?
Yes, but I don't think
I ought to tell them that.
No, of course not.
And they'll never guess.
Do you think I'll do?
I only know what I read in the papers, but you look all right to me.
- Andy! Get the first eight girls.
- Yes, sir.
Will the first eight girls line up here?
The first eight girls line up down in front. Come on.
Now lift your dresses up.
Come on, higher. I want to see the legs.
Yeah, they got pretty faces too.
Turn around. Come on, turn around!
Oh, dear, not a calf in a carload.
- Get the next eight.
- Next eight, come on.
Stick with us, and you'll come in on the tide.
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Line up, girls.
Hurry up, girls. Lift your dresses up.
- Do you mind holding Fifi for me?
- Turn around now, please.
All right, back.
Three!
Okay those three on the left.
If I were you, I'd keep them.
I suppose if I don't, you'll have to.
Lorraine again?
Andy, you're a panic.
All right, have it your way.
Mac, okay by special request of the copyright owner.
- All right, next eight. Hurry up.
- Next eight girls.
What's yours?
Diane Lorrimer. 333 Park Avenue.
And is her homework tough!
Next.
- Adams!
- Here.
- Kipling!
- Here.
- Andy.
- What's the matter?
Well, what is it, what is it?
What's the matter now?
Must have been a slip-up someplace.
We're a girl short.
Well, that's great. Just great!
We also need a dance director who can count to 40 without a pad and pencil.
- Mr. Marsh...
- Well, do something! Get another girl.
Are you gonna stand there and shake a blond out your pantlegs?
Yeah, but Mr. Marsh...
- I don't want to butt in...
- A lot of people are like that.
- I'll have one here in the morning.
- That's ducky. I can hardly wait.
Mr. Marsh, you don't have to wait.
And she's a swell dancer too.
You picked her, but she got eliminated the third time through.
- Come out from behind there.
- You, with the legs! Come out of there.
Quiet! Quiet, please!
- Quiet, please!
- Quiet, please!
Well, I'm a... Hey, kid! Hey, you!
Hey, come on, get up.
- The boss wants to see you again.
- Who? Me?
Come on, come on.
All right, she'll do.
They're all yours, Andy.
All right, get in line.
All right, now, everybody.
Quiet, and listen to me.
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna start a show.
We'll rehearse for five weeks, and we'll open on scheduled time... and I mean, scheduled time.
You'll work and sweat and work some more.
You'll work days and nights... and you'll work between time, when I think you need it.
You'll dance until your feet fall off and you can't stand up... but five weeks from now, we're going to have a show.
Some of you have been with me before.
You know it'll be tough.
It'll be the toughest five weeks that you ever lived through.
Do you all get that?
Anybody who doesn't think he'll like it, better quit right now.
What do I hear?
Nobody?
Good. Then that's settled.
We start tomorrow morning.
All right, 10:00 tomorrow morning, we start with the lyrics.
In practice clothes.
What did I tell him?
This is what I told him:
"No, I won't run your stage for that money."
Great. You beat Jerry to the finish by two lengths.
All right, take your positions.
We'll try those routines again.
Quiet! Where do you think you are, home?
I get back to New York and I get this wire.
Come on, kids, make it snappy.
All right, Jerry, let's go!
Dorothy, that's your cue.
Things can never be the same now.
I beg your pardon, but would you mind saying:
"Things can never be the same now"?
- That's what I said.
- You did not.
You said, "Things can never be the same now."
- I did not.
- You did.
- Who's directing this show?
- She's reading my lines wrong.
- I am not.
- What did you say?
I said, "Things can never be the same now."
That's right.
Things can never be the same now.
The scene ends with you on the steps, and you go into the number.
That's where you take his hand.
The scene ends with you two on the steps, and we go into the duet.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You're doing fine for a beginner.
- Well, thanks. I'm trying.
I was so scared that first day,
I walked around the block four times... before I had the courage to even come and apply for this job.
It's tough, but you'll get along.
Well, I wouldn't mind, if I could only get that routine set.
I'll show you those taps.
Come on with me.
Taps?
Say, I can do a tap dance on my ear.
What bothers me is that routine.
Then I'm just what the doctor ordered. Come along.
Now, look.
Cross over.
You're gluttons for punishment.
Well, Mr...
Well, this boy's showing me.
- I was trying to make her...
- Trying to make her is right.
We'll just let that pass.
Now try it again.
- Where you sitting?
- On a flagpole, dearie. On a flagpole.
I always said she was a nice girl.
She's so good to her mother.
She sure is. She makes $45 a week and sends her mother 100 of it.
Get some feeling into it, will you?
What do you want me to do, bite my nails?
You've got the busiest hands.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
It's out.
That'll be enough of that. It smells.
You don't like this number?
Sure, I like it.
I've liked it since 1905.
You think this is a revival?
- It's out. The whole number!
- This number will be a riot.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Dismiss. An hour for lunch.
All right, everybody.
One hour for lunch.
Waiting long, darling?
Well, long enough.
My, but we're grouchy, aren't we?
- Oh, no, not that, but...
- What?
I'm getting tired of this hiding in doorways... sneaking in and out of places and keeping under cover.
Why, I'm beginning to feel like a criminal.
There's nothing criminal in that, is there?
No, there's nothing criminal in that.
I thought we'd better tell you, it looks like we're in trouble.
That word has a familiar sound.
Are you married too?
This is serious, Julian.
Serious? Did you ever leave your wife... sitting alone in a nightclub, holding the check?
You know Abner Dillon's putting up the bankroll for our show.
I knew he wasn't here because you liked his face.
I don't like his face or any part of him.
He looks like a Bulgarian boll weevil mourning its first-born.
Well, his interest in our show is Dorothy Brock.
And his interest is our principal.
Very good. Very, very good.
Even I was able to gather that much.
Yes? Well, we stand a first-rate chance of having him... withdraw his financial support.
Now, did you gather that?
But why?
Because dear Miss Brock is two-timing
Abner right under his very nose.
Who with?
With a fellow who used to be her partner in vaudeville.
She's come up in the business, he hangs around.
He's been out of town and just got back last week.
If Dillon finds out... And if he doesn't, he's dumber than I thought...
Well, now, wait.
Nobody could be as dumb as all that.
He'll just walk out on us and we'll be sunk, that's what... if we don't do something.
Tried applying dough to the problem?
Give the Romeo 100 bucks.
Get him out of the way.
We might try using a little flint.
You don't know this guy Denning.
That's his name. Pat Denning.
He's not the kind of guy that gets sent places just like that.
Oh, no, he gets train-sick.
Oh, I see. Hard-boiled?
Well, it's going to be just too bad...
- ...but nobody's gonna ruin my show.
- What'll you do?
I'll talk it over with Murphy, a friend of mine from downtown.
- Slim Murphy?
- Yeah.
Murphy will kill him.
That'll teach him a good lesson.
I don't want to be mixed up with Murphy or any other gangsters.
No? One man's meat is another man's Murphy.
I told you what this show means to me.
Well, this is what it does mean.
Hello, Murphy? This is Julian Marsh.
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Listen to me.
You gotta do me a favor.
Did you ever hear of Dorothy Brock?
Good, that makes it so much easier.
Well, listen to me and get this.
It seems there's a certain guy by the name of Denning.
D-E-N...
N-I-N-G.
I got you, Mr. Marsh. Sure.
Hey, pipe down!
What do you think I got on, earphones?
It's as good as done.
Say, you ain't gonna forget me on ducats for the new show, are you?
Thattaboy! Okay.
Not another nickel, honey.
Just can't be done anymore, that's all.
Pat, don't be silly.
We've always shared and shared alike, haven't we?
What's come over you?
Getting a sudden attack of manhood, possibly.
Let's quit kidding ourselves.
I'm a regular anchor around your neck.
- You're not.
- I am.
Besides, never being able to see you... except when nobody's looking is getting me down.
But, darling,
I owe everything I am to you.
It was you and that act of ours that started me in all this.
Why, you trained me and coached me and taught me all I know.
I was pretty dumb too.
- I haven't forgotten.
- The act?
It was grand, Pat. Really grand.
- It was terrible.
- You didn't think so then.
You mean I didn't say so then.
Oh, Dot, you've gone ahead.
You've earned it. I've stayed behind where I belong, I guess.
You've kept yourself behind.
Nothing of the sort. They wanted you.
They never wanted me.
Besides, I've been getting myself some education... and they have a name for a man who doesn't work... who accepts money from a woman.
It isn't a very nice name.
- Darling, you're talking like a child.
- No, I'm not.
- There isn't any other reason, is there?
- No.
- Sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.
It's late. I'll take you home.
Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- I wish you didn't feel that way.
- So do I, but I do.
Watch your tempo! Watch it, will you?
Get your feet off the floor.
Faster, faster!
Come on, faster! Faster!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
It's brutal!
Oh!
May I remind you that Pretty Lady's out-of-town opening is not far away?
It's been advertised as a musical comedy with dancing!
If it isn't asking too much, will you please show me a little?
All right, once again.
Give it something!
Come on. Ready, Jerry?
Get into it now. Come on!
Having fun?
After three weeks, a leg ain't nothing to me... but something to stand on.
Let me hear your number, Dorothy.
Come on, Jerry. The "Habit" number.
Jerry, put it up a half tone, will you?
Doesn't she sing gorgeous?
Seventy thousand bucks.
Watch this, honey.
I may want you to understudy her.
All right, okay.
Come on, folks, get ready for the duet number. Start up.
Okay, Jerry, let's go.
Come on, faster!
Faster, Jerry, faster!
What's the matter with you?
- You all right, kid?
- I guess so.
Come on, faster. Faster!
Peggy!
- Stand back! Get back in line.
- She's fainted.
Come on now, places.
This is a rehearsal, not a rest cue.
Mac, take her outside. Hurry up.
Come on, everybody.
All right, come on, get back.
Jerry, let's go.
Come on, pick it up!
- Here, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hold your places!
- Lawler, inside.
- The girl's okay.
- You feel better, honey?
I guess I fainted.
That's a good guess.
Well, I guess I'm all right now.
Woo. Bad guess. Better sit down again. Now listen, you let me play now.
What would you suggest, doctor?
A little fresh air and conversation.
What about Mr. Marsh?
Never mind Mr. Marsh.
Let's sit this dance out.
And if I lose my job?
If you do, there just won't be any show.
Anyway, it's a nice idea.
I've got a lot of nice ideas.
What I need are ears to spill them in.
Well, won't mine do?
Yes, you know, I think they'd do very, very nicely.
When are your ears available?
At all sorts of odd hours.
You must look them up sometime.
Remind me to tell you you're swell.
- That's all for tonight.
- All right, dismissed, girls.
Well, thanks, doctor.
Your prescription was great.
Now for the workshop.
You gotta take it daily to really do any good.
It'll have to be absent treatment, I'm afraid.
At least for the time being.
- Good night.
- Bye.
- Good night, Jimmy.
- Good night.
Coming, Abner?
Dorothy, where will we eat?
You know, Abner, I'm not a bit hungry.
- But I'm all dressed for dinner.
- Oh, yes, so you are.
I'll get the car.
- Dorothy, the car's here.
- Yes, Abner.
Why, doctor, you must like it here.
I'm beginning to.
I'm not the doctor anymore, you are.
I've become the patient, and I'd like a little advice.
Very well, but you might tell the doctor your name.
I couldn't do that, but my initials are Pat Denning.
What do you advise for a man who's both hungry and lonesome?
- Company.
- Excellent.
Did you have anyone in mind?
- Did you?
- Will you?
- I'm very much afraid I will.
- Good.
Good night, Pat.
It was a wonderful evening.
- I'll see you again?
- I hope so.
- Good.
- Good night.
Hey, got a match?
Yep. I guess so.
Happen to know a guy named Pat Denning?
- Why, yes.
- We've got a message for him.
This guy Denning's a pretty wise mug, but he ain't wise enough.
If he don't lay off Dorothy Brock, it'll be just too bad... for Denning. Get me?
- I'll tell him.
- Yeah, well...
Oh!
- That's so you don't forget.
- Pat! Pat!
Pat. Who were they?
- Friends with good advice.
- Are you hurt?
Not much.
But, Pat, tell me what happened.
Better let it drop.
Besides, it's hardly a bedtime story for a nice girl like you.
What do you think this is?
Get that man out of here!
- But, Mrs. Holt...
- But nothing!
I have eyes.
Just because there's a depression on, some folks think I'll stand for it.
But you don't know.
After running a rooming house for 19 years, there's nothing I don't know.
Now you get out, and no more talk!
Then if he goes, I go too!
Probably I'll be able to bear up under that blow too.
Well... where do we go from here?
- Hotel?
- I suppose so.
But it'll have to be inexpensive, as I only have a dollar and a half.
- What about my place?
- Broke?
Not exactly. Not exactly flush either.
Then I guess it's your place or a park bench.
Here you are.
That's better.
Hand me your coat.
Make yourself comfortable.
Will you excuse me a minute?
Rose-colored glasses.
Let's see how the world looks.
- Okay, doctor.
- Here we go.
- Things beginning to look any better?
- A little bit.
- Tired, aren't you?
- Dead tired.
And I feel just like beginning.
You hop, step and jump as many miles as I have today... and you'd be tired too.
Pat. Pat, what are you doing?
Please put me down!
Please, Pat. Please put me down.
Now you go right to sleep, youngster.
What you need is a good night's rest.
Good night.
- Oh, Pat.
- Yes?
Will you hand me my bag, please?
- Oh, which one?
- That one.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What do you do when you've got left feet like mine?
- Just pick them up and lay them down.
- I'm doing the best I can.
Get a load of the juvenile.
Didn't know we had elephants in the show.
Wait a minute, hold it!
Hold it, Jerry!
Some director's gonna jail you for taking money under false pretenses.
You're supposed to be a dancer!
You just need license plates to look like a Model T Ford.
They've been going all night long...
I'll keep them here if it takes a week!
All right, get out!
- Take the last eight bars.
- Pick it up, Jerry.
Pick it up, Jerry.
- Hello, honey.
- Oh, Dot, how are you?
Oh, tea for two.
Yeah. Friend of mine dropped in.
Love me?
I wonder.
You're not going to get serious on me, are you?
- You leaving town?
- Yeah.
Stock job in...
Philadelphia.
Oh, Pat, without telling me?
Well, I thought it was the best way.
Maybe you're right.
Sit down, dear. I want to talk to you.
I've done a lot of thinking since the other night.
Pat, you know what's wrong with me, or rather, with us?
We've grown too necessary to one another.
You've been content in the shadows while I basked in the spotlight... simply because it's held us together.
- My success has been your failure.
- Well, dear... my failure, as you put it, has been my happiness.
But, darling, you're capable of such great things.
You're not a quitter.
I've only wanted to help, but I've been hurting you instead.
I realize that now.
That's why I came here this morning.
Pat.
We're not going to see each other for a long time.
No more doorways.
No more secret meetings.
You're going out on your own and make a success.
You're right, Dot. But you know... somehow, I can't imagine going on without you.
Nor I without you... but it's got to be.
Yes, Dot. It's got to be.
And maybe, someday... someplace?
Maybe.
Bye, Pat.
Oh, Dot...
I love you.
Me too.
Up!
Up.
Up. Up.
Up.
- How are you, Bluebeard?
- Okay, just a touch of scarlet fever.
Oh, that's fine. Maybe it'll develop into something serious.
The curtain's just come down!
It's the end!
Is this what you call a finale?
What is this? Amateur night?
Have we been rehearsing for five weeks, or did I dream it?
The show's ragged!
- What do you mean, the show's ragged?
- The numbers are ragged!
May I remind all you shining lights that... this is the company that opens tomorrow night?
I am in the right theater, am I not?
This is the Pretty Lady company, isn't it?
The all-star show that... opens in Philadelphia tomorrow night?
- Philadelphia?
- Quiet.
Quiet!
Philadelphia, PA.
Yeah, and on Sundays, it's P-U.
- Quiet!
- Quiet!
Julian...
- ...you mean Atlantic City, don't you?
- I mean Philadelphia.
Train leaves at 1 p.m., Penn Station.
Full dress rehearsal, 4:00.
Arch Street Theater.
But I don't want to go to Philadelphia.
Who does? We couldn't get the house at Atlantic City.
But why Philadelphia?
Well, when you become stage director... we'll open in your apartment.
But right now, it's Philadelphia.
Of all the cities in the United States, he would pick Philadelphia.
All right now, listen to me.
We open at the Arch Street
Theater tomorrow night.
So this is Philadelphia!
Why don't you stop that?!
Peggy.
- Getting a kick out of it?
- Of course, you?
I don't know. Do you suppose anybody'll even know I'm in the show?
I will.
Does it make any difference to you?
Gee, Billy. I've been for you since that first day.
Places, everybody.
- I'll be seeing you.
- Okay.
You won't forget the modulation on the last eight bars.
- You forgot your handkerchief.
- Go ahead.
Call those timers, hold them.
- nice to the right people, you'll get along.
When you walk downstage... just give it a little life.
You know, sort of...
Quiet! Please!
Well, it's... not good, it's not bad.
That's all for tonight.
- Wait.
- Hold it!
Come back here, girls.
I want you all to take your minds off the show.
Get out and relax.
Forget it till 10:00 tomorrow morning.
I don't know. I think it'll do.
But I want you to come back tomorrow... to give the best performance that you ever gave in your lives.
Company dismissed.
- Dismissed, girls.
- Company dismissed!
Go on out and have a good time.
You really was elegant, Miss Brock.
Pansy, did anyone telephone me?
Phone?
No, ma'am. Nobody at all.
- You're sure?
- I certainly is. Yes, ma'am, Miss Brock.
- Have a little supper with me?
- I would have.
- But you thought of it too late.
- I've been thinking of it all day.
Well, I'm not a mind reader.
I've got a date.
Billy.
- I'm free tomorrow night.
- Then it's a date.
- Okay.
- Don't forget, now.
I gotta get the stuff for the party.
Do you mind?
I'll see you at the hotel, room 1061, and make it snappy!
She says for you to wait.
She'll be out in just a minute.
Oh.
Good night, Mr. Marsh.
I said, "What is it? A duck?"
Andy, you're terrible.
You know any more?
I've got a lot more...
Andy?
- Yes, sir?
- Go on, yes man. Papa give you liver.
Shut up. This may be important.
Oh, it can't be, darling.
He's calling you.
Hurry up!
Oh.
Sit down, Andy.
Anything wrong, chief?
Everything's wrong, Andy.
No, you're a great director, Mr. Marsh.
Maybe I was, but... right now I'm a sick man.
They told me I was sick when
I started, but I started anyway.
Andy, I'm going to finish, and I'm gonna have a show.
I know what they'll say.
They'll like it. They've got to.
"Marsh is a wizard.
He turns them out like clockwork.
The guy isn't human. He's a machine."
Well, I'm not a machine, Andy.
And for the first time, I'm counting on someone else. I've got to.
I'm counting on you. And tomorrow night, we're gonna give them a show.
The greatest show
Julian Marsh ever put on.
What are you doing? Got a date tonight?
No.
Come on home with me, will you?
I'm lonesome.
Sure.
Taxi.
Pat! What are you doing in Philadelphia?
Got my passport and dropped over.
- Business or pleasure?
- I don't know yet, but it's a job.
Say, what about one of those cozy midnight suppers one reads about?
I've been hoping you'd come out.
- Oh, dear, I have a date.
- Well, break it.
- I'd like to, but I can't.
- Well, you can try.
It's with the company and we open tomorrow. I really should be on hand.
I understand. Let me drive you to the main event.
All right.
Taxi.
Congress Hotel.
Forget something, Dorothy?
Oh, no.
Congress Hotel.
Oh, Abner. Isn't this car big enough for two? Move over.
You ain't gonna have another spell, are you?
I'm tired. Dress rehearsal is no picnic.
- A little party'll do you good.
- Yes.
Don't just being with me cheer you up?
Oh, tremendously.
I'm practically hysterical right now.
Oh, don't be afraid of me.
I got strength.
I used to be the intercollegiate champion hop, skip and jumper.
- Come on now, hurry up.
- Here I come.
Give the little boy a big hand.
Right across your big mouth.
Please!
I tell you, I don't even know my own strength. Wait a minute.
Just look here.
Oh, you're too, too divine.
Tomorrow you've got to give a performance, not an exhibition.
Well, you'd never know it from the manuscript.
I beg your pardon.
She's right.
- Let's dance.
- I don't want to.
- Come on, I wanna dance.
- Stop mauling me.
Let me alone.
You're not funny to me tonight.
- I've got half a mind...
- You're telling me.
Do you wanna cramp your act?
In a star, it's temperament, but in a chorus girl, it's just bad taste.
What is this, target practice?
Why can't you let me alone?
Wisecracks, I'm sick of them!
I'm tired of you.
Tired of all of you, do you hear?
Why, Dorothy.
You know, you better hop on your
Kiddie Kar and go back to Cleveland.
Excuse me, it's the tight shoes.
Shut up!
- Where are you going?
- Maybe she needs me.
- Are you going to be a sucker for that?
- Sucker! You listen to me.
Seventy thousand dollars is a lot of money to pay for a pack of insults.
So you've been calling me a sucker behind my back?
Well, I ain't a sucker for anybody.
Dorothy don't mean that to me!
If not for me, she wouldn't have had a show to star in.
She better not try to give me the air now.
Now...
So that's it, is it?
You small-town big shot.
- Now don't start...
- Shut up!
So I better not give you the air?
Well, that's exactly what
I'm giving you right now.
Now get out of my room, you sucker!
Get out!
Try and make me!
- Don't do that again!
- Get out!
Get out!
No place for anybody whose insurance ain't paid.
Wait for me.
And the next time you come to a lady's apartment, act like a lady.
Please!
- Hello.
- We've located Mr. Denning for you.
Get him for me, will you?
Oh, now what?
Hello.
- Hello, Dorothy.
- Hello, Pat...
Pat, I can't stand it any longer.
I've gotta see you.
- Yes, but...
- Please don't ask me why.
Just come quickly, please.
All right, dear. I'll be right over.
Come in.
Sorry, Julian.
More trouble.
- What's up?
- Dorothy's out of the show.
Definitely, once and for all, she's out.
Well, let me have it. What happened?
She threw me out of her room.
That's what.
Now you want to throw her out.
What is this? A game?
- You can't do it.
- Oh, no?
Brock's in my show and that's final.
If Dorothy stays in... this show don't open tomorrow night. That's final.
Why, you potbellied sap.
I resent that.
You've sunk $70,000 already, and you're gonna toss that away... because of a dame?
That's my funeral, ain't it?
And the funeral of 200 other people: chorus girls, boys, electricians.
You wouldn't be that mean, would you?
Well, I think she ought to apologize.
Why, of course she'll apologize.
She'll be sorry by morning.
I wish you wouldn't take it like this.
Back in New York, they're calling you
"The Angel of Broadway."
No.
- Sure.
- Are they?
Well...
I guess maybe I can overlook it, if she apologizes.
But it must be tonight.
That's final.
What's the matter?
You don't seem to be warming up at all.
Oh, don't, Terry! Please!
Come on, this is no way to act.
You've got me wrong, Terry.
I'm not acting.
I just don't like to be pawed, that's all.
Come here, honey.
Why, you don't know...
- Must have been a fuse.
- Yeah, a fuse named Charlie.
Peggy! Peggy!
Go get her, Terry!
Come on, let's have another drink.
- Going down?
- No, sir. Up.
Pat.
Pat.
If he cramps our show now...
We fixed him once before, and we can do it again. Let's get Marsh.
- What?
- Mr. Denning. Is he here?
- You know he is. What do you want?
- Mr. Denning.
Can't leave him alone for five minutes, can you?
Please, Miss Brock. This is important.
What's the matter?
Oh, Pat, there's going to be trouble. I saw...
Oh! So it's "Pat" to him, but it's "Mr. Denning" to me.
You bet there's gonna be trouble.
- Let's see what it's about.
- I know what it's about!
She's been spying on us.
- Spying? I wasn't spying...
- You were!
You were peeking through the keyhole.
You were, because I saw you.
She's jealous.
You want him, but you won't get him!
- Wait a minute.
- Wait for what?
More spying and double-crossing?
- Let me go! Let me...
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, Miss Brock!
- Dorothy...
You pushed me, didn't you?
Dorothy, what's the matter with you?
Oh, Pat.
- My ankle.
- What is it?
My ankle.
- Get the house doctor right away.
- All right.
Hello. Hello. Please send the house doctor to Miss Brock's apartment.
Yes, thank you.
Get her shoes off, quick.
There, there, now.
Oh...
Pat, it's swelling.
- Answer the door, it's the doctor.
- All right.
- You sent for me?
- Yes, doctor. Right in there.
- Oh, doctor. It's her ankle.
- Which one?
- A glass of water, please.
- Yes, doctor.
- Is your name Denning?
- Yeah.
I want to talk to you. Where is she?
- She's had an accident.
- What?
She fell and twisted her ankle.
It may be a break.
What are you talking about?
How bad is it?
- Can't tell definitely.
- Maybe it's only a sprain.
Looks like a fracture.
Can't tell till the x-rays are made.
- Will she be able to go on tomorrow?
- Go on?
- She's got the show tomorrow night!
- Not a chance.
She's got to! Do something, doctor!
Get her a pair of crutches.
- Oh...
- There, there.
- Don't stand there gaping.
- But...
Oh, get out! Get out!
- I still don't know why you're here.
- If it was your business, I'd tell you.
A broken ankle?
It's too bad it wasn't her neck.
May I have your attention?
- Quiet, quiet!
- Quiet, please!
There'll be no performance tonight.
Wait a minute. Wait!
Our star, Miss Brock, has had an accident. She's broken her ankle.
Don't leave the theater until you're dismissed. Get that, Andy?
Hold the company here for further instructions.
- Stick around, everybody.
- Don't anybody leave the theater!
You gotta think of something, someone.
There must be some way out of this.
Dillon just phoned.
He's got everything fixed.
- Up to and including Brock's ankle.
- No, he's going through with it.
He's going through with what?
He found someone to take Brock's place, and he's on his way here with her now.
- Where?
- I don't know.
Come on, Marsh.
No such luck.
Now, there's a Kiddie Kar
I could really go for.
Anytime Annie. Well, lay me low.
Your new leading lady, folks. I guess
I saved the day all right this time.
We'd better go in and talk it over with Marsh.
- You have a big investment in this show.
- You're telling him?
I appreciate your help, but she won't do.
Sure! She didn't wanna do it at first, but I convinced her.
She's all set.
Why, she'll be sensational.
- How about letting me talk?
- All right.
Let's quit kidding, Mr. Marsh.
Abbie, all those things sounded swell at breakfast... but I can't carry this show.
I know that as well as you do.
I appreciate your honesty.
Swell, because you've got somebody here who can carry your show.
A great little trouper.
Aren't I capable of selecting my own cast?
But you'd never pick her.
I say she can swing it.
How can you lose? You gotta try her.
- Who is she?
- Sawyer.
- Sawyer.
- Yes, Peggy Sawyer.
She can dance rings around Brock.
Your show's half dancing.
She'd kill them.
Nobody ever heard of her.
She's a raw kid from the chorus.
Listen, I've been waiting years for a chance like this... and if I give it up to someone else, believe me, she's gotta be good.
- Send her in.
- Do you mean it?
Yes, send her in.
Mac!
- Oh, Mac!
- Here.
- Andy!
- Yes, sir.
- Get Sawyer.
- Yes, sir.
- The boss wants to see you.
- Who, me?
Not your brother. Come on.
- Lorraine, will you hold that?
- Go ahead.
Well, here she is.
Experience?
Just this show, Mr. Marsh.
You know the songs and dances?
Can you play the lead tonight?
The lead?
Sure, you can. Don't let him scare you.
I'll give you a chance because I've got to.
Andy, send Jerry in.
I'll have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl.
Get out of here. I don't want anybody in for the next five hours.
- Good luck, honey.
- Come on, you.
Pick it up right after the number.
There's your cue. Speak.
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.
No, it's impossible. Impossible.
You're greeting the man you love.
Your entrance speech!
Make it mean something.
Put feeling into it!
Listen, like this:
"Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come."
Let me hear it.
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.
No, it won't do.
Look, have you ever been in love?
Did you ever have a man hold you in his arms and kiss you?
Now you're in the spirit of the thing.
You love this man.
Now, give it all you've got.
Let me hear it.
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.
That's better.
Let me hear it from the beginning.
Go over there and make your entrance again.
All right.
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.
I can't! I can't...
Look here.
You can't, but you will.
Please, Mr. Marsh.
You want this chance or don't you?
- All right. Let's try it again.
- All right.
All right, it's fair, only fair.
Come in.
Only an hour before the curtain.
Okay, Jerry, that's all.
You let me down, Sawyer, and I'll...
Come on, lie down and relax.
The wardrobe woman will have to come in to fit your costumes.
But rest all you can, because you're definitely going on tonight.
Julian, how about it?
All right, the show goes on.
Wardrobe, everybody.
Everybody, makeup.
- Oh, Billy.
- Hello.
I brought some coffee.
You can use a little, huh?
Oh, Billy, I'm so excited,
I think maybe I'm dreaming.
Oh, no, you're awake, all right.
Don't worry about that.
Billy, what's going to happen to me?
You'll be a hit. You'll be the biggest thing that ever hit Broadway.
Oh, I hope so.
Say, I know so.
And I'm for you too. You know that.
Even if...
Even if what?
Oh, honey.
I've been for you ever since the day you walked in on me in my BVDs.
I wanted to tell you, ever since
I first saw you, how I feel about you.
Oh, I don't know how to say it.
But you know what I mean, don't you?
I guess it does sound kind of funny at that, the way I say it.
But the lines are new for me, at least off-stage.
Well, I guess maybe I can read between the lines, Billy... but I wanna hear you say some more.
Billy, it was grand of you to come.
- They told me I'd find you here.
- Miss Brock!
You can't talk to her, nobody can.
It's Marsh's orders.
I wanna see her alone.
I know, but...
It's all right, Billy.
So you're going to take my place.
I'm sorry, Miss Brock.
You're nervous, aren't you?
Well, don't be.
The customers out there want to like you.
Always remember that, kid.
I've learned it from experience.
And you've got so much to give them:
Youth and beauty and freshness.
Do you know your lines?
And your songs?
And your dance routine?
Well, you're a cinch.
But... But it's tough on you, Miss Brock.
Come here.
Peggy, isn't it?
You know, Peggy, when I started for the theater tonight...
I wanted to tear your hair out.
And then I started thinking.
Well, after all, I've had my chance.
And now it's your turn.
I've had enough.
For five years it's kept me away from the only thing I ever wanted.
And a funny thing... a broken ankle was the thing that made me find it out.
You know, Peggy, most anyone can have success with the proper breaks.
As for me...
I'll take Pat and vaudeville... or whatever goes with him.
We're being married tomorrow.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Come in.
You've gotta hurry, miss.
Come right in, boys. Right over here.
Overture, places, girls!
I think it looks very nice now.
Do I look all right?
You look adorable.
Now, go out there and be so swell that you'll make me hate you.
Thanks.
Remember, girls, I want a straight line all the way through.
Marguerite, you're first.
Give me a big smile.
Get ready. All right, curtain.
Come on, all right. Get Sawyer.
When she comes out, I don't want any of you to say a word to her.
Here she comes.
All right, break up.
Pay no attention to her.
Sawyer, you listen to me, and you listen hard.
Two hundred people, 200 jobs...
$200,000, five weeks of grind, blood and sweat depend upon you.
The lives of these people who've worked with you.
You've got to go on and give and give and give.
They've got to like you, understand?
You can't fall down, because... your future, my future and all we have is staked on you.
Now I'm through.
Keep your feet on the ground, your head on your shoulders... and go out. Sawyer, you're going out a youngster... but you've got to come back a star.
- There she is.
- There's your cue.
Good luck, honey.
Well, honey, we couldn't lose them, and least of all, Jimmy.
Why, Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.
All aboard the Niagara Limited!
Come on, let's go!
That's your light change.
All right, snap into it. Hurry up, kids.
Get going. Take it away!
Break this up. Come here.
You got by, but you're not through yet.
The toughest part's coming.
Don't be a flash in the pan.
There isn't an actor here who doesn't know what you're going through.
Now you gotta rest. Rest and relax.
Save it, because you're gonna need it.
I've been watching you for a couple weeks.
If you're nice to the right people, you'll get along.
- You know these routines?
- Quiet, please.
Mike, dim those first three borders, will you? Hurry up.
Places, everybody, for the finale.
She's a hit, Abner. She's a hit!
Who's a hit?
Peggy Sawyer.
- Oh.
- Did you do as I told you?
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Well...
But I'll take her right out.
Come on, Fifi.
Well, hurry.
Directors make me sick. Take Marsh.
Name all over the program, gets all the credit.
If it wasn't for Sawyer, he wouldn't have a show.
She'll have Broadway in her pocket in a week.
- You're right.
- Marsh will say he discovered her.
Some guys get all the breaks.

More, Betsy! More!
Now this concludes our little entertainment... and I'm sure we've all enjoyed it immensely.
I'm sorry to say... or perhaps,
I really shouldn't say sorry... but we won't have the pleasure of hearing Betsy sing for us again here.
Betsy's leaving us today.
Mr. Shea, who was a dear friend of her parents... has come to take her to live with him in New York.
I'm sure she has everybody's good wishes for happiness... in her new home.
- Is that me?
- I guess it is.
Gee. I'm certainly a big surprise to myself!
I'll get your coat and hat.
Oh, you look beautiful, Betsy!
- It's just splendid, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
I... I hope someday you'll all have pretty dresses too.
Betsy. We'll have to hurry now, dear.
I've still got to wrap all those toys
Mr. Shea's been bringing you.
Couldn't I leave them here,
Miss Hutchins?
Mmm, Mr. Shea might not like it.
He won't care. Please, Miss Hutchins,
I'd much rather leave them here.
Just give them to... oh, everybody.
Oh, that's sweet of you, dear.
Say thanks to Betsy, girls.
Thank you, Betsy.
Now say good-bye to everybody, and we'll hurry along.
- Good-bye Carol.
- Bye, Betsy.
- Good-bye, Jean.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Bye, Sheila.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Good-bye, Marilyn.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Good-bye, Mary.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
Good-bye, Rosalie.
What's the matter?
Don't you want to say good-bye to me?
- No!
- Why, Rosalie. I'm surprised.
Now be a nice girl.
Say good-bye to Betsy.
No! I don't want to say good-bye.
- Why not?
- 'Cause...
Because I don't want
Betsy to go.
Betsy.! Betsy!
Betsy!
Where's that button?

Hotel Variety.
The Three Dancing Baby Dolls?
They don't live here anymore.
I don't know. I reckon they retired on their social security.
- You're welcome.
- Hi, Pop!
Hello, Sam.
Flossie, see if you can locate Betsy.
It's time she was in bed.
- Hello? Is Betsy up there?
- Any mail for me, Pop?
- You see...
- No, no mail for you, Sam.
Any mail for his fiddle?
Yeah, from its beau.
Those are the kind of gags that killed vaudeville.
- Hello, Betsy.
- Hello. Hello.
Upstage. Rehearse in the theater.
- Hello, angel.
- Hello.
- Where have you been?
- Oh, just visiting.
Visiting, when you should have been in bed? Have you done your homework?
Oh, yes.
Here's my arithmetic.
- Who helped you with these problems?
- Mr. Burdini, the magician.
Hmm. Six goes into 18 five times?
Seven goes into 21 four times?
He's a magician, all right.
Oh, he's awful clever.
He's been teaching me new tricks.
May I have my key, please?
- Is that some of your ventriloquism?
- That wasn't me.
Is there any mail for us?
Oh, hello.
It's Mr. and Mrs. Brasno.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- It's from our son.
- He's in college.
- Look, Ma. Butch made the football team.
- Oh. Look.
"Dearest Mom and Pop...
"just a line or two.
"Hope you and Mom are well and have found something to do.
"I am getting along fine with my studies.
My goodness!
As you can see,
I'm on the squad.''
- Hello, George, Ollie!
Hiya, folks! Hello, Bets!
- Hello, Mike.
- Is there anything for us, Mike?
- Buffalo, next week.
One act for a smoker in a hurry.
How about you?
Sorry, Mr. Brody.
I'm all booked up tonight.
On the slumber time, huh? I get it.
- Who do ya suggest, Pop?
- Why, let me see...
- Better see who owes the most rent.
- Right.
Well, there's Martin and Martin, nine weeks.
Sullivan and Haley, six weeks.
Jimmy Clayton and his jazz band, it's 12 weeks.
- How about them?
- They're a knockout.
- All right, if you say so.
- Get Jimmy Clayton on the telephone.
I raise a thousand bucks.
- I think the phone's ringing.
- Don't change the subject.
I call you.
What you got?
- What do you got?
- Well, I...
I just got a little pair of threes.
And I thought you was bluffing.
Nuts to me, you get it?
Did you hang up your dress?
I hung up my dress, put away my shoes, brushed my teeth...
- washed my neck, face, hands and ears.
- Nice work.
I used to have curls all over my head once.
- Oh, that must've been lovely.
- Yes, but they were lots of trouble.
Now, don't you sit up and listen to that music.
You just shut your eyes and go right to sleep.
I'll shut my eyes, but it'll probably come in through my ears.
Hiya, Butch!
Willoughby!
- Willoughby.
- Yes, Sister?
Close that window.
Hand me the telephone book.
Yes, Sister.
You seem to be enjoying that horrible racket.
Hmm?
Well, I... I was carried away for the moment.
Hmm.
Yes, Miss Wendling, this is
Mr. Shea's daughter. My father...
I'm awfully sorry. The boys are rehearsing, but I'd be glad to...
I'm tired of warning you people.
I won't have my nights disturbed by a lot of noisy riffraff.
I won't put up with it any longer.
I'm sorry, Miss Wendling.
I'll go right up and...
- What's the matter?
- She called us a lot of riffraff.
- Who?
- Our landlady.
- I didn't know we had one.
- Well, if you ever see a pumpkin... in one of the windows next door and it isn't Halloween, that's our landlady.
Ugh!
I can't look out my window without seeing a lot of acrobats, jugglers... midgets and actors.
How much rent does the Hotel Variety owe?
$2,500 past due since the 12th.
Write a letter... to what's-his-name... Shea.
- Sarah!
- Ah!
Tell him unless his rent is paid within five days, in full, out he goes.
- Come on. In you go.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I've got to go up there and see about stopping that music.
- Oh, no. I like it.
- You do?
- Yes, especially that song.
- Well, it is a pretty song.
- Know why I like it?
- No. Why?
The words are just the way
I feel about you and Pop.
No fooling?
Lots of times I wanted to thank you, oh, ever so much.
Well, you don't have to, darling.
I'm afraid I can't
'cause...
# ow can I thank you#
#How do I start#
#The words are somewhere#
#Around my heart#
#If I could say#
#In a word or two#
#How much it means#
#To be loved by you#
#Then I could thank you#
# For all you've done #
#But I don't know what#
#To do#
#What can you say#
#When a dream comes true#
# How can I ever#
#Thank you#
Mmm. Don't you try to, dear.
Now you just close your eyes and go right to sleep.
- Happy dreams.
- Thanks.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You old pumpkin!
We've got to stick together.
It's one for all, and divided we fall.
The wolf is at the door, and the handwriting is on the wall.
- Pop's always been regular with us.
- He sure has.
So what does it get him?
A shady nook behind the eight ball.
We got to go out and hock everything we own.
Jewelry, trunks, instruments, props, everything.
We've got our sorority pins.
Get all the dough you can and give it to Pop.
If it wasn't for Pop, we'd all have barnacles on our hips... from sleeping on park benches.
And that's what'll happen if that old battle-ax next door... puts him out of the hotel.
It's up to us to raise some dough.
Jimmy, here's my watch.
What about that stickpin?
Oh-Oh, wait, wait!
You're choking me!
My goodness, don't pull it so hard.
I'll give it to you.
- Yes?
- May I see Miss Sarah Wendling, please?
- She's not at home.
- When will she be back?
I don't know.
If you're looking for Miss Wendling, she isn't home.
- Is that so?
- I'm waiting for her too.
- You are?
- Oh, yes, on important business.
Well, uh, maybe if it's very important,
I might put in a good word for you.
- Do you know Miss Wendling?
- Oh, yes, very well.
- She's my aunt.
- She is? Well, say... would you please give her this... and tell her it's on account for the rent of the hotel?
- The hotel? What hotel?
- Next door.
And will you please ask her to wait until Pop can pay her the rest?
Well, uh... uh, whom shall I say this is from?
Betsy. No, from Pop...
Mr. Shea.
Well, maybe it'd be a better idea... if you came inside and told her yourself.
But she's not in.
He said so.
Oh, he did?
I have an idea he's been imagining things.
- Miss Wendling is in, isn't she, Simmons?
- She's in the library, sir.
Oh!
Oh.
Stand in the corner.
Go on. Hide your face.
You big fibber!
That'll be all,
Simmons.
Why, if anyone did a thing like that at the orphanage... they'd have to stand in the corner for an hour.
At the orphanage?
Mm-hmm. I used to be an orphan before Pop adopted me.
Well, now that's a coincidence.
You know, I used to be an orphan myself.
Too bad we weren't orphans at the same time.
- We could've had lots of fun together.
- I'll bet we could.
- Will you excuse me a minute?
- Mm-hmm.
Say, that's cute.
Where'd you learn that?
- Jimmy and the Bandits.
- The what?
- The jazz band.
- Oh. Look at this.
That's good too.
Where'd you learn that?
At Harvard. You've heard of the Hasty Pudding club?
Mm-mmm. But I'll bet it tastes good.
- We dancers have got to stick together.
- Absolutely.
#We should be together#
#Like the walls and ceiling#
#Like a door and doorknob#
#Like the hat on your knob#
#Like butler goes with doorbell#
#Keyhole with key#
#I think we'll get by#
#If you'll stick with me#
#We should be together #
#Like the frame and picture#
#Like shoes and stockings#
#Like the clock's tick-tockings#
- #Like tap and toe like high and low#
- #Stop and go, honey#
- #You're a perfect lady#
- #You're a regular guy#
Oh, thanks.
#We should be together you and I#
- #You're a cup of coffee#
- Ho, ho!
#You're a peachy pie#
#We should be together you and I#
- Roger, what's going on?
- Oh, g... good morning, Aunt Sarah.
Betsy, this is Miss Wendling, and this is Uncle Willoughby.
How do you do,
Miss Wendling?
- How do you do, Mr. Uncle Willoughby?
- Charmed, I'm sure.
What nonsense are you up to?
This isn't nonsense.
This is high finance.
Hear the pretty music?
This young lady wants to give you money to pay the rent.
- Oh, nonsense!
- Come on, Betsy.
- So you've gone in for social service?
- Oh, not exactly, Aunt Sarah.
I just met an acquaintance here.
There's almost five dollars in there.
I'm sure Pop'll have the rest of it for you very soon.
- Bless my soul!
- Keep your soul out of this.
- You'll please get rid of this child.
- But, Aunt Sarah...
If those people think they can play on my sympathy like this... they're greatly mistaken.
I'll have my rent... all of it... or out they go.
Please, Miss Wendling.
Please don't put Pop out of the hotel.
He and Barbara and Jimmy and everybody, they'll have no place to live.
That's their affair, not mine.
But, Aunt Sarah, aren't you being a little bit hard?
- Yes, Sarah, I think...
- Think to yourself.
The place is an infernal nuisance, full of worthless, disreputable actors.
They are not disputable!
They're very good actors.
- Thank you.
- Roger.
Just charge it to my share of the estate.
Simmons.
You will get rid of this child.
You don't need to get rid of me.
I can go.
Just a moment, Betsy.
Aunt Sarah, I don't wish to seem impertinent... but after all, I do have a third interest in the hotel.
As long as I have charge of the Wendling estate...
I'll handle it in my own way.
Simmons, see this child to the door. Stand aside.
Uh, that'll be all, Simmons.
I'll see the young lady home.
- Come on, Betsy.
- Wait. Shh. Just a minute.
- Here, take these.
- Thanks, Uncle Willoughby.
- Simmons, get my hat and coat, please.
- Very good, sir.
Say, I may want to see you about this a little later.
No, no, no. I don't want to be involved, but I'll be at the club.
Come, come, young lady.
Cheer up, darling. Cheer up.
I guess I'm not a very good businesswoman.
Oh, that's great. Then you won't grow up to be like my Aunt Sarah.
- Shh.
- Come on, honey.
Thank you, Simmons.
See you later, Uncle Willoughby.
- Good-bye, Mr. Uncle Willoughby.
- Bye-bye, Betsy.
And if you say one word to my sister about those cookies...
I'll smack you right in the kisser.
Very good, sir.
You know you shouldn't have gone over there without permission.
- I was only trying to help, Pop.
- I'm glad she did.
I'd never have known that this place existed. It's all very interesting.
Next door, we hardly realize we're so close to anything so, uh... so different.
I suppose you feel like a feudal lord visiting the tenants on his estate.
I bet you'd look grand all dressed up like a knight on a big white horse.
Riding back to his castle for safety?
No. Rescuing the fairy princess.
I mean, two fairy princesses.
Mr. Wendling, I couldn't possibly raise the money in five days.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was going to make a suggestion... before your daughter so graciously knighted me.
I was going to suggest that I could lend you the 2,500. My aunt needn't know.
You'd lend... Why...
Thanks a million.
Thanks two million... one from me.
I'm afraid we can't accept your generous offer.
- Why not, Barbara?
- Because I don't know how we could pay it back.
And we're not going to be at the mercy of any spiteful old moneybag... who calls us a lot of riffraff.
I'm sorry, Mr. Shea. I, uh...
So am I. You see, I just couldn't accept your kind offer now.
- I understand.
- Come, Betsy. It's time for your lunch.
Pop? Couldn't Mr. Wendling stay and have lunch with me?
Well, I'm afraid...
As a matter of fact, I was going to invite you to lunch... but I guess the Wendlings are sort of social outcasts around here now.
- Please let me go with him.
- I wish you would.
Please, Pop. I'm old enough to go out with a nice young man.
- All right.
- It's a date.
Barbara's awful smart.
She reads great big books when she's not helping Pop at the hotel.
- Oh, she does?
- Yes.
She told me she's studying how not to be an actress.
Oh. I see.
Well, uh, does she have many boyfriends?
Oh, yes, lots of them.
There's Ole, the Four Martins,
Jimmy and his Jazz Bandits...
No, no. I mean, is there anybody that takes her out to dinner, lunch...
- You know, a sweetheart?
- Oh.
No. I guess she's just an old maid, like I was till you came along.
Say, are you trying to tell me that you like me?
Mm-hmm.
#I can't show how much I love you#
#In this little space
I've got#
#I don't know how much
I love you#
#But it's an enormous lot#
#If all the world were paper#
#And all the seas were ink#
#I'd write a great big note to you#
#And tell you what I think#
#I'd say
I love you dearly#
#In letters three miles high#
#And sign it yours sincerely#
#Cross my heart and hope to die#
#If all the stars were diamonds#
#In golden skies above#
#They wouldn't be worth that without your love#
#I'd like to write
I love you#
#So big that you would blink#
#If all the world were paper#
#Yes, and all the seas were ink#
What are all those mummies sitting in there for?
Mummies?
Those aren't mummies, Betsy...
Those are millionaires.
They spent all their lives trying to make a million dollars... and now they sit there wondering why.
- Hello, old-timer!
- Shh!
- Is, uh, Mr. Wendling in?
- He's in the Grill, sir.
Oh, he's in the Grill.
#I love you as I never#
#Loved before #
#Since first I met you on the village green#
#The village green#
#Come to me ere my dream#
#Of love#
#Is o'er#
- #I love you...
- mJim, wait a minute. That's terrible!
Oh, just a minute, gentlemen.
Whoa, just a moment now.
- I was standing right here.
Someone was a little bit sour.
- It was you.
What? Well, what do you know about music?
Well, of all the impertinence.
You were off-key.
That part goes like this.
#I love you as I loved you#
#When you were sweet#
- That's just the way I did it.
- Oh, no!
- I did!
- No. No.
- Let's try it again.
- All right, you take it.
# I love you as I loved you #
- #When you were sweet#
- # Sweet#
#When you were sweet #
#Sixteen#
That's the best you've ever done!
Now we got it.
Let's hold it.
- The youngster knows her stuff, don't she?
- She sure does.
Begging your pardon, gentlemen.
So sorry, but, uh, this noise...
- Noise?
- What are you talking about?
We've been having complaints.
The other club members...
Just when we're getting hot!
What's this country coming to if a man can't sing in his club?
Isn't there someplace we can rehearse without being disturbed?
- I know a place!
- Yeah? Where?
- A hotel!
- Say, that's a swell idea.
No, it won't work. We've been thrown out of the finest hotels in New York...
- The Waldorf-Astoria and St. Regis.
- That's right.
Well, you'll never be thrown out of this one.
This one is just made-to-order for you.
Just say you're a quartet, and you can sing all you want.
Really? Where is this place?
You mean...
She's right! Come on, boys!
A haven at last!
Last one out's an old maid!
- Well, I'm not gonna be any old maid!
- Come on, Betsy. Hurry up!
Eight bucks from the Tristate Trio... five from Daugherty, and five from Conklin and Scully.
- How much are we short?
- About 2,100.
The national debt.
I thought I was bringing home the bacon.
And you laid an egg.
That's right. Bite the hand that feeds the kitty.
Thanks just the same.
You're a great guy, Jimmy.
That goes for me too, bubble brain.
Is that straight from the balcony, Juliet?
It's my streamlined personality.
- I guess I'm not as bad as I look, huh?
- You couldn't be!
That's done it! From now on when you talk to me... start the conversation with good-bye.
- This way, gentlemen.
- Oh, Pop!
Hurry, Pop.
We brought you some new guests.
These gentlemen were looking for a hotel... so Betsy suggested that they come over here.
- Um, professionals?
- Ooh, yes. They're a quartet.
Yes. This is the well-known
Hot and Happy Four.
Yes! The Hop and Hat... the Hot and Happy Four.
- Where have you boys been playing?
- Ooh, hotels, clubs... churches and places.
Now, would you prefer single rooms or a suite?
- They want the best in the house, don't you?
- Yes! Certainly!
There's a nice, big suite on the fourth floor with four beds and a green carpet.
Green? My favorite color.
We'll take that.
Well, that's pretty high:
$40 a week.
That's not too steep for these gentlemen, is it?
No! Not at all!
That's fine.
Uh... Uh...
- Where is your baggage?
- Huh?
Baggage? Oh, baggage!
Oh, well... well...
Well, we could get some if you... if it's necessary.
Oh, it's very necessary. 'Cause guests without baggage have to pay in advance.
- Isn't that right, Pop?
- It's a rule of the house.
Oh, that's quite all right.
How much will you want in advance?
- Well...
- Uh, suppose we let Betsy decide that.
Well, let's see.
I think about, well, 10 years.
- No. Suppose we make it one year?
- Oh, no, no. That's too much.
No. I'm sure these gentlemen would rather pay one year in advance.
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes, sir. Certainly.
Then they wouldn't have to worry about the rent, and neither would you.
There you are, sir.
Fifty-two times 40 is 2,008.
Gee! You're awful good in arithmetic.
That's fine.
Uh, 426.
I'll take them up.
Follow me, gentlemen.
#Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi...#
Say, how are the acoustics here?
Oh, we don't have any.
We use Flit.
She uses Flit!
Come on.
I hope it don't bounce.
Pop, here's
25 bucks more.
I got it, Jimmy.
I got the 2,500.
What? And we just made the supreme sacrifice! Look!
- What happened?
- We done a striptease in a pawnshop.
Georgie. Georgie, where are you?
Your watch!
Marco, your dummy!
Take your drums away, Jerry!
Take them away!
Here's the cello for Heinie!
Here's your piccolo.
Here you are, Syd. Take it away.
The twins.
- Your paternity pins.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Ole. Your waker-upper.
- Oh, thank you, Jimmy.
Oh, no, no, no!
P-Please don't do that.
Jimmy, how you get them out the hock?
Ask me no questions.
- Mr. Wendling?
- Oh, hello. You still mad?
How could I be after all you've done for us? May I say thank you?
Well, sure, if you'll omit the ''mister'' and make it plain ''Roger.''
- Thank you, Roger.
- That's okay.
Barbara, Betsy wants you upstairs to help her with her reading lesson.
Tell her I'll be right up.
Could I go along?
I used to be very good at reading.
- Well, Betsy's in the third grade.
- Third grade? That high?
- Well, maybe I could learn something.
- Come on!
'''Run for your life,' said the little princess. 'I am the cap... “Cap...”
- Now slowly. What's this?
- “Tive.” “Captive.” Oh, yeah.
“I am the captive of a wicked, old sor...”
“Sor...” “Sorce...”
Sorceress.
You mustn't tell her.
Let her figure the words out herself.
“I'm not afraid”' said the brave young prince.
'I have come to rescue you and take you to my castle.”
I like him.
''But you are in great pearl...”
Peril.
That means danger.
Then why doesn't it say “danger”?
All right.
Skip it.
“Suddenly there was a great roar behind him.
“It was the wicked old 'sore-sorce-ess' riding on her broom.
“On her shoulder was a dodo bird... and the dodo bird was whispering in her ear...”
- This is Winchell's daily chatter.
- Mmm.
''That expensive speed buggy parked daily in front of Pop Shea's Hotel Variety...
“belongs to the Roger Wending... and the reason is Pop's lovely daughter, Barbara.”
I thought it my duty to inform you, Miss Wendling.
So that's why he hasn't been dining at home.
Cancel my reservations.
I'll take a later train to Newport.
I'll put a stop to all this right now.
Look, I want to show you here.
Now look. Up here's the little boy.
The little boy comes down here.
And he's got a dog, but the dog won't come downstairs.
The little boy goes upstairs, and he chucks the dog downstairs.
Isn’t that good?
So you don't like that.
Look, come here. I show you another.
Come, come. Isn't there anyone looking after this place?
No! You all can't call South Brooklyn.
It's 10 cents in advance.
Come, come.
With or without bath?
I don't want a bath...
I mean a room.
I want to talk to that man
Shea's daughter.
She's upstairs right now.
Is there anything I can do?
There is... Have her come downstairs at once.
Park yourself over there, and I'll see if I can get her.
You got a cigarette, grandma?
- No, and I'm not your grandmother.
- It's okay by me, toots.
Too...
What a face! What a face!
- What?
- Gordon's play.
You'd be great for the old witch.
Oh, I would.
Well, don't blow that smoke in my face.
Come on, Oscar.
We're going up.
Hello, Aunt Sarah.
It's the old pumpkin.
So this is where you've been wasting your time.
Aunt Sarah, please. Please.
Uh, Barbara, Betsy.
I'd like you to meet my aunt.
- This is Miss Shea and Miss Betsy Shea.
Miss Wendling.
- How do you do?
Young lady, I've come here to tell you... that I want you to let this nephew of mine alone.
You let him pay your rent, didn't you?
- Aunt Sarah!
- I don't have to listen to this.
Aunt Sarah, that was uncalled for, unkind and untrue.
Uncle Roger didn't give us any money.
We got it from... from someone else.
Oh, so it's Uncle Roger now.
- Is thi...- this woman your mother?
- Practically.
- Betsy is Mr. Shea's adopted child.
- Adopted her?
So they brought her to this wholesome atmosphere. Nice place for a child.
Why, she's using her as a decoy, and you haven't sense enough to realize it.
Aunt Sarah, you don't know what you're saying!
Roger, I want you to get out of here and stay out.
- You forget that I am over 21.
- You forget I control your finances.
I won't allow any Broadway gold digger to get your money if I can help it.
Stand aside.
Did she mean me?
No, I don't think so, Betsy.
I don't know what she's talking about... but I'll bet she's going to make trouble for us.
- Yes, I'm ringing him, mister.
- Flossie?
Just a minute.
Flossie, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.
- Yes?
- A man gets lonesome knocking... around with no one to talk to but a five-piece orchestra...
- and living in a...
- Hotel Variety.
That's right.
I was wondering, if I asked a certain girl to marry me...
- what would she say?
- You're on a busy line, stupid.
- Go ahead.
- I withdraw the question.
- I want to see Mr. Shea. Is he around?
- Somebody calling me?
The law.
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?
- What's this?
- What's the matter, Pop?
It's for Betsy.
Now, if you could come around tomorrow morning...
Sorry. I don't like this any more than you.
But I got to take her back tonight.
Look here, Officer, you can't take Betsy back to the orphan asylum.
You know why? 'Cause Betsy isn’t here.
She's down south in dear old Dixie.
Sure. Visiting with my folks.
#I wish I was in Dixie#
#Away, away#
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Yeah. No!
You see, we don't want to lose Betsy.
That's why I lied to you.
She's up in her room.
- What's the number?
I'll go and get her.
- But where are we going to take her?
- Over to my house.
Your house? Impossible.
I don't think Miss Wendling likes me very well.
She'll never know. She's gone to Newport and won't be back for a month.
I guess they'd never think of looking for her there.
No. Come on, Betsy.
Upsy-daisy.
Hang on tight now.
Hold her, Barbara.
Yeah. I got her.
- There you are.
- Thanks an awful lot.
Will you and Pop and everybody come over to see me?
- You bet we will. Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Come on, Betsy.
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.
Good night.
Good night, darling.
Don't cry, Betsy.
They can't do this to us.
We'll take it up to the Supreme Court, to Washington, to Lincoln.
Officer, take your prisoner.
- I'm sorry, old boy.
- I know. Just doing your duty.
Now run along before I give vent to my emotions.
Say, where are you going with my wife?
- What do you mean, your wife?
- You keep away from my wife... or I'll smack you down to my size.
- But I only did it to help Betsy.
- Ah!
Ah, Georgie, listen to me.
Now don't be sore.
We had to help little Betsy.
What's the matter, darling?
Something wrong?
No, nothing,
Uncle Willoughby.
- Only...
- Only what?
Couldn't I go over to the hotel for just a few minutes?
Oh, no, dear, no. There's been a detective over there every day this week.
Now you just be patient a little longer.
But I was sure someone would come over... especially today.
Why?
What's today?
Come on. Tell me.
It's my birthday.
Your birthday.
My, my.
At the orphanage, they always had a birthday cake for me.
Well, Pop and Barbara have been very busy, but we'll make up for it.
Come on. Let's go downstairs, huh?
You won't miss just one birthday party.
You'll have so many more birthdays and so many more parties.
How about some cookies?
But it just doesn't seem like a birthday at all.
Well, when the detectives stop hanging around in another week or so... maybe we can sneak over to the hotel and have a fine big party.
What do you say?
What do you say?
Oh, dear. I haven't even wished you a happy birthday myself.
Happy birthday!
#Happy birthday to you#
#Happy birthday to you#
# Happy birthday, dear Betsy #
- #Happy birthday to you#
- Speech! Speech!
Congratulations!
Speech! Speech!
How can I thank you?
How do I start?
#The words are somewhere#
#Around my heart#
#If I could say#
# n a word or two#
#How much it means#
#To be loved by you#
#Then I could thank you#
#For all you've done#
#But I don't know what to do#
#What can you say#
#When a dream comes true#
#How can I ever...#
Betsy, darling.
This is no time for tears.
This is your birthday.
On behalf of the hoi polloi gathered here...
I just want to say many happy returns...
- and when do we eat?
- Yeah!
Now!
It's the big parade.
What a joint!
What a joint.
Oh, thank you.
That... that's very nice of you.
- Good blow!
- Happy birthday!
- Cut the cake, Betsy! Cut the cake.
- Yes, come on.
Oh, my goodness.
Get out. Get out, all of you!
You call this hospitality?
I'll take it up with Emily Post.
Where are you taking that child?
Where do you suppose?
I'm taking her home!
- Officer!
- See here, Sarah!
You keep out of this, you Judas.
There's the child you're after.
- You let her alone! Come, Betsy.
- Just a minute.
Don't you hurt Pop!
Don't you dare hurt Pop!
We're not going to hurt anyone.
No need in getting excited.
We've got orders.
No, no!
I want to stay with Pop!
Well, I don't blame you.
You just come along now... and your pop can straighten things out later.
I'm afraid you'll have to go with him, Betsy.
But I don't want to go to the orphanage.
I want to stay with you.
Don't cry, darling.
I'll come and see you, and I'll...
I'll get you out again.
You mean old pumpkin!
Good-bye, Pop.
Good-bye, Betsy.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
I wish you were a man for about five minutes.
Now, Sarah!
You listen to me.
I suppose if Simmons hadn't warned me in time... you probably would have had all these freaks living here.
Well, it was the child's birthday, and people just happened to drop in.
A likely story.
Where's Roger?
- Out with that scheming
Shea girl, I suppose.
- No!
- On the contrary, he's...
- #Happy birthday...#
Well, uh, what kind of a birthday party is this?
You're a little late, aren't you?
Where is everyone?
Where's Betsy?
On her way to the orphan asylum, where she'll be among decent people...
- Come on, Barbara.
- Wait! Young lady!
You can give your father a message:
He's being dispossessed.
- You can't!
- I'm tearing the hotel down.
He's paid his rent.
He's violated his lease by having all sorts of animals.
He'll save himself a lot of trouble by getting right out.
- I'll have something to say about that.
- I'm afraid not... as our attorney will inform you.
Furthermore, I warn you, if you continue your association with this woman...
Continue it? I've been trying to get her to make it permanent.
- Come on, Barbara.
- Roger, wait!
Roger!
Snitcher!
It really isn't so very nice out there.
There's practically no one to play with... just grown-ups.
- And you know how tiresome they can be.
- Yeah.
Didn't you have any fun at all?
Well, it was fun singing with Uncle Willoughby's quartet.
And Jimmy was awfully good to me.
And Pop and... and Barbara.
Aw, come on.
It's not so bad here.
No! It's not!
It's no use crying about it.
Remember what you used to tell us?
- To be optimistic?
- Don't be a grumpy.
And when the road gets bumpy, just smile.
Your troubles can't be as bad as all that.
- And when you're sad as all that...
- Nobody loves you.
#Be optimistic#
#Don't you be a grumpy#
#When the road gets bumpy just smile#
#Smile and be happy#
#Your troubles can't be as bad as all that#
#When you're sad as all that#
#No one loves you#
#Be optimistic#
#Don't you be a mourner#
#Brighten up that corner#
- #And smile#
- #Smile#
- #Smile#
#Don't wear a long face it's never in style#
#Be optimistic and smile#
It's my property and my money just as much as it's hers... and trustee or no trustee, she's got to give it to me.
- What did you ask her?
- I asked her for the hotel and $50,000... just enough to rent a theater and back a show... to give those poor devils a chance to earn a living.
- You'll never get it.
- But I've got to get it!
Mr. Fiske, you're a lawyer.
Tell me. What can I do?
Don't get me in this. I don't want to get tangled with Sarah Wendling.
- Me either.
- I'm just asking for advice.
- I'd rather not ha anything to do with it.
- You can't fight Sarah Wendling.
Very well, gentlemen. Then we'll just allow these people to starve.
People that you all know and admire.
And don't forget, you're just a bunch of ham actors yourselves.
Gentlemen, I'm surprised that you'd sit here... and make beggars and panhandlers out of the same artists... that you used to applaud... to think you'd allow Sarah, just to satisfy some simple whim of hers... to tear the roof from over their heads, to turn them out in the streets
- You can stop her!
- How?
By getting out a temporary injunction restraining her.
You're a part owner.
I'm not advising you!
No, no advice.
But what do I do then?
- Let me alone, Roger!
- There's no harm in telling him.
- Come on, Mr. Fiske.
- Well, you could bring a court action... compelling Sarah to turn over your portion of the estate, including the hotel.
But understand now, it's just a chance... and I don't want to have anything to do with it, no.
Because you're afraid of that bullying sister of mine. Well, I'm not.
- Roger, I'm with you.
- Good for you, Uncle Willoughby.
- And you're going to take the case.
- No!
- Yes!
- No!
Yes! Now hurry up and get out that injunction... or I'll throw you out of the quartet... you, you off-key baritone.
Here's the mail and newspaper, Miss Hutchins.
Oh, thank you, darling.
- Read me the funnies.
- No, after dinner, when you and the other children...
Please, Miss Hutchins.
Please read me the funnies.
All right. Come on.
Oh, look! It's Roger, and that's Miss Wendling.
What does it say?
Please read it to me.
''Trial of Roger Wendling's action against his Aunt Sarah...
''for the petition of the Wendling Estate...
''was begun to day before Judge Hart in surrogate court.
''The young millionaire's action against his eccentric aunt...
“was occasioned by her threat to tear down the Hotel Variety.
This was temporarily prevented by an injunction.”
She wants to tear down the hotel?
- So it seems.
- What'll happen to Pop and Barbara?
Oh, now, now, don't you worry.
Everything's going to be all right.
- That old pumpkin! I'd like to...
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Come on. Get some more.
Come on. Hurry.
Come on. Get some more.
Come on. Hurry.
- Aren't you afraid, Betsy?
- You might fall and hurt yourself.
Oh, please don't do it, Betsy.
I've got to get to Pop. He's in trouble, and I've gotta be with him.
- Is it tight enough?
- Uh-huh.
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.
But what'll we tell the matron?
Uh, tell her I've gone out west to fight Indians.
Be awfully careful, Betsy.
- [ All ] Bye. Bye.
- Shh.
- What's your name?
- Betsy. What's yours?
Harry.
Where are you going?
- Home.
- Where's home?
New York, on 49th Street.
That's a million miles from here.
- I am not going that far.
- Take me as far as you go?
All right. How come you got way out here?
You see, last night I was riding home with my dad in his car.
He was driving awfully fast... and all of a sudden he hit a bump in the road... and I bounced right out of the car.
- And he didn't know it?
- No.
What a dope.
You got to get off at the next corner.
If I could get to a subway, it would almost get me home.
If... if I had a nickel.
Thanks a lot for the ride.
I appreciate it very much.
- Bye.
- So long.
Come on! Get off!
Well, here's a nickel.
- Oh, thanks.
- Come on, will ya? Scram! Get off!.
How far is it to the subway station?
Six blocks, and
I am not going that way!
Please take me to the subway station.
Oh, all right.
You dames are all alike.
Your witness, Mr. Barron.
Mr. Wendling, isn't it true that you intend to use this money... to put on a vaudeville show?
A small portion of it, yes, sir.
And you intend to put this show on with actors living at the Hotel Variety?
- That's right.
- Isn't it quite probable... that this vaudeville venture of yours may prove a failure?
Or, in the Broadway vernacular, a flop?
What? With me and the band? I object!
Order! Order in the court!
Do my eyes believe me?
That's Betsy. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
I'm glad to see you, but where is everybody?
They're over in the courthouse.
- Why aren't you there?
- You see, the crowds make Oscar nervous.
I've got to get to the trial, Ole.
You've got to take me.
Please, I want to be with Pop.
You must take me there, Ole.
Well, all right.
Come on, Oscar. Got to go.
Miss Wendling, do you know William J. Shea?
I do.
Have you ever seen your nephew in the company of Barbara Shea?
I object!
They told me they would be in here.
There's Pop, and there's Barbara!
Order.! Order in the court!
Well, I rode on bicycles...
Order! Order in the...
Go on to the case, please.
Has your nephew ever asked you for money for any business ventures of any kind?
- Only once, about two weeks ago.
- Did you give it to him?
- I did not.
- Why?
Because he wanted to throw it away on worthless, good-for-nothing actors.
They are not good-for-nothing!
They're the nicest people in the whole world!
You said it, Bets. Your Honor, I object to the lady's incinerations.
It's irrelephant, immemorial and a bare-faced lie.
If there's any more of this,
I'll clear the courtroom.
Your Honor, that child belongs in an orphanage.
I put her there myself.
Those scoundrels have kidnapped her.
I came here all by myself!.
That's another fib you told, Miss Wendling.
Bring that youngster up here.
Young lady, do you realize you're guilty of contempt of court?
I'm awfully sorry, but it just made me mad... to hear Miss Wendling say those mean things about my friends...
'cause they aren't true.
Honest, Mr. Judge, they're wonderful actors.
Just wonderful!
This young lady doesn't seem to agree with you, Miss Wendling.
But she never saw them act.
Did you, Miss Wendling?
And if you saw them act, Mr. Judge... if you saw Jimmy and his band and everybody... oh, I know you'd think they were wonderful too.
- If it please the court, I'd like to...
- Just a minute.
I believe this court can be saved a lot of time and argument... by following the splendid suggestion that has just been made.
It appears the immediate issue in this case... is whether or not the plaintiff s proposal to invest his money is a sound one.
Your Honor doesn't mean that...
I mean that I want to see this show right here in this courtroom tomorrow.
Court adjourned!
You were swell!
Yeah, yeah, start your show.
I mean, uh, present your evidence, please.
#Your Honor
I lay my case before you#
#With a show you're invited now to see with me#
#It's a wow one, I hope that you'll agree with me#
#Their business show business#
#Just comes to no business without backing#
#That's all they're lacking#
#All they need is a chance#
#A chance to smile to laugh, to sing, to dance#
#And that is that#
#And that is all#
#So thank you for the use of the hall#
O-Order! Order!
You may proceed.
I-Is your evidence ready?
My first evidence,
Your Honor, exhibit “A.”
#Oh, ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road#
#And I'll be in Scotland afore ye#
#But me and my true love#
#Will never meet again#
#On the bonny, bonny#
Don't stop singing, gentlemen.
Won't you sing a song for me?
#I'm afraid you wouldn't like the old-time numbers that we sing#
- Why?
- #People don't like them nowadays#
#All they want to do is swing#
Well, why don't you take an old song and swing it? How would that be?
#But how do we do it#
There's nothing to it.
#Just follow me#
#First of all you start to sway#
#Back and forth
That's the way#
#And now that you've got yourself swinging#
#Do the same thing with your singing#
#Swing me an old-fashioned song#
#Down by the old mill stream#
#Da-da-dee-da-da, swing me an old-fashioned song#
#Old-fashioned song#
#Croon me an old-fashioned tune
Da-da-da-da-da#
#In the evening by the moonlight#
#You can hear those darkies singing#
- #Oh, croon me an old-fashioned tune#
- #Won't you croon a tune#
#Just keep it soft and sweet with rhythm from the start#
#But keep that old-time beat#
#The beat that's straight from the heart#
#Swing me an old-fashioned song#
#I wandered today through the hills, Maggie#
#That's it, it's just an old-fashioned song#
#Dear old girl, the robins sing about you#
- #Rah#
- #Dee-rah-dee-rah, rah, rah#
Won't you try it?
#Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling, darling#
#Croon me an old-fashioned tune#
#Just keep it soft and sweet#
#With rhythm from the start#
#But keep that old-time beat#
#The beat that's straight from the heart#
#Won't you swing us an old-fashioned song#
#Ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road#
#And I'll be in Scotland afore ye#
#That's how to swing#
#An old-fashioned song#
#Now sing and you'll be happy all day long #
# Sing an old-fashioned song#
Yeah!
Order! Order! Order!
Proceed, please.
Your Honor, mark it exhibit “B.”

Your Honor, I'm George Gordon.
I offer this show a 10-week engagement. in my international follies at $2,500 a week.
Your Honor, I object.
This show is worth $5,000 a week... and I refuse to accept a cent less.
Attagirl.
- A marriage license? For you?
- No, for my father and mother.
Oh, for your fath... Huh?
Oh, my goodness!
- Did you bring my band of Indians?
- Indians?
Yes, American Indians, musicians to play in my café.
- Oh, you mean Indians with feathers?
- Yes, with noses.
- Like on the American five cents?
- Yes, yes.
- Have you got them on board, yes?
- No.
Thank you, monsieur.
Indians? Indians?
Are you the Wabash Indians Band?
Are you Voyda?
I am Alexander Petrovitch
Moskovich Voyda.
Let's pick it up from there.
We're the boys you hired to play at your café.
- The Wabash Indianians.
- Indianians?
Is this the same as Indians?
Well, yes, in a sense.
You see, we don't wear our feathers in warm weather, do we, boys?
- No.
- No, never, never.
- Well, when do we start, Mr. Voyda?
- You don't start.
I cable for Indians and I want Indians!
No pale American face is going to make me a fool of myself.
Did you ever heard of Alexander
Petrovitch Moskovich Voyda?
- Sure.
- Yes, and how, and how.
As a matter of fact, we hear you're one of the cleverest fellows in Paris.
In Paris and all Europe.
The whole world.
Well, I was coming to that.
I just wanted to prepare you, that's all.
You got a great bet in these boys, Mr. Voyda.
- They'll be a knockout in your café.
- They shall never see my café.
I ordered Indians, and what do I get?
Wait, Mr. Voyda.
Huck, do the organ number, quick.
Come on, boys, give us the organ number.
Get the gloves out.
- Oh, Mr. Voyda.
- What?
Aren't you going to give these boys a chance?
No, why should I?
Sorry, Mr. Voyda, but I'm afraid you've got to listen.
Just submit quietly and we'll both keep out of jail.
Well, how did you like that, Mr. Voyda?
You see, you almost made a mistake.
I made a mistake? You made a mistake.
You are not Indians!
The cable mentioned a short engagement.
Well, it was a nice trip over.
It'll be a nicer trip going back, stoking coals.
Come on, boys, the train for Paris.
A grand total of $13.78.
And a button.
Well, boys, at the rate we live, that'll last us about two months.
Mother told me there would be days like this.
Say, listen, they dance in Paris, don't they?
All we have to do is find out who pays the fiddler.
Does anyone know anyone in Paris?
That top sergeant brother of mine gave me some addresses.
Quiet.
Wait! I know somebody, a little girl who used to live next door to me.
Gee, I was crazy about her, too.
She's a sensation in Paris, she's a star of some show or something.
- She'll help us.
- Well, what's her name?
What was her name?
Gee, I could find her like that if I could only remember her name.
Anybody else you know you can't remember?
Yeah, but I can't think who they are.
I know, it's Lizzie, Lizzie...
Elizabeth Gatz.
That's it. Elizabeth Gatz.
What a beautiful name.
Whether you find your Lizzie or not,
I've got an aunt in Paris. Aunt Minnie.
Can Aunt Minnie use a band?
Probably not. She's a dressmaker.
Well, I've knitted and tatted all my life, but I've never sewed.
- She's very rich and famous. She might...
- Why didn't you say so before?
She's Roberta.
Roberta?
- This Roberta?
- Yeah.
They tell me in Paris if you don't buy your gowns from Roberta, you're not dressed at all.
I see, nude if you don't, and nude if you do.
Grab my bag, will you?
Listen, ask your aunt Minnie if she knows where we can find Lizzie Gatz, will you?
- Okay. I won't be long.
- All right.
You fellows pick yourselves some comfortable easy chairs.
Hey!
Hey!
What am I supposed to do here besides pray? Or can't you speak English?
Well, the old trap won't go.
Oh, what's the use? Just a dumb foreigner.
Oh, here, here, here.
You mustn't do that. You might be killed.
Oh, you speak English.
Ladislaw.
Oh, don't go away. I want to thank you.
Gee, you saved my life.
I'm ever so much obliged to you.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Oh, I mean you're welcome, of course.
Do you know where I can find Madam Roberta?
Yes. Come with me.
I didn't really mean that about a dumb foreigner.
I forgive you.
Gee, that's swell.
You speak English beautifully.
Long ago I went to school in England.
Did you like it?
Oh, yes, I like the English.
And the Americans, too.
Gee, that's swell.
- I'm an American.
- Gee, that's...
I mean, I thought so.
Will you sit here, please?
Thank you.
But Minnie, you've made a mistake in the year. You don't look a day over...
- Stephanie!
- How do you do, Lord Henry?
My dear.
I saw your cousin,
Prince Peter, last week in Rome.
He asked after you most solicitously.
I hope you told him I had gone to work and he should do the same.
When all you titled aristocrats get jobs, maybe Europe can settle down to a few years' peace.
What is it, Stephanie?
There's a young gentleman outside from America, waiting to see you.
Young gentleman from America?
John.
John!
Bring him in, Stephanie. Bring him in!
No, wait. Don't let him come until I've powdered my nose.
Give me that compact, Henry.
Quick, quick, the compact!
How does he look?
He must look all right.
- Send him in, Stephanie.
- Yes, madame.
- This "John from America", who is he?
- My nephew.
I met him when I was there a few years ago and took a great fancy to him.
He's quite famous in his way.
"All-American halfback" or
"three quarters back" or something.
- Really?
- Yes, you know, it's queer, but when you happen to like your relatives, you like them better than other people.
- And if you hate them?
- Don't be obvious, Henry.
He was the only one of the whole tribe who was polite to me during my entire visit.
I like him, Henry.
He's like a big, affectionate, blundering Newfoundland dog.
I'd like to see him grow up.
- How big is he now?
- Oh, about 6'2".
John, my dear, I'm so glad to see you.
It's swell to see you, Aunt Minnie.
- Here he is, Henry, here is my...
- Newfoundland dog?
I was telling him about you, John.
This is Lord Henry Delves, a really grand person.
And this is Stephanie, my able assistant whom I couldn't do without.
Well, young man, I think your aunt should be very much complimented.
When I was in Paris at your age,
I didn't spend my time visiting my aunts.
Maybe you didn't have any aunts like Aunt Minnie.
Very prettily said, John.
There aren't any like your aunt Minnie.
Well, goodbye, young man,
I'm off to catch a train, but in a fortnight I'll be back.
And then, as I understand is the custom in your country, we'll go places and do something.
Goodbye, Minnie, miss me just a little, won't you?
A very great deal, my dear.
Nice old duck, isn't he?
Oh, he isn't so terribly old.
Oh, I didn't mean in years, Aunt Minnie.
I meant I like him.
Do you?
Then you're a good judge of men.
Now, tell me about this young lady you wrote me about. What was her name?
Sophie. She's given me the air.
What?
We had a row.
Oh, I thought she'd given you an heir.
She must be very stupid.
Oh, no, she's brilliant, really.
She speaks German and French and everything.
Here's her picture.
It isn't very good of her, though.
She has her points.
I take it you're smarting over this air she has given you.
Well, I'm still in love with her.
But she says I'm just a hick.
- A what?
- A farmer.
I've got hay in my hair.
I can't talk on any subject,
- I can't dance, I can't even dress myself.
- Ridiculous.
And I don't know anything about women's clothes, and when I have to order dinner it's always meat, potatoes and pie.
Oh, she says that, does she?
Well, we'll show her she's wrong.
Gosh, John's been in there a long while.
Oh, why didn't we go to a hotel first?
Man, I'm hungry.
Come on, Mac, give him the call.
That's my gang.
- I came over with a band.
- A band of what?
An orchestra.
They're the Wabash Indianians, hired for a job in Paris and fired through a misunderstanding.
Now they're looking for an engagement.
They're a swell bunch.
They do that rather prettily.
Madame, Scharwenka wants to see you.
She doesn't like her tissue.
She doesn't like the model, she doesn't like the fit, and she doesn't like the price.
Oh, you mean she doesn't like it.
Yes, madame, what will you do about it?
Do about it? Let her go.
She'll come back.
She's the rage here right now, and she's got the best figure in Europe, but she has to have it dressed, at least partly.
I'm afraid she intends to start her screaming.
If she does, stick a pin in her.
Oh, I'd rather use an ice-pick.
This time I left the door open.
Who is she going to stick a pin into?
Scharwenka, a Polish countess who has spurned the hollow mockeries of society and gone in for nightclub entertaining.
You can see she's talented.
Do you allow her to make such a noise?
- lf she enjoys it, why not?
- Well, suppose the police come in?
Good, they can take her away.
But she must be insane to make such a row.
Stephanie may not be safe with her.
- You feel inclined to stop her?
- Yes, I do.
No, no, no, no, no!
You are not the only couturier in Paris!
I am a good advertising for the house that dresses me!
I do not know why
I come to Roberta anyway!
You... Will you quit pushing me?
I... I beg your pardon.
You can't behave like that, you know.
You big beautiful American!
You are very strong.
You do not understand.
These Latin races must be shouted at.
I'm not a Latin and shouting doesn't impress me.
Hey.
I shall never set foot in this place again.
You do not know how they have treated me.
This horrible old woman here.
The greedy old diable.
Easy, she's my aunt.
Oh, well, I was not blaming it on her.
She is really a genius, but that little shrew who runs the business. That Stephanie...
But Stephanie is swell.
What, you are her lover?
I've never seen such a place.
No one thinks of anything but being somebody's lover.
Well, have you never thought of it?
What happened?
Your nephew has done most admirably, madame.
What did he do? Where is Scharwenka?
On his neck.
Oh, I see.
Does he like it?
Not particularly.
But I don't hear him shouting for help.
There's that cuckoo band again.
Scharwenka!
Do you think she'd do something for my nephew if he asked her?
I don't think he'll even have to ask her.
No, no, no.
I mean something for this band of his.
She could get them an engagement and if they're John's friends, they're a swell band.
I must show you Paris, and I want you to love it.
- I've seen the Eiffel Tower.
- Oh, no.
My dear Countess. I understand there are a few things wrong with the gown.
You shall have a new model, at a new price.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with the gown.
I'll be back tomorrow for another fit.
May I present my nephew, John?
Oh, he presented himself most charmingly.
My nephew is paying me a visit en route to London, he has a band which is playing at a private party for the Duke of Wattingham.
I should like to hear your orchestra sometime.
Now. There's no time like now.
Now, hang on to your hat.
Hey, fellows!
Strike it up. It's a job.
Come on, boys, let's give them the Let's Begin number.
- Come on, get over here.
- Come on, man, get over there.
All right, boys, let's swing it.
Now that you've got me going
what you gonna do?
Is it up to me or is it up to you?
What kind a game is this we've begun?
Was it done just for fun?
Don't forget since we've met
There's no reason for vain regret. Oh
Is this to be a case of "fall
and glad I fell, kiss and never tell
"Folly and farewell?"
Which is going to be "might have been
"Lose or win? Let's begin"
I'm here to tell you, let's begin
Now that you've got me going
what you gonna do?
Is it up to me, or is it up to you?
What kind of game is this we've begun
Was it done just for fun?
- No
- Realize that I'm wise
And please stop rolling
those big blue eyes
Is this to be a case of "Fall and glad I fell
"Kiss and never tell, folly and farewell?"
Which is going to be
"might have been"let's begin
Let's begin
- I think I saw...
- Huck, it looks like you're all set.
- You remember the girl I told you about?
- She likes the band.
Well, I was out there dancing.
I looked up and I saw...
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- You're going in to meet a Polish countess.
- I don't want to meet any countess.
- But she can give the band a job.
- I don't care what she can...
- Who, who can? She can?
- Yeah!
- Well, that's different.
- No cracks, now.
I think they're very good.
Aunt Minnie, this is my friend Huck Haines.
My nephew has told me about you.
Countess, may I present
Monsieur Huck Haines?
Countess?
- Well, if it isn't...
- Huck is for Huckleberry, n'est-ce pas?
Yes, and a couple of n'est-ce pas.
Mr. Haines is the piccolo player
I was telling you about.
Ah! Piccolo player. How charmant.
No, no, no, madame. Pas de piccolo.
I play what you call a filthy piano.
May I present myself,
Le Marquis de Indiana.
Ah, Indiana, a province in the south of Greece, eh?
No, no, no, Madame la Comtesse.
Just west of Pittsburgh, babe.
Hey, ix-nay acking-cray.
These Americans are what you call fresh guys.
No, no, no. Refreshing.
Oh, mais oui. Refreshing.
Pardon, monsieur.
It is nothing, toots.
I should like to talk to this refreshing, filthy piano, alone.
Oh, certainly, certainly.
Is he a lunatic?
Oh, no, that's merely his way of making her feel at home.
Oh!
Now, listen here, Huck Haines...
No, no, no, no. What a charming surprise.
This little tete-a-tete with you, alone.
Huck, please.
What's the racket, Liz?
Did you marry the title or just lift it?
Be a pal, will you, Huck?
It's just a stage name.
You've got to have a title to croon over here.
I know. Gee, Lizzie, you look grand.
Look, I promise to get you a job if you won't tell on me.
- Okay, Liz.
- And it's not Liz.
I'm sorry, Princess? Baroness?
Oh, what is it?
You may call me Tanka.
- Tanka.
- You're welcome.
It's swell seeing you again, Tanka.
But what about that job for the boys?
Madame Roberta is having tea in her sitting room, and she would like you to join her, if you'd care to.
Oh, I am so sorry.
But you will tell Madame Roberta that I have an engagement with the Marquis de Indiana?
Yes, Countess.
Well, now, I guess
I've got you to add to my worries.
It's time for your nap.
Stephanie, my child,
I'm adding to your many duties.
We're going to make John over.
I think he's very nice as he is.
A good tailor never hurt a man, no matter how nice he is.
That's Ladislaw.
The doctor makes me take a nap every afternoon and Stephanie thinks that music helps me go to sleep.
Ladislaw is our doorman and a prince.
A prince, your doorman?
A Russian prince.
If there were such a thing as a restoration,
Ladislaw would be in line for the throne.
Ladislaw, I hope you're in good finger today.
- This is my nephew, Mr. Kent.
- Glad to know you.
Are you comfortable?
I want a drink of water.
Don't stand there, Ladislaw.
Play something. Play something.
You'll wake her.
You're darn right, you will.
I'll be hard to handle
I promise you that
and if you complain here's
one little Jane that will leave you flat
I'll be hard to handle
What else can I be?
Just ask my dad
the trouble he had controlling me
I have faults, to be specific
In a temper, oh I'm terrific
I throw chairs and tables and I never miss
Oh, I'm as cold as any shellfish
I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish
Think it over, my warning is this
I'll be hard to handle, I'm making it plain
now just be a dear and scram out of here
cause I'm gonna raise Cain
I'm as cold as any shellfish
I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish
Think it over my warning is
If you want me sweet and hot
Oh, I'll be hard to handle
I'm making it plain
Now just be a dear and scram out of here
Nice work, Countess, nice work.
Oh, well.
That was pretty good, boys but listen, Candy, give me a better pick-up after that second break, will you?
Okay. Okay, boss.
You know, this reminds me of the old days when we used to give shows in your barn.
Yeah, we used to fight over who handled the gate receipts.
You remember the valentine I sent you?
The one with the arrow piercing the heart and dripping blood?
Oh, yes, I remember that. I think that's the only valentine I ever received.
It's the only one I ever sent.
Those were the happy days, weren't they?
Do you know, I think I was in love with you then, Huck.
- I know you were.
- You.
Me. And what's more,
I was madly in love with you.
- Oh, we were funny kids, weren't we?
- Oh, I suppose so.
Remember that beauty contest I won?
- Oh, you got a trip to Kansas City.
- Yeah, well you won it for me.
How did you get all those men from the overall factory to vote for me?
That was easy.
I showed them a picture of Lillian Russell.
Lillian Russell?
What was the matter with my picture?
Well, if you must know, we got a lot of votes from the farmers with a picture of a prize heifer.
Oh, you.
He is coming now.
Listen, Huck, give it to him and make it sweet and hot.
Come on, boys, the big boss is coming.
Let's jam it.
What's that?
You want an orchestra.
I have got one for you.
You are tearing your hair to get good music, I bring it to you.
I take them away from the Duke of Wattingham, just to give it to you.
You give it to me?
How much does it cost?
What does it matter? Listen to them.
They are good.
They are very good.
They are hired.
I am glad
I didn't take those white-faced Indians.
I think maybe sometimes I am wrong.
But this orchestra is superb.
And who did it for you?
Little Tanka.
The palefaces!
Who did it?
Little Tanka do it for me.
It's a frame-down.
That's what it is, a frame-down!
- Well, up or down, do we stick?
- Stick?
You're right, you stick a knife upon my back.
- Voyda, what is wrong with them?
- What is wrong for them?
I cable for Wabash Indians and what do I get? Indianians!
Get out! No job!
- I do not get it.
- Neither did we.
Very well, let them go!
Then I go with them!
Oh, yes? Where you going to?
Now, what was the name of that club that made you the offer yesterday?
Oh, oh, the Club Antoine.
Oh, I could go there today.
They offered me a six-month contract and I could take the band with me.
You go, you go.
You are not bluffing with Voyda.
Indians.
Now, listen, Mr. Voyda.
I think you're making a big mistake by letting the Countess go to the Café Arman. I mean Antoine.
I think you ought to try and make her stay here, if possible.
After all, Mr. Voyda, your money is just as good as no money.
I mean, anybody's money.
That Café Antoine.
I hold you to your contract with me.
I have your cable accepting it.
As for you, I can pay you as much money as Antoine can pay you.
Everything is fixed!
I go and telephone my lawyer!
Boys, we're working.
Hurray!
Vive la France!
Vive la Russia, you mean.
Hello, Stephanie.
Stephanie, how's the Newfoundland pup?
- The all-American nephew?
- You won't recognize him.
Since you've been gone, Stephanie has made a man of the world of him.
He's positively arresting.
You ought to see him, Lord Henry.
Your tailor has surpassed himself.
He looks wonderful.
But then I think he has the knack of wearing clothes.
Not every man has, you know.
And he has a positive flair for languages.
The way he's taken hold of French is amazing.
You should have heard him tell a taxi driver where to go last night.
And Stephanie and I have given him a few pointers it would take most men a lifetime to acquire.
What a start for a young fellow.
Au revoir, my dear.
You never looked lovelier in your life than you do this minute.
Until tomorrow.
It's always nice to know
I shall see you tomorrow, Henry.
You've been saying very pleasant things to me, lately, Minnie.
- Not really ill, I hope?
- No.
- Stephanie.
- Lord Henry.
- Where is John?
- Taking his French lesson.
Haven't you heard them?
No.
La winner!
Come on, boys, come in.
- So long, prof.
- So long, prof.
Can I get you something?
No, thank you.
Not even a drink of water?
No.
Sing, please.
Yesterday
Yesterday
Days I knew as happy sweet
sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance
And love joys
were mine to take
Mine to give
Free and gaily flaming life
was mine to live
Sad am I
Glad am I
for today
I'm dreaming of
yesterday
Joys were mine
to take
mine to give
Free and gaily flaming life
was mine to live
Sad am I
Glad am I
for today
I'm dreaming of
yesterday
- Sophie, Sophie.
- What's the matter?
Here's an article about John.
He's turned dressmaker.
Can you bear it? lmagine John Kent in a smart dress shop?
He wouldn't know a smart dress from last year's awning.
Well, the first place I'll make a beeline for in Paris is going to be Roberta's.
It's all right, Fernande.
I was just saying goodbye to a room in which I've been very happy.
But you are not leaving Roberta's, mademoiselle.
Goodbye, Fernande.
Bonjour, Monsieur Fullback.
I wish to place an order.
Would you mind hemstitching two dozen touchdowns for me?
Oh, lay off.
Would run up for me two field goals and a bias, with the score tied in the back?
Kind of a halfback.
I don't get sore often, but I will in a minute if you two don't shut up.
Do you plan fitting the ladies yourself, John?
What a picture. Tape measure around the neck and pin-cushion on the hip.
I ought to spank the two of you.
Now, don't lose your sense of humor, Johnny.
Why don't you let a guy alone when he's trying to figure things out?
She just wants to know what you're going to do.
- That's all.
- I'm going home.
- But you can't. You're Mr. Roberta.
- I'm not. Stephanie is.
I mean, well, Aunt Minnie left no will, so her property comes to me.
But she always said the shop was to be Stephanie's.
- Stephanie's going...
- Yes.
We are astonished.
Well, I'm not astonished.
You mean you're going to give the whole shop to Stephanie?
Yes, right away. That's what Aunt Minnie wanted and that's what I want.
You're giving it to her without any... strings?
What do you mean, "strings"?
Oh, she just means strings.
Well, you make yourselves comfortable.
I've got to find Stephanie.
I was looking for you.
- Well, hello.
- No, no, no.
Can you tell me why no will can be found?
- Well, because there isn't any.
- Why haven't you been able to find it?
- It must have been destroyed.
- So you admit it?
Admit what?
For years Stephanie has worked to build this business.
It was hers as much as Roberta's.
Madame could not destroy that will.
- Are you trying to say I did?
- I will not say yes or not.
But it looks queer, very queer.
You... Why, you Russian prince!
I'm still boss of this outfit, and you're fired!
No, no, I am not fired. I am perfectly cool.
I mean you're dismissed.
You think you can get rid of me so easy!
- Get out!
- You think no one will protect Stephanie.
- Stephanie doesn't need your protection.
- While Stephanie stays here and remains here, I will protect her.
Aren't you ashamed to be quarreling like two silly little boys?
Please go, Lad, I'll meet you downstairs.
The Russian nobility burns me up anyway.
They're always sticking their noses in other people's business.
- You don't like the Russian nobility?
- No.
I don't like his hanging around you.
I was going to give you the shop anyway.
Oh, you are very magnanimous, giving me something I don't want.
- You don't want it?
- No.
And who are you to give me gifts?
- Wait a minute, you mustn't act like this.
- I'll act the way I choose.
It's your shop, you run it.
Goodbye.
Hey, wait a minute, Stephanie.
I'm sorry, but I can't be a dressmaker.
I couldn't half carry on the business.
- Maybe you could carry it on half.
- How do you mean?
Well, I mean
- maybe we could be partners.
- No, no.
You like it, you take it, Stephanie.
I've got a football team to coach.
No, I wouldn't accept anything except in partnership.
Not on your life. That's out.
- All right, then I'm out.
- Oh, wait a minute.
Pardon, mademoiselle, may I finish this now?
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, wait a minute.
May she?
I mean, yes. Certainly, my good woman.
You'll make a very nice partner.
It isn't generally known that Madame has been letting me do all the designing.
So we'll have to startle them with daring styles.
- Partners.
- Partners.
Oh, John, look. We've had a brainstorm.
Instead of you going home, why don't you and Stephanie become partners?
Huck, you're brilliant.
What do you say, Stephanie?
No, not on your life. That's out.
You'll make a very nice partner.
It isn't generally known that Madame has been letting me do the designing.
We'll have to startle them with daring styles.
- Partners.
- Partners.
Countess, you shall be our first customer.
Yvonne.
This we call le Petit Trianon.
If you don't like any of these, say so, won't you?
Gee, I think they're swell.
And this is le train bleu.
Oh, that one's a honey.
That's the one I'd take.
Do your ecstasies refer to the gown or the girl?
Oh, I hadn't noticed the girl, but now that you mention her,
- I'd take...
- Yes?
The gown. Less upkeep.
This is called la sirene noire.
Does not she look wonderful in that?
Marvelous.
Just like a peeled eel.
I don't like that one.
Liane...
Albert.
Maybe we could do something about it.
Albert, do you suppose we could raise this back a little?
If you don't mind, I'd like that dress out.
- As bad as that, huh?
- Worse.
All right, then it's out.
Take it away, Albert.
This is le ciel gris.
That is the one I will take.
And tall, handsome gentlemen with large bank accounts will be asking for my telephone number.
And getting it.
And won't they be surprised when I answer?
Well, so long.
Tell the Countess I'll be waiting for her.
Where?
Oh, either on the right side of the Left Bank, or the left side of the right bank.
- I think you're swell not to be angry.
- Angry?
I hope we're good enough friends for you to express an opinion.
And I hope we're good enough friends for you to dine with me tonight.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Tomorrow night.
I'm very sorry.
I'll tell you, the night
Huck opens at the Café Russe.
All right.
Gee, that'll be swell.
Yes.
I've always been interested in newspaper work.
Have you anything more to say?
I think he's said enough.
I haven't any more paper.
Oh, we have reams and reams of it here.
Oh, thanks.
A football player owning a dress shop is news, isn't it?
Good news.
Well, that's what I say, almost too good to be true, and that's why we want you to have it first.
So that you can write it in your own sweet charming way that you've made famous,
Miss...
We want you to introduce it in your own inimitable style, Miss...
- Jones.
- Jones.
Jones.
But I'm still sore about all those silly jokes they're printing about me.
Yes, but they print it.
Every time they make a joke, a million francs pour in.
It's a pretty expensive joke on somebody else, I think.
- Now, when Mr. Kent designs clothes...
- When I what?
Does Mr. Kent design clothes, too?
- No.
- Oh, modesty, modesty.
Mr. Kent's idea is to introduce the football motif into dress designing.
The outdoor flavor will make the evening clothes look healthier.
Oh, wait till you see our end-around-end evening creation.
You know, the one with the dash-off center.
Has Mr. Kent any more ideas?
- No.
- Oh, yes, thousands and thousands.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Kent's main idea is to design women's dresses the way men think they should be.
And how do you men think they should be?
Not so naked.
Well, well, he means that if clothes are to clothe, they should clothe.
It's more stimulating to the imagination, if clothes clothe.
That's very unique.
Yes.
And pockets in all dresses, especially in the evening ones, so the women can pack their own junk.
The bulging pockets of the male will disappear forever.
Women will not have to depend upon their male escorts.
They'll be much more independent.
As a matter of fact... As a matter of fact, pockets will make the female more female.
Very nice.
And gloves attached to the dress, so they won't get lost.
They'll be worn on a jeweled...
Around the neck.
Brilliant!
Well, I really must be going now.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- That's fine.
- Have you had enough?
- Yes, I think I have quite enough.
- Now tell me, what paper will this be in?
- Paper?
Why, I'm Miss Jones. I'm syndicated.
When you talk to me, you're telling the world.
How was I, toots?
Pardon, monsieur, a lady to see you.
- Another newspaper woman?
- An American, I think.
A Miss Teale.
Sophie! Send her in, please.
Huck, she's here.
That's great, and just when you were getting along so swell.
You don't appreciate her.
I know she seems a little hard and sophisticated.
But underneath she's a pearl.
And a pearl, so I am told, is the result of a chronic irritation on an oyster.
What do you know about anything, anyway?
- I know about everything, every way.
- Then you must know Sophie's swell.
John, every day you act worse, but today you're acting like tomorrow.
- Hello, John.
- Sophie!
You're awfully hard to see since you became a couturier.
Not for you, Sophie.
When did you arrive in Paris?
This morning.
How long are you going to stay?
Oh, hello, Huckleberry.
Hello, Soph.
Mother and I are going to Switzerland on Saturday.
Goodbye, John. I'll see you Sunday.
Don't mind him, he's only clowning.
Thank you, dear.
Well, so you're here now.
Yes.
- Aren't you pleased to see me?
- Sophie, I've tried to forget you.
And have you, John?
I thought I had, but now I know I haven't.
Gee, you're swell.
John, you have a line that just sweeps a girl right off her feet.
Yeah, sure.
When are you going to show me Paris?
You'd be bored seeing Paris with a small-town hick like me, who only knows how to order meat and potatoes and pie.
Oh, please forget I ever said those things.
I only said them because you were going away.
I didn't want you to go.
- I loved you so much.
- It was a funny way to love me.
But, John, darling, don't you ever say things you don't mean?
No.
Well, maybe I do.
Don't cry, Sophie, I don't like it.
I can't help it. I'm so unhappy.
I came all the way to Paris just to see you.
- Only to find you don't love me anymore.
- But I do, Sophie, honest I do.
Oh, John.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, come in, Stephanie.
May I present Miss Sophie Teale?
My partner Stephanie.
How do you do?
When I come in for a new gown, may I ask for you?
Oh, that'll be swell.
Well, I'll run along.
I know how busy you are.
- No, I'll see you to the door.
- No. No. Business before pleasure.
But I'll save Wednesday for you.
Lunch and dinner and the evening.
That's fine. It's a date.
Goodbye, miss.
- Stephanie, I want to...
- Why, when you have time,
- I wish you'd look over these materials.
- But I want to tell you about Sophie.
- She's very lovely.
- Yes, that is... I mean she...
Holy smokes, haven't we a date for next Wednesday?
Oh, have we? I'm sure we haven't.
This we call le lys doré.
If I weren't going out with Johnny,
I wouldn't be so particular.
But I'm sure he'll want me to have something that expresses my personality.
Suppose we have Johnny come in and help you select something.
He knows so much more about your personality than I do.
Oh, no. No, please. I want to surprise him.
You know, he's really just a little boy in spite of his man-of-the-world exterior.
Yes, I suspected that.
I'll see what else I can get for you.
- Oh, hello, Huck.
- Hello.
If you're looking for Johnny, he's in conference with his lawyer.
Well, then, maybe you'll have lunch with me.
- Are you busy?
- Very.
I'm trying to find something to suit the personality of Miss Sophie Teale.
Then you are busy.
Liane.
Excuse me, won't you?
Liane, that dress was discarded.
Why do you have it on?
Albert wanted to make a new top for it.
Oh, all right. Fine.
- Is Miss Teale's personality in there?
- Yes, right in there.
I'll go and torment her a while.
Is that beautiful.
And just made for you, Soph.
- Oh, hello. Do you really think it suits me?
- Oh, certainly.
A little longer sleeves, it would make an ideal straitjacket.
Some day, by sheer accident, you're going to say something funny, Huck.
Oh, Soph, now don't be like that.
Do you mind if I sit here and help you pick out a gown?
No, I'm trying to find something that John will like on me.
Something startling.
John loves to be startled by girls' dresses.
Here is a gown that might please you, Miss Teale.
This gown has both chic and good breeding.
I'm more interested in its chic.
I can supply the breeding myself.
I know the dress.
Look, Stephanie, you know that one that...
It sort of begins and then in the...
You know, the black one.
- The black one?
- Yes, the one you put aside.
Oh, no. No, I can't.
Oh, yes, you can, Stephanie.
Show it to Miss Teale.
- I know she'd like it.
- Oh, no, Mr. Kent wouldn't...
I'm quite sure Mr. Kent would want me to see any model you have.
Please have it shown as quickly as possible.
That's it, Stephanie, please have it shown as quickly as possible.
Just because it's been set aside for a marquise, doesn't mean that it can't be shown.
Very well. Anna, have Liane model
la sirene noire at once, please.
Oh, thank you, Huck.
Now we're getting someplace.
- She'll probably like that dress.
- She's going to like it.
When John sees her in it, oh boy, he's gonna make her walk home, ocean and all.
- No, he won't. He's in love with her.
- He only thinks he is.
If he were, would you mind?
I am minding, Huck. Terribly.
Can't you hurry that model?
Yes. Yes, Miss Teale.
Well, now that's the smartest thing you've shown me. I like it.
It's been discarded.
It wasn't put aside for anyone.
- Huck was mistaken about that.
- Oh, I see.
Well, I think I'll have it just the same.
What shall I do?
You're doing fine.
- How much is it?
- It's only 1,000 francs.
It's hardly worthy of you.
I'm afraid she's right, Sophie.
You know it may not be so becoming.
You're not a very good saleslady.
Maybe I'm wrong, Miss Teale.
That dress might suit you very well.
This is the bit of international diplomacy
I shall boast about to my grandchildren, the nasty little demons.
I'll take the dress.
But I want to try it on first.
The more I think of it, the more I am sure the dress will bring out something elegantly alluring in you.
Well, I always know the moment
I see a dress whether it'll be right for me or not.
I'll take this drink and then the food.
- Gee, I'm starved.
- Me, too.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Oh, hello, Huck.
- Hello, Soph.
- Hello.
Oh, say, Huck, will you take care of Sophie for a minute?
I want to see about a table.
Pardon me, Sophie.
- Here's a drink waiting for you.
- Oh, thanks, John. Thanks.
- Got the new dress on, Soph?
- Certainly.
You don't know it, but this is a great moment in my life.
- Oh, thank you, Huck.
- Thank you.
Don't you think this dress does something for me?
- It'll do something for me.
- Oh, now, Huck.
- A dress like this depends on...
- I know, it depends on that shoulder strap.
Has John seen it yet?
- Afraid he won't like it.
- And why not?
He thinks everything I wear is perfect.
If I ever ask him how he likes a dress, he just looks at me with calf-eyes and says,
"Gee, darling, you look swell."
I bet he won't say it about that one.
I'll bet you $100 he says,
"Gee, that looks swell."
- Make it francs, and it's a bet.
- Sold.
Look, John, we want you to settle a little bet.
Sophie has a very important question to ask you.
Gee, that's swell.
How do you like it? Isn't it a knockout?
It's the worst-looking thing I ever saw.
Gee, darling, you look terrible.
- Who sold it to you?
- Your partner.
She thought it brought out something elegantly alluring in me.
Oh, she did, did she?
I'm sorry I said anything, Sophie.
It isn't your fault, you send it back.
I will not send it back.
It's the smartest thing in your shop.
But what do you know about clothes anyway?
You make yourself ridiculous by even discussing them.
I knew enough about them to order that thing out of our line.
Let me tell you something, John Kent, now that you think you know something about women's clothes...
- Please.
- Now that you are carrying on
- with your dressmaker.
- Shut up.
I won't shut up. You're in love with her.
I could tell it the minute she came into your office.
Let's go home.
I'll go home and I'll go home alone.
Suit yourself.
- What? You'd let me?
- Why not?
And now we're getting down to cases, here's something I want to tell you.
You've bawled me out for the last time.
I've stood for all your knocking and criticism because it sounded so cute coming from such a little snip.
And because I thought I loved you.
- Oh, you thought you loved me?
- Yes, and what a sap you've made of me.
Well, it certainly didn't take much effort.
And don't you ever come crawling back to me again.
Because I'm through. Through!
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Sure, but I thought you said you were through.
- Well, I am.
- Well, goodbye!
Goodbye!
Noisy.
- Give me a dozen brandies.
- A dozen?
Yeah, and line them up right here.
Is there anything I can do for you?
No.
Think of what you're losing
by constantly refusing to dance with me
You'd be the idol of France with me
And yet you stand there
and shake your foolish head dramatically
While I wait here so ecstatically
You just look and say emphatically
Not this season
There's a reason
I won't dance
Don't ask me
I won't dance
Don't ask me
I won't dance, madam, with you
My heart won't let my feet
do things they should do
You know what? You're lovely
And so what? I'm lovely
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave
that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
Ah, but when you dance
you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos
And that's why I won't dance
Why should I?
I won't dance
How could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
Won't you?
I know that music leads the way
to romance
And if I hold you in my arms I won't dance
Bravo! Bravo!
Good work.
I won't dance, ta-da-dah
I won't dance
Get the musicians, quick.
I want a drink, ta-da-dah
I want a drink, ta-da-dah
I want a drink, ta-da-dah
Your Highness, this is a great honor.
Broken down prince rates a lot of trumpeting.
- What is it?
- You are going to sing for us.
- Oh, am I?
- Yes.
All right.
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said someday
You'll find all who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When the lovely flame dies
Smoke gets
in your eyes
They said someday
you'll find all who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think I could
Doubt my love
Yet to... my love
- Nice of you to join us.
- Now, don't try and high-hat me just because you happen to be with a broken-down prince.
- Please go away, John.
- No, I wanna talk to you.
- You're not yourself.
- Yes, I am. I'm twice myself.
I wanna talk to you.
What do you mean selling that dress?
Didn't I tell you to throw it out?
- I didn't intend to.
- You did, too.
It was a dirty trick to play on a friend of mine.
- Please go away, Mr. Kent.
- You stick to your own business.
- Laddie, please.
- Well, what have you got to say?
- I've nothing to say.
- Oh, you have nothing to say.
Well, I have.
And I think it was a sneaking thing to do.
Telling Sophie she looked elegantly alluring in an ugly, vulgar...
- Please, John, tomorrow.
- No, I want it out, now.
All right, I'll tell you.
I sold her that vulgar, tasteless dress because I thought it suited her perfectly.
I think she suits you perfectly.
I think you're perfectly matched.
And after this, you'd better count on running your business without me.
- Stephanie, I...
- Now, will you please go?
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So
I smile and say
When the lovely flame
dies
Smoke gets in your...
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know, but look, this is no joke.
I didn't say I'd take care of your silly dressmaking business indefinitely.
But you can't give it to me. I won't take it.
- You've got a band to look after.
- I've got a band to look after.
I know, but John,
Stephanie isn't here, either.
- Monsieur.
- What? Yeah, the one with the spots.
What? Well, how do I know were she is?
I only agreed to do this thing to help you out, you know.
But it isn't my racket either.
- Tell him you've got a band!
- I've got a band!
And both the band and the shop will be on the rocks this way!
I don't care which one you use.
They're both terrible.
What? Yeah, that was the Countess.
Well, what about it?
- Yes, but don't you think...
- I don't think...
Look, use the other one, the both of them.
The whole flock of them. Out. Out.
What?
Look, John, if I knew where Stephanie was
I wouldn't be wasting my time with you, babe.
I know, but somebody's got to come and take this ridiculous business off my shoulders.
In the four days I've been here, my voice is beginning to change.
John, but wait. Don't hang up.
He won't come back.
Now what am I gonna do?
- You're not asking my opinion, are you?
- Yes. No.
Pardon, monsieur, but do you think we should use matelassé for the "after twilight" number or paillettes?
And what about the tippet?
- Well, what do you think?
- I wouldn't know, monsieur.
Well, personally,
I go in for the simple things.
- Which is the simpler?
- There is no difference, monsieur.
Well, then, use whichever we have the most of.
We have plenty of all.
Oh, we have?
- Well, then use a little of each.
- A sort of a patchwork quilt.
Yeah. No.
It will be newer that way and have much more chic.
Tell Madame Blanchard that's my final decision.
Stephanie.
- I knew you'd come back.
- I came back to tell John Kent he's insane.
Where is he? Look at those.
How do you think women are going to react to those?
Where is Mr. Kent?
Oh, he's not here.
He's been staying away, too.
- Who has been running the business?
- Did you say running or ruining?
Well, someone had to do it.
You and John left it flat.
But I thought surely he was here.
Well, if he were, he doesn't know any more about it than Huck does.
Not as much.
You are the one who is needed, Stephanie.
Well, that's impossible.
Why? Just because you and John are in love with each other?
Don't be fantastic, Huck.
John isn't in love with me.
Is it fantastic when a man is eating his heart out for you?
When your name is continually on his lips?
When he stands around dark street corners just to get a glimpse of you?
- He doesn't.
- He does, and more.
Everyone around here knows it but you, Stephanie.
And maybe John.
- But he's always quarreling with me.
- Well, what more can you ask?
Oh, that's nothing. People in love are always quarreling with each other.
Now you take Liz and myself for instance.
Liz? Who is this Liz?
Oh, a little country girl from back home that I'm thinking of marrying.
You know, big feet, dumb, simple.
Oh, very simple.
Well, the simple and dumb ones make the best wives sometimes.
Well, forgetting about this girl of Huck's from back home, with the big feet, what about Roberta? What about John?
Yes, Stephanie, you must come back for Aunt Minnie's sake.
No, I'm sorry. I can't.
Stephanie, you must.
Come in.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, mademoiselle, I am so happy.
Now you can...
Give those to Mr. Haines, Albert.
Well, there are some dresses that men will fall for.
- I practically designed those myself.
- I've seen worse, darling, but not much.
And what do you think, Stephanie?
Are they as bad as that?
Well, the men may like them, but I'm sure the women won't.
Well, maybe you're right and maybe you're wrong.
- We'll just have to try them out, I guess.
- But, Huck, you can't.
Roberta's never put out clothes like those.
Roberta's is in new hands now.
But this is like the mode two seasons back.
I know, but I liked them better then.
But nobody will buy them.
Well, you'd be laughed out of Paris if you did a thing like that.
The trend is away from such styles.
- I'm not interested in the trend.
- But you've got to be.
You don't understand.
You're giving a fashion show next week.
Every couturier in Europe is going to be watching.
You can't afford to show models like those.
Well, of course you cannot.
Stephanie is right!
What does it matter as long as they're pretty?
But clothes must be more than pretty.
Look, the trouble with that is it...
It fits in the wrong places.
Such a pity.
The famous Roberta to go second rate.
- Roberta's will never go second rate.
- Who is to stop it?
The fashion show next week will be a colossal flop.
Maybe we should call off the fashion show.
I think so.
- We might better put on a good one.
- Now you're talking, Stephanie.
We'll put on a better-than-good one.
We'll give them some entertainment, too.
- How about your band?
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah.
- We'll bring over my band.
- A musical fashion show.
- Yes, that's it.
- It'll be marvelous.
- And you can make the new designs.
We endorse this polo rig, of course
And for an added 1,000 francs
we furnish horses
Or if you're doing splits on skis
at St. Moritz
You'd be the best-dressed
"faller-downer" on the courses
Now take the dowager who is glad
to leave her watchman for tea
She'll wear this patriotic plaid
and meet that Scotchman for tea
When summertime begins
this costume always wins
When 50 million little Frenchmen
clap their fins
For hunting grouse or quail
Roberta ran up this suit
The modest price includes
the bag, the gun and two ducks to shoot
And should Amelia Earhart care
to get a breath of air
this is the last thing in the world
she'd ever wear
- Ladislaw, are we gathering later?
- The Princess begs to be excused.
We are leaving for Rome immediately the showing is finished.
It is the hour for dry martinis
The park is full of little Fords
and Isotta Fraschinis
The Ritz bar is serving caviar and weenies
Madame is there
And from Roberta she has something
that is too divine on
The sort of thing your jealous friends
would love to spill their wine on
For your inspection, our cocktail collection
Clothes must play a part
To light an eye, to win a heart
They say a gown can almost speak
If it is chic
Should you select the right effect
you cannot miss
And night and day
He is sure to say
Lovely to look at
delightful to know
And heaven to kiss
A combination like this
Is quite my most impossible scheme
come true
lmagine finding a dream like you
You're lovely to look at
It's thrilling to hold you
Terribly tight
For we're together, the moon is new
And oh, it's lovely to look at you
Tonight
You're lovely to look at
Delightful to know
And heaven to kiss
Heaven to kiss
A combination like this
Is quite my most impossible
scheme come true
lmagine finding a dream like you
You're lovely to look at
It's thrilling to hold you
Terribly tight
For we're together, the moon is new
And oh, it's lovely to look at you
Tonight
So lovely to look at
Delightful to know
And heaven to kiss
A combination like this
Is quite my most impossible scheme
come true
lmagine finding a dream like you
You're lovely to look at
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight
For we're together, the moon is new
It's lovely to look at you
Tonight
I have never seen
Princess Stephanie look so lovely.
Yes. We shall miss her now that she and Prince Ladislaw are leaving Paris.
Oh, did she marry him?
At night when madame
leaves the quiet of her hall room
To drag her very weary feet
around the ballroom
Her clothes and jewels must be
a monument of power
I mean, the monument
they call the Eiffel Tower
We'll show you the gown we made
Marie,
Queen of Romania
We also ran up three of these
for Mrs. Smudge, Pennsylvania
The lights are low, here we go
Lovely to look at, delightful to know
And heaven to kiss
A combination like this
Is quite my most impossible dream
come true
lmagine finding a boy like you
You're lovely to look at
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight
For we're together, the moon is new
And, oh, it's lovely to look at you
- Oh, my. Oh, my.
- What?
- I said, "My, oh, my." That was lovely.
- It went well, didn't it?
- I guess I'll have to give in to you.
- To me?
But I didn't say anything.
But I thought you were about to want to marry me.
- Well, I was.
- Well, I accept.
Well, thanks very much.
Well, you're quite welcome, my fine feathered friend.
Hey! Hey!
- Hey, do something about this. Will you?
- Just a moment. You stay right there.
Well, where do you think I can go?
- John.
- Stephanie, I...
- Stephanie, are you happy?
- Tremendously.
- Then I am, too.
- Well.
Haven't you anything more to say?
No. Only congratulations and have a good time and goodbye.
I'm sailing for New York tomorrow.
You're being very heroic about something.
What is it?
Oh, I was just thinking it must be fun to suddenly find yourself a princess married to a nice prince.
I was born a princess. I'm not married to Ladislaw. He's my cousin.
And you're still a big blundering,
Newfoundland fullback.
- Where are you going?
- Down.
- Why?
- Because I pushed the button.
- But I want to talk to you.
- That's what you're doing.
Just let me tell you I love you.
- What does that mean?
- I love you.
Gee, that's swell.
And it was there that Daniel Webster got the stern and intellectual training of the lawyer.
Got the training... that made him see...
...made him see things clearly and logically. until victory finally crowned his efforts.
And... because he saw things clearly and logically... victory crowned his efforts.
And then there was another important thing about him.
About Daniel Webster, I mean.
And that was that...
And then he...
In the matter of the National Bank.
In the matter of the National Bank... he opposed it forcibly on the grounds that... that there wasn't enough behind the species...
And uh... because of the... of the... untiring and ceaseless efforts of that clear and logical lawyer our Junior High of Manson got its name and inspiration.
I thank you.
Did I leave anything out, Uncle Joe?
Just most of the middle and the whole point.
I thought you were wonderful.
I'm quite sure I voice the opinion of you all when I say that our Herbert Mitchell has made a most unusual speech.
Or should I become a little more informal and call him Buzz.
The name which he has gained since coming to this community from his native Canada.
Yes, I shall. Buzz Mitchell.
An excellent speech, Master Buzz, though I confess you did confuse me a little about the banking problem.
But then, I'm only a banker and not a prospective lawyer, like you.
Yip, yip, yip, yip.
Before announcing the next artist on the program
I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to a little woman who has done much for Manson.
In her civic activities, by the example she sets in her home life her commendable fortitude in adversity she's a credit to our fair city.
She always has given of her time and energy much more than her widow's might.
Mrs Dorothy Wingate.
And more than that, my friends,
Mrs Wingate has also given us the next artist on our program the little American nightingale,
Miss Pinkie Wingate.
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start.
Something inside of me started a symphony, zing went the strings of my heart.
Just like the breath of spring,
I heard a robin sing about a nest set apart.
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony zing went this strings of my heart.
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again but keep repeating through and through
I love you, love you.
I still recall a thrill
I guess I always will
I hoped would never depart.
I knew I loved you heaps and you were mine for keeps
Zing went the strings of my heart.
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again but keep repeating through and through
I love you, love you.
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hoped would never depart.
I knew I loved you heaps and you were mine for keeps
Zing went the strings of my heart.
If the future of Manson depends on some of the stuff I heard in there we're doomed for some long, lean years.
But Uncle Joe, I knew the whole thing...
There's Mrs Wingate.
Go on and square yourself with her.
Gosh, Dottie, I knew it word for word
when I said it to you the other night, didn't I?
I thought it was very good, Buzz.
Didn't you, Mrs Higgins?
It was all right.
Of course it was.
Ahh...
Ahh.
A delightful song, Pinkie, and a delightful voice.
We'll have to see that that voice gets training, eh?
Aren't you going to thank Mr Drubbs,
Pinkie?
Thank you.
Come along, dear.
I want to talk to Buzz first.
All right, but don't be late.
Bring Buzz home for dinner, if you want to.
Good bye.
If it hadn't been for Mr Drubbs
I bet I wouldn't have forgotten it.
He was staring at me every time I looked around.
Gee, I know what I forgot.
Not only in the matter of the defeat of paper currency Bank did victory crown his efforts but also in the area of free trade, too...
And I don't want you to rush into anything if you aren't sure, Dottie.
Take your time. Think it over some more.
I realize that perhaps I don't have much to offer a woman like you. but if you can see your way clear...
I'll do my best to make you happy.
I know you would, Arthur.
But I have so many problems right now...
The children?
I'd do anything in the world for them.
I love those kids.
Ouch!
Billy Wingate!
Are you still sure you want to take on the Wingate family?
Dead sure.
You will think it over, won't you?
Yes... yes, I will.
I'll think it over.
It's been a nice afternoon.
Good bye.
Good bye.
Billy, stop fooling now and eat your cereal.
But Daniel Boone didn't eat cereal.
Billie!
Aw, gee, it's the first day of vacation.
Well, all right, but tomorrow.
Guess I'll go kill a few Indians.
It's a nice sunny day to start a vacation.
Toast, dear?
Oh, yes, toast.
Gee, Dottie, I wish I had a job.
What?
Didn't you sleep well, dear?
It'd be just like when we used to have so much fun.
Remember, even the time I frowned
Daddy said we'd have to go and celebrate.
And he had finished the trailer we left the breakfast dishes and went away and stayed for a week.
We wouldn't have to sell the trailer and we could go anyplace...
Pinkie, what are you talking about?
I'd be making plenty of money and you wouldn't have to worry about anything at all.
We could get the taxes paid up, and the roof fixed and you could have a lot of new clothes like you used to have.
Oh, Pinkie, you're sweet, but you aren't going to work.
You're going to have a nice, long vacation.
And in the fall you're going to Millicent School and you're going to have that voice trained properly.
But Dottie, I...
Listen, dear... when I was your age
I didn't learn much, except well, how to wash dishes, how to bake a shortcake, that sort of thing.
When an emergency came,
I wasn't prepared to meet it.
You're never going to be in that position.
You're going to have the best kind of independence.
I don't mean money.
I mean the ability to do something for yourself.
That's why training your voice is so important.
But...
Pinkie, what are you trying to say?
Well...
It's just...
Dottie...
If there was anybody else in this family besides us
I mean, besides you, and Billie and me...
It wouldn't be like the same family.
I mean...
You wouldn't...
Pinkie...
Don't you think I want what's best for all of us?
When you and Billy have everything that Daddy wanted for you I'll be so happy.
Why, you're just beginning.
Won't you trust me, dear?
Yes, mother.
Gee, I love you, Dottie.
Fill 'er up, Joe, and check the tires,
I'll be back in a minute.
Gosh, Pinkie, don't.
Please don't.
Look, maybe she won't marry him after all.
But she will.
I know she will.
Then he'll sit there in Daddy's chair and go ha-ha-ha.
Oh, Buzz, I can't stand it.
Well, gosh...
You gotta go with this clearly, logically.
But she's unhappy, I know she's unhappy.
'Cause she cried again last night.
And she'll go on crying.
Before she used to laugh all the time.
If Daddy were only here he'd do something.
Well, I'll do something, Pinkie.
What?
Well, I'll go over and talk to her.
That won't do any good, Buzz.
Well, I...
Maybe we could sue.
Sue?
Dottie?
No, no, Drubbs.
Could we, Buzz?
What for?
Oh, I... there must be plenty of things,
I mean...
Just a minute.
Section 233
What is it, Buzz?
I think I've got something here.
Buzz...
I've gotta get an outside opinion.
Pinkie, you wait here.
Buzz!
Buzz...
If you wanted to take a fellow out of town for a few days that mightn't want to go but you knew it was the best thing for him...
Buzz...
They couldn't put you in jail for that, could they?
Maybe.
Supposing it was a relation.
Like the time Mrs Selfridge took her daughter Mabel to Europe so she couldn't marry that Pickering fellow.
Well, they couldn't put you in jail for that, could they?
No, they couldn't arrest you for that.
Supposing it was a case like that?
Say...
When Mabel came back, she didn't want to marry that guy at all, did she?
Let me do that, Uncle Joe.
Listen. If I took a fellow fishing for a couple of days... could I borrow the Model "A"?
Yep.
But don't you think the fellow would be more comfortable if you borrowed the Wingate trailer?
Gee!
Buzz.
Thought about how you aim to feed this fellow, Buzz?
Whereas you look all tuckered out from your first day's work, Buzz and... whereas the fishing will be pretty good right now.
Looks to me whereas I'm cooked for a raise in advance.
Not that I think it will do any good, mind you... but it's worth it just to get a look at old Drubbs' face.
Uncle Joe.
I bet that old windbag will wanna shoot me for this...
Pinkie, dinner's almost ready.
What?
I wish you'd come downstairs so I wouldn't have to shout at you.
I can't come down.
Never mind, I'll be up.
Oh, no!
I'll be down.
Right down.
They're ready.
Look out!
Let it go.
Now, listen, Billie, you...
What're you doing with Pinkie's clothes, stealing?
I know, you're eloping.
Pinkie and Buzz are eloping!
Pinkie and Buzz are eloping.
Shut up and I'll give you my three-bladed jackknife.
Pinkie and Buzz are eloping.
I'll give you my carbine shell, too.
Huh? Where is it?
I haven't got it with me, but I have got something you want.
What?
Rats.
Where?
Right in there in a cage.
Red-eyed rats?
Sure, come and see for yourself.
Jiminy Crickets
Buzz! Buzz!
Drubbs is coming down the road.
Hey, Dottie, Dottie!
Hello, Buzz.
What was all that noise outside?
Somebody moving in next door?
No, that was me. I've got the trailer here.
A man says he wants to buy it.
Says he'll give you $50 for it, too.
Really, Buzz?
Oh, wait till I get this roast out of here.
You'd better come right away.
He might go away. He´s that kind of a fellow.
Come on, Dottie, hurry.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, I look awful.
No you don't, come on now, Dottie.
Dottie, help, let me out!
Dottie, let me out.
Billy.
Dottie, help, let me out.
Baby, how did you get in there?
I'll shoot that ol' Buzz so hard that he won't be able to sit down for a week.
Rats! That liar.
What is all this?
Buzz! Buzz, let me out of here.
Pinkie, Pinkie. Do you here me?
She's pounding on the window, Buzz.
Don't pay any attention.
Gosh, Buzz, maybe we've gone too far, huh?
We've gone too far to back down now.
We're only as far as the old lumber mill.
Come on, Buzz, we'd better turn back.
For Pete's sakes.
Take her back to marry Drubbs?
Oh, no. No.
Then sit tight and quit yapping.
Now, now, don't, Pinkie, don't.
What do you want me to do?
Give it all up?
Let her marry Drubbs?
Oh, Buzz, please stop.
Please.
Oh, Buzz, you're a darling.
Wait a minute, Pinkie.
We've got to talk. I'm gonna do it.
I'm not gonna have you gumming this thing up too so as we're back where we started.
But...
Oh, all right, Buzz.
Dottie! Are you in there?
You know perfectly well I am, Buzz.
Let me out of here this second.
Open up, Buzz, or I'll shoot your ugly head off.
Open up, I said.
Listen, Dottie, please don't be angry and treat us like children.
We thought this whole thing out very carefully and it's for your own good.
Will you open this door.
Listen, Dottie... we just want you to promise something first.
Now, in the event that we must return to town... and we'll do that only if you promise us a certain thing.
It's in your own interest, I assure you.
Will you promise if I open the door?
Dottie. Can you hear me?
Dottie.
Mrs Wingate.
Now listen, we know you're in there.
Open it, Buzz.
I might as well try and reason with a piece of cheese as women.
What's the idea of locking us in that trailer?
Billie, be quiet.
I'm sorry.
Dottie.
Now what have you to say for yourselves?
It's simply this way, Mrs Wingate.
We just wanted to protect you.
By throwing me into a trailer and locking me in and then driving into this ordeal and nearly knocking my teeth out.
Dottie, we didn't mean to.
Are you hurt?
Well, what did you mean then?
What is the meaning of this?
We only wanted... only so you could get away and... not have to worry about money and... not have to marry people or anything.
Honestly, Dottie.
I know you do, even though you say you don't.
I hear you crying at nights after we're in bed.
Dottie, I don't want you to have to marry anybody just because you want a new roof or you want me to go to school or... you want to get Billie's teeth straightened or anything.
Honestly, even if we have to live in a trailer for the rest of our lives.
It would be wonderful, honest it would.
It doesn't cost much to live in a trailer and... we could travel for months and months and... eat hamburgers and...
Buzz...
I think the two of you are mad.
Absolutely mad.
It's the craziest, silliest, most ridiculous, senseless thing
I've ever heard of in my whole life.
But I love you for it.
There's a road that leads to happiness
I know we can find it.
Although it's full of hills and spills darling, we won't mind it.
I got you, you got me who cares how rough the road may be
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Side by side, we'll go far, who cares how many bumps there are
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Remember this when anything goes wrong
Remember this, we'll merrily roll along.
We'll get rich or we won't
Who cares whether we do or don't
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Let's all join in and sing this tune
Dottie, Buzz, and Daniel Boone
We'll go bumpty, bump, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Hi-ho, what do we care
We're on our way but we don't know where
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
We'll never need silver linings for we'll never ever have a cloud
Give three cheers for four musketeers...
Only four?
Just four.
Just four?
No more.
For five would be a crowd, yes!
Rah-rah-rah.
Sis-boom-ba
Hey diddle-diddle
And Ooh-la-la.
We'll go bumpty-bump, bumpty-bump we'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Hail, hail, the gang's all here
Our home sweet home is in the rear
Bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
I got a long one,
I got a long one!
So did I.
Well, it looks like you and I will have to wash the dishes, Buzz.
Gosh, this is the third time in a row for me.
Oh, that's too bad.
Pinkie, you take Billie and run back to that farmhouse we passed this evening and see if you can get some milk for breakfast.
Okay.
Come on, Bill.
Pretty soon we'll be back in Manson,
Buzz.
With the same problems to face that we left behind.
Some things are rather hard for a woman to face all alone, Buzz.
I wish you'd give me some advice.
Well, that's what I'm here for, Dottie.
That's my business.
It's about Pinkie. I had no idea she felt so strongly about certain things.
I can hardly talk to her when she's so upset.
It's like pulling teeth sometimes to get her to listen to reason.
But you understand her so well, Buzz.
I thought you might help me with her.
I...
I don't quite understand this terrible dislike she has for poor Mr Drubbs.
That's only because she doesn't want you to marry anybody that you don't like, Dottie.
But I do like him, Buzz.
He's a very kind, unselfish man.
You mean you really want to marry him?
I'm going to marry him, Buzz.
Gee.
Then you really love him after all, huh?
Well, you see, Buzz, there are many different kinds of love.
It wouldn't be the same kind of love
I had for their father, Buzz.
That was wonderful.
But I'm older now.
A woman wants to keep her home around her children, have someone help her with problems she can't face alone.
Daddy was so happy-go-lucky he wouldn't worry a moment about the future.
He didn't even believe in insurance.
But everyone believes in insurance.
He didn't.
He thought everyone should get as much fun out of money as possible.
Just going on from day to day.
But that's sheer lack of foresight, Dottie.
Why, even I saved up $7.50.
Exactly, Buzz.
You can see I'm doing the right thing,
Buzz.
From a completely unprejudiced viewpoint,
Dottie,
I'd say you were doing absolutely the right thing.
Then if you could only make
Pinkie see it.
Pinkie just needs handling.
Ixnay, ixnay, attunday
Oh...
Hello, Pinkie.
Where's the milk?
Yeah, didn't you get the milk, Pinkie?
We got it all right, we almost had it home till mister smarty Buffalo Bill Wingate started to play Pony Express with it.
If she'd given me the milk bucket I wouldn't have had to grab it from her, would I?
I she hadn't of hung on to it when I came galloping past...
It's all right, Billie.
Only I'm afraid we won't have your flapjacks for breakfast.
Aw, Dottie! Gee, no flapjacks?
Now look what you went and done.
Buzz.
Buzz, wake up.
Buzz, it's me, Pinkie.
What is it?
I gotta talk to you.
Are you sick?
Shh... no.
I just got a question I had to ask you.
Come here.
For Pete's sake. Why can't you keep your questions till morning?
Instead of waking a man from a good night's sleep.
I just had to.
I just couldn't sleep.
I kept wondering.
Was Dottie talking to you about Drubbs when you were washing the dishes?
Now listen, Why do you wanna go jumping to conclusions for?
Listen, she didn't say a thing.
She was.
I can tell by the way you say she wasn't.
Oh, Buzz, she isn't still gonna marry him, is she?
Pinkie, listen.
Suppose she wanted to marry him.
But she couldn't.
She couldn't love anybody but Daddy.
That's all you know.
Well, not in the same way, maybe, but...
You're not taking into consideration all those other kinds of love.
What other kinds?
Well... when people get older... naturally they want to keep a home for their children, have peace and not have burdens on their shoulders.
If a guy comes along and wanted to help those children, naturally she'd have to love him in a way, wouldn't she?
Particularly if he carried good insurance.
Maybe, but...
I don't know how you could do better than Drubbs in the whole town of Manson.
If we aren't dumb.
I see plenty of other guys.
Guys both of you would like.
You know very well the only men in town that aren't married are old Mr Grant, Mr Farnswick and the barber.
Who said anything about in town?
We're out on the open road now.
We can meet anyone out here.
Up to the President of the United States.
What good would that do?
He's married.
Listen, if I found one that wasn't married and that was rich and everything and that both you and Dottie were crazy about... well, you'd like him better than Drubbs, wouldn't you?
I'd like anybody better than Drubbs.
Well, she'll go back and marry him for sure unless we find the right guy.
I'm gonna start out tomorrow and find him.
But, Buzz, people just don't go out and find husbands.
For the sole and only reason that they haven't the initiative, that's why.
Boy, I bet I can find one that'll make old Drubbs look sick.
Boy, I bet this is the solution to the whole darn thing.
Once and for all.
Listen, you know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna wake up good and early in the morning and hit the old road.
Isn't it beautiful, Buzz?
You know, I could settle down here and spend the rest of our time right in this very spot.
Oh, gosh, Dottie, no.
We gotta get out on that open road and see what the country has to offer.
I mean, Pinkie and I were saying just last night that we couldn't get started early enough this morning.
For a girl who couldn't get started early enough,
Pinkie is taking a long time getting dressed.
Hurry up, darling.
Buzz wants to get started.
I don't see what all the rush is about anyway.
You can't sit up half the night and...
But you got to bed at 9 o'clock.
Gosh, you must have been dreaming,
Pinkie.
Yes, I guess I was.
When did that trailer get here?
Oh, it drove in early this morning.
Breakfast is almost ready, dear.
You help Buzz with the table.
For Pete's sakes. Don't go giving things away the minute I think of them.
It all looks kind of crazy in the daylight, anyway.
Is it as crazy as Drubbs?
No.
All right, then.
We gotta get started with this thing right after breakfast.
Pinkie, is the salt on the table?
No, it must be in the cupboard, Dottie.
I can't find it anywhere.
Oh, Billie has it.
He went out to catch some birds.
Find him, Pinkie. I want Buzz to help me.
Oh, he's always going off and I have to chase after him...
Buzz, I need that salt right away.
Run over to that other trailer and ask them if they'll lend us some, will you, dear?
Okay, Dottie.
Hey, is anybody in here?
Get away from that tent flap.
What do you want?
Some salt.
Are you sure that flap's down?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
All right, whoever you are, the salt is in a can in front of you on a shelf as you come in that door.
Take the whole can, but watch that flap on the way out.
For the love of heaven, watch that flap.
Okay, I will, okay.
Close the door!
Shut it quick!
Holy smoke!
All he said was, "Watch that flap".
Hey, hold it.
You haven't used this stuff, have you?
Yes, but I don't think I'll use the eggs.
I don't like potassium bromide on eggs.
Thank heaven you knew what it was.
Luckily my husband used to use it for photography.
Really?
Although he never found it very satisfactory.
Is that so? Well, I find it quite satisfactory whenever I use it.
Maybe he used the wrong proportions.
Perhaps he didn't keep the plates cold enough.
Now, I keep my plates in a specially built refrigerator, you see, and...
I'm sorry, there I go again.
I almost poisoned you, but don't let me bore you to death.
Say, this is quite a trailer you've got here.
What's that?
Oh, that's for the water.
How do you work it?
That works like a tap pump.
You push this down... and that builds up the pressure in the tank there... forces water along and then you turn the fawcet.
Don't they think of the screwiest gadgets...
It was an invention of my husband's.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Not at all. It is a bit complicated.
Rather ingenious, though.
This must be rather an early vintage, isn't it?
Pioneer.
I'd like to show you a few improvements that I've devised for mine to conserve space.
Would you care to step over and see?
Come on, Dottie, let's.
Well, as long as we can't eat the eggs.
That is a shame.
I've got a half a dozen over there you can have and I'll give you some real salt.
All right.
After you, lad.
Hey, look out.
Wow, you need some ballast for that.
I want you to see this.
I'm rather proud of this one.
My shower.
How very handy.
And very practical, too.
Hot and cold running water and here is the water for the sink.
That is a convenience.
I've never seen anything like it.
How do you like it, lad?
Oh, what's that?
That won't bite you, now.
That is my robot refrigerator unit.
That's wonderful.
Here are the eggs.
Oh, I really couldn't.
You must, now take it.
And here's some real salt.
Thank you so much, and sorry for being such a bother.
No bother at all.
Come on, Buzz.
In just a minute.
All right.
That's a very lovely mother you have there.
Dottie's Pinkie's.
Huh?
She's very nice, too.
Yes, I'm sure.
My, this place must have cost quite a lot, eh?
It did.
Is that where your family sleep?
No, I haven't a family.
That's my darkroom for photography.
A fellow I know in Manson does a lot of photography.
Really?
Good money in it since this magazine boom, eh?
Yes, there seems to be.
Is this your work?
Hm-hmm.
Very pretty.
Isn't she?
It's...
It's nice to be able to take pictures of your loved ones, isn't it?
Yeah, but that's a professional model.
Oh.
Got any pictures of the girl you're engaged to?
No, I'm sorry to say I haven't.
And you know, I...
I hate to confess this to you, with your romantic nature... but I'm not engaged to a soul.
Oh, that's all right.
That's fine.
You're not a woman hater, are you?
Do I look like one?
Oh, no, I just thought I'd ask.
Seeing that there's so much talk about women, pro and con...
Oh, yes, of course.
Now, personally...
I think there's nothing like married life.
Have you been married a long time?
Huh?
I just mean, since I've been around Dottie.
Mrs Wingate, there.
Oh, yes, I understand.
I can see all I miss.
It's just Uncle Joe in the gas station.
You own a home of your own somewheres?
No, I regret to say that I just lease a New York apartment.
They cost plenty, don't they?
Yes, plenty.
Still, I guess with the photography boom money's a small item.
I bet I couldn't begin to guess the amount of money you've made out of photography in, say, the last year.
Are you thinking of taking it up?
Well, if you can make it hand over fist like you're doing.
I mean, if you'd just give me a rough idea...
I haven't made a red cent out of photography. It's just a hobby with me.
Oh, hobby, eh?
Hm-hmm.
Expensive hobby.
Somewhat.
Your real work must be something then.
Say, would it disillusion you terribly to learn that I practice law?
Law?
Now wait a minute, don't take it so much to heart.
I'm liable to make a dollar or two out of this thing...
I think it's wonderful you're a lawyer,
I think it's simply swell.
Then everything's all right.
Say, will you tell me something?
Sure, anything.
Never in all my life have I had such concentrated and flattering interest in my romantic, professional and financial affairs.
What is it that fascinates you so?
Huh?
Well, gosh, it's natural, isn't it?
Considering that I'm sort of practicing law myself.
I mean, practicing practicing.
Oh, then that accounts for the cross-examination.
All the time I've been thinking you were a detective and instead of that you're a great legal mind.
You really think I've got talent?
Genius, positive genius.
Boy, thanks.
Gee.
Well, I guess I oughta be getting back.
Dottie'll be waiting. Dottie's so swell
I wouldn't want her to worry.
That wouldn't do.
Well...
Why don't you come over to dinner and taste her cooking?
Thank you.
Well...
I've never enjoyed meeting anyone so much in all my life.
The pleasure's been mine.
Well...
See you later.
I hope so.
See you later.
Be back about the dinner.
I know. Watch your head there on your way out.
Bye.
Good bye.
Now, where under the sun could we find such a beautiful spot again, Dottie?
Let's stay here.
But you just said you and Pinkie...
After all it's your holiday and one place is as good as another to us.
Except this one is better even.
Well, all right, Buzz.
Gee, I think that guy is swell, don't you, Dottie?
Yes, he's very nice.
I didn't think anyone could be as enthusiastic about his trailer as Daddy was.
And those inventions.
He's a lawyer, too.
Oh, that's what kept you over there so long, huh?
Look, Dottie...
If you invited him over to dinner we could talk over some more...
Hey, for Pete's sakes...
Gosh, he's going.
Hey, you aren't going, are you?
Yep. Good luck to you.
Hope to see you along the road.
Dottie, we gotta get out of here, too, quick.
Buzz, just because he's a lawyer doesn't mean you can pursue the poor man the way you did Mr Fleming.
But he said I was a genius, Dottie.
Dottie, it's a matter of life and death to me.
Listen, Dottie. Please, please...
You'll never regret it.
If it means so much to you, all right.
Shame on you, Billie, you bad boy...
What in the world?
That famous old beaver trapper,
Mister smarty Bill Wingate fell into a beaver trap...
Stop, stop children.
Get those clothes off immediately.
Come on in.
Yeah, hurry, we gotta get started.
I found him!
I tell you, I found him!
Huh? Who, the beaver?
Well, let me tell you, Buzz Mitchell, that beaver is mine.
And if you don't believe me, just wait until you see him.
Everything. He invents things like your father, he's a lawyer and...
Gee, that'll be swell for me.
He said I was a genius and...
Gosh...
I didn't find out if he had any insurance.
Oh, well, I can ask him as soon as we find him.
We've been going for hours and we haven't found him yet.
But I don't care if we never find him.
And what's more, Buss Mitchell,
I think the whole idea is silly.
Pinkie Wingate, I'm fed up.
I wash my hands of the whole affair right here and now.
She can go back and marry Drubbs.
And if I ever here another word on this subject, I...
Pinkie, look!
It's him!
Oh, boy, it's him.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Send him back, Pinkie, or he'll spoil everything.
I wanna go, too.
Billie, why don't you go hunt some beavers?
I'm tired of beavers.
There's a new kind of beaver in these woods.
They got stripes on them.
Striped beavers?
Sure.
They're gonna build a new dam, too.
It's right over there in those woods.
Oh, boy!
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
What's the matter?
Whatever you do, don't shoot now.
Why?
Skunks.
They are not. They're beavers.
Shhh.
Do beavers have stripes on their tails?
Striped ones do.
But there's no such thing as striped beaver.
There is, too. I saw one yesterday.
I'm gonna get my mother a striped beaver coat.
Look, wait a minute now...
You wouldn't want anybody to shoot your mother, would you?
What?
How would you like it if they wanted to make a fur coat out of her?
They couldn't.
I know they couldn't.
Suppose they could, you'd feel pretty bad, wouldn't you?
Now look, you see that skunk there?
That's the little skunk's mother.
The little skunk doesn't want his mother shot any more than you do.
I'm gonna shoot him anyway.
Hold it, wait a minute till I get out of the way.
I got him! I got him!
It was a skunk. It was a skunk.
It smells awful.
Well, it serves you right, you little...
You ruined my photograph and... now you fixed it so I can't get near my camera.
You get that camera.
It smells to high heaven but it can't hurt you any more
Go on, get it, or I'll...
Get that camera.
Both hands, you idiot.
I gotta hold my nose, don't I?
All right, hold your nose.
But stay back there till I tell you what to do. Now, listen, stay there!
Now listen to me. Carry that camera carefully and follow me.
But keep your distance.
Come on, now.
Watch it.
Don't come too close to me.
Easy with that camera, now.
That's right, my mother lives there.
All right, you stay there and I'll get your mother.
But I want my mother.
Hey, don't touch it, you've done enough damage already.
Madam, will you come out here and get this menace.
What?
Oh...
Is he yours?
Billie, what in the world?
Get back! He shot a skunk.
Oh, dear, stay back, Billie, stay back!
Now you stay back, my young lad...
Stop!
There's no need of terrifying him.
Me terrify him, after the mental torture he put me through?
I wasn't going to hurt him, but a good old-fashioned licking would do him a lot of good.
I think you're making a great deal of fuss about a little accident.
Accident?
Well, naturally Billie wouldn't want to hit a skunk.
Will you pardon me if I contradict you?
He insisted on hitting a skunk.
I stood out there after he'd ruined a photograph I spent hours setting up arguing with him, pleading with him, begging him to realize it was a skunk and not a beaver he was shooting at.
I even appealed to his love for his mother.
I'm glad I provided you with so much amusement.
Well!
Gee, I'm glad you're back.
The handle came off and we can't get the water to stop.
I think it's getting flooded in there.
Give me that handle.
Say, I meant to ask you.
Have you got any insurance?
I have not.
But if it's insurance against other people's kids believe me I'm gonna get some.
Now get out of here.
Come on, get out, quick!
I thought you said he was nice.
Go on, hurry up.
I thought you said he was nice.
Well...
I didn't know it would turn out like that.
What's the use of trying.
First you think you have someone, then, plop, you gotta drop it.
I should hope we would.
Buzz...
Skunk.
How can I get him to bury his clothes if I can't even get close to him?
Listen, Buzz.
There comes a time in every man's life when he's got to figure things out for himself.
Oh, Pinkie, that man over there was so funny.
Oh, Dottie, you look beautiful when you laugh.
Beautiful.
The grave's almost ready, Pinkie.
Loosen up on the rope.
Okay, Billie, get them off.
No!
But, Billie, you promised Dottie you'd bury it.
Not my Daniel Boone suit.
Now, listen, Billie, if you don't get those clothes off and bury them this minute
I'll come over and rip them off you.
If you touch him, you'll have to bury your own clothes.
Shhh.
Okay, Buzz.
Come on, Buzz, what's the matter?
Are you scared?
Oh, Billie, please, you can't do anything but bury it.
Yes, I can. I wanna kiss you, Pinkie.
I wanna hug and kiss you.
I love you so much I wanna kiss you.
Keep back!
Stay away, Billie!
Keep back!
Now listen, Billie...
Be reasonable.
You gotta bury it so the smell will go.
It'll still smell in the ground, won't it?
No. On account of the salt in the ground keeps the smell out of it.
There isn't any salt in the ground.
Sure there is.
Pepper, too?
Sure, all kinds of minerals.
Now, come on, Billie, old boy.
Take 'em off. Be a good scout.
I'm not gonna take them off and nobody can make me.
Listen, you want us to bury you in them?
You can't.
Oh, yes we can, if you won't take them off.
Buzz!
Now, look.
The salt will take the smell out of him at the same time, wouldn't it?
All we'd have to do would be to put a lot of old dirt over him and by morning...
I don't wanna be buried!
You can't bury me, you can't...
I got him!
You can't bury it!
You can't bury me either!
You can't bury it!
You can't bury me!
You cant' bury me and I won't bury myself.
We will if you don't bury them.
No!
You've got a choice. You bury them right away or we'll bury you.
Abercrombie, we'd better look into this.
We'll all starve. Even your only sister.
Well, well. You seemed to have struck a bit of an impasse.
Maybe I can help.
We can't make him take it off.
Dottie says we can't come home till he does
'cause it smells so terrible.
It is not. They don't smell bad to me anymore.
For Pete's sakes, do you wanna grow up and smell like that way all your life and have everybody hate you?
Pardon me, you haven't another one of those, have you?
I'm sorry, sir, I haven't.
I don't care, I'm not gonna bury my only Daniel Boone suit.
I bet you Daniel Boone would be surprised to hear you say that.
Why?
Why, he couldn't bury his clothes fast enough when he met a skunk.
Did he meet a skunk, too?
Many times. And he was always the first one in the crowd to take his clothes off.
What crowd?
Oh, hunters and trappers.
Do you know that once several hundred of them all met a skunk at the same time.
And before the rest of them could take their caps off
Boone's whole outfit was off and buried in the ground.
What did he wear home?
Well, he um...
A bathrobe. He always had one handy.
And then he'd jump into a briny salt bath until the last trace was gone.
Oh, he was a smart fellow, Boone.
But he had other suits.
Well, suppose you had another suit.
Suppose I had a suit you could wear?
Your suit wouldn't fit me.
But suppose I had a suit that would fit you.
A Daniel Boone suit?
Oh, a much better suit than that.
A Chief Bald Eagle outfit.
You know, Boone always used to borrow
Bald Eagle's outfit every chance he got so that he could skulk around among the unfriendly Indians in disguise.
Gosh, I'd like to do that.
Then let's see how long it'll take you to get out of those clothes.
Because, you know, Boone could get out of his suit in, oh, a half a minute.
If he could do that, I bet you could get out of yours in a minute at least.
Then we'll go up to the house and have something to eat...
Boy, I bet I can do it in a half a minute, too.
I bet I can do it in a quarter of a minute.
Untie me, untie me...
Oh.
May I come in?
Please do.
I don't know what to say, I...
I wanted to send you some flowers but there's no place around here you can get them.
What?
I mean, blowing up the way I did this afternoon.
Oh, you were perfectly justified.
I shouldn't have laughed.
You should have laughed, anyone should have laughed.
I don't know why I acted that way, really.
It doesn't mean anything and... afterwards I feel like a skunk.
Well, I really do feel like one, so that gives you a rough idea.
Please don't even think about it again.
I think I scared the daylights out of those kids and I probably should apologize to them too.
They're out burying the Daniel Boone suit.
There was quite an argument, but I won.
You have no idea how trying they can be sometimes.
You don't think so?
I guess you have at that.
I can't say that it wasn't a distinct shock when I learned that Daniel Boone belonged to you.
I don't mean that he isn't grand youngster, they're all swell kids, but...
I imagine your husband has a lot of fun with them.
Oh, he did.
Oh...
That oldest boy really has a remarkable mind.
Oh, Buzz is a friend of Pinkie's, but he might as well be mine, too.
He is bright.
Bright is hardly the word.
You know that kid put me through a cross-examination that hasn't been equaled since Darrow.
The little girl is your daughter, isn't she?
Yes, she's a darling.
You have no idea the help she has been to me.
It must be quite a problem bringing up three kiddies all alone.
It is.
Isn't it remarkable the difference there can be in odors?
Mmm. that smells wonderful.
I had to barter a bit for the Boone suit.
They're crazy about strawberry shortcake.
Who isn't? It's my favorite dessert.
You know, I had an aunt once that made strawberry shortcake that just melted in your mouth.
I couldn't wait to get over there for dinner.
You don't get good home cooking these days.
At least I don't.
Would you care to stay for dinner?
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.
What do you think I'm hinting at?
Believe me, if I were in his position,
I'd certainly believe in plenty of insurance.
You're a lad off to Mr Slattery's heart.
He believes in it fervently.
In fact, he's the president of the
United Commercial Fund Insurance Company.
He is?
You mean the one on the calendar?
Gee. Say, is Mr Slattery mar....
Er... it... must be quite a comfort to Mrs Slattery to know that Mr Slattery believes so in insurance.
Perhaps it was.
But Mrs Slattery died several years ago.
She did, boy!
I mean, what a pity...
Not only that, but she's the best cook in Manson.
Why, her strawberry shortcake alone is the talk of the town.
And when she makes potato pancakes, oh...
You know, one time she had a fellow in for dinner and she had made one of those beautiful...
I'm all through, chief. I'm going hunting.
You cleaned your plate, huh?
Okay.
I got him, I got him!
Full of the old nick, eh?
I was just like him when I was a kid myself.
Gee, I'd give a lot for a youngster like him.
Well, I bet Billie would give a lot for a father like you.
Say, Chief, you know, I think I'll have to ask your mother to let me adopt you.
Mrs Wingate?
Yes?
About your children.
The children? What's happened?
Oh, they're quite safe.
Mr Slattery wishes me to inform you...
Mr Slattery?
Yes, the first house off the highway on the left.
He sent me to tell you that the older children have had their dinner and that master Billie has been de-skunked.
Hooray!
Poor man.
He requests as his payment the right to keep them for another hour.
With your permission, of course.
Why, certainly. And will you thank your Mr Slattery for me and tell him I'll come up and get them.
We'll come up and get them, after we've had our dinner.
Very good, sir.
Baking a cake, madam?
Strawberry shortcake.
We'll bring you a piece.
Thank you, sir. I'll await you with great anticipation.
With great anticipation.
Yes, indeed...
My great anticipation is for this dinner.
Come on.
But even Buzz never got away with an entire shortcake in one sitting.
Now, wait a minute. I left one piece.
I think I showed admirable restraint.
Wee, what a rain.
Yeah.
Something you intended having fixed, no doubt.
Oh, I thought I'd mended that.
You better move over here.
That doesn't do any good... here... take my hat.
No, on your head.
Oh.
Oh, boy, what a day.
From skunks to storms to the Wingates.
We have given you a time.
Nonsense, I love it.
This is the kind of a thing I go out to look for.
When business gets too serious,
I lock the office and lie out.
But doesn't your practice suffer?
Let it suffer. I don't.
I've got a theory that the only way to get any fun out of life is to live from day to day.
What are you laughing at?
Nothing, you just remind me of someone, that's all.
Don't you agree with me?
No, I never worry, I...
Hey, what's the matter here?
Sounds though this gas line were plugged.
You couldn't be out of gas?
No, I just filled it up this...
Wait a minute.  Was that yesterday?
Anyway, we don't have to worry,
I've got a special...
Reserve tank you put in yourself?
How did you know that?
You see, I just turn this button and presto, the tank refills.
Funny.
Must be something wrong with that pipe.
It couldn't be possible that the emergency tank is empty, too?
Of course not.
What do you suppose I have it for?
No, there's something wrong with it.
Would you mind getting up for a minute?
It's under the seat.
What do you know about that?
I bet you don't carry insurance either.
No, I don't. I don't believe in it.
What?
Say, does your family sell insurance?
Of course not, why?
Hey, here comes a car.
Hey, we're out of gas.
Wee! Did you get wet?
Wet and I got a mouthful.
Well, that's that.
You wait here and I'll run up the road and see if we can get some help.
I will not.
What else is there to do?
We'll go up and find the good Samaritan that's keeping my children.
In this storm?
Why not? I love it.
Well, I'll eat my hat.
Not till I get through with it.
I guess I won't. You know,
I didn't know there were women like you.
Come on, then, let's go.
Come on, now, skunk in the woods, you aren't afraid of a little thunder.
I want my mother.
I tell you what you do.
Come on, sit on my lap.
He's gonna cram the whole thing.
You got to, Pinkie.
Not here, Buzz.
Oh, go on.
All right.
A chief like you couldn't be afraid of a little thunder, that's foolish...
Mr Slattery...
I know how to take care of him.
All right.
Now, look, Billie, Dottie's gonna be here in a minute.
Sit here.
Did you ever wonder why in thunder, thunder comes in spring.
Once upon a time, it seems, all the world was wrapped in dreams. playful little fellas, so they tell us, said let's have our fling.
Spring is in the air, you know.
It's time to wake 'em up below
So... when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry
They're playing ten-pins in the sky.
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly while rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky.
The world will wear a new bonnet daffodils on it, thanks to the skies above.
Thunder and showers wake up the flowers
Where there are flowers there must be love
So, laugh at raindrops, laugh at thunder, clouds will soon roll by.
They're playing ten-pins in the sky!
Come on.
Wee, I must look a sight.
Well, a bit on the drowned-raft side.
Not an unattractice raft, though.
That's not exactly the loveliest compliment
I ever had, but...
Oh, Mrs Wingate, come in.
Do let me take those wet things.
The children are in there, in the den.
Won't you go right in?
Thank you.
Oh, say. I almost forgot.
Not quite as fresh as it was, but a promise is a promise.
Oh, the strawberry shortcake.
Dottie! Mommy.
Billie, hello baby.
Oh, don't you smell sweet.
Hello, darling.
Well, Mrs Wingate.
Mr Slattery?
I want to thank you so much.
It's a shame you had to have this infliction.
And I'm sorry to be so late.
Oh, not at all. I loved every moment of it.
In fact, I've just been pleading with the chief here to adopt me.
That is, provided you have no objection.
I think that would be lovely.
Well, good evening.
Come in, Mr Wingate.
Mr Thurlow, Mr Slattery.
I'm so sorry. Naturally I thought...
Naturally nobody but a husband would make a lady suffer as I have Mrs Wingate.
Do you know I succeeded in running out of gas in this storm?
Special reserve gas, darlings.
So don't be too hard on her, kitties.
You're both drenched.
I believe I can help you dry out.
Look at her, Buzz...
Who was to know he'd have to come?
Oh... when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry.
They're playing ten-pins in the sky.
Shhh. You'll wake the chief.
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly while rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky.
Come on, darling.
The world will wear a new bonnet
"daffydils" on it, daffydils...
Here we are.
Look what the water did.
Look at the stream. Look.
Atta boy. Watch your step.
How are we gonna get across?
Let's go swimming.
It's all bogged up, so you might have to help the ladies out of there.
Be careful, honey. Don't drop him.
Take it easy.
Hey, wait a minute.
Come on, Billie,
I think you better go to bed, it's awful late.
I can make it.
No, no, I got a better idea than that.
There we are.
You hang on tight.
There we are.
Well, aren't you going to put me down?
I am not, because the minute I do you're gonna vanish into that trailer.
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do with you. I'll make a bargain.
You give me five minutes more of the swellest day of my life and okay.
All right.
It has been a swell day.
You know, I didn't think it was possible.
What?
To find somebody else who thinks the open roads, skies and love of life is the only one to live.
Madam, it's wonderful, it's like walking on stars.
Are you always like this?
Always.
But don't you ever come down to earth?
Never. Why should I?
Well, after all, you must have certain responsibilities.
I haven't any responsibilities, and what's more,
I'm never gonna have any.
Look. My father was a very responsible man.
He worried himself into his grave.
So I made up my mind that I'd always have freedom.
Oh.
Well, it's wonderful if you can live that way.
I really must go.
Did you get Billie to bed, dear?
Yes, mother.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Good night, my princess.
Sweet dreams to you.
Thank you.
I think he's nice, don't you,
Dottie?
When thunder starts to thunder don't run home to cry...
They're playing ten-pins in the sky...
He has a lovely voice, hasn't he?
Little fellas, way up yonder... make the raindrops fly...
Gee, mother...
If we could just go on like we did tonight... it would be just like...
Well, like it used to be.
When you used to laugh all the time.
It would be just like one of the family... well, if it were someone we liked and...
He's putting out his light.
Look, Dottie.
It's time for us to put out ours, dear.
Get into bed.
What a big help you turned out to be last night.
We found the only man in the world that owns an insurance company and likes Billie both and then you go on and encourage that... that Thurlow.
Listen, I can't stand any more of this shilly-shallying.
You've gotta make up your mind right here and now which one she's gonna marry.
She cried last night, Buzz.
What? She couldn't.
Worse than at home and almost all night.
But she was having the time of her life.
There's no reason in the world for her to cry.
Aw, she couldn't.
Buzz, you don't always have to have a reason to cry.
I've cried lots of times just because
I felt funny inside.
Oh, talk sense, Pinkie.
Something happened to make you feel that way, didn't it?
Somebody was mean to you, or you didn't like somebody.
That's all you know.
Lots of times girls cry because they do like somebody.
Cry because they like somebody?
And if you ask me, it sounded like that kind of crying last night.
Oh, what nonsense.
How does that kind of crying sound?
Louder?
It's just different.
You know, I thought she did.
But then, when she cried, I didn't know.
But if that is why, she must love him even more than I thought.
What are you talking about?
Mr Thurlow.
Buzz, if she married him, she'd be happy just like she used to be and...
By God, Pinkie, if that's all the attention you pay to what I think.
I should think you'd have a little more regard for your own mother.
You heard him yourself last night.
He's the most improvident...
Daddy was too, maybe, but she loved him.
Yes, and she doesn't want any more of that kind of love either.
Buzz!
She told me that herself.
For Pete's sakes, Pinkie, you've gotta get it into your head that that kind of thing is all right when you're young and you haven't got any kids on your hands.
Oh...
When you have kids you've gotta be practical.
Now, Mr Slattery, now there is a...
Come in.
Madam, your humble servant.
A little token I ran up myself.
Thank you.
And I'm here to report that Mr Slattery's car is waiting.
Now, I suggest that you bundle off your offspring and we'll follow them in my rescued chariot.
Of course, I don't promise to get you home at all today but I do guarantee you just as much fun as yesterday.
Maybe it wasn't so much fun for you after all, eh?
I'm not going to Mr Slattery's with you.
Oh, come, come. I didn't disgrace you that much.
Maybe I shouldn't have said to him what I did about his insurance company...
We're going back home.
Huh?
No, no.
I don't understand. But why?
I'm just going home, that's all.
You didn't expect me to stay here forever, did you?
No, but wait, last night...
Look, if you think I'm going to let you get away now, you're crazy.
Anyway, you can't pack up like this and go running off without some reason.
But I have a reason.
I'm going to be married.
You?
Oh, no, you mean you're going to go back and settle down and play bridge with banker's wife somewhere?
I'm going to be the banker's wife.
What?
What's so dreadful about that?
It's just what I want.
Oh, I guess it's none of my business, but...
I don't know, you seem the only woman
I ever met that well... free is the only word for it.
Guess I must be crazy.
But I'm not. Look, you can't make me believe that you want to be anything else but free,
I know because you love the same things I do.
All right, supposing I do.
Supposing I do love your up in the clouds, crazy, irresponsible sort of life.
But I hate it, too. I hate it because my children are paying for it.
It's all right for you to talk about being free. You haven't children.
I have and I tell you it's different.
As long as they're dependent on me, all I want is security.
I know, but, my dear, look, if you...
Don't talk, there's nothing to be said.
Just, please go and leave me alone.
Very well.
Dottie.
Oh...
Tell Buzz to pack, Pinkie. We're going home.
And tell Mr Slattery's driver we're sorry.
But, Dottie.
Do you hear me?
Would you please tell Mr Slattery we're very sorry but we've got to go home.
Yes, Miss.
Aw, gee, I don't wanna go home.
Well, you've got to.
Go tell Buzz and help him pack.
All right.
Hey! Hey, wait!
Wait just a minute!
Well, well, Pinkie.
I thought you weren't coming.
We aren't. We're leaving right away.
That's why I had to come.
You see...
I'm glad you did.
Was there anything you wanted?
Well...
Mr Slattery, did you mean what you said last night?
Because if you did... well, you'd need to have somebody to take care of him anyway and I know him better than anybody.
I wouldn't be any bother and... if you could just take me, too
I'd do anything, honestly I would.
Look...
Let's sit down.
I don't think I understand exactly what you're trying to say.
Well...
I mean about Billie.
Hmm.
You remember last night you said you'd give anything if you had him yourself?
Yeah.
Well, I thought if you were going to adopt him, you could...
I mean, if you meant it, you could...
I guess it's all kind of crazy.
I shouldn't have come.
No, no, no, no.
You tell me all about it.
No, I have to go because they'll be waiting for me.
Wait a moment.
Why, darling, you're trembling.
Oh, come on, tell me what's wrong.
I don't know everything, I guess.
You see, I thought if I could explain to Dottie that we'd all be happier if she would be.
And she would.
A person oughta marry somebody they're gonna be happy with, shouldn't they?
Not just somebody because they have children.
She'd never be happy if she went back and married Mr Drubbs.
Look how happy she was last night.
Yeah.
I bet she'd always be happy with
Mr Thurlow.
Even if he doesn't carry insurance, because she doesn't care about those things for herself.
It's only on account of us.
And if we were out of the way.
Somebody's gotta do something before it's too late.
And if we can't...
I just wish I'd never been born.
Oh, shh... now, Pinkie.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Here, darling.
Thank you.
Look, Pinkie...
I've always wanted children.
And I did mean what I said about Billie.
More than that.
I'd give a whole lot to have a daughter like you, but...
Mothers are pretty good, Pinkie.
Your mother loves you both so much more than she could love anyone else.
She'd never be happy without you and Billie.
Why, you're her whole world.
And don't think for one moment it isn't more important to her to keep you all together than... well, than anything.
So, if I were you, darling...
I'd trust her.
She knows what's best.
And no matter where she goes,
I'd go with her.
And help her and try to show her how happy I was.
Hey!
Wait a minute.
Did the Wingates go?
Yeah, they've gone all right.
That's too bad.
Just after that poor little kid came all the way up to see me this morning, too.
Well, it's none of my business, but I can't get her out of my mind.
I came down here to tell her mother some things.
If she isn't mighty careful she'll ruin that child's life thinking she's doing the right thing.
You know... you really can't fool kids.
Say, what are you talking about?
Well, Mrs Wingate is going to marry someone she doesn't love.
Ditching someone she does because the fellow is... well, he's improvident.
And Pinkie... now imagine this...
Pinkie thinks that if I adopt her and Billie it will give her mother one more chance for happiness.
Does the fellow sound like a heel to you or what?
Why, any man who wouldn't, or couldn't, or didn't take care of a woman's kids should be left behind.
Hey, look, wait a minute.
Are you telling me that Mrs Wingate is running away from some fellow she loves?
Did Pinkie tell you that? Did she?
Yes, yes.
Well, I'll be...
Hey, get out of the way, there.
Hurry up!
Well, we got him started, ol' Chief Vinegar Puss.
Oh, now we've got to stop the Wingates.
Let's get to a phone.
Gee.
Gosh!
It's not us.
But, officer, we weren't speeding.
Gosh, Dottie, we weren't even going 30mph.
What's the trouble, officer?
Is this the Wingate trailer?
Yes, I'm Mrs Wingate.
Just a minute. We have a much more serious charge than speeding here.
Gosh.
But, officer, Uncle Joe said that when there's a relation it isn't kidnapping.
That's what your Uncle Joe says.
But, officer, this is ridiculous.
But you just heard him confess, mam.
You can't mean it.
The children only wanted to...
Are these two in on it, too?
No, they kidnapped me, too.
Well, I guess you'll have to tell that to the judge.
You can't mean it.
We didn't want to do anything except get her away from Mr Drubbs.
Listen, we'll get a lawyer, we'll take this...
Hey, wait, we've got a lawyer.
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
You're just in time.
They want to arrest me for kidnapping Dottie.
What?
Say, what's the trouble here, officer?
And who are you?
He's Mr Thurlow, he's my lawyer.
If you're his lawyer, maybe you want to see this.
Well, I'll be...
For the love of...
Gosh.
Think you'd better take them all back and lock them up.
No, I don't think that'll be necessary, officer.
I'll be responsible for them.
That's all, boys.
From now on I'm looking after the Wingate family. Come on, Buzz.
In you go, here. Atta boy, Billie.
Just a moment.
I'll tell you all about it. Listen.
You follow us.
You get in there and get your apron off and get a sweater.
I got you and you got me
Who cares how rough the road may be
We'll go bumpty-bumpty-bumpty-bump on the bumpy road to love.

So, gentlemen, I urge you to deliberate most carefully... before reaching a decision on so vital and momentous a question.
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- Mr. President.
I agree with our eminent professor of metaphysics... and I suggest that we postpone further consideration of this-
- No, no! Definitely no!
- I object!
I must remind Professor Pillsbury... that we cannot procrastinate further.
The press and public await our verdict impatiently.
We must act today.
- Now!
- Right. Right, right, right.
Mr. President.
Mr. President.
After careful and scientific analysis... it is the opinion of the department of mathematics... that Yale University can beat the pants off Michigan.
- [Chuckling]
- I disagree.
Look at what Michigan's team did to Northwestern.
- Ah!
- You still owe me 50 cents from that game.
- I do not, sir! I paid you.
- [Chuckling]
- You never paid me that 50 cents.
- I distinctly remember-
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.
Remember that this great football classic comes on Armistice Day... just one week before we play Harvard... and we dare not risk facing as strong a team as Michigan.
We must find a more desirable opponent.
May I suggest Arkansas Normal?
I'm afraid not.
This game is for charity.
We cannot select too weak an opponent, or no one will come to see it.
- [All Chattering]
- Then how about Nebraska?
- Oh, no!
- Definitely not.
- Well, sir?
- We've decided on the University ofTexas.
- Texas?
- Yes.
Will you see that an invitation is sent and that the newspapers are notified?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Vacate, son.
Texas!
The game won't draw flies unless the players bring their horses.
- Look it up for me, will you, Freddy?
- Look what up?
- The address ofTexas.
- The address ofTexas?
Texas University, you flathead!
Oh.
There's two of'em.
Which one do you want?
"Yale University takes great pleasure in hereby inviting you"-
- What?
- Which one?
Texas University, I told you.
Prairie, Texas.
P-R-A-I-R-I-E.
Grand Central Station!
All out.
Where are the showers?
- Here I come!
- Alley-oop.
- [Giggling]
- Time out for Texas.
Hey! We oughta have the new coach look you over.
- Don't worry. He will.
- Remember, he's married.
And you know what football coaches' wives are like.
I'll say. They think a forward pass is something a girl shouldn't make at a boy.
Hey, Zeb.
Is the Fort Worth train on time?
Maybe. Tell you when she gets in.
Aimin' to go someplace?
No. We're meeting the new football coach.
He's coming all the way from New York.
Boy, we're gonna have a team this year.
We're gonna put T.S.U. on the map!
Looks like it's fixin' to rain.
- We oughta make him cheerleader.
- Yeah.
- Seen anything of Biff Bentley?
- No.
Fine thing if the captain of the team isn't here.
We won't have much of a captain if Sally Saxon doesn't let him alone.
Oh, here's Biff now!
Our captain's tackling awfully high this season.
- The new coach'll fix that.
- Hiya, fellows. Sorry I'm late.
- Flat tire.
- I see you brought it with you.
- Hello.
- Hello, honey. Just talking about you.
And all the time I thought it was your engine knocking, darling.
- Hey, you two will have to cut that out.
- Jealous, Chippy dear?
Remember, Biff's in training.
Biff doesn't need any training.
He's perfect now.
You'll all have to toe the mark this season with the new coach.
- Suits me. As long as he can teach us football.
- He will.
Boy, I sure had a tough time luring him away from Flushing.
- Flushing what?
- Flushing, Long Island, and no wisecracks!
[Whistle Blowing]
Are you packed yet, sweetheart?
Come on.
Stop kidding and step on it.
- What the-
- Oh, excuse me, darling.
Now, listen. Don't pull any of those offside plays on me.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- Sorry?
Not half as sorry as you're going to be for dragging me out here to this forsaken desert!
Flushing was a heaven compared to this.
Are you sure you didn't join the Foreign Legion?
Now, what's wrong with Texas?
Look at that sky, that sand.
You can have it.
I'll take Coney Island.
The wind, the wide-open spaces.
Ahh.
That's wide enough.
You can shut it now.
- Where men are men.
- Yeah, and I'm stuck with you.
And you're stuck with-
Oh, there you go again. Always belittlin'.
Look here, Bessie.
I'm gonna be a big shot down here.
What'll people think of a football coach whose wife is always-
- Go on and finish dressing.
- Look, you can't talk to me like-
- I said, finish dressing!
- Well, that's different. All right, all right.
- [Conductor] Prairie! Next stop, Prairie!
- Come on. Let's hurry.
What we've always needed is a two-fisted coach who could give it and take it.
- [Train Whistle Blows]
- Now, at last, we've got one.
- Here she comes!
- Oh, boy! Come on!
Come on. We're in.
- Hurry up!
- Oh.
[Bell Clanging]
Hey, that must be them.
Here they are, fellas!
Hey, Mr. Winters!
Mr. Winters?
- Mr. Winters?
- Yeah. How'd you guess?
I'm Carson, athletic manager and publicity director for T.S.U.
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Winters.
I suppose this is Mrs. Winters?
Well, if Winters comes, can Mrs. Winters be far behind?
- [Laughing]
- [Chuckles]
May I present Miss Watson, Miss Jones,
Miss Saxon and Tommy Barker?
- This is Biff Bentley, our captain.
- How are ya?
- My name's Winters.
- Oh.
On behalf of the faculty
and student body...
I want to welcome you both to Texas State University.
And we hope that, as coach of the football team... you will bring success and glory to T.S. U... and to yourself.
[Chuckling]
I want to thank you, fellows and girls.
And on behalf of
Mrs. Winters and myself-
- You can leave me out of this.
- You can leave me out-
I want to say... that it's a great deal of pleasure.
- [Engine Chugging, Whistle Blowing]
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- [Chugging Continues]
- [No Audible Dialogue]
For dear old Texas, I thank you.
That's the best speech you've ever made.
- [Laughing]
- Well, the car's right over here, Mr. Winters.
Well, fine. You know,
I'm going to be very happy down here.
- Swell.
- And I think we're gonna have a great season.
You look like first-class material-
a rough and ready bunch of youngsters
who aren't afraid to go in there and fight.
I've started seasons with worse-looking players
and turned them into champions.
With your brawn
and my, uh, experience...
we'll be a tough outfit to beat.
I want to get to know all you fellows personally... and I want you all to know me.
Say, they look pretty thin.
What's the matter? Diet?
Oh, they play a lot better than they look, Mrs. Winters.
- Huh. I hope so.
- Oh, sure. Move over.
You see Biff Bentley there?
Why, he was all-state fullback last year.
He's great. He can pass, kick and run- a real triple-threat man.
Hmm.
Got anybody else that's good?
Well, we will have when Mr. Winters gets through with 'em.
He's gonna do big things here,
Mrs. Winters.
- We've got as much confidence in your husband as you have.
- Yeah-
I hate to talk about myself... but last year in Flushing, where I turned out, as you might have heard...
- one of the greatest, one of the-
- [Clicking]
Just a minute, fellas.
Excuse us, folks.
Pardon us.
- What'd I say now?
- Nothing. It's what you were gonna say.
- Listen, I want you to find out something.
- What?
- When does the next train leave for New York?
- Why?
Why? You're no magician.
The day of miracles is past.
Go home and pack your toothbrush, and let's go back to Flushing.
Wait a minute. Go back there and coach those high school kids again?
Here I've got a chance to coach a college team and get myself a reputation.
Yeah, a reputation that'll keep you out of a job for the rest of your life.
- You can't make a team out of that herd!
- I can't, eh?
Listen, in my dictionary, there's no such a word as "can't."
Brawn isn't the only thing that wins football games. It takes brains.
At last we agree on something.
- Now let's get out of here while we still have the fare.
- Hey, Chip!
- Hey, Chip!
- Yeah, here I am.
Chip, read that.
Whoo!
- What is it, Chip? What is it?
- Yeow! Whoo!
Look, Mr. Winters.
Look!
"Yale University cordially invites
Texas State University to play its football team... on Wednesday, November 11."
[Cheering]
- Say, is this on the level?
- Sure, it is.
Gee, they must've known you were coming down here, Mr. Winters!
- Yeah.
- We'll wire an acceptance right away.
[Cheering]
Wait. Just a minute.
Just a minute, fellas.
Now, Yale's got a pretty heavy team.
I'm no magician. The day of miracles is past.
You can't expect to take a team that-
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "can't"? In our dictionary, there's no such a word as "can't."
Brawn ain't the only thing that wins football games. It takes brains.
Yeah!
Send that wire to Yale.
Tell 'em that I-
That-That-That, uh-
- Tell 'em that we accept.
- [Cheering]
Sparks, you were instructed to invite the University ofTexas... not Texas State University, you confounded idiot.
I'm sorry, sir.
I could withdraw the invitation... and send another to the University ofTexas.
Gentlemen, we can't do that.
That would be an obvious insult.
Professor Pillsbury is right.
- [Murmuring]
- Yes, yes, yes.
I find Texas State hasn't won a game in two years.
A fine opponent for a big charity game.
We'll be the laughingstock of the nation.
Young man, I must ask for your resignation.
Just a minute, Dr. Burke.
May I say a few words?
Three teams have come out of the south... teams that the north never heard of until they played Famous Northern 11 's.
Remember Center of Kentucky when they played Harvard?
Well, publicity made those games interesting, and publicity can do it again.
Why, I know all about this Texas State University team.
- You do?
- Of course.
They're light and fast and play a brand of football we don't see up here.
They're tricky.
They're unorthodox.
They throw that pigskin around like an apple.
Gentlemen, it's David and Goliath- little David from the South, and big Goliath from the North.
Give me a chance, gentlemen.
Give me a chance.
I'll build this game up to the point where everyone will be fighting for tickets.
- It's a natural!
- [Murmuring]
Sparks, I don't think you know a thing about Texas State... and I'd advise you not to try and find out.
But I do like your imagination.
- You go ahead and let it run wild.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
All I can say is, "Watch the sports page of your favorite newspaper!"

Fellows and ladies, this is the biggest day in the history of our alma mater.
From this day on, there's only one thought in the mind of every man and woman at T.S. U... and that is, beat Yale!
[Cheering]
I don't know how we happened to be honored with the invitation to play Yale... but, well, I have my suspicions.
And the man who I think is responsible for the invitation... is the man who is gonna turn that invitation... into the greatest football victory in the history ofTexas.
Do I have to tell you who he is?
You tell me!
Come on, everybody.
Let's have three for Coach Slug Winters!
Coach Slug Winters!
Rah, rah, rah! Coach Slug Winters!

You won't mind if I don't take you home, will you, Laura?
I gotta hurry to town to the newspaper office.
You run right along, dear.
Don't let me interfere with your work.
You know nothin' else could keep me away from you, beautiful.
- You want to know something else?
- What?
- Will you keep it a secret?
- Uh-huh.
- I love you so much it makes me quiver all over.
- [Laughing]
- And I don't care who knows it!

[Slug] Try that number 16 play again.
And no fumbles this time.
[All Shouting]
Twenty-one, 38.
What's the matter with you?
Can't you hold on to the ball?
And who, may I ask, is that big lummox?
That's my brother Elmer.
Well, never mind, honey.
There's one in every family.
I'll have you know Elmer is the best basketball player in this whole state.
We've got a great basketball team.
- Yeah. Haven't lost a game in five years.
- Basketball.
That's a big help.
How's your domino team?
[Whistle Blows]
Say, any more basketball players in that alleged football squad?
Yeah, there's four of'em.
There's Biff Bentley, Connors, Link and Mather.
Uh-huh.
Excuse me!
Hey, Slug! Come here!
Oh! Okay.
Put them through that last play again, Biff.
Come on, fellas.
Get in there. That was terrible.
- Hurry up.
- What do you want now?
Have you read this article, stupid?
Yeah, yeah.
I thought it was very flattering.
Don't you realize there's a sensational idea in what it says?
You've got a lot of great basketball players out there.
Yeah, but I'm trying to teach them to play football.
- You've got to teach them to play basketball-football.
- I know-
- Basketball-football?
- Right!
Oh, listen, honey.
Do you feel all right?
Maybe you'd better go home and lie down for a while. This Texas heat has got you.
Listen, lug, there's nothing wrong with me. It's you!
Here's the answer to all your problems in black and white, and you're too dumb to see it!
- All right. What do you want me to do?
- Practice what they preach.
- Quit talking riddles.
- Look, you've got four great basketball players.
Make them your backfield. They're used to heaving a basketball to each other.
Let them do the same thing with a football.
Say, there may be something to what you say.
There's everything to it!
Use your brain.
Dope out a lot of screwy passing plays.
Let them toss the ball around and run wild.
It's your only chance!
Yeah. Honey, this is the greatest idea you've had since you asked me to marry you.
[Shouting]
Twenty-one, 49.
That's it!
Boy, did you see that play?
Nobody'll stop 'em!
You haven't seen anything yet.
This team will be the talk of the country.
- Yeah, and you'll do all the talking.
- And I'll do all the-
Say, it's new!
Where'd you get the idea, Mr. Winters?
Oh, it's, uh- it's from something
I picked up in Flushing.
Boy! Oh, babe!

Why, the idea of you two kids drinking!
Right here on the campus!
Why, you oughta be ashamed of yourself.

Mmm. Gin.
What do you expect for nothin', champagne?

Yahoo! Whoopee!

Let go.
What's the matter with you?
Aw, is that what you call a tackle?
A fine coach you are!
Listen.
You've been drinking, eh?
What are you doing, trying to ruin me?
Remember, you're my wife.
Aw, why did you have to remind me and spoil my whole evening?
- Now, listen, Bessie. I have a certain-
- [Chip] Mr. Winters.
Professor Barton would like to see you.
- Tell him I'll be right there.
- All right.
Bye, Chippy!
Listen. Now, stay here.
Don't go away. I'll be back and get you.
You run along and don't worry about me.
If your team can hold Yale as well as I can hold my liquor, they-
Shh! Bessie.
[Thumping]
- Hiya, Biffo!
- Hello, Mrs. Winters.
Well, you're just the man
I'm looking for.
You played a great game Saturday, Biff, but I'm sorry, old boy.
- You still don't know how to take a man out.
- No?
No, you're not puttin' enough weight into it.
You're hittin' too high.
- Come here. I'll show you how.
- You, Mrs. Winters?
You heard me.
Come on. Get over here.
Biff, I'm gonna show you how to take a man out and take him out good.
Get down there.
Now you relax and watch me.
Signals!
Twenty-two, 41, 64! Hike!
[Groaning]
- What's the matter?
- My leg! My leg.
- What's the matter?
- [Groaning] My leg. My leg.
Aw, come on.
You're not hurt. Get up!
Oh, I can't. I can't.
Oh, come on!
Be a man!
- It's nothing. Stand up.
- Okay. All right.
There. See?
It's all right. Stand on it.
- That's it.
- [Gasps, Groans]
- Oh! Oh!
- Biff!
Biff!
Slug! Hey, Slug!
- Biff! Aw, come on. Get up, Biff.
- What's the matter, Mrs. Winters?
It's Biff. He's hurt.
Something's happened to him. Slug!
- Hey, Slug! Oh!
- What's the matter?
- How's he doing, boys?
- What happened, Biff?
It's awful this had to happen to Biff.
Maybe it isn't as bad as we think.
- Any news about Biff yet?
- Not a thing.
I'm afraid Bentley won't play any more football this year.
- He has a fractured leg.
- [All Groaning]
That's terrible!
[Murmuring]
Chip.
Don't worry, honey.
Everything's going to be all right.
Aw, come on, honey.
After all, Biff isn't the whole team.
You're wrong, Laura. He is.
Without him, they're a bunch of scrubs.
Oh, so sorry.
My name's Herbert Terwilliger Van Dyck.
Oh? Too bad.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Well, I-I was planning to enroll here.
Could you direct me to the Delta Delta Pi house?
- Oh, are you a Double Delt?
- Sure.
Well, hello!
Glad to know you!
Well, the house is right across the campus, two blocks down.
Too bad you didn't get in sooner.
You missed the football rally.
Football? A capitalistic device for the exploitation of the masses... fostered by the meatpacking barons to promote the sale of pigskin.
- But the time is coming-
- Well, I'll see you around sometime.
Ah. How's Biff?
Is he all right?
Sure, he's all right.
He's fine. He's wonderful.
- Only his leg ain't feeling so good.
- What's the matter with it?
- Not much. Just busted, that's all.
- Bust-
Fine thing. I take my wife to a dance, and she goes around breaking people's legs.
Well, I didn't do it on purpose, did I?
I told you,
I was only showing Biff how to block.
- How did I know that I-
- [Clicking]
Twenty-five men on the squad, and you had to pick on my best player.
Why didn't you break your own leg- or even your neck?
All right!
If that's how you feel about it!
You're darn right that's how I feel about it.
The next time you meddle in my business,
I'm gonna send you back to where you be-
What are you doin'?
- Oh. Now, wait a minute.
- Let me alone. I'm going back home!
Oh, now, listen.
Don't be like that, babe.
You can't leave me alone.
You know I can't get along without you.
- You'll have to!
- But I can't. Honest, honey. Please don't.
Oh, why don't you listen to reason?
We're pals, aren't we?
I need you. Honest, I do.
Well, do you promise not to talk to me like that again?
Sure. I didn't mean it.
You know how it is.
How would you feel if just when you've built up a great team... some stupid, half-witted idiot came along-
Idiot!
That settles it.
- What's the matter?
- You can't call me a half-wit!
For years I've been trying to help you to get to where you are-
- I didn't mean to-
- What do I get for it? You wish I'd break my leg!
- Oh, no, I don't.
- I know! You want to get rid of me!
- I didn't say anything-
- You wish that I were dead!
- Aw, no, honey. I didn't say that.
- [Bawling]
- [Crying] I didn't say that at all.
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Go answer the doorbell.
- All right.
[Crying]
Hello, Chip.
Glad to see you. Come on in.
Aw, come on, Coach. Don't take it so hard.
Accidents will happen.
- Hello, Chip.
- Hello, Mrs. Winters.
Look out.
She might break your arm.
Well, what do you think we oughta do, Coach?
- Maybe we'd better cancel the Yale game.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Listen, Chip. Can't we find someone to take Biff's place?
There's a peach of a player up at Fort Smith who was coming here... but he wanted us to pay him.
Of course, we couldn't do that.
That would be unethical.
- Well, it's been done.
- What are you doing, trying to make more trouble for me?
- You keep out of this.
- I was only suggesting.
- Where are you going?
- To the drugstore. Walk me down, Chip?
- Certainly.
- Can I bring you anything?
Yeah. A ton of aspirin.
- Where you gonna get the headache?
- In my he-
There you go again.
Say, Chip, what's the name of this player you were talking about?
Stanley Russell. Oh, but it's no use.
We can't offer him money.
You don't have to.
You just let me give him a sales talk.
There's no kid that's gonna turn down a chance to play against Yale.
- Where's your car?
- It's laid up.
- Can you borrow one?
- I think I can. Laura has a car.
Then get it and come back here as fast as you can!
Listen, do you want to beat Yale, or don't you?
- I'll be right back.
- Remember, not a word to his nibs in there.
- I get it.
- Hurry!
- This is the place.
- [Laura] I'll wait here.
All right.
Now listen, Chip.
You let me do all the talking. You understand?
- All right.
- Pardon me. Does Mr. Stanley Russell live here?
Is he in?
Well, do you expect him back soon?
Well, is there anybody else home?
Thanks, chatterbox.
We better sit down here and wait.
Hey! Did you ever hear a tune on a harmonica called "A Fox Chase"... with the dogs and everything in it?
A fox hunt-
No, we haven't.
[Playing]
[Whines, Barking]
Here. Here, boy. Here.
[Barking, Whining]
Here, boy, Fido.
Here, Ranger.
[Yipping]
Here, boy. Sing, Fido.
[Grunting, Whining] Hurry, Fido.
[Harmonica Continues]
[Yipping]
Come on, boy.
That's it, boy.
[Yipping]
Here, boy.
[Yipping] Over now.
[Yipping]
Come here.
[Yips]
We've been here two hours and a half.
How much longer do you suppose we have to wait for him?
Whoa. Hey, sonny!
Say, did you ever hear a fella play a harmonica three different ways... and end up playing it with his nose?
With his nose?
["O Susannah"]
[Ends]
Oh, sonny, that was fine, but tell me- haven't you any idea where Stanley is?
- For the love of Mike, where is he?
- He's at Yale.
- Yale?
- Yale?
Sure.
Playin' football.
Footba-Why didn't you tell us this three hours ago?
- You didn't ask me.
- We didn't ask-
[Harmonica]
Oh!
[Rooster Crowing]
Don't mind me.
I'm a heavy sleeper.
[Laughing]
Y'all stop for melons?
Well, no, not exactly, but it's an idea.
- Are they nice and ripe?
- They ain't nothin' else but.
- All right. Give us three.
- All right.
[Rooster Crowing]
Amos!
- Hello!
- Pick three!
All right.
Let 'em come.
[Whistles]
What a heave.
Say, can he do that again?
Sho' 'nuff.
Just keep your peepers on it.
- Who is that?
- That's my brother Amos.
I'm Sairy Dodd, and I can sing.
You want to hear me?
Not right now.
Just about the size of a football.
- Call your brother. I want to talk to him.
- Amos! Come a-runnin'!
[Rooster Crowing]
He can run powerful fast too.
He oughta.
He's got the biggest feet in Craw County.
The bigger the feet, the better the kick.
- Hey, are you thinkin' of-
- Brother, I'm not thinking. I'm praying.
[Sairy]
Don't be scared, Amos.
They're friendly.
- Howdy, folks.
- Glad to meet you, Amos.
- Why?
- How would you like to go to college?
What fer?
I hain't done nothin'.
It's a chance to get an education, and it won't cost you a cent.
- We'll get you a scholarship.
- All that for free?
- Absolutely.
- No foolin'?
Cross my heart.
Aw, shucks.
I got enough book learnin'.
- You hain't neither!
- Shut your mouth before I smack you down.
You could study agriculture, Amos.
What I want with that?
I'm a-gonna be a farmer.
You can meet some nice girls at college.
- Aw, shucks.
- Oh, Amos is scared of girls.
I hain't not!
- I could introduce you to a lot of lovely girls.
- With shoes on?
Sure, and stockings too.
Huh? Oh, gee whiz.
Does this here college place give folks singin' lessons?
Yes, we have a fine department of music.
And they teach hog calling.
Amos, you're a-goin', and I'm a-goin' with.
I aim to learn to sing proper.
- Now, look-a here, Sairy.
- Now, you know how I can sing.
- Do y'all wanna hear me?
- Oh, yes, Sairy, but not now.
Come along now, Amos, so's I can fetch my Sunday dress.
I allow as how you'd better take your shoes along. Don't you think?
- Oh, yes, by all means.
- Come on!
- We'll be right back.
- Oh, please, hurry.
Oh!
- [Horn Honking]
- Hey, Slug!
- Bessie!
- [Honking Continues]
Hey, Slug! Hey! Slug!
- Hey!
- Bessie!
- Slug!
- Come on, Amos. Come on.
Sairy, Laura, come on.
I want you to meet the coach.
- Come on.
- Bessie! Wait a minute.
- Where were you last night?
- Oh, nix on the drama.
Amos, come here.
This is it, Amos. Isn't this a great place?
[Chuckling]
Here, I want you to meet my friend Amos.
Oh, yeah? What do you mean by keeping my wife out all night?
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone crazy?
Give me that football.
Come here, Amos.
- Yeah. Come on, Amos.
- Don't be afraid.
There. Here.
- You see this?
- Uh-huh.
- It's a football.
- Yeah. I've heard tell of them there things.
- Go ahead. Throw it, Amos.
- Yeah. Here.
- T'ain't got much heft to it.
- [Chuckles]
- Where'll I heave it to?
- Oh-
- You see that light down there?
- Uh-huh.
- Throw it at that.
- [Chuckles]
Go ahead.
Throw it.
- What's the matter?
- Aw, shucks.
What's wrong, Amos?
Amos wants to know if'n it's all right... if'n he takes off his shoes.
Tell him he can take off anything he wants.
- Go ahead, Amos.
- I kinda like to feel my toes get a hold of the earth.
That's perfectly all right.
Go ahead.
What's the matter now?
I'm a-scared I'll bust that light.
You do, and I'll eat that football.
Go ahead, Amos.
Show 'em.
Oh, boy! That was swell, Amos!
Shake, that was great!
Well, how will you have your football- on whole wheat or rye?
I'll have it-
Has someone got a ball?
- Here. Try that other light.
- Go ahead, Amos.
Supposin' I bust that one too?
- It's okay. This one's on the house.
- Come on.
Give him a little room, boys.
[Cheering]
- Hey, brother, you're a whiz!
- Aw, 'tweren't nothin'.
- That's a big light.
- [All Laughing]
- I can sing. You wanna hear me?
- [All] Yeah!
Oh, no.
Not now, honey.
We found him in a melon patch playing quarterback for a bunch of cantaloupes.
Boy, if this is a dream, don't wake me.
He's better than Bentley.
- Certainly!
- You know-
Don't you go trying to teach him how to play football.
- Better hurry up and enroll him.
- Enroll him? Holy smoke.
- What's the matter?
- I wonder if he's eligible.
- Oh, sure he's-
- Certainly he-
- What?
- Oh!
What a break.
We finally find the greatest football passer in the country, and he can't get into college.
And this stupe has been here seven years and can't get out.
[Laughing]
- [Laughter]
- What's the matter?
Read this. Brothers and comrades, read these carefully.
A message of vital importance to the collegiate youth of the nation.
- What's this?
- Read it.
Are you fellas socially aggressive?
- [Laughs] He's socially offensive!
- Oh, get outta here!
What are you doing with these?
Spreading the message of intellectual freedom.
- This might get you into trouble.
- We martyrs fear nothing!
- I spent two months in a jail in New Jersey.
- What for?
I crashed a brick through the window of a bank.
The capitalistic faculty at Bradley expelled me.
But I shall carry on here.
Tomorrow, after I've enrolled, my work begins in earnest.
- You haven't enrolled yet?
- No.
- Have you got your credentials?
- Oh, yes.
They're in perfect order.
You bet. Anybody could get in college with credentials like these.
Boys, take good care of Herbie.
T.S.U. needs him.
Brothers, I can't tell you how delighted I am... to find myself among such splendid, intelligent sympathizers in our cause.
[Shouting]
The time has come-
- [Herbie Continues Orating]
- Hello. Is this Judge Fleming?
- Speaking.
- This is Chip Carson.
- Would you settle a little argument we're having here?
- Well, what is it?
Could a fella get 60 days for tossing a brick through the bank window?
Like the big plate glass one on College Street?
That's just exactly what I'd give him- 60 days.
Fine. Thanks, Judge. Thanks very much.
[Chuckles]
Hey, Red, Jimmy! Come here!
Come here, quick.
[Muttering]
Listen, fellas, all we gotta do is-
Read these carefully, boys.
We are the rising generation of mental giants... who will loose the ties that bind us... as sure as my name is
H. Terwilliger Van Dyck.
Wait a minute.
What did you say your name is?
H. Terwilliger Van Dyck.
- Can you prove it?
- Sure, he can. Show him your credentials.
Take a look at those.
H. Terwilliger Van Dyck?
[Together]
H. Terwilliger Van Dyck?
Why, that name sounds vaguely familiar.
- Ah!
- Ah!
- Ah!
- Ah!
[All Singing]
[Ends]
[All Cheering]
Hey!
Here's the brick!
- Where's the bank?
- In case you're arrested, your name is John Smith.
Right! And tonight,
John Smith makes history!
- [All Cheering]
- On to the bank!
Call the police!
[Laughing]
What's the big idea?
I do this as a protest of the collegiate youth against the tyranny-
Tell it to the judge!
I reiterate, I do this as a protest of the collegiate youth of the United States against-
- Sairy!
- Amos!
Well, I wouldn't have knowed ya... if I hadn't have known who you was.
Me nuther.
Where'd you get all them store-boughten clothes, Sairy?
- Laura give 'em to me.
- She did?
- She's awful nice, Amos.
- Shh.
My name hain't Amos.
- 'Tis too.
- 'Tain't nuther. Not no more.
Then what is it?
Herbert- Herbert, um-
Um, what does it say there?
Chip wrote it down for me.
[Sairy]
Herbert Van "Dick."
Dyck. Dyck. That's it.
Herbert Van Dyck.
Well, call my hogs!
Ain't that a name!
Where'd you get it?
Chip give it to me for to play this here football with.
Then my name's gotta be
Van Dyck too, hain't it?
Mm-hmm.
I reckon so.
Come on.
Van Dyck.
Gotta get me a high-tone front handle for that.
- I got it!
- Huh?
- Murine!
- Murine?
Well, that's right fancy.
Where'd you get that?
- Off'n a bottle.

- Hiya, Van. What's up?
- Hello, Van. How ya doing?
- Hiya, Van Dyck!
Hello.
- Hello, Van Dyck.
- Hello.
Hello.
[Continues]
Look!
So that's what kept him out last night.
The little devil.
She must be rooting for Yale.
Get a load of that.
- When she gets through with him, they'll have to plow him under.
- You're not kidding.
Hello.
[Chuckles]
- What's the matter?
- He's cutting in. I'll have to dance with him.
- With both of us?
- No.
We'll dance around, and you cut in on us. See?
Oh.
Aw, shucks.
I thought you didn't want to go to this dance.
- I changed my mind.
- Don't kid me.
You've fallen for that hillbilly just 'cause he got his picture in the papers.
Oh, have I?
Guess I'd better take this back to the jewelers.
- For me?
- It was.
Oh, Morty, darling.
[Ends]
- Hiya, big boy.
- Having a nice time?
Well, I was, but I'm a-gettin' kinda tired.
- I reckon I'll go on home.
- Where's Sally?
Oh, I don't know.
Go get him.
- Oh, Mr. Van Dyck.
- Huh?
- You haven't danced with me yet.
- Well, gosh, I don't feel much like dancin' no more.
[Man]
Where's Tommy? We want the Balboa!
- Come on! The Balboa!
- [Cheering, Shouting]
- All right!
- Balboa! We want the Balboa!
Okay! The Balboa!
Come on.
They're gonna do the Balboa.
Oh, I can't do no newfangled dancin'.
Oh, come on.
It's easy.

- Why, Amos, what's the matter?
- I'm a-goin' home.
- Why, you can't do that, Amos.
- Yes, I can.
Folks like me and Sairy don't belong here nohow.
I'm a-waitin' for her now.
Soon as she gets here, we're trackin' back home.
Look, Amos, you wouldn't throw us down like this, would you, old man?
Everybody's depending on you.
Why, we can't get along without you, Amos.
Oh, I reckon some folks around here can get along without me.
Who?
What do you mean?
I'd rather not say.
It's- It's kinda personal.
Why, it isn't Sally, is it?
Well, I hain't sayin' it 'tis, and I hain't sayin' it 'tain't.
Amos, why, that little flirt is nothing but an ordinary-
You shut your mouth, Chip!
You can't talk that-a-way about the gal I love.
Now you be gettin' on outta here.
Amos, I didn't mean that-
I said, you git!
[Water Running]
- Hi, Chip.
- Hi.
- [Doorbell Ringing]
- Come in!
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Winters.
- Hiya.
- Is the coach in?
- Why, yes.
Oh, hello, Chip.
Bad news, Coach.
Amos is going home.
[Chuckling]
I thought you s-
- What?
- Don't break up house yet!
- Why is he leaving?
- On account of Sally. She gave him the air.
- Can't you make her listen to reason?
- She won't budge.
- And she knows who Amos is and threatens to spill the beans.
- There goes Yale.
It's a jinx.
I give up.
We can't give up.
You city people don't realize what this Yale game means to our little college.
It's more than just a football game.
It's our chance to show the country that a college doesn't have to be big to be good.
This isn't only T.S.U. 's fight.
We're fighting for all the small colleges... that haven't got thousands of students and millions of dollars... but are just as good as your Yales and Harvards and Princetons.
They're all watching us and pulling for us.
We can't let them down.
We gotta win!
I'm with you, son.
Nobody's quitting now, not after that speech.
It's a lucky thing for him you're not selling pianos.
Come on, stupid, think of something.
- We've gotta keep Amos here.
- How? By breaking his leg?
Darn little flirt.
She even flirted with you at the dance.
Yeah, but I didn't flirt back.
- But you will. That's it! I've got it!
- What do you mean?
- You're gonna take Sally out and make love to her.
- I'm-
- Who, me? What for?
- Leave that to me. You just make love to her.
But I can't do that.
- Besides, I'm out of practice.
- You're telling me.
Well, what's your idea, Mrs. Winters?
Stick around and you'll learn something they don't teach in college.
Gee, I never won a football game this way before.
Aw, Bessie, honest,
I don't wanna do this.
- You'll do it and like it.
- All right.
[Humming]
- What's Sally's address?
- She lives on Bird Street.
I think the number is 1216.
It's 1218.
Sairy!
Sairy!
Murine!
[Singing]
We'll give him a little time.
Not too much.
[Singing Continues]
[Ends]
[Chuckles]
Sweetheart! Darling!
- My, but you work fast.
- Well, I'm in a hurry.
I-I mean, I'm kind of a busy man.
You know, I've never been out with a coach before.
Neither have I.
I-I mean, uh-
[Chuckles]
He's really enjoying it, the rat.
My wife's all right... but she just doesn't understand me.
I wondered how a good-looking man like you... could be stuck with a crow like her.
- Yeah, me too.
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
Bessie- I-I mean, Sally, you're wonderful.
You do something to me.
This thing has gone far enough.
- [Gasps, Whimpers]
- [Groans]
What is it?
- So I've got you at last!
- Wait a minute, honey. I can explain everything.
Oh, yeah?
Well, explain this!
[Screams]
You'll hear from my lawyer. I'm going to sue him for divorce and name you as correspondent.
Oh, no, no, you can't. I've never been out with him before. Honest.
We haven't done anything wrong.
- You're my witnesses!
- Oh, please! Please!
I swear your husband doesn't mean a thing to me.
I'm in love with somebody else.
- Who? The 7 th Regiment?
- Uh-uh.
Herbert Van Dyck, for instance?
Yes! Yes! Everybody knows we're practically engaged.
Is she lying about this?
She's been going out with him.
[Amos]
Sairy! Sairy!
Sairy!
That's him now!
Sounds like he's calling hogs.
Must be paging you.
Go on. But if I find out you're not engaged to him,
I'll file my divorce papers in the morning.
Well, that's that.
Come on. Let's go.
Wait a minute, Mrs. Winters.
Haven't you forgotten something?
[Groaning]
Oh!
[Groans]
- Here.
- [Groaning Continues]
There.
You didn't have to sock me so hard, did you?
Imagine what I'll do if
I ever really catch you. Come on.
- [Band: March]
- [Cheering]
- What do you mean, we can't sleep six in an upper berth?
- [Cheering]
Have you got your baggage, dear?
- Yeah, Ma. Here it is.
- [Hooting, Laughing]
Come on, gang!
Let's get going!
[Ends]
[Cheering Continues]
Promise, darling, when you're not with me that you won't flirt with any other girls.
Say, where do we eat on this here train?
Come on.
Let's go this way.
Isn't it exciting?
The whole town's here to see us off.
I only hope they're all here when we come back.
Statement for the press,
Mr. Winters?
Why, uh, yes.
Uh, you can quote me as saying:
As Coach Winters boarded the train for New Haven, he said... my players are in fine physical and mental condition... and will fight to the last man for Texas.
And on the eve of battle...
I feel very confident of victory.
- But if we should lose, I-
- [Clicking]
We will have no alibi.
Come on.
- [Cheering, Shouting]
- [Train Whistle Blows]
All aboard! All aboard!
Hey, General, have we got time just for one song?
- I guess so.
- Swell! Come on!
- Oh, no, no.
- Not right now!
No, we've written a special song... but we're saving it for the big game.
- Aw, come on!
- Mr. Chip, I got a song. Can I sing it?
- Would it make you happy, honey?
- It sure would.
Then you sing it!
Come on!
Hey, let's go!
Okay, fellas, hit it.
[Band]
[Singing]
[Ends]
[Whistle Blows]
[Band: March]
[Ends]
I reckon none of you
Northern folks ever heard... a Texas cowhand makin' love to his gal.
Well, you're gonna hear it now.
[Singing]
[Ends]
[Crowd Cheering, Applauding]
All right, Sam.
You're on.
A good good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Sam Hays, bringing you a play-by-play account of the gridiron classic... between Yale and Texas State.
I'm looking down on a colorful and certainly a capacity crowd... gathered here to see the little team from Prairie... fight it out with the Yale Bulldogs.
While the weatherman says it's fair and warmer... it feels to me like it's freezing and getting ready to snow.
But maybe I'm just thin-blooded.
The Yale team has come onto the field- or should I say, the four Yale teams.
They're running through their signals.
Those boys look a little too tough for these Texas lads to handle.
- [Cheering, Applause]
- Here come the Texas boys back onto the field again.
[Cheering Continues]
Texas are in crimson jerseys with white sleeve bands, wearing white bordered head guards.
They don't look very big, but they make up for their lack of weight with terrific speed.
- Sure is mighty chilly up here all of the sudden.
- I'll say it is.
'Tain't like down home.
It's snowing!
Yeah, and it isn't gonna help us any.
My, it's cold.
I'm freezing.
Well, snow or no, here we go.
Let the best team win.
Well, it's started to snow, but nobody around here seems to care.
Yale has won the toss and is going to kick off.
They're lining up in their positions now.
Van Dyck, the Texas pass wizard, isn't in the starting lineup.
- Is he in there, Jerry, or isn't he?
- No.
No, friends, he isn't. But you can bet Coach
Winters will send him in at the first opportunity.
[Whistle Blows]
[Cheering Continues]
[Whistle Blows]
[Whistle Blows]
Did we gain anything?
About a yard.
That Yale line's pretty heavy.
- Snow's getting heavy too.
- Yeah.
[Whistle Blowing]
I should have worn a heavy coat.
We're going to kick!
[Cheering Continues]
[Whistle Blows]
Yale has the ball. First down and 10 to go.
We'll see what they're going to do.
[Cheering Continues]
[Whistle Blows]
Five minutes left in this nip-and-tuck quarter... with those fighting Texans more than holding their own.
Yale has the ball.
Third down and four to go.
And, ladies and gentlemen, it's really snowing a snowstorm.
Looks like Yale's going to kick.
They're in punt formation- long punt formation. Cooper back.
Block that kick! Block that kick!
Block that kick!
Block that kick!
[Cheering Continues]
[Whistle Blows]
Texas ball!
Here you go, Herbie.
Go in for Prescott and heave that apple.
I'm a-just a-rarin' to heave, Coach.
Oh. Remember, don't talk on the first play.
- It's Herbie!
- Oh, boy! Now we goin' places!
Van Dyck for Prescott.
Watch closely, young man, and you'll see how we play football in the great open spaces.
You can watch too.
[Whistle Blows]
Pretty snappy!
That goes for me too.
[Whistle Blows]
[Murmuring]
Can't you stop them fellas from bustin' through on me?
We'll stop 'em this time, and it'll be a number 38 for a touchdown.
Now, come on, gang!
Give it to 'em!
[Cheering Continues]
[Gunfire]
That wasn't bad either, was it, sonny?
That's the way they play football down in Texas. And very good too.
Van Dyck faded back, tossed a cannon pass to
Mather, and boy, how this Van Dyck can throw 'em.
Mather snagged it, tossed a lateral to Connors... who ran across the goal line standing up for a touchdown.
They're lining up for the extra point.
[Cheering Continues]
- He missed it.
- Aw, who cares? We've just started scoring.
It's a great game, isn't it?
Yeah.
- [Gunshot]
- There goes the gun, ending the first half... of this terrifically exciting gridiron battle.
The score:
Texas, 6, Yale, nothing... providing one of the biggest upsets of this season.
The Texans, who weren't given a chance, have played magnificently.
In the second quarter, the weather slowed down their passing attack considerably.
Did I mention that our snowstorm has turned into a blizzard?
But defensively, their work was smart and stubborn.
If Yale doesn't play heads-up football this last half, those six points'll beat 'em.
What's the matter with you boys anyway?
That whole Texas outfit don't weigh four pounds more than a straw hat... and they're making monkeys out of ya!
You lose this game, and you'll be the laughingstock of the country.
[Band: March]
And you, Sparks-
I thought you were making up all that stuff about their passing.
- Can I help it if they believe everything they read?
- Oh, you-
[Continues]
[Ends]
Now, folks, four of our boys will sing a song written especially for this occasion.
- Would you like to hear it?
- [Cheering Continues]
We can't sing that song here.
It don't fit. We didn't expect this.
Listen to me, fellas.
You can't embarrass me in front of all these people.
Now, sing it and sing it good.
- But, Tom-
- Go on!
[Band]
[Singing]
[Ends]
[Crowd Cheering, Laughing]
It's great, boys, it's great!
You got those Yale guys dizzy!
Keep it up!
Don't let it down!
Herbie, you were terrific.
Just slightly, boss.
Come on, fellas. Up and at 'em. And remember, a game isn't won until the final gun is fired.
Come on now!
They're lining up for the second half kickoff on a field completely snowed under.
- [Whistle Blows]
- Yale will kick off to Texas. There's the whistle.
[Cheering Continues]
[Whistle Blows]
[Whistle Blows]
[Whistle Blows]
What's the matter with you guys?
They're stopping us cold.
- We can't run in this stuff.
Let's try another pass.
- It's 47 this time.
- The ball's gettin'-
- I know. It's getting slippery.
Come on.
Up and at 'em.
Giddyap!
[Crowd Cheering, Gasping]
[Whistle Blows]
He can't hold that ball.
It's too slippery.
That's the third time he's fumbled.
Forrest, come here.
Go in for Van Dyck.
[Crowd Chanting]
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Forrest for Van Dyck!
Out!
[Cheering Continues]
- Say, can you get this down to the Texas coach?
- But, lady, I-
It's very important.
I'm his wife.
Thanks, fella.
Van Dyck is out of the game, which means that Texas has given up the offensive... and is going to try to protect that six-point lead.
Yale's ball.
[Whistle Blows]
Well, friends, this is certainly one for the book.
It's fourth quarter, and the Yale team hasn't been able to reach the Texas goal line.
The score is still: Texas 6, Yale nothing.
And Yale has the ball.
[Whistle Blowing]
[Horn Blares]
Piling on- 15 yards.
Uh-oh, that hurts.
Texas is penalized 15 yards for piling on.
It puts Yale right down there within scoring distance.
And if they're ever going to score, now's the time.
Hey, you! Come here!
What's the big idea, you robber?
One more crack like that, and I'll penalize you another 15 yards.
Where do you think you are anyway, in Texas?
Ah, you silly-
Can I trouble you again to take this down to him? It's very important.
Thanks.
[Grumbling]
The big blue team is ripping its way toward the Texas goal line, and Texas can't stop 'em.
[Cheering Continues]
[Whistle Blows]
[Whistle Blows]
They've put up a great fight, those kids from cow country, as gallant as I've ever seen.
But they're in a tough spot now.
And here comes the big moment.
The score is tied, 6-6.
Yale is lining up in front of those goal posts... and Evans is going to try to put that slippery pigskin between those uprights... for that one little point that Yale needs to win.
The ball is snapped!
He made it, and Yale leads Texas 7-6.
- Going to be a cold winter in Texas.
- We still got a chance.
What we really need is snowshoes.
My nerves are all in tatters.
Only enough time left for a couple plays.
Yale is praying for the final gun, but it's fourth down and they've got to kick.
They're back to punt formation.
[Crowd Chanting]
Block that kick! Block that kick!
[Cheering Continues]
[Whistle Blows]
Texas recovered that blocked kick!
This ball game isn't over yet!
Hooray!
We still got a chance!
Patterson!
Go in there and tell 'em to run a play over their left guard! Go ahead!
We've still got a chance!
[Horn Blares]
Flagrant, unsportsmanlike conduct from the Texas bench.
Fifteen yards.
- It's a penalty.
- Against us?
Five yards!
- Ten!
- Fifteen yards!
- What for?
- How do I know?
Maybe it's my poor spelling.
Isn't that awful?
The Texas team is penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct... from the Texas bench.
And that looks like it's about the end of your old ball game.
We haven't got a chance!
We haven't got a chance!
- You haven't got a brain either.
- I haven't got a brai-
- What are you doing here?
- Suffering while you're throwing the game away.
Will you keep out of this!
Watson.
- [Groans]
- What's the matter? Every time-
Ah!
Yea!
Now we've got a chance!
Herbie!
Out of the way, boys.
Herbie!
Come here!
- Yes, ma'am?
- Oh, Herbie, listen, and listen carefully.
I want you to go out there and-
- Here. You got it? Get going! Hurry!
- Yes'm.
[Horn Blares]
They've sent Van Dyck back in. I think he's going to try a desperate, last-minute pass.
Wait a minute.
What's this?
Van Dyck sitting down in the mud.
Do my eyes deceive me?
No, sir. He's taking off his shoes and stockings.
It's a sight you may never see again.
The stories about him must be true- he likes to feel his toes grip the earth.
He's getting ready to put everything he has into one long pass.
The timekeeper has his gun ready to end the game. Van Dyck's getting up now.
- Pass! Pass!
- I got him!
[Cheering Continues]
Van Dyck scores!
It's a touchdown! Touchdown!
- [Gunshot]
- [Gunfire]
[Screams]
Slug! Slug!
Wake up, Slug!
- [Muttering]
- Oh, come on! Snap out of it!
[Muttering]
Let's get in there, Coach.
Aw, cut it out! It's all over!
Slug, we won!
Oh, I-What?
- Yeah! We won! We beat 'em, Slug!
- We won?
- Whoo-hoo-
- Yeah! Whoo!
Hey!
[Chorus Singing]
[Singing Continues]
And then we'll score a touchdown
[Singing Continues]
[Singing Continues]
- [Ends]
- [Cheering]
Taking off at 9.10.
All clear, George.
Watch for the light.
Glendale calling NC95W.
Go ahead.
NC95W answering Glendale.
I'll be in in about five minutes.
How'd you make out, Loop?
Did you get your passenger there on time?
I got him there just in time to see his wife.
Have you seen Shirley around anywheres?
No, not yet, but she'll be here.
She always is when you come in.
Where are you goin'?
I'm going to the airport.
ZJump in.
I'll give you a lift.
Thanks, mister, but I'll have to get a faster car.
I'm in a hurry.
You're the most particular hitchhiker I ever saw.
Well, thanks, anyway.
Hello, Shirley.
Goin' to the airport?
Yes, thank you.
Come on, hop in.
That-a girl.
Hello, Loop.
I bet you wish you were up there with him.
I will be someday.
Contact.
Contact.
Ha ha ha!
Come on.
Contact. Ha ha!
Hiya, Loop.
Hiya, Bill. Check the oil when you gas it.
Yowzuh.
Come on, honey.
Up you come.
There.
Hello, Shirley.
- Hello, honey. How was it, Loop?
- Hello,Jack.
A little bumpy over the hills.
Are you off again?
Sure. I'll be eating my Christmas dinner... in New York tomorrow.
Well, Merry Christmas, Shirley.
Merry Christmas and lots of tailwind.
- Ha ha ha! Thanks.
- So long.
You wait here, honey.
I'll be right back.
- Hiya, Tony.
- Good morning, sir.
Hello, fellas.
- Tony.
- Yes, missy?
You didn't dust my daddy's picture.
Here, missy.
You givin' your daddy a clean face?
Yes. Don't you think he needs it?
I think you do, too.
Here. Wet.
There you are, young lady. Come on.
My daddy could fly better... than anybody in the world, couldn't he?
That's right- better than anybody in the whole world.
You know, your daddy and I were pals... ever since we were about as big as you are.
He was my best friend.
That's why I'm your godfather.
And then one day, he cracked up... and went away to heaven, didn't he?
That's right.
I'll bet when I'm a flyer,
I won't crack up.
When you're ready to be a flyer... we're gonna buy you a great big noncrackable ship.
Say, that reminds me.
I found an old scrapbook... the other day with some pictures of your daddy and me in it.
- Would you like to see it?
- Oh, yes!
I'll get it.
- Hi, Harry. Grab some of these, will you?
- Sure.
Hello, honey.
Hello, little boy.
I'm not a little boy.
I'm a little girl.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Well, I just didn't want to take any chances.
Now, that's mistletoe.
And when you hold it... over anybody's head, you can kiss them.
Beat it, you chiseler.
OK, kid.
Move over.
There's your daddy on the day... he broke the transcontinental record.
And there's your daddy and me when we first got our wings.
We'll skip that.
Wait a minute.
There ought to be... another one in here someplace.
Who's that?
A girl I used to know.
She's a pretty lady.
I used to think so.
But it's not enough to be pretty here.
You've got to be pretty in here, too.
How can you be pretty in there?
By thinking the right thoughts... and doing the right things... and eating plenty of spinach. Ha ha ha!
Say, we better call up your mother... before she starts to worry about you.
She won't worry as long as I'm with you.
Fledrich 4230.
Good heavens.
Will no one answer the phone?
Hello.
May I please speak to Mrs. Blake?
Mary.
Mary.
Yes, ma'am?
The telephone- for you.
Thank you.
Hello?
This is Loop.
I just wanted you to know that Shirley's with me.
Hello, Mother.
I'll have one of the boys drive her home later.
All right, Loop.
Thanks.
Mary.
Yes, ma'am?
I don't approve of all these telephone calls.
I'm sorry.
And I don't approve of all these aviators... who keep coming here to see your little girl.
She's sort of a pet with them.
They all knew her father.
I know that, but I really can't have it.
You know it isn't everyone who'd engage a maid... with a small child.
I have no fault to find with your work... but if you want to stay on with us... you'll have to correct these things.
Yes, ma'am, I will.
Very well.
I told you when you engaged her... that it wouldn't work out.
Well, she was so pathetic about wanting a nice home... for her little girl... that I let my sympathy get the better of my judgment.
I'll let her go right after the holidays.
Hmm. Fine.
Ah. Through with the upstairs already?
Yes.
What's wrong, dearie?
Mrs. Smythe doesn't want me to have any more telephone calls.
She don't? Well, well, now, ain't that too bad.
Ha! Her and her highfalutin ways... and him that finicky.
They both give me a pain.
Tut tut, Elizabeth.
I shall not stand here... and listen to you defame our employers.
What?
Besides, I have to go down to the post office.
Ha ha ha!
Don't forget to pick up those things.
What things, my love?
Don't you remember?
The things I told you to get?
Oh, you fool, you.
The sewin' kit I told you to get for Shirley.
Oh, right.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
I guess it won't matter if you know.
ZJust a bit of a Christmas gift.
You're awfully kind.
Aw, go on.
I bought a few things for her.
Not very much, of course.
It was different when her father was alive.
Oh, yes, the poor young fellow.
Well, it must be a comfort to know... you're doin' the best you can for the little one.
She's a sweet child.
Not like that young one of theirs.
There's a brat if ever one lived.
Now, darling, don't get yourself all excited.
Child: I don't care! No! No!
No! No! No!
Darling, you must practice your piano lesson.
You won't have to practice again... until after Santa Claus has been here.
There ain't any Santa Claus!
Don't say "ain't," darling. Say "isn't. "
Ain't! Ain't! Ain't!
What's all this noise about?
Mother wants me to practice, and I don't wanna!
You must do as Mama says, dear.
Well, I ain't gonna!
Now, look here, young woman-
Remember what the psychoanalyst said-
The child mind must never be coerced.
One must use persuasion and reason.
Now, darling... practice your lesson, and mama will buy you something nice.
What?
- Anything you like.
- Anything?
Yes, dear. What would you especially like?
A machine gun!
Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!
Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!
Rat-a-tat!
That's a good girl.
Hey! Is there anybody at all in this confounded house?
Hey! Somebody! Anybody!
Come and help me downstairs!
Hey!
So you think you're gonna make me stay up here today, do you?
Well, I'll show you.
Oh!
Doggone it!
Why, Uncle Ned!
Why didn't you call us?
Call you?
I yelled, and I shouted and bellowed.
A fat lot of good it did me.
No one pays any attention to me.
No one cares what happens to me.
All you do is think of yourselves.
Oh, Uncle Ned, you know that isn't so.
Mary.
Yes, Mr. Smythe?
My name is Smith!
His name is Smythe.
Yes, Mr. Smith.
Didn't you hear me holler a little while ago?
No, sir, I didn't.
Folks around here had better get their ears fixed.
That's all, Mary.
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
? 1 and 2 and 3 and...
1 and 2 and-?
Stop it!
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
Is that all you know?
Mama! Mama!
Mama. Mama.
It's a good thing
I'm not your mama.
Why, it's enough to drive a man crazy.
Things better be a little different around here... or you're gonna see the last of me.
And another thing-
You stop telling people...
I made my money in sanitary engineering.
It was sewers!
Sewers! And don't you forget it!
And, oh...
How much longer must I stand this?
Now, now, dear. Be calm.
That horrid man.
He's just impossible.
Yes, I know he's trying, but after all... we can afford to be patient.
It will pay us in the end.
Any money he leaves us we'll have earned.
Yes, that's true... but with my business in such condition... we'd better keep on humoring him.
And, Mama, every time he sees me, he makes a face.
Never mind, darling.
Well, I must be getting down to the office.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye, darling.
Never you mind, darling.
Don't you let him worry you.
Sit up.
Sit up.
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Miss Blake's car is ready, sir.
Very good, Meadows.
The royal chariot awaits, madam.
Come on.
Ha ha ha!
Bye, Ray.
I'll see you later.
Bye, honey. Bye.
Hello, Harry.
Hello, Shirley.
Hi, Shirley.
Hi.
Hello there.
Mr. Higgins?
Yes, madam?
See that?
That's mistletoe.
Thank you, madam.
- Mother.
- Yes, darling?
May I help you with the dishes?
No, honey, but I tell you what you can do.
Take this down to the incinerator... and leave it there.
All right.
Higgins, what's that on your face?
My face, madam?
Yes.
It appears to be chocolate, madam.
Look out for the police car!
Here comes the police car!
Everybody, get out of the way!
Everybody, get out of the way!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Why, you poor little thing.
You must have cracked up.
You should be in the hospital.
Hey, that's my doll.
Well, I just found her here.
You can't have her.
You bad old thing.
You ran away from home... and I'm gonna spank you.
If you give her to me...
I'll take care of her.
I'll wash her face... and make her some clothes and everything.
You can't have her!
You wanna know why?
Because I'm gonna kill her.
? Happy, happy, happy days?
? Happy days, happy days?
? Happy days, happy days?
? Happy days, happy-?
Hey, what are you gonna get for Christmas?
I'm gonna get a doll house with real furniture... and a little piano and a tennis racket... and a great big doll.
I asked Santy Claus to bring me a doll.
Santa Claus? Pooh!
There ain't any Santa Claus.
- There is, too.
- There is not!
There is not, because my psychoanalyst told me.
There ain't any Santa Claus.
There ain't any fairies or giants or anything like that.
I'll bet you'd feel bad... if you woke up tomorrow morning... and you didn't have any presents.
Well, I won't.
You want to know why?
'Cause I already peeked in the closet and saw 'em.
I don't care what you saw.
There is a Santy Claus.
There ain't!
Mr. Smith?
Huh?
There is a Santy Claus, isn't there?
What did she say?
She says there isn't.
Then there is.
You think you're smart, don't you?
Well, I'll show you!
You'll what?
You'll...
Aarrrgh!
Get outta here!
Go on!
Get out of here!
Go on! Get outta here!
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Shirley.
Shirley, where are you?
Here I am.
Oh, well, my goodness.
We got rid of her, all right.
Thanks, Mr. Smith.
Oh, that's all right.
I like you.
You're the only one around here that does.
They don't like me... and listen,
I don't like them, either.
I made the arrangements... and everything's all set for tomorrow.
It's wonderful of you and the boys... to give Shirley her Christmas party.
Oh, we're getting a big kick out of it ourselves.
She'll be so surprised.
She doesn't expect much, you know.
Now, get her down to the airport... as early in the morning as you can.
I may not be able to come with her... but I'll be down just as soon as I can get away.
That'll be fine.
Hello, Mr. Merritt.
Merry Christmas.
The same to you.
I'm just after making myself a cup of tea.
- Will you have one?
- Sure.
Ah, fine.
Hello, Loop.
Hiya, honey.
All ready for Christmas?
I've been ready for a long time.
Hello, Loop.
Hiya, Thomas.
All ready!
Come on.
Yes, dear, I think Friday will be all right.
That will be fine.
Very well. We'll make it definite, then.
Thank you so much for inviting us.
Good-bye, dear.
This is good cake.
It ought to be.
I whipped it up myself.
How are you,
Mr. Merritt?
The compliments of the season to you.
Same to you,
Mr. Higgins.
The cup that cheers but not inebriates.
Ha ha ha!
Wow! That's hot.
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Higgins.
Yes, madam?
My cousin's arriving from New York tomorrow... and I want you to be sure... that everything is done just right.
Yes, madam.
- Thomas, you will meet the plane in the morning.
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm very anxious to show her that we can do things... exactly as well out here as they do in the East.
I want perfect meals and perfect service.
Is that understood?
Yes, ma'am.
- And, Mary...
- Yes, ma'am?
I hope you'll remember what I told you... this morning... about visitors?
Yes, ma'am.
And I don't want to have to remind you again.
Remember that,
Mrs. Higgins-
Anything else than perfection... and, ggkktt... off goes your head.
My head, indeed.
You better look after your own.
How can you stand working for people like that?
Oh, I don't mind.
Could be worse.
Well, I guess you know your own business best.
Now we'll have a little pepper.
Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins.
Ah-choo!
I'll see you tomorrow.
OK, Loop.
Hello, dear.
Mother, I undressed myself.
I put my clothes away- all folded and everything.
Well, you're mother's precious little angel... that's what you are.
No, I'm not, because angels have wings... like these.
Those are your daddy's wings.
I know, and he's really an angel, isn't he?
Yes, darling.
Now, then. Are you all ready to hang up your stocking?
- Mother.
- Yes, dear?
You know,
I was thinking today...
- about hanging up my stocking...
- Yes? and I thought maybe... if Santa brought me a great big present- of course, he mightn't- but then if he did-
Yes, if he did?
Well, you know, my stockings are awful little.
I know. And you want mother to lend you one of hers.
Oh, no. I already borrowed one of Mrs. Higgins'.
Oh, you did?
Ha ha ha!
See? It's a real good, big one.
Santa Claus could get most anything in that.
Shall we hang it here?
Will it hold everything without falling down?
I think it will.
Now... say your prayers.
Then mother will tuck you in... you'll close your eyes and go to sleep... and then-
And then it will be Christmas.
That's right.
Now, there you are.
Dear Lord, please bless my mother and me... and Loop and all of the aviators... and Mr. and Mrs. Higgins... and Mr. and Mrs. Smythe and Mr. Smith-
Do I have to ask him to bless Joy, too?
Yes, dear.
And bless Joy, too... and make her a good girl.
- Mother.
- What, dear?
On account of this is Christmas Eve... do you think it will be all right... if I ask something special?
I'm sure it will.
Dear Lord, please see my daddy... and wish him a merry Christmas from my mother and me... and tell him we love him... forever and ever. Amen.
Mother, do you think he will?
I think on this night of all nights...
God will listen to the prayer of a child.
Don't cry, Mother.
I get lonesome for him sometimes, darling.
Don't be lonesome, mother.
You have me.
Yes, my own sweet baby.
And we're together... and tomorrow's Christmas and everything.
And it'll be a merry
Christmas, won't it?
The merriest we've ever had.
The very, very merriest.
All right.
Beddy-bye.
In you go.
There you are- nice and comfy.
Tell me again about the first Christmas.
All right.
A long, long time ago... three travelers came to an inn.
And they needed food and shelter.
Yes, but there was no room for them in the inn.
And the only place they could find to sleep... was in the stable.
In the straw... with the cows.
And there was born that night... a little baby boy.
Isn't it beautiful, dear?
Merry Christmas, Uncle Ned.
Ohhh...
Oh, look, darling.
Look, darling. Isn't she nice?
I don't want any old doll!
I wanted a wheelchair like his!
Little girls don't have wheelchairs... but you have lots of other nice things to play with.
I don't want anything else!
I want a wheelchair!
Ohh...
Look, Mrs. Higgins!
Look what Santy Claus brought me!
Oh, my! My!
Isn't she pretty?
What's her name?
Her name is Mary Lou... and Santy Claus brought me... a little man that dances when you wind him up... and a ball and some candy... and a sewing kit... with real scissors, a needle, and everything!
Santa Claus was certainly good to you.
He certainly was.
I got every single thing I asked for.
I'm pretty lucky, all right.
All right, honey.
Roy's outside waiting for you.
Now, you run along and see Loop... and mother will be down just as soon as she can.
Run along, dear.
Are you gonna take Mary Lou to the airport with you?
Do you think maybe she's too young?
Perhaps you'd better leave her here.
All right. Take good care of her while I'm away.
I certainly will, darling.
Hello, honey.
Hello.
Up you go.
You hurry down, Mother!
All right!
Hello, honey.
Hello, Thomas.
That plane flew all the way across this country... since yesterday afternoon.
And it made a 3-point landing, too.
That's right, honey.
Now, you stay here with Thomas.
I'll be right back.
Check your baggage right inside.
Hiya, Paul. We're expecting you at the club, you know.
Swell, Loop. I'll be there.
Everything all set?
Miss Martin?
- Yes?
- I'm Thomas, the Smythe chauffeur.
I was sent to meet you.
Oh, yes. Take care of my bags, will you?
Yes, ma'am.
You wait here, dear.
I know who you are.
You do?
Sure. You're the lady... who's coming to live at our house.
Well, you're not littleJoy, are you?
Oh, no. I'm Shirley.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, I see.
Come on, honey.
Loop.
How are you, Miss Martin?
Isn't she the lady... whose picture you have in your book?
Yeah. She's one of them.
You see that?
That's all for you.
For me?
- Surprise, honey!
- Surprise!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Oh, my!
Do you like her?
Oh, my goodness!
Ha ha ha!
You'll have to give her a name, Shirley.
What are you going to call her?
Her name is going to be...
I know- Loopy!
Ha ha ha!
That's a swell name, honey.
I'll meet you, Loop, uh... you know.
Let's go, gang.
Now I've got a present for you.
This isn't from Santa Claus.
This is from me to you.
That's a magic ring, see?
ZJust like they have in the fairy tales.
Now, if ever you're in trouble... or ever you want me to do anything for you... you send me this ring, and I'll come.
It's pretty. Thanks, Loop.
How much do you love me?
Is that all?
- Mmhh!
- Ha ha ha!
I wish Mother would hurry... so she could see all I got.
She'll be here.
We're just beginning.
I do wish that man from the bakery... would get here with the cake.
He's sure to be here in a few minutes.
I don't want to miss any of the party.
No, of course you don't.
Mary, where's your little girl?
She's gone to a Christmas party.
I don't believe in Christmas.
You don't?
No. It's a lot of nonsense.
Well, I don't feel that way about it.
Well, I do!
Here-
Buy a Christmas present for Shirley from me.
Christmas! Ugh!
Now, what do you make of that?
He never fooled me.
He's only tough on the outside.
Inside he's soft as mush.
How 'bout it, Loop?
I wanted to wait for Mrs. Blake... but I guess we better get going.
When she comes, give me the flag... so I can stop and take her on.
OK, Loop.
What are we going to do?
I've got it all fixed... for you to have your party in the big ship.
Are we going to go up?
No, but we're gonna taxi all over the field.
Won't that be swell?
Oh, boy!
Come on.
We want Shirley!
We want Shirley!
We want Shirley!
Have a good time, Shirley.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Surprise!
Surprise!
Hi, Shirley.
OK, Loop.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Turn on the radio, Bill.
If I close my eyes...
I can make believe
I'm really flying.
Now I'm way, way up.
I wish mother was here.
This is the candyland hour...
for all good children.
The orchestra will play our theme song.
You know that song, don't you?
- Sure, I do.
- Well, then sing it. Come on.
Come on, Shirley, sing it.
? I've thrown away my toys?
? Even my drum and trains?
? I want to make some noise?
? With real-life aeroplanes?
? Someday I'm going to fly?
? I'll be a pilot, too?
? And when I do?
? How would you?
? Like to be my crew??
? On the good ship Lollipop
? It's a sweet trip to a candy shop?

Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Well, you're here at last!
Yes, ma'am.
I want you to see it.
Here you are.
Thank you, ma'am.
Merry Christmas to you.
Ohhh!
Oh, ain't that pretty?
Why, it's far too nice to eat... if you ask me.
I'll save a piece for you anyway.
Now I must dash.
- Here, I'll hand it to you.
- Thanks.
Well, good-bye, now.
Good-bye.
Bye. Have a good time.
Look out!
Aah!
That man was on the wrong side of the road.
He was going too fast.
Why don't we get the doctor?
Do you live in town here?
Yes. But she ran right in front of me.
I didn't even have a chance to put on my brakes.
Why, it's Mary!
You know her?
Yes. She works for the same people I do.
Come on, let's take her over to the curb. Give me a hand.
Who was it?
It was Mary, our maid... the mother of the little girl you saw at the airport.
Ohhh...
Fare, please.
I paid you already!
Oh! So you did!
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Loop, look!
Hey, Bill, hold it a minute.
What's the matter?
I've got bad news for you.
Well, what happened?
There's no use breaking it to her right now.
I'll tell her later.
I can't say thanks, but...
I want you to know
I appreciate you... coming down here to tell me.
Wouldn't you let me go along?
If you don't mind...
I'd rather be alone with her.
I understand.
Honey?
How much do you love me?
Mmhh!
Mmm.
I'll never forget this day.
It's the best I've ever had in my whole life.
Good-bye, Shirley.
Had a swell time... at your party.
- Bye, Shirley!
- We'll have another one soon.
Swell dance.
Good-bye, Shirley.
We have to go back.
So long, Shirley.
Bye.
Is it all over now, Loop?
No.
They have to go back to work... but we're just starting.
Now, because today is Christmas... you can do anything that you want to do.
What would you like to do best of all?
You know. Fly.
That's just what I thought.
Hey, Bill.
All right, Shirley... we're goin' for a ride... just you and I.
You mean way up high?
Yep... way up high.
Come on.
Ooh! We're going up!
That's right.
We're going way up.
Do you know where we're going?
No.
We're goin' right up to heaven.
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.
You know, Shirley... heaven's a very nice place.
If we're good, we'll all live there someday.
Yes, I know.
My mother and father are there now.
So is my daddy.
We're up pretty high now.
Are we getting near it?
We're right in it now.
It's all around us, everyplace you look.
It must be a awful big place.
It is, honey.
Shirley...
I've got somethin' to tell you.
A story?
No, not a story.
You know... ever since your daddy went to heaven... your mother's been awful lonesome for him.
Yes, I know.
Sometimes she cries and everything.
Well... today your mother got so lonesome for your daddy... that she went to see him.
All the way up to heaven?
Yep.
All the way up to heaven.
They're up there together now.
You mean... my mother cracked up, too?
Yes.
Would you take these off for the little girl?
I think I would.
What's to become of her now?
I don't suppose the Smythes will do anything for her.
Oh, not them.
They're far too selfish.
- Elizabeth-
- Huh?
No, we couldn't do it.
Oh, how I'd love to have her.
She's such a sweet child.
But if we took her... we'd have to give up our place here... and it mightn't be so easy gettin' another one.
That's what I was thinking.
Well, I've checked up.
As far as I can find out, there are no relatives.
Now what are we to do?
There's nothing for us to do.
It's no concern of ours.
We have neither a legal nor a moral responsibility.
I know that, but after all, the woman worked for us.
People will naturally expect us to do something.
Maybe one of those aviators... would like to adopt her.
Well, if they do, let them go to court.
All that we can do is to see... that the little girl is placed in an institution... where she'll be cared for.
I'll speak to judge Thompson about it.
Oh, no, you won't!
Oh. Uncle Ned!
Did I hear you say you were gonna put... little Bright Eyes in an orphan asylum?
Who?
Shirley. Bright Eyes, I call her.
I don't care what you call her.
Well, now, Uncle Ned, you see, uh...
Anita and I have talked the matter over... and we've decided... that since there are apparently no relatives... and since of course... it's impossible for us to keep Shirley-
Why is it impossible?
Well, really, Uncle Ned, you could hardly expect us... to raise our littleJoy with the child of a servant.
Servant, my eye!
She was just as good as you are.
I don't know where you get the idea... you're so high and mighty.
Why, your father was a retail butcher!
And your father started life as a bricklayer!
Why, really, Uncle Ned... you-you mustn't get so excited.
Well, I will if I want to.
Now, listen to me, you two.
I want you to understand just one thing.
If you ever expect to get anything out of me... you're going to be human enough and decent enough... to take Shirley into this house to live.
I'll pay for her board and her clothes.
Oh, that wouldn't be necessary, Uncle Ned.
Of course, Uncle Ned.
We had no idea... you felt this way about the child.
Well, I do... and if you don't want her here...
I guess I can find some other place for her.
And listen...
I can find another place for me, too.
Well, this is going to be perfectly lovely.
Well, you engaged the woman against my advice.
I told you not to do it.
Are you blaming me because the woman died... and left a child on our hands?
I'm merely pointing out-
Well, don't bother pointing anything out.
Uncle Ned?
What do you think?
I think you're an old softy.
Well, would you let them put a child like that in a home?
In my home.
You're not like those two in there.
You're more like me.
Where's Shirley now?
She's down at the airport with Loop.
Loop? Who's Loop?
Oh. He's that aviator fellow you were interested in.
Yes.
Uh-huh. Well, uh... you go down yourself and bring her back.
I'll go right now.
Whrrr!
How was the trip to Ensenada?
Terrific. I didn't have a minute to myself.
I'm gonna sleep from now on.
Hey, Bob.
That's right.
Come on. We're goin' to San Francisco right away!
Oh, boy!
How'd you like to make a livin'... flying a guy like that?
Don't squawk.
He could've said Paris!
Ha ha ha!
Whrrr!
Watch, Loop.
I'm gonna bank.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
We should've had our belts on.
You didn't make a bank.
You did a barrel roll!
Now, always remember one thing-
If you bank too sharply, you're liable to go into a sideslip.
That's what I did, all right.
I went into a sideslip.
Oh, you!
May I come in?
Hello.
Hello. How are you, dear?
I'm fine, and I'm glad you came to see me.
Come on and see Loop.
What can I do for you?
I want to talk to you... privately.
Shirley, run over to the radio room and see... if the American Airlines ship is on time.
Why, it was on time when we asked a while ago.
Well, then, uh... run over to the hangar... and find out if they've gassed my ship.
Well, I know they did because I watched them.
Come on, take off, will you, please?
OK.
Whrrr!
Well, you might ask me to sit down.
I might.
Why are you so bitter?
You ought to know.
Can't you forget the past?
Sure. I can forget a lot of things.
I can forget that you and I were in love... and we were engaged to be married... and that you walked out on me.
All that is just as dead as this.
But I can't forget that you made a fool of me.
A man usually remembers that.
Would it make any difference... if I said I'm sorry?
Not a bit.
It's a little too late.
You didn't come all the way over here... just to tell me that, did you?
No. I came to talk about Shirley.
What about her?
The Smythes want her to come and live with them.
Now I'll tell one.
- I mean, Uncle Ned-
- Wait a minute.
You mean you and Uncle Ned sold the Smythes the idea.
They don't like it any too well... but in order to keep in good with Uncle Ned, they'll do it.
Is that right?
You're being very unfair.
Nothing doing.
You can't have her.
Don't let your feeling against me... interfere with the little girl's future.
I know her father was your best friend.
I know you love her very dearly.
If you do, you must surely see that she can't live here... in a barracks with a lot of men!
They're pretty good men.
Even so, if there was ever a time... when a child needed women around her, it's now!
Oh, I know she can't stay here... but on the other hand,
I'm not so sure... the Smythes are the right people for her to be with.
But I'm going to take care of her myself.
- What about when you go east?
- I'll take her with me.
Oh, no, you won't. Anyhow,
I'm figuring on getting a house... and hiring a woman to take care of Shirley.
But that'll take a little time, won't it?
Oh, I suppose so.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can take her for now, but only with the understanding... that when I get a place for her,
Shirley comes with me.
I love that baby.
I understand how you feel.
And, Loop, no matter what you think of me...
I think you're the finest man I've ever known.
There was a time I thought you were pretty swell, too.
Say, Loop,
American Airlines ship is-
Oh, now I forgot whether it's four minutes late... or four minutes early.
Never mind.
Come here.
Honey, would you like to go back... to the Smythes' house and live there?
Do I have to?
For a little while, dear.
We think you should.
Are you gonna be there?
Yes, I am, and we'll be together every day.
If you're there, it'll be fine.
I like you, and I like Mr. Smith, too.
All right. Then it's all set.
Can Loop come live with us, too?
Oh, no, dear.
ZJust at the moment...
I'm afraid that can't be arranged.
Oh, no! Not a chance!
Here, Rags. Here, Rags. Come on.
I'm gonna let you take
Rags with you, too.
Oh, goody!
Good old Ragsy.
Thanks, Loop.
Oh, that's all right.
I might as well give the dog a break, too.
Don't worry about her.
Come see her whenever you like.
Much obliged.
So long, sweets.
If you don't like it there... remember what I told you about the magic ring.
Send it to me... and I'll come and get you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Loop.
Come on, Ragsy.
Do you have much trouble... with your little girl?
Oh, no. She's very good.
She sleeps all the time.
Well, I have to spank mine every day... and give her castor oil.
Now,just listen to her.
She's crying again!
Stop crying!
Stop this minute!
They seem to get along all right.
Why, of course.
Anyone could get along with Joy... but I still think it's a dreadful imposition.
I know, but, uh... it won't last forever.
What do you mean?
Well, we can humor
Uncle Ned for a while... and then later on,
I can convince him... that the child will be better off somewhere else.
Shirley is just one of his whims.
He'll get tired of her one of these days.
I hope so.
Well, ladies... taking your children out for an airing?
I'm taking my little girl to the hospital.
She's very sick... and I'm afraid she'll have to have an operation.
Huh. Is that so?
Yeah. They'll probably have to cut her leg off.
Maybe both legs.
And what's wrong with your child?
Nothing. She's fine.
The only thing about her is... she just won't eat her spinach.
Well, we must be going.
Come, Shirley.
Let's play hospital.
I'll be the doctor, and you can be the nurse.
I'll get a big knife out of the kitchen... and we'll operate on your doll.
I don't want Mary Lou to be operated on.
I don't care.
You have to do as I say... and play the way I want to.
- I don't, either.
- Yes, you do.
This is my house and my yard... and you're nothing but an old charity.
- I am not!
- Yes, you are, 'cause I heard my papa tell my mama.
Let's do something else.
Do you want to play a game?
What kind of a game?
Train wreck.
How do you play it?
I'll show you.
You stand right here and don't move.
All right, now, don't move.
Here comes the train!
Woo woo!
Aah aah!
Mama! Mama!
Shirley pushed me!
What's the matter with that imp?
She's a very difficult child.
Difficult? Huh!
I can think of a better word.
Uncle Ned, I think you should speak to Anita... about the way
ZJoy treats Shirley.
No use talkin' to her.
I got somethin' better up my sleeve.
What?
You'll see.
Well, it's your move.
Uh... you only got one move.
Ha ha ha!
There you are!
Look at that!
You give up?
What was it you wanted?
I don't know whether you know it or not... but I'm Shirley's godfather.
- Oh, is that so?
- Really?
So naturally I want to do the best I can for her.
Yes, of course.
When you wanted her to stay here and live with you...
I thought it would be a good idea.
I knew you'd be nice to her.
It isn't hard to be nice to such a sweet child.
I'm glad you feel that way... because Shirley means more to me than anybody else... in the world.
That's why I thought
I'd come and ask you-
Yes?
I want to take her to live with me.
And I hope you'll let me have her.
What's that?
Hey, what's all this?
Why-
Let me explain, dear.
You're that aviator fellow, ain't ya?
That's right.
I don't like airplanes.
Well, I don't like wheelchairs.
Well, you stay in the airplane business... and you'll wind up in one.
What's he doin' here?
Well... you see, Uncle Ned...
Mr. Merritt thinks it's a good idea... for Shirley to live with him.
What?! He wants to take
Shirley away from here?
Are you married?
No, I'm not.
How much do you make?
Enough to support myself.
Where do you live?
At the airport.
Where do you eat?
In restaurants.
You've got a lot of nerve, young fella.
How can you take care of a child... when you haven't got a home or a wife or even a cook?
Well, maybe I've got something else she needs.
- What?
- Love, that's what.
Aw, fiddlesticks!
We all love her here, don't we?!
Yes, Uncle Ned.
Well, you can't have her!
- Who says so?
- I say so.
I've got more right to her than you have.
Aw, nonsense. You haven't any right at all.
Well, we'll see about that!
Hey, young fella!
If you want to see about it... you see my lawyers!
Lawyers?
Lawyers?
That's what I said. Lawyers.
I'm taking legal steps to adopt Shirley.
Good heavens!
So that's where he went yesterday.
You can't get away with this!
Oh, I can't, eh?
No! I'm gonna give you a fight!
I'll get lawyers myself!
We'll let the court decide!
Is that so?
You haven't got money enough to fight me!
I'll get it. I don't care if you've got $90 million!
You're not gonna take
Shirley away from me!
Ha! I've got the best lawyers in the country!
Ha ha ha!
Loop!
You put one over on me again, didn't you?
No. I didn't.
I didn't know about it.
You expect me to believe that?
Yes.
OK.
Loop, from now on,
I'm on your side.
Why?
Because if Shirley means so much to you... then you're the one who should have her.
For a child, love counts more than anything.
ZJust for a child, huh?
For anyone.
I'm glad you found that out.
There, now.
Pleasant dreams, dear, and go right to sleep.
I don't want to go to sleep... but I'll try.
That's a good little girl.
Good night, Shirley.
Good night, Mrs. Smythe.
And remember, Shirley...
I don't want to have to speak to you again... about having that awful little dog in your bed.
It isn't healthful.
And besides,
I think the dog has fleas.
Oh, no. He hasn't got fleas.
He just scratches that way because he's itchy.
Well, I don't want him here in this bedroom.
Is that understood?
Yes, ma'am.
Good night,Joy, darling.
Hey!
What?
Do you want to play burglars?
No. I want to go to sleep.
Come on, Rags.
Ooh! You've got that awful dog in your bed... after mommy told you not to!
I'm gonna tell.
Mama!
You don't have to yell for your mother... and you don't have to tell her, either... you old tattletale.
I'll take Rags downstairs.
Come on, Rags, good old dog.
I thought about it and thought about it... and I'll be hanged-
Pardon me, dear- if I know what to do.
The minute I heard him say he'd seen his lawyers...
I felt a cold chill go down my back.
He may have changed his will.
He may have left us out of it entirely.
Oh, it's intolerable.
Yes, you're right, dear... and all because he took a fancy... to a 5-year-old orphan.
There's been nothing but trouble... ever since that child came into this house.
I wish we'd never seen her.
If you'd only taken my-
Now, don't tell me again that it's all my fault... for hiring the woman.
All right, dear.
Well, what are we going to do about it?
If we could find some way of getting rid of the child.
Heaven knows she's not wanted here.
Why don't you bribe that aviator fellow... to take her out of the state?
Now, that's an idea.
But what would
Uncle Ned think?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm so sick of hearing that child's name, I could scream.
She's practically disrupted the family.
I know, dear. But we've got to find some way out of it.
Say, what's a three-letter word... for Peer Gynt's mother?
What's the matter,
Loop? You low?
How could I make some money?
What for?
Well, I gotta hire some lawyers.
Why don't you marry the girl?
Cut out the wisecracks, will you? I'm serious.
I don't know, Loop.
Flyers never have any money.
You know that.
Yeah, I know it.
Wow! What a night!
Heavy weather, huh?
Terrific.
I hear everything's on the ground.
Nothing moving.
That's right.
Zero zero all along the line.
Boy, oh, boy.
Hello, everybody.
Shirley!
What's happened?
Shirley, what are you doing out... on a night like this?
Why, you're soakin' wet.
Come on, now. You gotta get those clothes off and dried out.
Hello.
Hello, honey.
Hello, Shirley.
Are you all dressed?
Yes.
Did you dry yourself off good?
- I did.
- OK.
Ha ha ha!
You sure look swell.
They fit you fine.
Now, then... what's the big idea?
I don't want to live with the Smythes anymore, Loop.
I want to stay with you.
I want you to stay with me, Shirley.
And I'm gonna try and fix it so you can.
Oh, goody!
Now, then... off you go to sleep... and we'll talk everything over tomorrow.
You're not mad at me for coming here... are you, Loop?
Yes, I am very, very mad.
Ha ha ha!
Come on.
Ha ha ha!
? Ohhh?
? He flies through the air?
? With the greatest of ease?
? This daring young man?
? On his flying trapeze?
? Well, his movements were graceful?
? The girls he would please?
? This daring young man?
? On his flying trapeze?
Well, good morning, Anita.
Good morning, Uncle Ned.
Good morning,John.
Good morning, Uncle Ned.
Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Do you feel all right, Uncle Ned?
My boy, I never felt better in my life.
Tony!
I sent him out for some breakfast, Loop.
What's the matter?
Aren't you workin'?
Not today. I'm no hero.
Aw, it's not that tough, is it?
Ladies and gentlemen, here's news of national import.
Two mail planes are reported missing...
in the worst storm the West has known in years.
A blizzard is raging over the Rockies...
which has completely disrupted rail and air traffic.
All transcontinental passenger planes...
have been ordered grounded until the weather breaks.
That's 30 for this morning.
This is Sam Hayes speaking.
I'll see you tonight at 10.00. Good day, all.
I'm ready for breakfast now, Loop.
I was gonna have some chow brought down... but I guess we'll have to go and get it.
And then, young lady, you're going to have to go home.
Oh, Loop.
Why can't I stay here?
Can't you be a soldier and stick it out for a little while?
I don't want to.
You don't want to live in a swell house... go to a nice school, and be educated and refined?
I don't want to be refined.
I want to be like you.
All right.
Let's eat and talk it over.
Now, come on. Bundle up warm.
Well, children,
I want you to know... that I'm about to change my will.
I'm adopting Shirley... and I'm setting aside a trust fund for her.
What?
You two have nothing to worry about... so long as you behave yourselves.
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama! Mama!
- Shirley's gone!
- What?
Yeah! She didn't sleep in her bed all night...
'cause I woke up and looked.
She must've run away!
She wouldn't have run away without some reason!
Did you have anything to do with this?
Why, of course not, Uncle Ned.
She's gone to that aviator fella!
Get police! Get detectives!
Get the army!
But go to that airport and bring her home!
Yes, Uncle Ned.
There'd better be some action around here now...
I'll tell you that!
You see, honey?
Man's just learning what the birds knew all the time.
What?
You never saw birds fly in bad weather, did you?
They have too much sense for that.
Listen. Am I working for you, or you working for me?
I'm workin' for you.
Well, then you listen to me.
This has gotta be in New York tomorrow.
It means a lot of money to me.
You're gonna fly it there.
Not me.
What do you mean, not you?
I mean the weather's too bad.
There won't be one ship take off from here today.
- It's too dangerous.
- You don't understand.
This has got to be in New York tomorrow.
That's all I know.
Well, I'm sorry, it can't be done.
I've got a wife and two children... and they mean more to me than this job.
You mean I gotta get someone else?
You sure do.
All right. You're through.
I'd give $1,000 for this flight.
There must be someone around that wants that kind of money.
You won't get anyone to fly today.
Well, that's my worry.
I'll find somebody.
Oh, my! Come on!
Come on, Rags.
Who's Loop Merritt?
I am.
You fly to New York for me?
Not today.
They told me you were a flyer with plenty of nerve.
Nerve is one thing, and being crazy is another.
Anybody who takes a ship up today is crazy.
There's $1,000 in it for you.
I could use 1,000, all right.
Mister, you got a bet.
This has to be delivered in
New York tomorrow morning.
Leave the check in the office with Major Moseley.
I'll do that right now... and I'll meet you in my hangar in 10 minutes.
You're not really gonna fly today, are you, Loop?
I sure am.
Don't be crazy.
You'll kill yourself!.
Didn't you ever need money so badly... you were willing to risk your life for it?
Sure, but on a day like-
I know, but I need $1,000, and I need it for a good reason.
No one should fly in this weather.
I fly better in weather like this.
Eddie, come here.
Take Shirley home, will you?
Sure, Loop.
So long, baby.
Be a nice fella and wait till I get back.
I'll wait right here for you.
Oh, no. You have to go home.
No. I'm never going back there.
Aw, Shirley. I'm making this flight to get money... so that I can take you and keep you with me always.
But for now, you'll have to go back to the Smythes'.
Won't you do that for me?
All right, Loop... but hurry back.
You wait in here out of the wind, honey.
I'll be right back.
So long, Loop. Lots of luck.
Why don't you call it off, Loop?
Nothin' doin'.
Hey,just a minute!
Where's Shirley?
Don't tell me you're worried.
Never mind the funny stuff.
If you've got that kid... you're in a tough spot.
Well, wise guy, I haven't got her.
I sent her home.
She'll be at your house before you get there.
You sent her home?
Yes, I sent her home!
You know I could have you arrested for kidnapping.
We'll take that up at the next meeting.
So long, fellas.
- Well, where is she?
- Isn't she here?
- She is not.
- She ought to be.
Sure, she should be, but she isn't.
Are you a detective?
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm not, but if I was one...
I'd figure out where she is.
Now, Mr. Smythe-
Smith's my name!
You know what I think?
I didn't know you could think!
I think that aviator took her with him.
He was going on a flight when we got there.
Say, that's right!
You say he was goin' away?
- Yes.
- Sure, he's got her!
He's taken her with him!
Call the police!
Call my lawyers!
Now, take it easy, Uncle Ned.
Ah, get out.
Hurry, man! Hurry!
Have them in a moment,
Mr. Smith.
Hello. This is Hall speaking.
I want to report a kidnapping.
I'll spend $10,000-
Anything to get her back safe and sound.
Burbank, Burbank. Zero zero.
Dense fog. Zero.
Temperature 50.
Dew point 50.
Barometer 29.80.
Winds west 3.
All airports have been asked to notify police...
if plane NC13843 lands.
The pilot,James Merritt...
is suspected ofkidnapping
Shirley Blake...
5 years old.
Ha! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Shirley! Come here.
How did you get in here?
I got in where the baggage goes.
Don't be mad, Loop.
This is the first time in my life...
I ever felt like spanking you.
Didn't you tell me to send you this ring... if I wanted you to come get me?
That's right.
Well, I was going to send it... but I couldn't get it off, so I brought it myself. See?
You certainly picked a fine time to do it.
Now, what's the idea?
I want to be with you, Loop.
All airport offiicials have been asked...
to report the arrival of plane NC13843.
You know, we're really in trouble.
Loop, you're not awful mad at me, are you?
Yes, I'm very mad at you.
Well, I guess I won't be very long.
That's right. But be sure... and keep me posted if anything happens.
Well?
There isn't any news.
I blame you two for this.
If you hadn't been so selfish... if you'd just been a little kinder... that child would never have left here.
You people have everything to make life worthwhile- youth and health and money.
And yet you were too mean and too narrow to share it... with a little child who had nothing... but who had more than you'll ever have.
Well, if anything happens to her...
I'm through with you for good and all.
Is it always bumpy like this?
It isn't bumpy till you hit your head on the top.
Say, reach in my pocket and get a stick of gum.
Isn't this great?
Uh-huh.
Give me half.
Say, what was that
"Lollipop" song?
Go ahead and sing it.
? On the good ship Lollipop?
? It's a sweet trip...?
?... Bonbons play?
? On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay?
NC13843 calling.
NC13843 abandoning ship.
Broken gas line.
Approximate position-
Can you hear me?
It's dead.
What's the matter, Loop?
Do you love me?
Of course, Loop.
How much?
Oh, you can hug me tighter than that...
'cause we're bailin' out.
Hold tight.
Are you all right, honey?
Sure!
Let's do it again.
And in conclusion, your honor... my client feels that he is the best qualified... and most fit person to have the custody of this child.
He therefore prays... that you grant him the right of adoption.
ZJames Merritt.
Yes, your honor?
Aren't you represented by counsel?
No, sir.
Well, you've heard all about the advantages...
Mr. Smith can give Shirley.
What have you to offer?
Not very much.
I haven't a lot of money, and I haven't a fine home.
But I love Shirley, and I know she loves me.
I'd do anything in the world for her.
Judge: Come on up here by me, Shirley.
Up she goes. Yeah.
Well, looks as though you... are a very popular young woman.
Now, it's my duty to decide who is going to adopt you... but I think you should have something to say about it... don't you?
Yes, I do.
Now, uh... which of these people would you like to live with?
I'd like to live with him.
And I'd like to live with him, too.
And her, too.
Well, it seems to me that this case... can be settled without attorneys.
Will all the lawyers in the courtroom please leave?
Now, suppose we adjourn to my chambers.
Come on, dear.
Oh, not you, Mr. Merritt... nor you, Mr. and Mrs. Smythe.
I just want to talk to Mr. Smith and the young lady.
Mama, do we have to have... that old Shirley living with us again?
Darling, please, be quiet.
But, mama, do we?
Shh! Shh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Well, Mr. Merritt...
I've been making some inquiries... and I'm not so sure-
Would you please step in here?
You told Shirley if she was ever in trouble... to send you this ring.
Well, I want to see if it's really a magic ring... because I'm in trouble.
You want Shirley... and I want Shirley.
If you think hard for a minute... can't you figure a way out?
I don't get you at all.
Oh, dear. Do I have to propose?
Well, I did the last time.
Oh, Loop.
No. You don't have to propose.
Maybe all this happened for a good reason.
And this time, it'll last forever.
Well, Uncle Ned, who got Shirley?
We did.
Come up and see us sometime.
Oh, Papa, now we don't have to... be nice to Uncle Ned anymore!
Hey, listen, if you and your nautical nitwits...
...are gonna give the girls their big break, better shove off.
- We've dropped anchor.
- We have?
Say, will you guys let me forget
I was once a hoofer?
It sure seems swell to be getting back where the women talk your own language.
You bet. it's gonna be great to be able to talk to a dame...
...without using your hands.
Hey, you been holding out on me.
I didn't know you had a girl in your act.
- Give me that.
- Wait a minute.
That's why you joined the Navy.
You thought a torpedo would be easier...
- ...to dodge than a shotgun.
- Don't be funny.
- I asked that little girl to marry me.
- What?
Yeah, and she turned me down.
Imagine a guy asking a dame to marry.
Say, what's become of her?
Oh, I heard from her when we were down in Manila.
She's working here in Frisco.
Well. Maybe she's got a friend.
Let's go see her.
No, we're all washed up.
- Say, give me that picture.
- What do you want it for?
I thought you said you were all washed up.
Oh, I just kept it because I came out so good.
Lay aft for the 4:00 liberty party.
Boy, I hope I pick something good this time.
I'm always getting schoolteachers.
Why not?
You got a lot to learn yet.
I want something with spangles on it, like that ex-partner of yours.
Say, let's find her.
She probably wouldn't even speak to me anymore.
The last letter from her, she said she was working in a high-class spot...
- ...where all the money goes.
- Yeah? Well, that's the way it is.
Listen, you mugs, don't forget that liberty expires at 12:00.
We've got our orders.
Needn't wait up tonight, Mother.
We're going to Paradise.
Six admissions, please.
- Do you want any dance tickets?
- Dance tickets?
- How much are they?
- Three for 25.
- Give me one.
- one?
Yeah, to see if I like it.
What's the matter?
Don't your friends dance?
They're underage.
I hold them on my lap.
- Hey, Bake, where's Bilge?
- He stopped off to buy the beer.
He knows a place where you get
3 cents back on the bottles.
Hi, tiny.
I'll see you fellows. I gotta look up a party in the telephone book.
Hello? information?
Look, I want to get the number of a Miss Sherry Martin.
She lives at 610 Hyde Street.
Yeah, all right.
Sorry, miss, it's the rules of the Paradise.
No girls are allowed in without escorts.
I see. Women aren't even admitted to paradise without a man.
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.
Don't bother. Your hands are full.
I'll get the tickets for us.
Two, please.
I'll explain to you when we get inside.
Did you bring your lunch too?
Thank you. You see,
I wanted to get in to see my sister.
She works here, and they wouldn't let me in without an escort.
I thought you were trying to frame me.
Oh, no. You see,
I've never been here before.
My sister's asked me to come down.
I've never been able to.
I've always been so busy, but, well, tonight I just felt like a little spree.
Well, I hope you find it.
I've sort of been playing hooky all day today.
I spent the afternoon watching the fleet come in.
Oh, gee, it was exciting.
If I were a man, I'd be a sailor.
Yeah, I know just how you feel.
They're pretty, aren't they?
I'll bet you're used to seeing pretty girls all over the world.
I never give them a tumble, sister.
Women don't interest me.
I'll bet you dance beautifully.
No, not a step.
Well, I gotta be shoving off. So long.
- Come to Papa.
- You sure work fast, Bilge.
- Yeah, we're the slow ones.
- Lay off me.
Where did you pick up that awful-looking crow?
She picked me up.
I think she's screwy.
She must be if she tried to pick you up.
- Well, what will you have?
- Six clean glasses.
- Who is it?
- Connie.
Oh, Connie, come in.
I'm glad to see you. How'd you get away?
What about your music lessons?
I didn't feel like giving them, so I just called up and said I was ill.
I guess it's just a touch of spring fever.
This is a funny time to be having spring fever, in october.
Well, things usually happen to me out of season.
Connie, why don't you admit it.
You're lonesome.
Some men aren't half bad.
I don't know why.
I just seem to frighten them away.
You look too darned intelligent.
It isn't that gentlemen prefer blonds...
...it's just that we look dumber.
Maybe that's it.
It used to end up by my saying
I'd be a sister to them.
Now it begins by their saying they'll be a brother to me.
That's the difference between us.
I make them say uncle.
Well, I can understand that.
You're attractive.
Connie, women weren't born with silk stockings on, you know.
Well, I wear silk stockings.
And no one looks at them.
Well, men haven't x-ray eyes.
Though sometimes I wonder.
Gee, you must look lovely in this.
And so could you, if you wanted to.
Things have got to be dolled up nowadays.
That's why they put brass on battleships.
Why don't you let me try to fix you up?
You'll be amazed how much better it'll make you feel.
Even though I'm not a blond,
I could be dumb, couldn't I?
And you'll probably do all right too.
It takes a lot of brains to be dumb.
Let's try it.
Hey, Kitty!
Connie, this is Kitty Collins.
Kitty, this is my sister.
- How do you do?
- Hiya.
Will you fix her up?
Well, I'll do what I can, Sherry.
I've got to go on.
I'll be back after the number.
And remember the old saying,
"Clothes make the man."
Do you have to wear these?
Oh, no. I just wear them to impress my pupils.
I'll bet they're impressed.
Nobody'd ever take you for Sherry's sister.
I guess not.
I've spent most of my life up the coast in a little town called Bellport...
...while Sherry's been here.
Sherry!
- Bake!
- Sherry!
Well, what a surprise seeing you here!
Yeah. I'm kind of surprised to see you here too.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
I'm glad to see you too.
Say, you better do something for that cold.
Oh, this isn't a cold.
It's tears because
I'm so glad to see you.
I'm glad to see you too.
Thanks.
I've missed you, Bake.
I've missed you too.
A little bit.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
Same here.
I worried about you for two years until I learned you'd joined the Navy.
Didn't you ever get my letter?
Oh, sure, I heard from you, all right.
Telling me about how well you were doing and everything.
Why didn't you write to me?
I didn't think you cared about hearing from me.
Especially after that last time we saw each other.
Well, all I said was
I didn't want to marry you.
Yeah, I know.
It all seemed very important at that time.
But it doesn't make any difference now.
Doesn't it?
No. As you said, marriage would have ruined your career.
Well, I found out I was wrong.
No, maybe you're right.
If you'd married me, you wouldn't be working in a chop-suey joint like this.
Well, I don't see any admiral's stripes on you.
I like to go incognito, just to mingle with the boys.
Order, please.
I want a Coke.
And Miss Martin will have a chocolate sundae without whipped cream.
With whipped cream, and plenty of it.
Gosh, you're glad to see me.
Well, you sure look different.
Don't I?
I'm beginning to feel different.
Kitty, there's a sailor I want to meet.
How do I go about it?
Are you kidding?
No. I mean, are there any rules?
Well, yes and no.
"Yes" before you meet him...
...and "no" after.
Gosh, Sherry, how'd you ever get in a place like this?
Well, it seems I didn't mean much after we split up.
For some reason, they're not interested in a girl dancing alone...
...unless she's got a fan.
Well, a fan doesn't cost much.
Gee, it's swell being with you again.
Friends?
- Friends.
- Let's kiss and make up.
No, let's just make up.
That'll give you something to work for.
Why don't you guys take a walk.
Hiya, baby.
Hello, sailor.
- So you know my name.
- Sure.
Haven't we met before?
That's what I should have said.
No, but haven't we?
Not a chance.
Think I could forget a face like yours?
Well, I must have been mistaken.
But we're meeting now.
Wanna dance?
Oh, I was under the impression that you didn't dance.
Who, me?
I'm the heavyweight dance champ of the fleet.
You've got me up against the ropes here.
Maybe we better sit this one out.
Sure.
This is a lucky night for me, baby.
You're just my type of girl.
Oh, really?
I thought you were the kind of man who never gives girls a tumble.
You've got some very funny ideas about me.
Oh, I admit I've been around.
But I've never met one like you, baby.
No, I guess you haven't.
Hey, what's the idea?
It's a line of defense.
Well, watch my maneuvers.
You can't beat the Navy.
All right, sailor. I surrender.
Unconditionally?
Well, I'm willing to discuss terms.
Okay, baby. Let's get out of here.
Let's find someplace where we can talk.
I'll go ransom my hat and meet you at the back exit.
And don't walk out on me.
- Where's Connie?
- Dropped in a minute ago...
...and said she was leaving, for you not to worry.
Poor kid. I'll bet she was scared with all these sailors around.
Thanks.
All right, everybody.
And now, as you know...
...the Paradise Club holds its popular
Saturday night dance contest.
Mr. Weber will tap the shoulders of the eliminated couples...
...and as usual, your applause will decide the winners.
I thank you.
- Kind of neat, huh?
- Kind of.
Listen, my enlistment's up in the spring.
Then we'll pick up where we left off, only this time you'll ask me to marry you.
The Navy must be a wonderful institution.
It produces such a modest, shrinking type of man.
Yeah, doesn't it?
Go away.
How do you like that?
On my dime, he wants to cut in.
The village cutups.
Wait a minute.
This is the dance contest.
- Is it?
- I'm not supposed to be in it.
- Why not?
- Because it's for guests.
Well, I'm a guest. Ten cents' worth.
No, I don't think I'd better.
Maybe you're right. You probably couldn't keep up with me anymore anyway.
You think not? Well, I'm not so sure you could keep up with me.
Gosh, you've kind of taken the wind out of my sails.
There aren't any sails these days, baby.
Just steam, full steam ahead.
Come on, let me get you something to eat.
- Don't tell me you can cook too.
- oh, yes.
You don't know the kind of person I really am.
Well, you've given me a faint idea.
Oh, boy.
Say, I haven't seen the inside of an icebox since I left home.
Where is your home?
Texas.
I've been back once or twice to see my mother.
- She never knows when I'm gonna turn up.
- Don't you ever write her?
I'm no good at writing.
Don't know what to say.
You could say you love her.
What's the use? She knows that.
Custard pie.
- Now, don't tell me you made this too.
- I made it.
Sweetheart, you've got everything.
I knew it from the first minute I saw you.
- Bilge, I've got to tell you the truth.
- About what?
Well, the first time you saw me, you acted as my escort.
Remember the funny-looking girl with glasses who bought your ticket?
- Yeah.
- Well, that was me.
Well, what was the getup for?
It wasn't a getup.
Until tonight, those were the kind of clothes I wore. That was the real me.
Well, how do you like that?
But that doesn't make any difference.
I'm nuts about you anyway.
Say, Connie, what are you?
A teacher.
I knew it.
Yes, a music teacher.
Well, that ain't so bad.
Oh, Miss Martin, I want to speak to you.
Mr. Weber, I want you to meet
Mr. Baker, a friend of mine.
Mr. Baker is a guest.
- Oh, how do you do?
- How are you?
Mr. Weber owns the Paradise Club.
Is that so?
Not a bad little spot you got here, Mr. Weber.
It isn't right for Miss Martin though.
She's used to working in a nicer atmosphere.
Oh, you don't like this atmosphere.
It's all right for some people...
...but not for Miss Martin.
And who are you?
Me? I'm her manager.
I see. Well, I think you'd better go manage her somewhere else.
Beginning right now.
Pick up your salary in the morning, Miss Martin.
Good night.
Well, I fixed that.
You fixed me.
I did that on purpose. I don't want you working in a place like this.
I'll take you to see Jim Nolan.
I'll get him to put you in his show.
- He'll do that.
- It might have been better to wait...
...until we were sure.
Now, I'll take care of everything.
That's exactly what's worrying me.
Bilge, how long are you going to be here?
We're having war games.
We don't know.
- Maybe in a week. Maybe tonight.
- oh, no.
Don't you worry.
We'll be back in the spring.
The night the fleet arrives you and me have got a date.
- Honest?
- The minute we hit port.
- Soon after that, I'm out of the Navy.
- Really? What are you going to do then?
Gonna stick to the sea.
Oh, I love the sea too.
My father was a sea captain.
You know, that's what I want to be.
I'm taking my chief petty officer exams now.
Then I'm going to try for my master's papers in hopes that I can get a ship.
Bilge, I've got a ship.
- What?
- Yes, come here.
Here it is.
It's a model of the real one.
It was my dad's ship.
He died of a broken heart when she ran aground off the north coast.
I wouldn't want my ship to run aground either.
Dad left my sister Sherry what little money he had.
And he left me the ship because he knew how much she meant to me.
Boy, she's a beauty.
I've always had dreams of sailing on her again as I did when I was a kid.
A steam schooner, just the kind I like to feel under me.
Baby, I'd like to be captain of your ship.
I wanna sail under my own steam to
China, India and those spiggoty ports.
So do I.
I've always wanted to sail on her to all those spiggoty places...
...with my husband at the helm.
- Holy cat.
- What's the matter?
I gotta be going.
Gotta be back on board by 12:00.
- Oh, gee.
- Sorry.
Well...
Hello, Connie. ls Sherry home?
Not yet. She's a little later than usual.
What's happened to you, Connie?
You look swell.
May I present Mr. Smith. A friend of my sister's, Mrs. Manning.
How do you do?
How do you do?
- I'm sorry to have broken in like this.
- oh, no, that's all right. Don't go.
Mr. Smith was just leaving.
He has to be back on ship by 12.
I can't stay. I have an engagement, but tell Sherry I dropped in.
Good night, dear.
Good night, Mr. Smith.
Good night.
I wish you didn't have to leave, Bilge, but maybe you'd better.
Yeah, I guess so.
If you're still here tomorrow night, will I see you?
Will you.
- Tell the admiral not to go away.
- I'll do that. Good night, baby.
Good night.
Mr. Smith.
Hello.
I'm going that way anyway, so I thought
I might drop you off at the dock.
Thanks, that'll help me out a lot.
I'll be up to get you the first thing in the morning and we'll go see Nolan together.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Can't you come up for a while?
I'm sorry, Sherry. I've only got a minute.
I've got to be back on board by 12:00.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Haven't you got a home?
Turn in all liberty cards.
All liberty has been cancelled.
We have immediate sailing orders.
Turn in all liberty cards.
All liberty has been cancelled.
We have immediate sailing orders.
Sailing orders? Listen,
I've got to get ashore.
I've started something
I've got to finish.
Yeah?
Maybe you're lucky we're sailing.
Put it in.
I've got to go to bed, Connie.
I can't keep my eyes open any longer.
Yes, it's late.
Sherry, how much does a chief petty officer get?
Whatever he told you, just cut it in half.
Give me a chance. Let me talk about Bake for a while, will you?
Excuse me, darling, you go right ahead.
Of course, he would make more as master of his own ship, wouldn't he?
I'll bet he's by far the best dancer in the Navy.
Yes, that's what he told me.
Who?
You're talking about Bake.
It's swell, Sherry, isn't it?
Isn't it?
- What's the matter?
- Bilge must have been right.
About what?
Well, he said they might have to leave anytime...
...but it's sooner than I expected.
Who has to leave? What? Where?
The fleet.
The fleet?
Why, the dirty, double-crossing...
What's going on?
Dance team.
Stand clear, fellows.
Give everybody a chance to read it.
Well, where is Bake?
Professor Baker will commence dancing class just as soon as he...
...finishes painting the mainmast.
When you weren't back by 2 this morning...
...I had to think up some alibi.
I told the quartermaster you stayed with your mother who was very sick.
When the officer of the deck asked me where my mother was...
...I said she was home in Texas.
Well, how did I know you were going to be so dumb?
I can understand them making you do this, but why do they have to pick on me?
What kept you out so late anyway?
A very charming young lady, with loads of dough.
She was in show business too, before she got married.
But her husband didn't understand her, so the poor kid had to go to Reno.
Poor kid. I bet the chorus miss her.
She still sees them.
There's nothing snooty about her.
What about that teacher that was going to make you captain of her ship?
She's a swell kid too, but she's kind of serious.
She's sappy like you.
She wants to get married.
I beg your pardon.
One, two, three. one, two, three. Try it.
One, two, three. one, two, three. one, two, three.
Now the left arm up. one, two, three.
Right arm around the lady's waist. one, two, three. Now smile.
One, two, three. All right.
Let's see if you can remember what I told you.
Now, you fellows get over there.
You're the dames.
Dames? What's the big idea?
You asked me to teach you how to dance, didn't you?
All right then, you're dames.
You fellows are their partners.
All right, music.
Now get together.
Come on, get together, get together.
One, two, three. one, two, three. one, two, three.
Don't be bashful. Grab them tight.
One, two, three. one, two, three.
That's better. one, two, three.
Hey, Bake, nobody will dance with me.
That's too bad.
Keep it up, fellows, while I dance with the wallflower.
Hey!
You know, there's a difference between dancing and wrestling.
In dancing, the main idea is to keep your partner's shoulders off the floor.
I was taught to dance collegiate.
Oh, that's different.
Let's cut in.
Hey, Marines.
May I have the pleasure?
Dancing class dismissed!
What I can't understand, Miss Connie, is why you want a floater.
A girl can't handle a ship herself.
No, but she may be able to get a man to do it for her.
Well, I went over the ship like you asked me to, and...
There's lots to be done.
It'll cost quite a bit.
Well, I've saved up about 600 dollars.
And I'll add 400...
...which I got convoying the Navy around the dance floor on my feet.
Even at that, I'm afraid 1000 dollars would hardly be enough.
But I'll tell the company what nice girls...
...my old friend Captain Martin's daughters are...
...and we'll see what we can do.
Thank you, Captain Hickey.
If you don't mind my saying so,
I think he's a very lucky young man.
Actually, Captain Hickey, I consider this whole thing a business proposition.
Don't you believe it, Captain Hickey.
Little Red Riding Hood rides again.
I hear the old man is entertaining a party of big shots this afternoon.
- That's the reason for the dress whites.
- Yeah.
Hey, Bake.
I just got word I passed my exams.
No kidding, Bilge!
Gee, that's swell. Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- I knew you'd make it.
I know you don't care to be taken on a tour of inspection, Courtney.
But I'd like to have you glance over the ship...
- ...and look at our men.
- We'd love to, Captain Jones.
If it won't trouble you, Jones, we'd enjoy it immensely.
Mr. Gilbert, my party will look about the ship.
See that attention is sounded.
Have the band play a march.
Aye, aye, sir.
How about breaking up this sewing circle, and getting into a jam session?
Are you ready?
- Your men are very smart, lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Gilbert.
- Yes, sir.
Have that jazz band stop playing at once.
Aye, aye, sir.
Silence!
Baker, are you aware the captain is showing some guests around the ship...
...and that attention has been sounded?
I'm sorry, sir. We didn't hear the call. We were playing.
Captain, the orchestra was playing and none of the men heard the call.
I'm satisfied, sir, they intend no breach of discipline.
- Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Jones. Would you think it a breach of discipline if I asked you...
...to let them play for us?
I do so adore American music.
Not at all.
Bugler, sound carry on.
Division dismissed.
Baker, please carry on as you intended.
Thank you, sir.
Come on, boys, as we rehearsed it.
Captain Hickey, I'm so happy.
- The great day is dawning.
- Yes, they're just outside the gate.
- They'll drop anchor tonight.
- That's not what I mean.
Nolan's back from New York.
He's giving me an audition tomorrow.
- That's marvelous! But what about Bake?
- That's all I want.
To show him I can get that job without his magnificent management.
- And then what?
- And then...
...I'll be satisfied.
So the Connie Martin is about to have a new master, huh?
- Well, good luck, dear.
- Thank you.
Oh, gosh, it's nearly 7:00.
I've got to be going.
I hope this is the last night
I have to take a substituting job.
What time will you be back, dear?
We won't be through until about 1 or 2.
Don't worry. I'll make a lot of noise with the key.
- Good night.
- Night, darling.
- Say, what are you gonna do with Mike?
- A little peace offering for Sherry.
Every time she looks at him, she'll think of me.
There is a resemblance.
I wrote and explained what happened...
...but I never had an answer to any of my letters.
Bilge, you don't think by any chance she could be sore at me, do you?
I'd advise you to phone first and find out.
Maybe you'd better phone for me.
You're so masterful with women.
You'll swab your own decks tonight.
I got a heavy date that I made last october.
Hello.
- Hello, Bake.
- Is Sherry there?
Oh, she's working. Good.
Then she's not sore at me.
Oh, she is?
Well, I'll be right up then.
Well, I wouldn't, at least until
I've spoken to her. Where are you?
Who, me? I'm...
I'm dining with a friend of mine.
Yes, well, you can tell her she can reach me at this number.
It's Franklin-4321.
All right, I'll tell her.
She may be a little late. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mike, don't ever fall in love.
Connie.
Oh, hello.
I must have fallen asleep.
Can't I get you a cup of coffee?
No, thanks. You have one.
You see, I never did write him.
I wanted to keep the boat as a surprise.
So I really can't blame him.
It's my fault.
I think we better get to bed.
Don't forget I've got to sing at Iris' tomorrow night.
- We can use that 50 dollars.
- Yes.
Oh, I nearly forgot. Bake called.
He left a number where you can reach him.
He's waiting to hear from you.
Let him wait.
Good morning, Nolan Enterprises.
Just a moment, I'll connect you with him.
- Good morning. I want to see Mr. Nolan.
- Mr. Nolan is in New York.
Good. I'll wait.
- Thank you, that's very nice.
- Thank you, Mr. Nolan.
We'll be ready to hear you sing as soon as you've rested.
- Well, how is she?
- She's a great little dancer.
If she can sing too, she's the best bet we've had.
Better get a contract ready. Nolan'll be yelling for one if she delivers.
Okay.
Hi, Sullivan.
Hello, Baker. What's the idea of the outfit? Is it a new act?
- Yeah, an act of Congress.
- So you joined the Navy.
So long as you don't want a job,
I'm glad to see you.
I want a job for somebody else.
She's just what Nolan's been looking for.
You're too late.
He's got somebody in there he's interested in.
Yeah? Who is she?
I don't know.
Just some girl who came in.
- May I have a drink of water, please?
- Why, certainly.
Yes, Mr. Nolan, right away.
Take a glass of water to the young lady.
She's gonna sing now.
- You better take that contract in.
- All right.
- Glad you dropped around.
- Thanks.
There's nothing like water for the voice.
No, there isn't.
- That's what I always say.
- Yeah.
Well, so long, Sullivan.
I'll be seeing you.
So long.
Thank you.
All right, Miss Martin.
Yes, sir.
- Pretty dull party, isn't it?
- Why, yes, it's dreadful.
How about sneaking away to find some excitement?
I'd love to, but I can't.
You see, I'm the hostess.
Really? I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to deride your party.
It's all right, brother.
That's what parties are for.
- Hello, Sherry.
- oh, hello, Iris.
Connie says she's singing in your place tonight, that you're not well.
- What's wrong?
- Well, I don't know.
I've been feeling a little peculiar all afternoon.
That's too bad.
Why don't you try a little bicarbonate of soda. That might help.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- You like?
This reminds me of the Paradise.
- I wonder where you buy the tickets.
- Remember where you are, son.
Poor kid, she had to go to Reno.
I'll see you later.
Don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.
- What are you doing here?
- I came with my pal.
You're not gonna hold it against me for the rest of my life, are you?
I waited all last night for you to return my call.
- I wanted to explain about Jim Nolan.
- Don't bother.
I was there this afternoon and I fixed it all up for you.
- At Jim Nolan's?
- Yes, and it wasn't easy.
There was a girl he was about to sign up.
As she was getting ready to sing, she asked for a drink of water.
What do you think I did?
- What?
- I put bicarbonate of soda in it.
- You what?
- Yeah, bicarbonate of soda.
Can you imagine the expression on her face?
Bake Baker, I'll get even with you if it's the last thing I do.
I must have said something.
Bilge.
- Connie Martin.
- Why, yes, of course.
Well, well, how are you?
You're back. it seems a long time, doesn't it?
Yes, when you come to think of it, it does.
I was sort of expecting you last night.
And when you didn't show up, well,
I thought perhaps you'd forgotten me.
Forgotten you?
No, I had to stay on board last night.
I realize that. it was silly of me.
Of course, somebody has to stay on board.
Oh, Bilge, I was so excited,
I didn't notice you passed your exam.
- I'm so glad.
- Yeah, I am too.
I've so many things to tell you,
I don't know where to start.
That's swell. I'll be glad to hear them some time.
- Well, I'll see you later.
- But, Bilge...
- What?
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, can you imagine that?
- What?
I'm trying to drown my sorrows.
I down a quart of the stuff...
...and the guy tells me it's grape juice.
Let's get out of here.
What's the rush? Maybe the grape juice will make me feel happy anyway.
- Remember that teacher?
- Yeah.
She's here, and she was expecting me last night.
- Did you forget?
- No, I lied to her.
- I told her I had to stay on board.
- Why?
Oh, I don't want to wake up some morning and find myself married.
Acted as cold as I could. A dame like that always makes me feel like a heel.
She brings out your finer instincts.
Come on.
- Where have you been, Bilgy?
- oh, I...
I want you to meet my shipmate, Bake Baker.
This is a friend of mine, Mrs. Manning.
How do you do, Mrs. Manning?
How do you do?
I'm always happy to meet a friend of Bilgy's.
Yes.
Sometime when I'm having a party
I'll invite you to come.
May I have the next dance? Thank you.
I've been waiting for you, Bilgy.
Why aren't you wearing your uniform?
It's a custom of the Navy.
Officers seldom wear their uniforms ashore unless we're on duty.
Then how can one tell the difference between an officer and a civilian?
We have our academy ring.
Oh, isn't that lovely.
Mind if I borrow this for a moment?
- I'd like to show it to a friend.
- Certainly.
Thank you so much.
I'll bring it right back.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
What is it?
You men are all alike.
Oh, Sherry, honestly,
I didn't know it was you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Then tell me what's the matter.
No.
If I only had someone to protect me.
What is it? What is it?
I've never been so insulted in all of my life.
Who did it? What did he say?
Oh, I couldn't repeat it.
Who was it? Point him out to me.
That man over there near the pond.
I don't like his face.
Listen, landlubber, I know your type.
You can't get away with that.
He's lucky I slipped.
- Let go of me.
- Take it easy, buddy.
Let go of me.
I'm awfully sorry this had to happen, lieutenant.
Thanks so much for the use of your ring.
Return to your ship at once.
Aye, aye, sir.
What's the matter, Bake? You look sick.
Can I get you some bicarbonate of soda?
Sorry you're leaving so early, Miss Martin.
I have to get up early. I'm looking for my sister. Have you seen her?
- She was on the terrace a moment ago.
- Thank you.
What's the matter with you tonight, Bilgy?
Nothing. Why?
- You're acting so funny.
- Am I?
Why, I don't mean to be.
That's more like you were last night.
This is tonight, baby.
And remember the date for your diary.
Now, remember what I told you.
Well, look who's here.
Thank you very much.
Where did you come from?
That's all right, son. You did your best.
I know. She treats me that way too.
I don't often try to apologize because I seldom make any mistakes.
I thought we were all even after last night.
Gosh, Sherry, I didn't know you took this whole thing so seriously.
- Don't flatter yourself.
- It's Connie. She's going back home.
Why, what's happened?
Like a sap, she fell in love with a sailor.
Well, look at you.
I don't consider you a sap.
Save that for the high-class patter and genteel dance act.
Connie won't listen.
If she goes back to Bellport...
...she'll just eat her heart out.
Tell me who it is, and I'll bring him back if I have to drag him to her.
She wouldn't want him that way.
Who is he?
Well, with the usual lack of imagination a sailor has...
...he told her his name was Smith.
The call him Bilge.
Bilge Smith? He's my shipmate.
I might have guessed it.
No, seriously, Bilge is a swell guy.
I'll talk to him.
Bake, you don't understand.
Connie wouldn't want him if things had to be explained.
He's stuck on that Iris Manning.
Say, what's she like?
Anything in a uniform.
There, don't you worry about it.
I guess maybe I can take care of this matter.
Captain Hickey, did you guarantee this whole thing personally?
No. Not exactly.
I did tell them I sailed under your father.
And if the amount isn't met, you're in danger of losing your job, aren't you?
Well, I'm kind of sick of being a landlubber anyway.
Don't you worry about it, child.
Goodbye, Miss Connie.
Ahoy, Captain Hickey.
Ahoy, Miss Sherry.
- Well.
- I want you to meet...
...the United States Navy, Bake Baker.
- How do you do, Mr. Baker?
- Captain Hickey.
So this is the young man you've been moping about, eh?
- Well, fair weather.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, I don't suppose you can make it any worse than it is.
You see what you can do with her.
- Hello, Bake.
- Hello, Connie.
Sherry tells me you're leaving.
Well, that's probably the wisest thing to do. Run away.
All this stuff about fighting for your man makes things so complicated.
If all girls would just give up and run back to Bellport...
...then we'd see the end of family life.
Little Junior would remain just an idea...
...and every man would burn his own toast. I thank you.
Well, I'm not leaving.
Staying right here.
There, you see? I told you I'd fix it.
Why, Connie, that's swell.
What happened?
Well, I've been talking to Captain Hickey.
He's about to lose his job for what he's done for me.
I've got to have 700 dollars by Saturday.
Seven hundred dollars? We earn that in a week, but they don't pay it to us.
There, Mr. Baker, is something for you to manage.
What do you say?
I don't know, Baker. if Nolan ever found out, he'd fire me.
All I want is a loan of some scenery and costumes for the one night.
Now, how will he ever know?
Well, let's see.
We had a show called Mum's the Word that folded in four days.
Those costumes were pretty cute, but Nolan never liked them.
You can have those.
Thanks.
And if you ever need a battleship, you can have mine.
- So long, boy.
- So long.
- Hi, Bake.
- Hello, Bake.
You know, rehearsal was called for four bells.
Say, Bake.
Is there going to be some dames in this show with us?
If it's the fairer sex you're referring to, the answer is yes.
- Hello, Sherry.
- Hi.
Lookie there.
How about that, huh?
- These kids offered to help out.
- oh, gee, that's swell of you.
I wish that tall blond angel would adopt me.
You ain't fooling, either.
Hello.
How was heaven when you left?
Tell me, little boy, did you get a whistle or a baseball bat with that suit?
Bomber and his blonds.
Thanks, fellows. I can see you guys don't appreciate high art.
What's the matter, Sherry?
It's Connie. She says she's going back to Bellport after the show, anyway.
I wish there was something we could do for her.
That Manning woman.
Maybe something can be done.
Let's not worry about it now.
We ought to run through the new number.
We haven't been through the dance though.
Let's take a crack at it anyway.
There isn't much time.
Come on, fellows, let's have it, will you?
A flat, fellows.
That's it.
I'm moving my gear up to the chief's quarters.
Mind getting that riveting machine out of the way so that I can get to my locker?
Don't bother me, son.
The show must go on.
Why?
Why? I don't know why, but that's what they always say.
I hear you're putting on a show with the Martin girls.
Yeah.
What are you doing tonight, Bilge?
I've got a date with Mrs. Manning at 10:00.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
"Was I long, darling?"
Was I long, darling?
Was I long, darling?
Was I long, darling?
"And every hour away from you seems like a day."
- Mr. Bake Baker.
- Yes.
Mr. Baker, I'm so happy to see you again.
Oh, thank you.
It's so thoughtful of you to ask me to join your show.
- I see you have the part I sent.
- Yes...
...it's short order to learn by tomorrow night. I spent the afternoon studying it.
- I think I know it quite well.
- That's fine.
I just thought I'd drop in to run through it with you...
- ...since we haven't much time.
- Mr. Smith isn't here yet.
Oh, he'll be here.
Shall we start?
Well, now, I thought we'd make this a sort of a dress rehearsal.
Oh, dress rehearsal?
I'm supposed to wear a negligee.
Yes, it's very important to the scene.
This is going to be a lot of fun, isn't it?
You'll be surprised.
I'll rush and slip one on.
It'll be more effective that way, won't it?
Oh, definitely, yes.
Yes.
Mrs. Manning is waiting on the porch, sir.
Thank you, Benson.
I know, it's Bilgy.
What are you doing here?
Who, me?
I'm here at Mrs. Manning's special invitation.
Have a cigar.
I'll call for a drink for you.
Hey, Max!
What's this all about?
Oh, my being here?
Iris and I have developed a very close friendship...
...ever since the night of her party.
Listen, how far has this thing gone?
Well, you know, Bilge, you and I are both men of the world.
Don't make me laugh.
You wouldn't like to make a little bet or anything, would you?
Any amount you say.
Ten bucks?
All right with me.
You wait out there, and keep your eyes open.
Okay.
Was I long, darling?
Was I long, darling?
Was I long, darling?
Every minute seemed like an hour, babe.
And every hour away from you seems like a day.
You're not expecting anyone, are you?
Well, I was.
But when I heard you could come
I told my servants...
...I wasn't home to anyone but you, Bakey.
And to think we've only known each other these few days.
Of course, there have been other men in my life...
...but they all seem like such petty, unimportant people since I met you.
Yes, I understand.
Tell me, have there ever been any other women in your life?
- You're the first.
- oh, my darling. You make me so happy.
There, there.
Sorry if I'm interrupting anything.
And you're supposed to be my pal.
How dare you enter like this.
What right have you to come prying, forcing yourself into my private life?
- But I...
- Understand this.
I was only playing with you.
And you, poor sap, fell for it.
Will you leave, or do I ring for the butler?
Don't trouble yourself.
Well, how was I?
You were swell. Nobody could've done the part as well as you.
I was confused at the end. Bilgy didn't say his lines the way they were written.
No, but he got the general sense of it.
Isn't Bake here yet?
The boys say he didn't leave in their boat with them.
No one knows what's happened to him.
I might have known. A little thing like this show's just slipped his mind.
I bet he's telling the admiral how to run the fleet.
If he doesn't come, we'll just have to return the money.
Without Bake, we'll have no show.
And without a show, we'll have no Bake.
Why did they let the rest of the men go and keep me?
I've gotta get to that show.
All I know is that orders are your liberty has been cancelled.
I'll bet you did this to get even with me for last night.
Well, if you think I did it, go ask your executive officer.
Okay, admiral, I'll do that.
Seaman Baker to speak with the executive officer.
Just a minute.
Seaman Baker requests to see you, sir.
Permission granted.
Here's Baker now.
- Executive officer will see you.
- Thank you.
Yes, Baker?
I beg your pardon, sir.
I've changed my mind.
Just a moment.
We've been talking about you.
Lieutenant Williams came aboard to discuss you with me.
I'm sincerely sorry about the other evening, sir.
I didn't know you were an officer.
I realize that, Baker.
Lt. Williams has been very generous about the whole thing.
He's just been interceding for you.
Thank you, sir.
May I go ashore now, sir?
Your name is on the report.
The captain will probably scratch it tomorrow at mast.
But until then, you must remain aboard.
- But, sir, I...
- That'll be all, Baker.
Aye, aye, sir.
Well, wise guy, did you get your liberty pass?
Where are you going without liberty?
- Where do you think?
- Wait.
- You crazy?
- I'm not crazy. I'm going.
You know the orders.
I don't care what the orders are. I'm going.
Cut it out, will you?
Gee, kid, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I forgot myself.
Come on, Bake, hit me.
Hey, water taxi. Stand by.
Bake!
What is it, quartermaster?
It's a man jumping ship, sir.
- Do you know who it is?
- Yes, sir.
It's Seaman Baker.
Smith.
Get a detail of men and arrest
Seaman Baker immediately.
Aye, aye, sir.
You've gotta be ready by the third chorus.
Get your clothes on. Hurry, kids.
- Is he here yet?
- No.
Here I am.
- Hello, Sullivan.
- Hello, Mr. Nolan.
Glad to see you taking so much interest in scouting talent.
Yes, Mr. Nolan.
If I'd known you were coming...
- ...I'd have changed my plans.
- oh, that's all right. Glad to see you.
Let's sit together.
Baker sent a note telling me he had a
Monte Carlo idea when the fleet was there.
I'm anxious to see it.
Might be able to use it.
- He's a smart lad.
- In more ways than one.
Sullivan...
...look at that costume.
That's the kind we should've used in Mum's the Word.
Yes, sir.
- Shore patrol coming aboard on duty.
- Aye, aye, sir.
You men patrol the docks and see that he doesn't get off the ship.
Wonder what this is all about.
Hello, Connie.
It's you. What are you doing here?
I've come to arrest Bake.
Arrest Bake? Why?
He jumped ship.
My orders are to bring him back.
Well, couldn't you wait until after the show?
If I don't bring him back right away, it'll cost me my stripes.
Well, I guess you'd better make your arrest then.
He's in there.
Thanks.
Connie, I've been wanting to say this to you, but I...
I don't know how.
Can't we start again, like at the beginning?
I'm afraid you missed the beginning.
This is the end of the show.
You're under arrest, Bake.
I guess I didn't hit you hard enough.
Come on, we gotta get back to the ship.
You win.
You may as well know, that thing with
Iris Manning last night was a gag.
What?
While you were running around with a bottle of peroxide...
...you were passing up a girl you were nuts about.
That's my business.
Tried to make up.
She wouldn't look at me.
I don't blame her.
Do you know why this show's being given?
To help Connie pay off this ship.
Is this the Connie Martin?
It ain't the Joe Doakes.
She didn't tell me she salvaged it.
She salvaged it for you, you sap.
She knew I was going to arrest you, and she told me where you were.
That's the kind of a girl she is.
You go on with this show.
What about the patrol?
I'll stall them off until you get through.
Oh, no, just because I'm in a jam, there's no need for you to get in one.
Those are orders. Do as I tell you.
Maybe they won't be putting us in the same cell together anyway.
Okay, chief.
And we'll sail to China and India, and all those spiggoty places.
With your husband at the helm.
Hey, Bake.
Here's a note for you and Miss Sherry.
It's from Nolan. I told you I'd fix it.
Oh, he asked me to get an answer.
Tell Mr. Nolan we'll be happy to consider his proposition...
...as soon as Mr. Baker gets out of the brig...
...which is one thing he can't fix.
- Okay.
- Wait a minute. one condition.
That is that Miss Martin asks me to marry her.
Well, will you?
You'll have to ask Father.
Get your uniform on.
I can't stall the patrol any longer.
# Happy ending #
# With all our troubles behind #
#Happy ending #
# That's what we're trying to find #
# Why didn't Cinderella waver #
# What made her braver #
# She knew the prince would come and save her #
# Happy ending #
# The best of wonderful times #
# Always ending #
# Just like in nursery rhymes #
# May each thing you pray for #
# Bring you joy and laughter #
# Ever after #
# Happy ending to you all ##
And now for a very important announcement.
Wednesday night at 8:00 over the Federal Broadcasting
Company's coast-to-coast network... the Crackly Grain Flakes Company bring you something new in entertainment... tomorrow's sensation of the airwaves,
Little Miss America.
# You got to eat your spinach, baby #
# That's the proper thing to do #
# It will keep you kind of healthy too #
# And what it did for Popeye it will do for you #
# You got to eat your spinach #
Kent, our program starts next week... and you haven't found me a Little Miss America yet.
I'm beginning to lose faith in the whole idea.
- Mr. Bartlett, if you'll just be patient...
- Patient? Patient?
Look. Look.
All this advertising.
What I can't understand is how you had the colossal nerve... to spread publicity from coast to coast... before you found the right child for the program.
Wait a minute.
You turned down some talented kids... and some of them were very successful radio entertainers.
That's just what was wrong with them.
They weren't what the program calls for, and you know it.
If this thing blows up after it's been announced all over the country... it'll be an irreparable blow to the prestige of Crackly Grain Flakes... and, Kent, I won't have it!
Take your hands off my child.
I will if she'll take her teeth out of my hand.
- You worm. I'll have the Humane Society up here.
- Let go. Ooh!
Say, what do you got in that bag?
I carry it for luck.
Glad you took the horse off it.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Quiet! Now, listen!
Listen!
Now, listen, please! Quiet, ladies!
You'll have to wait your turn:
You sure you got the song right?
Yew, Uncle Harry, but I'm awfully hungry.
Shh. Not so loud. We'll be eating regular soon as I hand these guys the old one-two.
You better not, Uncle Harry.
The last time you gave the old one-two, you came home with a black eye.
That was a crooked game, and can prove it.
Well, honey, when do we start broadcasting?
It's my guess you've never stopped.
Don't be that way, sweetheart.
Isn't this the place that advertised for a kid?
I have here the most sensational, the most extraordinary and thrilling...
So you're another one of those.
I'm afraid you're too late.
Harry Kipper is never too late.
All right, hotshot. Have it your own way.
Child's name and address.
Rebecca Winstead,
950 10th Avenue.
- Where's the man in charge?
- That door.
Thanks, sister.
I'll be seeing you oh the way out.
I can't wait.
You'll have to excuse him.
I've told him not to act that way.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm used to it.
- Would you like some candy?
- Thank you.
We'd really get further in our act if he wouldn't talk so much.
- Is he in the act with you?
- No, I'm the act. He's my manager.
I bet you'd make a better manager than your father.
Uncle Harry's not my father.
He's my stepfather.
I've been taking care of him ever since Mother died.
- Oh, you poor child.
- I'm not a poor child.
- You know, I'm very self-reliant.
- You are?
Yes. My mother told me to always be that way.
Well, Kent, what are we waiting for now?
I'll see what's holding them up.
Orville, let's go.
Okay, chief.
What are you going to sing, little girl?
Frorabelle will now sing
"You Got to Eat Your Spinach, Baby."
Do they all have to sing that song?
Give it to them, Florabelle.
- Now, honey.
- # You got to eat your spinach, baby #
# That's the only thing to do #
Come on.
Snap in to it, sweetheart.
Snap in to it.
#You got to eat your spinach#
"Baby," isn't it?
It's "baby," isn't it? Yes, "baby."
Come on, honey.
You can do better than that. Now-
Mike fright, eh? I know just how you feel. It happened to me once.
- What's she doing that for?
- Stage fright. She can't help it.
What's stage fright?
Well, it's, um-
It's something you'll never get.
- Why?
- Because I trained you. That's why.
You're a trouper.
That kid's just an amateur.
Stop it. Stop it. You're killing me.
If it wasn't for setting a bad example for Florabelle...
I'd pin your ears back.
Come on, doll.
I have here the most sensational, most extraordinary and thrilling-
Say, do you get stage fright?
- No, I'm a trouper.
- Have you got adenoids?
No, but I'll get some if you want them.
Okay. You're next.
Play it good, professor.
Your search is over, son.
If I do say so myself, this child is the most, uh-
Clever child. Clever child.
All right. Go to it.
#What is all this dizzy busy hustling for#
#People running helter-skelter on their way#
# What is all this hazy crazy bustling for #
# No time to notice it's a sunny day #
# Why don't you take a vacation #
# Looks like you've got to have relaxation #
# Aw, come on, forget your troubles for a while #
# Why don't you try to feel like I do #
# If I had one wish to make #
#This is the wish I would choose #
That's great!
Just what I've been looking for
No need to look further.
She's perfect.
Okay, Orville.
That's enough.
I'm sorry, honey.
I guess you're not the type.
I can change my type.
I'm very self-reliant.
But you didn't even let her finish her song!
The chief said he's heard enough, and he's giving orders around here.
Why, he's passing up the most colossal, the most in-
You told him that once before,
Uncle Harry, and it didn't do any good.
That's very true, my child, very true.
You don't know talent when you see it.
It's people like you that'll put radio on the spot today.
Why, at this rate, the big networks will be bankrupt within a year!
Radio Center will be as empty as your head!
Thousands of employees will be thrown out of work, and all because of you!
Bah!
I do all that?
You can't come in here!
You'll have to get out.
Now, please.
- How'd you make out, honey?
- The man said I wasn't the type.
There's nothing wrong with your type.
It's your environment that's not so hot.
Then maybe I should have my- my environment fixed.
- Come, come. Enough of this slumming.
- Hmm.
My goodness.
I thought we were wowing them.
Well, I guess it's time to go home.
It may interest you to know, Rebecca, that we have no home.
That foul landlady locked us out this morning.
Uncle Harry, why are landladies always doing that to us?
It won't happen again. I'm going to give your other relatives a chance to feed you.
Oh, goody!
You mean we’re going to have dinner?
I mean I'm taking you to your
Aunt Miranda's at Sunnybrook Farm.
From now on, you're living with her
But, Uncle Harry, I want to stay here and be a success like my mother wanted me to.
Well, I've done all can for you.
I taught you all know.
Yes. I guess it just wasn't enough.
Good-bye, Mr. Bartlett. I'm glad everything's turned out so well.
So am I, Kent. And don't let anything happen to that little girl.
Without her, there's no program.
- Just tune in next Wednesday night.
- I'll be glued to that radio.
- Yes?
- Okay for the next kid, chief?
What do you mean "the next kid"? Bring in the little girl that just sang, and fast.
Well, I didn't think-You didn't-
I didn't think you liked her.
- She just left.
- She just-What? Get her back here!
I want that kid right now!
Oh, of all the stupid, dumb morons
- Who, me?
- Oh, hello, Lola:
Well, that's a fine greeting after last night's stand-up.
I'm sorry, Lola.
I was busy. I forgot.
I waited three hours for you.
- I said I'm sorry.
- You still haven't told me where you were.
Lola, can't you understand?
I've been busy, and when I say "busy,"
I mean crazy.
I've had kids in my hair day and night.
Now, please don't make it any worse!
- Well, you needn't scream.
- Who's screaming?
Hello. Stoddard?
Did you see a big girl with a little man?
I mean, a little man with a big girl. l-
What's that? They're down there?
Hold them! Stop them! Yes.
Send them back to Kent's office right away.
Oh, Myrtle,
I thought I made a mistake.
Impossible.
All right, all right.
If you insist, then I wasn't working.
I was out with a blonde, a beautiful, gorgeous, luscious blonde.
And we're going to be married next week.
Are you satisfied?
Ah, Tony, we're crazy fighting like this.
It's okay, chief.
They're on their way back up here.
Oh. Hello, Lola.
Hello, love of my life.
Aw, cut it out, Lola.
Can I help it if go all pieces when I see you?
The man and the little girl are here, Mr. Kent.
Oh!
Well, come right in. I'm certainly glad we caught you in time.
When they tapped me on the shoulder,
I thought it was the cops.
But, chief, she isn't-
That isn't-
Keep quiet, Orville. Lola, I want you to get a load of this kid's voice.
She's sensational. Sing me that last chorus of your song, honey.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Please. Oh, wait till he finds out.
- Just listen to this.
- Chief, chief.
Let her go, Florabelle!
#You got to each your spinach, baby #
- Oh.
- Come on. Pull yourself together, sweetheart!
Ouch!
- # You got to eat your spinach #
- That's plenty.
- That's plenty.
- Well, this guy-
- I said that's enough.
- This bird here-
You'll be hearing from me very soon, very soon indeed.
- This guy told us...
- I'll be calling you up someday.
- But this fellow-
- Yes, yes. Good-bye. Good-bye.
- I am going to cut you up and sell you for bait.
- It wasn't my fault.
Do you realize if we don't find that kid,
Bartlett cancels everything?
Careful, Tony. Remember your apoplexy.
I gotta run now, darling.
- Bye, Casanova.
- Good-bye, Lola.
I gotta hand it to you, Orville.
I've been out on a limb before, but I've never had a guy behind me sawing it off.
You realize we're on the worst spot of the century?
You've got nothing to worry about, chief.
We've got the kid's address.
- You have?
- Of course. We've got all their addresses.
- Yes?
- Did you get the addresses of every one of the applicants?
- Yes.
- Well.
That's a load off my mind.
Whew. I'm dead.
Between you and Lola and getting this program set, I'm going screwy.
Why don't you take a run down to Atlantic City for a few days?
Atlantic City. That's the sort of place
I'm trying to get away from.
I'm going up to my farm where I can relax.
Birds, trees, new-mown hay, the simple life.
Well, anyway, that's what I need.
Oh, when you find that kid, be sure you get the contract signed.
Pay her anything she wants!
Well, within reason.
If you make any mistakes,
I'm going to tear your head off and use it for a doorstop.
- Okay, chief. You know me.
- I'm still regretting it.
Now you're going to meet your Aunt Miranda.
I wonder if she'll like me.
You be nice to her, and she'll be nice to you.
Uncle Harry... is this where my mother used to live when she was a little girl?
Yup.
I think I'm going to like it here.
Wait for me.
How do you do?
I guess you must be my Aunt Miranda.
Heavens above.
It's Bess's child.
- How did you ever get here?
- Oh, we drove up on the village bus.
"We"? Who's we?
Why, Uncle Harry and I.
There ought to be a law against loose planks.
- It's a miracle I'm still alive.
- It's no miracle.
It's a calamity. I suppose you want something, as usual.
Let's not start by quarreling, Miranda.
I'm only going to be here a few minutes.
That's long enough for me.
My, this is a very fine boarding house.
This is no boarding house, honey.
I thought everyone took in roomers.
A nice environment you've given her.
I want to have my environment fixed.
- I'll wager the child hasn't had a bit of food.
- Oh, yes, I have.
Uncle Harry bought me a candy bar.
Candy bar?
Take the child in the kitchen and get her something decent to eat.
- Oh, I can help myself.
I'm very self-reliant.
- I'm hungry too.
Let's go together, huh?
My name's Rebecca Winstead.
What's yours?
- I'm Gwen Warren. We're first cousins.
- Oh, are we?
My, it's nice to get-out in the country again.
You certainly have a cozy little place here, Miranda.
Get to the point, Harry.
Well, Miranda, it's this way.
I've had Rebecca on my hands for some time now.
It's been quite a burden. Of course,
I'm only too glad to take care of the child.
Although she really isn't my own, you might say.
But lately I've had several financial reverses, and I thought-
You're trying to tell me you want me to take the child off your hands.
I'd hardly put it that way, Miranda, but that's the general idea.
Listen to me, Harry Kipper.
I'll take Rebecca, but only on one condition.
Promise to let me have her for good, so
I can give her the right kind of upbringing.
I don't want her to come to a bad end like her mother.
Now, now, your sister didn't do so bad.
- You're just against show people.
- Show people!
If Bess hadn't eloped with that opera singer who died without a cent... she wouldn't have had to marry a no-good like you!
- Now, Miranda.
- Don't you "Now, Miranda" me!
Will you promise not to come back here if I take the child?
It's a sacrifice, but I'll go for anything that's good for Rebecca.
- You know me, Miranda.
- Yes, I know you.
- You're probably in a hurry. Good-bye.
- Oh, just one more thing.
I've been sort of short lately, and I thought that maybe-
I wouldn't lend you a cent if it was to save your life, Harry Kipper.
Well, no harm in asking.
Aunt Miranda, you certainly are a good cook.
- Bye-bye, Rebecca. Don't miss me too much.
- I won't, Uncle Harry.
Well, see you folks in church.
Maybe it's for the best.
He has been an awful trial to me.
- Take her up to the side room.
- Come on, darling.
As long as you live here, you'll wear your hair this way.
I like it.
It's so nice and cool.
I wore my hair that way when I was a little girl.
- My, I bet you were pretty.
- Now, get along.
See what you can learn about farming.
All right. I'll introduce myself to the chickens.
I was considered quite a belle in my day.
I'll bet you kicked up your heels when you were young.
The idea.
Stuff and nonsense.
Oh, you poor little thing.
I hope you're all right.
Oh, you bent your tail.
I'll fix it. I'm surprised Aunt Miranda lets you wear it curled.
I'll bet you haven't had any breakfast.
I'll ask Aunt Miranda to give you some eggs and bacon.
Oh, there's your breakfast!
Hurry up, or there won't be any left.
Oh, that's the wrong way.
Come back!
Please come back!
You'll get lost:
For heaven's sake, where are you?
Don't you want your breakfast?
You're a very naughty pig.
Well, hello, stranger.
What's your hurry?
I'm sorry, but I was trying to catch our pig.
- Don't you know you're trespassing?
- What's that mean?
It means you're very welcome.
Thank you, but I must catch our pig.
Wait. I'll round him up.
You stay here andhead him off.
Aunt Miranda! Gwen!
- Aunt Miranda! Gwen!
- Rebecca, what's the matter?
- They fell in the well.
- Who fell in the well?
A pig and the man with the long legs.
- Something wrong, Miss Gwen?
- Someone fell in the well.
- Perhaps it's Homer.
- No, ma'am. There's Homer now.
- Hello Gwen. What's all the rumpus?
- There's a man down there.
It's my boss.
Are you hurt, Mr. Kent?
- We're all right. Get a rope.
- Let's use the hose.
Ouch:
You might have at least taken the nozzle off.
Okay. Haul away.
Everybody, pull.
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't mention it. Nothing at all.
Whew.
I hope you'll pardon my appearance.
I didn't expect callers.
I'm glad you're not hurt.
Or are you?
I'm afraid so.
There's a strange feeling right here.
Oh, I hope it doesn't hurt you too much.
You better let Gwen and me put you to bed.
That would be a pleasant experience.
I think Homer can handle the situation.
Come on, darling.
I'm sorry she bothered you Mr...
Kent is the name. Anthony Kent. I live here, but this is my first trip of the year.
I hope you'll bother again soon.
I've got a lot of other tricks.
I'd love to see them.
Will you do one now?
I'd better clean up first.
How 'bout tomorrow?
Perhaps. Come on, darling.
- Homer, see the ladies to the door.
- Yes, sir.
I'll hold the pig.
Over we go.
Gwen! Haven't I told you to keep out of that place?
The place is all right, Auntie.
In fact, it's quite nice.
- Besides, I had to help Rebecca.
- What were you doing in there?
Now, Miranda, it wasn't her fault.
- Your pig ran away, and she had to chase it.
- Is that my pig?
- Yes, Aunt Miranda.
- Tell that man to give it to Aloysius.
But he's right here.
Why don't you tell him?
'Cause I refuse to speak to him.
Aunt Miranda says for you to give the pig to Aloysius... and she refuses to speak to you.
I'm used to it. She's refused to speak to me for 25 years.
You can tell Homer Busby he's not fit to touch my pig... and he's a no-good loafer!
You're not fit to touch our pig, and you're no-good loafer.
- But I don't think so.
- I'm glad someone's got a kind word for me.
See you again soon, Rebecca.
- Tell him he will not!
- Oh, yes, I will.
After this, stay on your own side of the fence!
Such people!
- What does Homer do?
- He takes care of Mr. Kent's place.
Why doesn't
Aunt Miranda like him?
Well, a long time ago, Homer asked Aunt Miranda to marry him.
- Is that why she's mad at him?
- Not exactly.
You see, Homer celebrated so much the night before that he forgot to go to the wedding.
Mr. Kent is very nice too.
Don't you think?
We were talking about Homer.
Come on. Help me pick berries.
Oh, Aloysius, give Rebecca a pail and show her how to pick berries.
Yes, ma'am. It's a pleasure.
Yes, ma'am. It's a pleasure.
Now, honey, you just watch me.

- See who's at the door, Homer.
- Yes, sir.
- Why hello there.
- How do you do, Mr. Busby?
I would like to see Mr. Kent.
Well, that might be arranged.
Come right on in.
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.
You may tell him
Miss Winstead is calling.
Well, that would make it more official.
Uh, that little girl from next door wants to see you, Mr. Kent.
- Oh, so I see.
- You said you'd announce me as Miss Winstead, Mr. Busby.
You'll have to forgive Homer,
Miss Winstead. He's out of practice.
- Oh, that's all right.
- Won't you have some breakfast with me?
We had our breakfast a long time ago... but if it were lunch,
I would love to.
Lunch it is then.
Homer, lunch for the lady.
I'll try. You know how the cook is about digging up things at the last minute.
The servant problem gets more difficult every day, don't you think?
I guess it must be terrible.
- Will you have a glass of milk?
- Thank you. I'd like that.
You have an awfully pretty house, Mr. Kent.
I'm glad you like it,
Miss Winstead.
My, but that's good.
Don't look now, Miss Winstead, but there's milk on your nose.
Dear me. I don't know how it could have gotten there.
- May I?
- I guess you better.
- Ah. There you are.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
Awfully glad you dropped in.
- I can stay for a minute.
- Do you have to hurry?
Aunt Miranda won't like it if I'm gone too long. She's sold-fashioned.
Oh. I know just what you mean.
I knew you would if I explained it to you.
This is all I could dig up.
Oh, that's all right.
I eat most anything.
My, Mr. Kent, but I'm having a good time.
So am I, Miss Winstead.
I've never enjoyed entertaining a lady so much before.
Thank you.
You may call me Rebecca, if you like.
And I'd appreciate it if you'd call me Tony.
Pardon me, madam. Miss Gwen is here and says your lunch is ready at home.
Homer, where are your manners?
Ask her in.
I hope Gwen will like it here as much as I do.
Rebecca, I grow fonder of you by the minute. Hello there.
I'm sorry to intrude... but Aunt Miranda got worried when Rebecca didn't come home for lunch.
I'll take the blame. Rebecca dropped in for a call, and I insisted that she stay.
- Won't you sit down?
- I'm afraid I can't.
You better, Gwen.
The food's awful good.
You really can't afford to pass this up.
All right, but no lunch for me, and
I can only stay a minute.
That's what I said, and I'm still here!
Believe it or not, I was hoping
I'd see you today.
I always say neighbors should be, well, uh, neighborly.
- What do you always say?
- I always say that depends on the neighbors.
I can see we're going to get along great:
Hello. Could you direct me to Mr. Kent's house, please?
- You're looking right at it, bub.
- Oh, thanks.
Just a minute.
I'll have to introduce you first.
Aw, come on. This is important.
I'm Mr. Kent's assistant.
Hold your horses, bub, and wait till I introduce you.
Keep your eye on him, Al.
- I got my eyes right on him.
- How do you like... Ooh!
Would you mind pointing that the other way?
There's a sort of a simple-looking person outside.
Says he's got to see you.
Claims he's your assistant.
- Orville? Will you excuse me a moment?
- Sure.
- Could I get you some more turkey, madam?
- No, thank you.
I think I have enough.
Well, Orville, I didn't expect to see you down here.
- Nothing's wrong, I hope.
- No, everything's going to be okay.
You did find the kid all right, didn't you?
- Well, it's this way. See, the detectives-
- Did you find that kid?
- Now, don't get excited.
- Did you find her?
- Chief, there are a lot of other kids.
- Quit stalling, Orville.
- What's happened?
- Well, chief, I lost Little Miss America.
What? What do you mean you've lost her?
It wasn't my fault. We went to her address, and she'd gone.
I tell you, we even hired detectives.
- That kid has vanished from the face of the Earth.
- That's what you're going to do.
- Do you realize what you've done to me?
- No, wait a minute.
- I'll never explain this to Bartlett.
- You won't have to.
- I told him already.
- You what?
- What did he say?
- Well, for a minute he didn't say anything.
Then I couldn't understand him.
Why, you-
Hello, Operator.
I want New York.
I want to speak to Mr. Cyrus Bartlett,
Ryan Lender 51680.
Informs me...
Yes?
- Mr. Kent on long distance.
- Hello?
- Hello. Mr. Bartlett?
- Yeah!
This is Kent. Tony Kent.
Look here, Kent, you sold me on the idea of-
##I'd want an old straw hat a sui9t of overalls ##
Just a minute, Mr. Bartlett.
You're going a little too far.
We can straighten out everything.
Why, you-You've ruined-
You've scuttled my product!
The failure of this program... will be an insurmountable affront to the dignity of Crackly Grain Flakes!
And, Kent, I'll get you for this!
I'll... I'll... I'll...

I've been trying to tell you...
I've got Little Miss America!
Wait. Listen.
- Listen!

And don't hang up!
Hello?

Give me a hand!
Oh!
Get over here.
Keep playing. Loud.
Let's go.
Come on, Rebecca!
Come on. Come on, honey.
Sing another chorus right here under the phone. Play it, will ya?
Give it everything you got, honey.

Did you hear that, Mr. Bartlett?
Of course she's right here.
That's what I called to tell you.
Oh, that. Uh, uh-
My assistant was just playing a practical joke.
Oh, you're right. It wasn't very funny.
He's never very funny.
Yes, Mr. Bartlett.
Everything's fine.
In fact, everything's beautiful.
Good-bye, Mr. Bartlett.
Whew.
Well, I put it over, chief.
I knew I'd find her.
I still can't believe it.
Why, it's marvelous.
- But what, Mr. Kent?
- It's uncanny!
We had a kid all set for a big program.
She disappeared, and now it turns out to be Rebecca.
Why, it sounds like a fairy tale.
- It is!
- I love fairy tales.
My old pal, Rebecca!
I was crazy about you before, but now- Ohh!
Why didn’t you tell me you tried out for my program?
But I didn’t know it was your program.
- Am I going on the radio after all?
- You bet you are!
Why, you'll be a sensation.
Oh, I don't think
Aunt Miranda will like it.
Don't you worry about Aunt Miranda.
I'll sell her a bill of goods.
Going to have to be a mighty good salesman, Mr. Kent.
Rebecca tells me Aunt Miranda is rather old-fashioned.
- She's mighty peculiar.
- I'm glad I brought you, Homer.
Having along an old friend of Aunt Miranda's... ought to get me off on the right foot.
I'm warn you again... It won't none to have me along.
I've known Miranda for 25 years, and
I can't rightly say understand her yet.
- Maybe I'd better wait out here.
- Wait a minute.
That's no way to talk to the chief.
Where's your loyalty?
We got to pull together.
Orville, I think you'd better pull from out here, where you can't do any damage.
Oh, now, chief-
Hello.
Have you told
Aunt Miranda anything yet?
No. Gwen thought it would be better to surprise her.
- Aunt Miranda isn't in a very good humor today.
- Oh-oh.
Where are you going, Homer?
It just came to me sort of sudden-like.
Maybe I'd be in the way, hmm?
I'm depending on you.
Aunt Miranda, this is Mr. Kent.
How do you do, Miss Wilkins?
How are you?
What's that man doing in my house?
- Why, l... l...That is, l...
- Now, Miranda...
Rebecca, tell that man to get out of my house.
I think Aunt Miranda wants you to leave, Mr. Busby.
All right.
I guess I can take a hint.
But you can tell her for me it isn’t Christian to hold a grudge so long.
- Mr. Busby says it isn't
Christian to hold a-
- I heard him.
You did?
Mr. Kent, I don't thank you for bringing that no-good-
Auntie, I don't think
Mr. Kent understands.
I assure you, I had no idea there'd been a breach between you and Mr. Busby.
Breach? I don't even know that Mr. Busby's on Earth.
I quite understand,
Miss Wilkins.
I can see now there couldn't possibly be any community of interest... between a lady of your background and a man like Homer.
Hmm. Won't you sit down, young man?
Thank you, Miss Wilkins.
I knew you'd like Tony, Aunt Miranda.
Tony?
Yes. That's short for Anthony.
I have a great surprise for you,
Miss Wilkins.
I've been connected with radio a long time... but never have I met a more talented child than Rebecca.
Fortunately, she's just what we need for a big program we're starting.
- Why, Rebecca's personality and voice are two of the most...
- Just a minute, young man!
Are you trying to tell me you want to put Rebecca on the radio?
Why, yes, on a very important program.
A nationwide hookup-
- Get out of here!
- B... B... But, Miss Wilkins,
I don't understand. l...
Auntie, please listen to Mr. Kent.
I want to go on the radio so bad.
- You keep out this
- This is a very important opportunity for Rebecca.
- Surely you can't say no.
- Oh, can't I?
Well, just listen to this, Mr. Kent... No!
I know what you theatrical people are- a no-good lot:
I took Rebecca out of that unwholesome atmosphere... and I'm not going to put her back into it.
She's going to stay right here where I can keep an eye on her.
- But, Miss Wilkins, I...
_ Mr. Kent, I'm asking you to leave.
- If that's the way you feel, there's nothing more to say.
- Indeed, there isn't.
All right, Miss Wilkins, but you're making a serious mistake.
I don't want to hear this subject mentioned again.
And, Rebecca, if you go near that man again...
I'll take you over my knee and give you a spanking you'll never forget.
That goes for both of you.
How much you have to pay her, chief?
Pay her?
Why, we didn't even get her.
Tony! Waite minute!
The charming Miss Wilkins practically tore my head off.
- She was awfully mean to you, Tony.
- It looks hopeless.
Once Aunt Miranda makes up her mind, she's too stubborn to change it.
I've been trying to change it for 25 years.
I'm afraid this is good-bye.
I've got to get back to New York and straighten out this mess.
We're sorry you're going.
I'm none too happy over it myself, but I'll be back.
Good-bye, Tony.
I wish I could sing you over the telephone, like I did to Mr. Bartlett.
- Tony, why not?
- What do you mean?
Broadcast from here.
It's possible, isn't it?
Why, yes, it could be done by remote control.
Sure, chief!. We could run wires down like we did on the courthouse.
Then the kid could stay in the program.
Oh, please try it. With all her talent,
Rebecca deserves a chance.
Oh, Tony, please do!
It's insane, but I don't see why it won't work.
Uh-oh. What about Aunt Miranda?
Well, we won't tell her. And you can
Depend on us to keep her in the dark.
You bet we will.
We're very "inescapable."
I don't know.
Miranda's a mighty peculiar woman.

- You've just heard the
Crackly Grain Flake...
- Never mind the commercial.
Boys, that was a swell rehearsal.
Knock off and get your feed.
We go on the air in a couple of hours.
Come and get it!
You'd better relax too.
It won't be long now, Rebecca. Nervous?
Of course not. I never get nervous.
I'm very self-reliant.
I don't mind saying
I'm shaking like a leaf.
Well, well!
If it isn't Farmer Gray.
How are all the crops?
- Nice of you to show up for the broadcast anyway.
- Darling, don't be that way.
I suppose I should cheer when you miss a rehearsal.
- Now you know how I feel when you keep me waiting!
- Uh, Miss Warren, Miss Lee.
Miss Lee is an old friend.
- How do you do, Miss Lee?
- Hello, Miss Warren.
I've always wanted to meet a farmer's daughter.
Ig led known you were coming,
I'd have worn my sun bonnet.
And this is Rebecca, the star of our program.
Oh, isn't she cute.
How old are you, little one?
I'm eight. How old are you?
That's a question you must never ask a lady.
Oh. I guess you must be pretty old.
Sweet little thing, isn't she?
We'd better be going
Before Aunt Miranda gets suspicious.
That's right. We don't want anything like that to happen.
Don't worry about a thing.
Homer and I know exactly what to do.
That was a sweet greeting. You practically broke my arm when I tried to kiss you.
- Couldn't you have at least waited until they'd gone?
- Oh, so that's it.
A barnyd romance. No wonder you wanted to broadcast from this outpost.
That blonde hayseed's got you doing nip-ups.
- Don't start anything, Lola.
That kid means a lot to me.
- Yeah?
Which kid are you talking about?
- Chief, I couldn't find Lola anywhere.
- Keep looking, Orville.
- You'll find her.
- Not if I can help it.
Oh! Lola!
I'm sure glad to see you.
- Thanks, my pet.
- Lola.
- There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
- Shoot.
Maybe I better tell you some other time.
Aw, come on, Orville.
Let's have it.
Well, I don't know whether I should... because this is sort of a secret.
I won't tell a soul.
Well, uh, there’s a certain party... that's crazy about you.
- Yes?
- Yes.
And because of certain circumstances... this party is afraid to tell you just how he feels.
Oh, how ridiculous.
Why, when a man loves a girl, he should take her in his arms, smother her with kisses... and tell her he adores her.
All right then. I will.
Lola, I adore you.
Oh!
- Were you talking about yourself?
- Sure, Lola.
- Couldn't you go for a guy like me?
- Yeah, with an ax.
With an-
I was afraid of that.
- I guess the only one you can see is Tony.
- That's right.
We'll be seeing it with orange blossoms any day now.
- Well, congratulations.
- Aw, Cheer, Orville.
Let's run over the number. Pete, will you give us "Alone With You," please?
# I've always known that three's a crowd #
# Only two may dance #

Rebecca should be here now.
She goes on in five minutes.
- She'll be here, all right.
- I hope so.
- What if she can't make it?
- I've got a two-minute emergency ready.
- After that, we're sunk.
- Oh.
- You didn't, by any chance, have anything to do with this?
- I didn't do a thing.
So the doctor said to me,
"Mrs. Turner, in my 20 years of practice...
I've never seen a case like yours before."
So he called right away, and they rushed me to the hospital.
What's gotten into you, Rebecca? You've been yawning and fidgeting ever since dinner.
I'm so sleepy... and this horsehair tickles.
Where are your manners, child?
I don't know what ails her, Mrs. Turner.
- Don't you think Rebecca ought to go to bed?
- Might as well.
Better than falling asleep here in our laps.
Good night!
Rebecca!
Come right back here!
Didn't you forget something, Rebecca?
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
Good night, Reverend Turner.
Good night, Mrs. Turner.
Land's sakes. I never did see a child so eager to go to bed.
I think I'll go up and help her.
Since when couldn't Rebecca undress herself?
- But the poor little thing's so sleepy.
- Well!
Gwen, there's something wrong with my whistler.
If mine's out of order, we're sunk.
- That's the signal.
- Let's go.
- You Hold it steady, Al.
I'll go up and get her.
- If I don't hold it, skip it.
We're late.
What kept you?
- Mrs. Turner's operation.
- Is the ladder safe?
- I built it myself.
- Just the same, you better hold it up from here.
Shh.
You better get her on it.
Come on, honey. We've got to hurry.
Program is half over now.
- Gwen!
- Hang on.
- Yes, Auntie?
- What's going on up there?
Oh, it's nothing.
I just knocked over a rocking chair.
Well, you're old enough to know better.
Yes, Auntie.
Shh.
That was a close call.
You better stay up here until they bring Rebecca back.
This way, dear.
The doctor told me he operated just in time.
- Have another piece of kake.
- I've already had two.
- You've had three, but you're welcome.
- Oh, that reminds me.
Henry, what time is it?
Surely you're not thinking of leaving, Mts. Turner?
Oh, no, but I did want to hear that new
Crackly Grain Flakes Hour on the radio.
8:10, dear.
Oh, my. It's started already.
- Uh, may I?
- Well, no. It's not working, I don't think.
There was nothing wrong with it this morning, I'm sorry to say.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the high spot of our program.
Crackly Grain Flakes takes pleasure in presenting everybody's little girl... healthy, happy
Little Miss America.
Her first song will be
"Come and Get Your Happiness."

Land's sakes, that’s peculiar!
If I didn't know Rebecca was upstairs in bed...
I'd swear that was her voice on the radio.
Well, it did sound like Rebecca, but of course it couldn't possibly be.
Maybe not, but she's gotten mighty heavy all of a sudden.
Now, Auntie...
Rebecca? Are you asleep?
Yes, Auntie.
- Homer Busby, get off that bed!
- Miranda.
- You're talking to me.
- Course I'm talking to you.
- Take me to Rebecca.
- I've waited we years for this moment.
- Fiddlesticks.
- Oh, don't be stubborn any longer.
We're wasting the best gears of our livers.
Homer Busby, you're revolting.
Come on, Mirandy. Give in.
How do I know I can trust you after the way you acted?
I swear I'll never keep you waiting again.
Give me one more chance.
Are you sure you got all the wild oats out of your system?
Congratulations, you two.
There's no time for this folderol.
Where is she?
Take me to her!
Come on!
And now, before we sign off, our little star has another number for you.
What would you like to sing for us?
What would you like me to sing, Mr. Smithers?
I'm sure everyone would like to hear you sing the songs...
- that have made a lot of people happy.
- All right.
# My dear radio audience #
# Now I shall do #
# Some of the songs I've had the pleasure of introduction to you #
# It was not so very long ago #
# When you heard this little ditty #
# On your radio, oh #
# On the good ship
Lollipop #
# It's a sweet trip to a candy shop #
# Where bonbons play #
# On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay #
# And do you remember #
# Animal crackers in my soup #
# Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop #
# Gosh, oh, gee but I have fun #
# Swallowing animals one by one #
# And I never ever will forget my grandest thrill #
# The very first time that I sang #
# An ordinary day becomes a holiday #
# When I'm with you #
# Mmm, mmm #
# I have lots of toys but I don't want to play #
# Yes, and I'll never forget it #
# I sat in my daddy's lap and whispered #
# Oh, Daddy, how I miss you #
# You're busy all your life #
# I long to hug and kiss you #
# Marry me and let me be your wife #
#Ah, but it’s great to reminisce #
# When I sang to my little Dutch dolly #
#J ust like this #
# Sometimes I ought to haste you #
# You make me feel so blue #
# But honest I can't haste you #
# When you smile at me main lovely popgun #
# Ach, main goodness #
The clock is ticking the hours away.
# And so, my radio audience #
# The time has come #
# For me to say #
# Good night, my friends #
# The tired old moon is descending #
# Good night, my friends #
# My moment with you now is ending #
And so I must leave you with kindest regards... from Rebecca and Crackly Grain Flakes... the grain flake that makes your tummy...
Say yum, yum, yummy.
I want all my little friends to close their eyes and dream... for in the morning, it's Crackly Grain Flakes... some sugar and cream.
Eat it with a smile, and life will be worthwhile.
Now, in conclusion... please join me in singing my theme.
# Good night, my friends #
# Sleep tight, my friends #
# God bless you
Pleasant dreams #
Nighty-night.
- That was Rebecca.
- Go on. You're daffy.
Oh, am I? I know that kid when I hear.
I've heard her a thousand times.
What would she be doing on a big hookup like that?
I told you when you married me you'd be in the dough, didn’t I?
Come on. Get dressed.
Adorable!
Come on, folks. Hurry up.
Miss Winstead,
I think you're wonderful.
- You mean, the program was all right?
- Who cares about the program?
- Miss Winstead, I love you.
- And I love you too, Tony.
I don't know how
I ever got along before I met you.
Tony, when I grow up, would you marry me
Rebecca, I've never received a more flattering proposal, but it won't work out.
By the time you're ready to get married,
I'll have a long, gray beard.
Then would you marry Gwen?
She's almost ready.
Rebecca, will you give me a kiss?
They just can't resist you, can they, Tony?
How 'bout running down to the village with me?
I can't. I've got to wrap up Little
Miss America and put her back where I found her.
So far, everything's gone like clockwork.
- I'm afraid the clock's going to stop, Tony.
- Huh?
Now, Miss Wilkins, I don't want you to say anything until you hear my side of this.
Young man, what are you going to pay Rebecca?
Well- Huh?
But, Aunt Miranda, I don't want any pay.
I love to sing.
Then you don't mind, Miss Wilkins?
Course I mind. I'm not going to have my niece a big radio star and not get paid for it.
You won't have a thing to worry about,
Miss Wilkins. I assure you.
- You're an old dear.
- You're a honey, Aunt Miranda.
- Hmm.
- How about me?
Homer Busby, you're an old fool.
But you can't wait much longer, Aunt Miranda.
She's right, Mirandy.
I got my rig out here if you want to take a ride in the moonlight.
Go on, Auntie. I'll be along later.
Homer Busby, you always were impulsive.
Come on, Rebecca.
But, Miranda, I thought that after all these years...
Nonsense! It's past Rebecca's bedtime and mine too.
Come along. Good might!
Tony, darling, if Miss What’s Here Name doesn't mind, I'd like to speak with you.
- Will you pardon me, Gwen?
- Oh, don't bother about me.
I'll be right back.
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.
- Gee, it was a swell program, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.
- Wasn't she wonderful?
- Rebecca’s all right.
- Uh, yes, she is, but I meant Lola.
- Oh.
- Oh, gosh, she's sweet.
- So it's like that, is it?
Well, only on my side.
She's crazy about the chief.
Oh, really?
Gee, he's a lucky guy.
He gets everything guy.
- Yes, I... I suppose he does.
Good night, Orville.
- Good night.
Where's Gwen?
Oh, think she started for home.
Gwen.
- Pardon me, but haven't you forgotten something?
- I don't think so.
Well, think again. A fella named Kent is going to take you home.
- You think again.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
- Gwen, what is all this about?
- Please, it isn't anything.
- Tony, darling:
Is it Lola that's worrying you?
Lola? Mm-mmm. Let's forget it.
Good night.
Now I'm going to make a gingerbread man.
Now I think I'll make a moon.
Now I thing a heart.
Now a star.
Gwen, when these are done, let's take some over to Tony.
Well, I'll be too busy, but you can take some over to him.
- Don't you like Tony anymore?
- Well, of course I like him.
You sounded like you're mad at him.
Now, Melba, act nice to the kid.
You don't have to tell me how to act.
So, all right, honey.
I got it twice.
- We could sue them for that.
- That's an idea.
Oh, run along, will you, and see who's at the door?
Hello there, honey.
How's tricks? Meet the missus-
- Your new mother.
- How do you do?
Hello, kid. How about a kiss?
- No, Thank you.
- Fresh, eh?
- Aunt Miranda!
- Aunt Miranda!
- What a dump!
Isn’t it a laugh? Wait till you see Aunt Miranda. She'll kill you.
- I hope not.
- Hey, come on in. Get a load of this.
- What do you think of it?
- I wouldn't like it if I was a moth.
Well, well!
A long time no see, folks.
Meet the new missus.
And this is my attorney Singer.
- Pleased to meet you.
- I thought you weren't coming back here, Harry Kipper.
It's this way, Miranda. I been doing all right, just got married and all.
And I'm ready to take Rebecca back now.
You do no such thing! You gave the child up once, and you can't take her back now.
Now, now, now, now, Miranda, there's no reason we can't be friendly about this.
I'd as soon be friendly with a rattlesnake.
It's obvious you've heard Rebecca on the radio and you're after her money.
It's Harry's kid, isn’t it? We got more right to her dough than you have.
Don't let them take me away,
Aunt Miranda. I didn't like it with him.
Now, honey, you'll have a swell time with me.
You can have anything you want.
Then I want to stay here!
Oh, Mr. Kipper, you can't take Rebecca away.
She's been happier here than she's ever been in her whole life.
- Now you get out of my house!
- Not without the kid, we don't.
I don't want to get tough about this,
Miranda, but you're asking for it.
You just try and take her.
Now, my dear madam, all this yelling isn't going to get us anyplace.
And don't forget that Mr. Kipper is the child's stepfather and legal guardian.
The courts of New York have decreed that he shall have custody of the child.
Here are the papers.
Now, madam, if you'll take the advice of a lawyer... who's looking out for your interest... as well as my own client's, you'll see that this child parks her things and gets out of here.
He's right, Auntie.
There's nothing we can do about it now. et y pac, kid. Go on.
I'll help.
I warn you, Harry Kipper.
You better take good care of the child.
Say, didn't I always treat her right?
Don't worry. I'll handle the kid like she was my own.
Sure!
Maybe if I work hard, Uncle Harry will let me come back for the visit.
Of course, darling.
Maybe you and Aunt Miranda can come to the city and see me too.
You bet we will.
I guess I won't need these in the city.
Will you save them for me, for when I come back?
Don't cry, Gwen.
You said you'd come and see me.
I brought you some cookies to eat on the way.
Thank you, Aunt Miranda.
I'm going to miss your cookies.
And here's a picture of me, so you won't forget what I look like.
Of course, it isn't a very good likeness.
It was taken 20 years ago.
- I'll never forget you, Aunt Miranda.
- Oh, of course you will.
Please, Aunt Miranda,
I don't want to leave.
Go on, now. Go on.
We haven't got all day.
Here, honey.
They're taking enough time. That kid must have more clothes than I've got.
- All set, kid?
- Yes.
- Come on.
- Good-bye, Gwen. Good-bye, Aunt Miranda.
So long, folks.
See you in church.
Bye, Aloysius.
I'm going away.
- I sure hate to see you go, Miss Rebecca.
- Oh, I'll be back.
Sure, you will, honey.
And don't forget this.
I won't.
Take good care of yourself, Rebecca.
I will, Aunt Miranda.
I'm very self-reliant.
Good-bye, darling.
Come on.
- Good morning, Gwen.
- Hello. Is Mr. Kent home?
He'll be right out.
- Well, good morning.
- I hate to be a bother, but I had to see you.
I was hoping I'd see you before I went back to New York.
- Gwen, what was wrong last night?
- Oh, I was rude, and I'm sorry.
But that isn't what
I came over here for.
Something terrible happened, and you've got to help me. Rebecca's gone.
Gone? But how?
What happened?
Her stepfather came back with a court order.
But he can't take her.
I'm going to put her under contract.
It's too late.
They've already gone to New York!
- Come on and pack. We got to get Rebecca.
- All right.
Baby Bath invites you to the premiere of a new series of programs... starring that cheerful little earful,
Little Miss Universe.
Remember, if you want your child to have a perfect skin... use Baby Bath, The velvet soap.
To start things off, smiling Frankie Lee and his Baby Bathers... bring you that new song sensation,
"Wash Your Troubles Away."
- Here we are, Mr. Purvis.
- Well, we're on our way, Kipper.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Purvis.
If you handle the kid right, she'll make you a fortune.
You're lucky yourself with this contract.
We'd feel a lot luckier if you'd give us a little advance.
If Rebecca clicks tonight as she did at rehearsal, you'll get a big, fat check tomorrow.
I still can't understand why you sold her to me instead of to Kent.
Well, first come, first serve, Mr. Purvis.
I've been waiting for a long time to put something over on Tony Kent.
Will he burn when he hears that his Little
Miss America is now my Little Miss Universe.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear me.
- Anything wrong, mister?
- I'm almost a nervous breakdown.
I get this way before every program.
Oh, are you going on the radio now?
Well, that's just what makes me so nervous. I never know.
Then why don't you ask somebody?
Well, they don't know either.
This is certainly a funny radio station.
Why, my dear young lady, there's nothing funny about in. lim an organist, one of the best, if I may say so.
- Hamilton Montmarcy.
Perhaps you've heard of me?
- I don't think so.
Well, there you are. Nobody has.
You see, I'm an emergency musician.
But there's never any emergencies around here.
You mean, people get sick and can't go on the radio?
Well, that was the idea when they hated me, but nobody ever gets sick around here.
I've waited 10 months, and there hasn't been so much as a bad cold.
Don't worry, Mr. Montmarcy.
Somebody’ll be sick any day now!
I certainly hope sp.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
- Gwen! Tony!
- Hello, honey.
Darling! Oh!
- Well!
- Purvis, you put over a fast one, didn't you?
- All's fair, you know, kent.
- I'll give goy &100,000 for Rebecca's contract.
- Ha! Not a chance.
But, Mr. Purvis, this isn't just a business matter.
It is to me... big business
Little Miss Universe goes on the air in a minute.
There's a couple of seats in the auditorium, if you care to listen.
A hundred thousand bucks, and you had to sell her to Purvis.
- Well, that's that.
- Can't I go back with you and Tony?
I'm afraid not, darling.
- At least not for a little while.
- But I don't wanna stay here.
I know, but you can't always have everything you want right when you want it.
But we'll get you back with us someday.
I guess I won't be able tp sing for you now, Tony.
Mmm. Don't you worry about that, honey.
Singing for me isn't important anymore.
It's just that we want you with us.
It may take time, so you've got to be a brave little girl.
- I will, Tony.
- We'll be listening to you, so do your best.
- Come on, Gwen.
- Good-bye, darling.
All right.
Here's your cue.
And here comes your cheerful little earful,
Little Miss Universe... bringing you that charming melody, "Old Straw Hat".
# If I had one wish to make #
#This is the wish...#
Let's try it again.
Please.
# If I had one wi...#
Want to try it again?
- What’s the matter with your voice/
- I can't talk.
- What is the matter?
- Go on and sigh. Go on.
You're getting paid for it.
- Do you want a glswof water?
- I can't talk.
- Go on. Do something.
- What is the matter?
- Sing in there.
- I can't talk.
- Poor baby.
- I'll get a doctor.
Hey. Montmarcy, you're on!
Studio "B".
- I'm on? Oh.
- Yeah.
Oh. Oh. Oh, I'm on.
Oh, dear. I'm on.
Oh. I'll be back in a minute.
I'm on.
Wonderful.
Isn't it marvelous?
How wonderful.
You will now hear an organ recital by Hamilton Montmarcy.
Oh. Okay.
Because of conditions beyond our control... our program will continue with selected recordings.
- I knew something would go wrong.
- Shut up!
- I can't...
- You shut up too!
If you don't want the licking of your life, tell me the truth.
- Did Kent put you up to this?
- No. I can't talk.
Kipper, you knew this when you sold me the kid!
I'll stake my professional integrity that this is a frame-up.
- Dr. Hill is here.
- Ah! Now we'll know whether it's a frame-up or not.
- Where's the patient?
- This little girl here.
Well, you look healthy enough to me.
What's wrong with you?
I can't talk.
She claims something happened to her voice.
And, Doc, if the little brat's stalling,
I'll slather silly.
Mmm, we'll see. Is there someplace where I can examine her?
You can examine her right in here, Doctor.
Thank you. Come on.
I'm sorry.
If this little girl is really sick, you'll need a doctor too.
- Where's Rebecca?
- She's in there with the doctor.
- Oh, darling.
- What's wrong, honey?
I can't t...
- Well, Doc?
- Oh, there's no question about it.
It's partly a psychogenic condition, and partly the result of straining the child's voice.
Doc, you mean the kid can't work?
Oh, she won't be able to sing or even to talk very clearly.
But with a complete rest for a year or two, she may get over it.
Well, Kipper, there's your contract.
Don't you worry, honey.
It's kind of fun to whisper anyway.
Come in here, you two.
Look, Kipper.
I think Rebecca should be with her aunt.
After all, she's not much use to you now.
I'll give you $5,000 if you turn over your legal guardianship to Aunt Miranda.
Well, now, um, the kid means a lot to me.
- Don't be a sucker! Take it.
- Okay.
Drop up to my office in the morning.
- You can get the money as soon as you sign the papers.
- How about a little advance?
Here's a hundred dollars to clinch the deal.
Well, so long, kid.
See you in church.
Thank you, Tony.
I imagine these are the good friends you told me about.
Doctor, isn't there anything we can do for Rebecca?
That depends on the circumstances.
Sometimes these things clear up rather suddenly.
Good-bye.
Good night, Rebecca.
Good-bye, Doctor. And thanks!
I hope I can do the same for you some day.
Rebecca!
What a smarty you turned out tube.
I always told you
I was very self-reliant.

"Among the rugged peaks that frown down upon the Borgo Pass
"are found crumbling castles of a bygone age."
I say, driver, a bit slower.
No, no!
We must reach the inn before sundown.
And why, pray?
It is Walpurgis Night, the night of evil.
Nosferatu.
On this night, madam, the doors, they are barred and to the Virgin we pray.
I say, porter.
Don't take my luggage down.
I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
No, no, please.
Put that back up there.
The driver, he is afraid.
Walpurgis Night.
Good fellow, he is.
He wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise.
Well, I'm sorry, but there's a carriage meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight.
- Borgo Pass?
- Yes.
Whose carriage?
Count Dracula's.
Count Dracula's?
Yes.
Castle Dracula?
Yes, that's where I'm going.
To the castle?
Yes.
No. You mustn't go there.
We people of the mountains believe at the castle there are vampires!
Dracula and his wives.
They take the form of wolves and bats.
They leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living.
Oh, but that's all superstition.
Why, I can't understand why...
Look, the sun.
When it is gone, they leave their coffins.
Come. We must go indoors.
But wait! I mean, just a minute, I...
What I'm trying to say is that I'm not afraid.
I've explained to the driver that it's a matter of business with me.
I've got to go. Really.
Well, good night.
Wait. Please.
If you must go, wear this, for your mother's sake.
It will protect you.
The coach from Count Dracula?
Hey, driver!
I say, driver, what do you mean by going at this...
I am Dracula.
It's really good to see you.
I don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and...
Well, and with all this,
I thought I was in the wrong place.
I bid you welcome.
Listen to them.
Children of the night.
What music they make.
The spider spinning his web for the unwary fly.
The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.
Why...
Yes.
I'm sure you will find this part of my castle more inviting.
Well, rather.
It's quite different from outside.
Oh, and the fire, it's so cheerful.
I didn't know, but that you might be hungry.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you, but I'm a bit worried about my luggage.
You see, all your papers were in...
I took the liberty of having your luggage brought up.
Allow me.
Oh, yes.
Thanks.
I trust you have kept your coming here a secret.
I've followed your instructions implicitly.
Excellent, Mr. Renfield.
Excellent.
And now, if you're not too fatigued,
I would like to discuss the lease on Carfax Abbey.
Oh, yes. Everything is in order awaiting your signature.
Well, here.
Here's the lease.
Why, I hope I've brought enough labels for your luggage.
I'm taking with me only three boxes.
Very well.
I have chartered a ship to take us to England.
We will be leaving tomorrow evening.
Everything will be ready.
I hope you will find this comfortable.
Thanks. It looks very inviting.
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Just a small cut from that paper clip.
It's just a scratch.
This is very old wine.
I hope you will like it.
Aren't you drinking?
I never drink wine.
Well...
It's delicious.
And now I'll leave you.
Well, good night.
Good night, Mr. Renfield.
Master, the sun is gone!
You will keep your promise when we get to London, won't you, Master?
You will see that I get lives?
Not human lives, but small ones with blood in them.
I'll be loyal to you, Master.
I'll be loyal!
Must be a Scandinavian ship.
That's what it looks to me like.
Here now, here now, get back.
Nobody goes aboard this here boat but the authorities.
The captain dead, tied to the wheel.
Horrible tragedy, horrible tragedy.
Master, we're here!
You can't hear what I'm saying, but we're here!
We're safe!
They must have come through a terrible storm.
What's that?
Why, it's come from that hatchway!
Why, he's mad!
Look at his eyes.
Why, the man's gone crazy.
Violets! Violets!
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole.
Here's a nice one.
And after you deliver the message, you will remember nothing I now say.
Obey.
- Dr. Seward?
- Yes?
You're wanted on the telephone.
Thank you. Well, excuse me, dear.
Oh, Father, if it's from home, will you say I'm spending the night in town with Lucy?
All right, dear.
- Pardon me.
- Yes?
I could not help overhearing your name.
Might I inquire if you are the Dr. Seward whose sanitarium is at Whitby?
Why, yes.
I'm Count Dracula.
I have just leased Carfax Abbey.
I understand it adjoins your grounds.
Why, yes, it does.
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance.
May I present my daughter Mina?
Count Dracula.
Miss Weston.
How do you do?
And Mr. Harker.
How do you do?
Count Dracula's just taken Carfax Abbey.
Oh, it'll be a relief to see light in those dismal old windows.
It will, indeed. You'll excuse me,
I'm wanted on the telephone.
The Abbey could be very attractive, but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs.
I shall do very little repairing.
It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania.
The Abbey always reminds me of that old toast about lofty timbers.
"The walls around are bare,
"echoing to our laughter
"as though the dead were there."
Nice little sentiment.
But there's more, even nicer.
"Pass a cup to the dead already,
"a round for the next to die..."
Oh, never mind the rest, dear.
To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious.
Why, Count Dracula!
There are far worse things awaiting man than death.
It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania.
Oh, Lucy. You're so romantic.
Laugh all you like.
I think he's fascinating.
I suppose he's all right.
But give me someone a little more normal.
Like John?
Yes, dear, like John.
Castle.
Dracula!
Transylvania.
Well, Countess,
I'll leave you to your Count and his ruined abbey.
- Good night, Lucy.
- Good night, dear.
The fog seems to be closing down a bit, sir.
Another death.
Dead.
Dr. Seward, when did Miss Weston have the last transfusion?
About four hours ago.
An unnatural loss of blood, which we've been powerless to check.
On the throat of each victim, the same two marks.
He probably wants his flies again!
No, Martin, please!
Please don't, Martin!
Oh, Martin, please!
Please, Martin! No, Martin!
Oh, Martin, please!
Here, give it to me now!
No, no, no, Martin! Please!
No, Martin! Martin, don't!
Don't throw my spider away from me.
Oh, Martin.
No.
Ain't you ashamed now? Ain't you?
Spiders now, is it?
Flies ain't good enough?
Flies? Flies?
Poor, puny things.
Who wants to eat flies?
You do, you loony.
Not when I can get nice, fat spiders!
All right. Have it your own way.
Read, dummkopf, where I have marked.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with the undead.
Nosferatu?
Yes, Nosferatu, the undead, the vampire.
The vampire attacks the throat.
It leaves two little wounds, white with red centers.
Dr. Seward, your patient, Renfield, whose blood I have just analyzed, is obsessed with the idea that he must devour living things in order to sustain his own life.
But Professor Van Helsing, modern medical science does not admit of such a creature.
The vampire is a pure myth, superstition.
I may be able to bring you proof that the superstition of yesterday can become the scientific reality of today.
But, Professor, Renfield's cravings have always been for small living things.
Nothing human.
As far as we know, Doctor.
But you tell me that he escapes from his room.
He is gone for hours.
Where does he go?
Well, Mr. Renfield, you are looking much better than you did this morning when I arrived.
Thanks, I'm feeling much better.
I am here to help you.
You understand that, do you not?
Why, of course.
And I'm very grateful.
Keep your filthy hands to yourself!
Now, now, Renfield.
Oh, Dr. Seward, send me away from this place.
Send me far away.
Why are you so anxious to get away?
My cries at night, they might disturb Miss Mina.
Yes?
They might give her bad dreams,
Professor Van Helsing.
Bad dreams.
That sounded like a wolf.
Yes, it did.
But I hardly think there are wolves so near London.
He thinks they're wolves.
Me, I've heard them howl at night before.
He thinks they're talking to him.
He howls and howls back at them.
He's crazy!
I might have known.
I might have known.
We know why the wolves talk, do we not, Mr. Renfield?
And we know how we can make them stop.
You know too much to live, Van Helsing.
Now, now, Renfield.
We'll get no more out of him now for a while.
Take him away, Martin.
On your way, old fly eater.
I'm warning you, Dr. Seward.
If you don't send me away, you must answer for what will happen to Miss Mina!
All right, Martin.
Come along, now, come along.
What was that herb that excited him so?
Wolfsbane.
It is a plant that grows in central Europe.
The natives there use it to protect themselves against vampires.
Renfield reacted very violently to its scent.
Seward, I want you to have
Renfield closely watched by day and night, especially by night.
Yes, Master.
Master, you've come back.
No, Master, please!
Please don't ask me to do that!
Don't! Not her!
Please! Please don't, Master!
Don't, please!
Please!
Oh, don't!
I lay in bed for quite a while, reading.
And just as I was commencing to get drowsy,
I heard dogs howling.
And when the dream came, it seemed the whole room was filled with mist.
It was so thick,
I could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog.
And then I saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
It came closer and closer.
I felt its breath on my face, and then its lips.
Dear, it was only a dream.
And then, in the morning,
I felt so weak.
It seemed as if all the life had been drained out of me.
Darling, we're going to forget all about these dreams, think about something cheerful, aren't we?
Allow me.
Oh, certainly, Professor.
Think for a moment.
Is there anything that might have brought this dream on?
No.
Doctor, there's something troubling Mina, something she won't tell us.
And the face in the dream, you say it seemed to come closer and closer?
The lips touched you? Where?
Is there anything the matter with your throat?
- Oh, no, but I...
- Permit me.
- No, please!
- Yes, yes.
How long have you had those little marks?
Marks?
Please.
Mina, why didn't you let us know?
Do not excite her.
When, Miss Mina?
Since the morning after the dream.
What could have caused them, Professor?
Count Dracula!
It's good to see you back again, Doctor.
I heard you have just arrived.
And you, Miss Mina.
You're looking exceptionally...
Pardon me, Dr. Seward, but I think Miss Mina should go to her room at once.
Professor Van Helsing,
I don't believe it's as important as you seem to think it is.
Excuse me. Count Dracula,
Professor Van Helsing.
Van Helsing.
A most distinguished scientist whose name we know, even in the wilds of Transylvania.
I had a frightful dream a few nights ago, and I don't seem to be able to get it out of my mind.
I hope you haven't taken my stories too seriously.
Stories?
Yes.
In my humble effort to amuse your fiancée, Mr. Harker,
I was telling her some rather grim tales of my far-off country.
I can imagine.
Why, John!
I can quite understand
Mr. Harker's concern.
I'm afraid it's quite serious.
My dear, I'm sure Count Dracula will excuse you.
You must go to your room as Professor Van Helsing suggests.
Oh, but, really, Father,
I'm feeling quite well.
You had better do as your father advises.
Very well.
Good night.
John.
Miss Mina?
May I call later and inquire how you're feeling?
Why, yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
My visit was so ill-timed.
Not at all.
On the contrary, it may prove to be most enlightening.
In fact, before you go, you can be of definite service.
Anything I can do. Gladly.
A moment ago,
I stumbled upon a most amazing phenomenon, something so incredible,
I mistrust my own judgment.
Look.
Dr. Seward, my humble apology.
I dislike mirrors.
Van Helsing will explain.
For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you are a wise man, Van Helsing.
What on earth caused that?
Did you see the look on his face?
Like a wild animal!
Wild animal? Like a madman!
What's that running across the lawn?
Looks like a huge dog!
Or a wolf?
A Wolf?
He was afraid we might follow.
Follow?
Sometimes they take the form of wolves, but generally of bats.
What are you talking about?
Dracula.
But what's Dracula got to do with wolves and bats?
Dracula is our vampire.
But surely, Professor...
A vampire casts no reflection in the glass.
That is why Dracula smashed the mirror.
I don't mean to be rude, but that's the sort of thing I'd expect one of the patients here to say.
Yes, and that is what your English doctors would say, your police.
The strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him.
Professor, vampires only exist in ghost stories.
A vampire, Mr. Harker, is a being that lives after its death by drinking the blood of the living.
It must have blood or it dies.
Its power lasts only from sunset to sunrise.
During the hours of the day, it must rest in the earth in which it was buried.
But then, if Dracula were a vampire, he'd have to return every night to Transylvania, and that's impossible.
Then he must have brought his native soil with him, boxes of it.
Boxes of earth large enough for him to rest in.
Renfield? What are you doing there?
Come here.
Did you hear what we were saying?
Yes, I heard something.
Enough.
Be guided by what he says.
It's your only hope.
It's her only hope.
I begged you to send me away, but you wouldn't.
Now it's too late.
It's happened again.
What's happened?
Take her away from here.
Take her away before...
No, no, Master!
I wasn't going to say anything!
I told them nothing!
I'm loyal to you, Master.
What have you to do with Dracula?
Dracula?
I never even heard the name before.
You will die in torment if you die with innocent blood on your soul.
Oh, no.
God will not damn a lunatic's soul.
He knows that the powers of evil are too great for those of us with weak minds.
Oh, Mr. Harker!
Mr. Harker, it's horrible!
Oh, it's horrible! Dr. Seward!
Miss Mina, out there dead!
Where? Where?
Out there!
Thank heaven she's alive.
Thank heaven for that.
Alive, yes, but in greater danger, for she's already under his influence.
It's horrible, Van Helsing, horrible!
Incredible.
Incredible, perhaps, but a fact.
We must face it.
We must cope with it.
"Further attacks on small children committed after dark
"by the mysterious woman in white took place last night.
"Narratives of two small girls, each child describing
"a beautiful lady in white who promised her chocolates,
"enticed her to a secluded spot
"and there bit her slightly in the throat."
Ghosts.
Vampires.
And then, Miss Mina?
Well, how could she know anything about the woman in white?
It's bad enough for her to read it in the newspaper...
Please, please, Mr. Harker.
And when was the next time you saw Miss Lucy after she was buried?
I was downstairs on the terrace.
She came out of the shadows and stood looking at me.
I started to speak to her.
And then I remembered she was dead.
The most horrible expression came over her face.
She looked like a hungry animal.
A Wolf.
And then she turned and ran back into the dark.
Then you know the woman in white is...
Lucy.
Miss Mina,
I promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest, her soul released from this horror.
If you can save
Lucy's soul after death, promise me you'll save mine.
Darling, you're not going to die, you're going to live.
No, John. You mustn't touch me.
And you mustn't kiss me ever again.
What are you trying to say?
You tell him.
You make him understand.
I can't.
Professor?
It's all over, John.
Our love, our life together.
Oh, no.
No, no, don't look at me like that.
I love you, John.
You.
But this horror, he wills it.
Miss Mina, you must come indoors.
You must.
You know what you're doing to her, Professor?
You're driving her crazy!
Mr. Harker, that is what you should be worrying about.
The last rays of the day's sun will soon be gone, and another night will be upon us.
Dr. Seward, I'm taking Mina with me to London tonight or I'll call in the police.
But, John...
Mina, please get your bags packed.
Seward, I must be master here or I can do nothing.
Right.
Miss Mina, both this room and your bedroom have been prepared with wolfsbane.
You will be safe if Dracula returns.
She'll be safe, all right, because she's going with me.
Mina, I'll be waiting for you in the library.
Oh, John! Father, talk to him.
Please don't let him go.
Oh, Briggs.
Miss Mina is to wear this wreath of wolfsbane when she goes to bed.
Watch her closely, and see that she does not remove it in her sleep.
I understand, Professor.
And under no circumstances must these windows be opened tonight.
Very well, sir.
You will recollect that Dracula cast no reflection in the mirror.
Yes.
And that three boxes of earth were delivered to him at Carfax Abbey.
Quite.
And knowing that a vampire must rest by day in his native soil,
I am convinced that this Dracula is no legend but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged.
Well, Dr. Seward, what about it?
Is Mina going with me or not?
If you take her from under our protection, you will kill her.
Now, John, please, please, be patient.
Mr. Harker, please, come here.
Well.
John, I know you love her, but don't forget she's my daughter, and I must do what I think is best.
Mr. Harker,
I have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things, little-known facts, which the world is perhaps better off not knowing.
I know, but, Professor, all I want is to get Mina away from all of this.
That will do no good.
Our only chance of saving
Miss Mina's life is to find the hiding place of Dracula's living corpse and to drive a stake through its heart.
Isn't this a strange conversation for men who aren't crazy?
Renfield, you're compelling me to put you in a straitjacket.
You forget, Doctor, that madmen have great strength.
Dracula has great strength, eh, Renfield?
Words, words, words.
Oh, Martin. Didn't I warn you to keep a strict watch?
What? What? Again?
Yes, sir. At once, sir.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Here. The doctor's pet loony is loose again.
He came and stood below my window in the moonlight.
And he promised me things.
Not in words, but by doing them.
Doing them?
By making them happen.
A red mist spread over the lawn, coming on like a flame of fire.
And then he parted it.
And I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red, like his, only smaller.
And then he held up his hand, and they all stopped.
And I thought he seemed to be saying,
"Rats. Rats.
"Rats!"
Thousands, millions of them.
"All red blood,
"all these will I give you
"if you will obey me."
What did he want you to do?
That which has already been done.
Strike me down dead, Doctor.
He's got me going.
Now he's twisted and broken them iron bars as if they was cheese.
Dracula is in the house.
In the house?
Doctor, this time he can do no harm.
We are ready for him.
Martin, come with me.
I'll show you where we can put Mr. Renfield where he won't escape again.
All right, but I have me doubts.
Come along, old fly eater.
Now, you mustn't get out of it this time.
I'm awfully sorry to have to look you up, but you've got to stay in your room.
Van Helsing.
Now that you have learned what you have learned, it would be well for you to return to your own country.
I prefer to remain and protect those whom you would destroy.
You are too late.
My blood now flows through her veins.
She will live through the centuries to come, as I have lived.
Should you escape us, Dracula, we know how to save Miss Mina's soul, if not her life.
If she dies by day.
But I shall see that she dies by night.
And I will have Carfax Abbey torn down stone by stone, excavated a mile around.
I will find your earth box and drive that stake through your heart.
Come here.
Come here.
Your will is strong,
Van Helsing.
More wolfsbane?
More effective than wolfsbane, Count.
Indeed.
Open the windows, Briggs, and let in some air.
The odor in the room from that horrible weed is stifling.
I can't stand it.
But the Professor gave orders.
Oh, never mind the Professor now.
Now, please, go back to bed at once.
I'm going to call your father.
What is it, Briggs?
Oh, I don't know, Mr. Harker.
I felt strangely dizzy.
And when it cleared away,
Miss Mina was up and dressed and out on the terrace.
And I can't get her to go to bed.
Well, let me see her.
Tell her I'm here.
John.
Oh, John, I'm so glad you're here.
Well, what have they been doing to me, dear?
Locking me in my room.
And the horrible smell of that awful weed.
It's been like a nightmare.
What's been the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Mina.
You're so...
Like a changed girl.
Oh, you look wonderful.
I feel wonderful.
I've never felt better in my life.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you like this.
I've been awfully worried about you.
Mr. Harker.
You better bring Miss Mina inside.
That's all right, Briggs, now that I'm here.
Run along, Briggs. Don't worry.
John. Look, the fog's lifting.
See how plain you can see the stars?
Yes.
Millions of them.
I've never seen them so close.
Why, it looks as if you could reach out and touch them.
Would you like me to get you a hat...
Why, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
Come.
Let's sit down.
Van Helsing.
Seward, that which I feared from the beginning has happened.
What?
Dracula boasts that he has fused his blood with that of Miss Mina.
In life, she will now become the foul thing of the night that he is.
- But Van Helsing...
- No, no, come, Seward.
Come, there's not a moment to be lost.
Oh, but I love the fog.
I love nights with fog.
But only yesterday you said you were afraid of the night.
But, darling, I could never have said anything so silly.
I couldn't. I love the night.
That's the only time
I feel really alive.
There's that bat again.
Yes?
Look out. He'll get in your hair.
Yes?
My, that was a big bat.
I will.
You will what?
Oh, I didn't say anything.
Yes, you did. You said, "I will."
Oh, no, I didn't.
John, come. Sit down.
There must be some way, some way to save her.
- There is only one...
- John.
That funny little old professor, he has a crucifix.
Now, I want you to get it away from him and hide it.
But why, dear?
Oh, he'll be wanting to protect me again from the night or Count Dracula or whatever it is.
Well, I don't know.
He may be right, Mina.
Your eyes.
They look at me so strangely.
Mina.
Mina, you're...
No, Mina, no!
Give me that. What's the idea?
Have you gone crazy?
What are you trying to do?
Frighten her to death?
No, I was trying to save her.
Save her? That's a fine way.
It's all right, darling.
Oh, John, darling, you must go away from me...
The cross, put it away.
After what's happened,
I can't bear to look at it.
What's happened?
I can't tell you. I can't.
Ah, but you must. You must tell me.
I have a right to know.
Oh, John.
You can believe everything he says.
It's all the truth.
Dracula, he...
Dracula?
Well, what's he done to you, dearie?
Tell me.
He came to me.
He opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink...
What is it?
Who is it, Martin?
It's that big gray bat again, sir.
It's no use of wasting your bullets, Martin.
They cannot harm that bat.
No, sir.
He's crazy.
They're all crazy.
They're all crazy, except you and me.
Sometimes I have me doubts about you.
Yes.
That's Renfield.
What's he doing at the Abbey?
Come, Mr. Harker.
Master! Master, I'm here!
Where else would he be going but to Dracula?
What is it, Master?
What do you want me to do?
Look, here's an opening.
Mina!
Mina!
I didn't lead them here, Master.
I didn't know. I swear.
No! No!
Wait!
I'm loyal to you, Master.
I'm your slave.
I didn't betray you.
Oh, no, don't! Don't kill me!
Let me live, please!
Punish me, torture me, but let me live!
I can't die with all those lives on my conscience!
All that blood on my hands!
Mina! Mina!
He'll kill her if we don't get to her.
We must not be too late.
We have him trapped. Day is breaking.
We have him trapped.
He's killing her.
Mina! Mina, where are you?
Mina. Mina.
Mina, where are you?
Mina.
Mina!
Mina! Mina!
Harker! Harker!
- Yes?
- Come.
Where? Where are you?
Here. Here, Harker.
I have found them.
Get me a piece of stone, anything.
It will help me drive the stake through their hearts.
Is she... How is she?
She is not here.
Then... Then she may be alive.
Mina! Mina!
Mina!
Mina!
Mina!
Mina! Mina!
Oh, John. John, darling.
I heard you calling, but I couldn't say anything.
We thought he'd killed you, dear.
The daylight stopped him.
Oh, if you could have seen the look on his face.
There's nothing more to fear, Miss Mina.
Dracula is dead forever.
No, no, no. You must go.
But aren't you coming with us?
Not yet, presently.
Come, John.
- Do I have to eat any more of this?
- DefiniteIy.
Spinach is very rich in vitamins.
I might say disgustingIy rich.
And very good for you, Miss Barbara.
Why is it so many things you don't Iike are good for you?
I couIdn't say offhand, Miss Barbara, but you must eat some more of your spinach.
Why do I have to?
Your Iunch caIIs for so many vitamins, and you must have them.
AII right.
My goodness, that was an awfuI big vitamin.
- Have you finished, Miss Barbara?
- But definiteIy.
The third sneeze.
Let me see your tongue.
I'm afraid you'II have to go to bed.
I'm not sick. I feeI fine.
CoIIins, she's perfectIy weII.
A sneeze is nothing to be aIarmed at.
Perhaps not, but I'm responsibIe for the chiId.
Come, my dear.
Phone for Dr PaImer.
The chiId sneezes and you'd think the worId was coming to an end.
Can't they Ieave her aIone?
She's a perfectIy normaI, heaIthy chiId.
The way they carry on, you'd think she was made of gIass.
Something ought to be done with CoIIins.
- How Mr Barry can...
- Sshh!
..stand that femaIe is beyond me.
WeII, you can't expect a widower and a man as busy as Mr Barry is to notice everything that's going on in the house.
Better do your teIephoning.
No, itjust seems to be a sIight coId, but Mr Barry aIways wants us to notify him.
Just got a message from Barry's home.
His chiId is iII.
Just got a message from Barry's home. His chiId is iII.
OK, I'II see that he gets the message.
Mr Barry is wanted at home at once.
His child is quite ill.
ReaIIy?
- Where's Mr Barry?
- At the househoId exhibit.
- His daughter's seriousIy iII.
- I'II go over to the show and pick him up.
If he phones, teII him I'm on my way over.
Thank you. Be ready for the opening of the exhibit at 2.15.
(women) Yes, Mr Barry.
- May I heIp?
- Thank you.
Seems I can't do anything without Barry making troubIe for me.
I hate that man.
He causes me more sIeepIess nights...
SIeepIess nights? What does he do, pIay a sIide trombone under your window?
Everything but that. I Iay awake haIf the night thinking up new ideas.
Then I find Barry's not onIy beaten me to them, he's topped me in a thousand ways.
I wish he'd drown in his own soap suds.
- I shouIdn't be boring you with my troubIes.
- That's aII right.
- Are you in this business?
- Yes.
I'm with the Peck Company. Advertising.
I see. I'm sorry you disIike this feIIow Barry, though. He's reaIIy not a bad sort.
- Do you know him?
- SIightIy. My barber cuts his hair.
- Maybe I couId bribe him to cut his throat.
- Mr Barry, do you think she'II be aII right?
I don't know. Let me see.
- Yes, she'II do very niceIy.
- Thank you, Mr Barry. Just what I thought.
Of aII the rotten tricks! Letting me taIk my head off without teIIing me.
Just another exampIe of Barry cIeverness, I suppose.
What was she burning about?
I keep her awake nights.
Mr Barry, you're wanted at home right away.
Barbara's very iII.

WeII.
Ah.
- WiII you read to me from this?
- AII right. Which one is it to be?
It's the one where Betsy runs away from the orphan asyIum and meets Tony, the organ grinder, and his monkey.
''Betsy Ware was two years oId when her mother died.''
''Because the famiIy was poor,
Betsy couIdn't stay at home.''
''So she was sent to an orphan asyIum.''
Which was an ugIy red-brick buiIding far, far away from where Betsy used to Iive.
Yes. ''From where Betsy used to Iive.''
''A young man came dancing round the corner in a green coat and bumped right into her.''
'''Excuse me,' said the young man.
'I'm aIways bumping into peopIe.'''
''That's why they caII me Puddin' Head...''
''So Mary couIdn't pIay that afternoon.
She had Iessons to do...''
No, no. Read what happened after Betsy met Puddin' Head.
Oh, excuse me.
Why, I must have skipped a page.
- How is she?
- She's fine.
The doctor was here and he said there isn't the sIightest thing the matter with her.
Now, you see, Mr Barry?
She's perfectIy aII right.
CoIIins gets panicky every time the chiId sneezes.
CoIIins is right. I want every precaution taken.
Of course, I know it's none of my business, Mr Barry, but did you ever stop to consider that the constant piIIing up of precautions and attentions was bad for the chiId?
Why, she's pampered and watched over and babied to death.
- WouId you mind if I'd offer a suggestion?
- No, go ahead.
If I were you, I'd send Barbara to schooI where she'II be with other chiIdren.
There may be something in that.
Perhaps schooI's the thing.
TeII CoIIins I wish to speak to her about it.
I know what CoIIins wiII say.
CoIIins aIways says no.
- HeIIo, Daddy.
- HeIIo, sweet.
Daddy, why do I aIways have to pIay aIone?
Why can't I pIay with other chiIdren?
- Honey, how wouId you Iike to go to schooI?
- Goody-goody!
- WeII, I guess that's settIed, then.
- Yes, Mr Barry?
I'm sending Barbara to schooI in the
Adirondacks, where her mother used to go.
But the chiId's much too young for a summer camp.
Didn't I teII you CoIIins aIways said no?
I've onIy been foIIowing your instructions.
I'm sorry if...
She needs to be with other chiIdren.
Get in touch with the Forest Grove SchooI right away.
Take care of aII the detaiIs.
- Yes, sir.
- (man) Mr Barry.
You wanted to Iisten to the changes on your radio hour.
- The programme's on now.
- Oh, yes.
? B-a-r-r-y
? Why don't you buy a bar of Barry's?
? Every grocer carries Barry's
? You will find that Barry's little bubbles
? Make you kinda laugh at your washing troubles
? Buy a bar of Barry's
? It's the berries, that's Barry's
? So run, don't waIk
? To the nearest exit and find a bar of Barry's
And now the Barry baritone will sing that new hit tune, ''When l'm With You''.
? Every street I waIk on becomes a Iovers Iane
? When I'm with you
? I can see the sun though we're out in the rain
? When I'm with you
? To lose you would be tragic
? Here is my heart unfurled
? You have that certain magic
? You're the Seven Wonders of the World
? Snow is on the ground but the Ieaves are on the trees
? When I'm with you
? Flowers sing a love song, there's music in the breeze
? When l'm with you
? Ooh
? Please let me make this confession
? You are my magnifiicent obsession
? The world is all in rhyme, lovely one
? When l'm with you
You know, Daddy, this house wouIdn't be so
Ionesome if you'd stay home once in a whiIe.
If I stayed home aII the time, there wouIdn't be any house.
Do you know, Daddy, I can sing that song, and I've got my own words.
- Wanna hear them?
- Mm-hm.
? An ordinary day becomes a hoIiday
? When I'm with you
? I have Iots of toys but I don't wanna pIay
? When I'm with you
? Oh, Daddy, how I miss you
? You're busy aII your Iife
? I Iove to hug and kiss you
? Marry me and Iet me be your wife
? Every word I hear sounds Iike a IuIIaby
? When I'm with you
? Even funny spinach tastes Iike pumpkin pie
? When I'm with you
? Ooh
? In every dream I caress you
? And every night
I pray the Lord wiII bIess you
? The worId's a nursery rhyme, Daddy dear
? When I'm with you
Are you going to stay in schooI with me?
No, my dear.
I'm going to take a IittIe vacation.
- What's a vacation?
- It's a rest, dear.
Getting away from peopIe you've been with and seeing new faces.
You reaIIy become another person on a vacation.
- What person are you gonna be?
- Just another person.
- Is going to schooI a vacation?
- HardIy. Just the opposite.
You think CoIIins is strict, but wait tiII you get to schooI.
There'II be no running to Woodward or to your daddy.
You'II do just what you're toId.
I don't think I'm gonna Iike schooI.
- May I take Snoopy with me?
- No, my dear.
- You're not aIIowed to have dogs in schooI.
- No?
- No, indeed.
- That settIes it.
- AII right, darIing. We'd better get started.
- Come, my dear.
Goodbye, Snoopy.
Are they expecting you this evening?
I toId them we'd be out sometime this week.
You'd better wire them and have a car meet you.
- I'II do it from the station.
- You're going to be very happy at schooI.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
Sure you're going to be happy.
I'II be up and spend every weekend with you.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Aren't you coming into the station with us?
I'm sorry. I can't. I'm Iate for a business appointment aIready.
I'm aIways running away from you.
I'II make up for it Saturday and Sunday.
I'II spend every minute with you.
We'II have Iots of fun. Goodbye.
- Take good care of her, CoIIins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's this for?
- It weighs you for a penny.
- I wanna be weighed.
- WeII, I haven't a penny.
- I have a penny.
- AII right.
No, here.
On this side is your weight. 58 pounds.
And on this side is your fortune.
What does it say? What does it say?
It says you're going away on a Iong trip.
You're going to meet a Iot of strange peopIe.
What a smart machine.
Come, my dear.
Porter, I have to send a teIegram.
My purse. It's gone.
I must have dropped it.
Keep an eye on her. I'II be back in a minute.
Yes, ma'am.
- (screeching tyres)
- Look out, Iady!
Come on! Give her air!
- What's your name?
- Rufus Washington Jackson Lee.
- AII by yourseIf?
- (chuckles)
- My name is Betsy Ware.
- That's a mighty pretty name.
- Did you ever have a vacation?
- Oh, yes, missy. Lots and Iots of 'em.
- Are they fun?
- They are if you don't have too many.
I'II bet they're more fun than going to schooI.
I never had a vacation, but I'm thinking about having one.
Look.
- Why don't you heIp your brother?
- Brother?
AII right, IittIe missy.
You just wait right here tiII I come back.
There was a Iady and IittIe girI with these.
They went away and didn't come back.
AII right.
- Has the woman been identified?
- No. No pocketbook, no Iaundry marks.
You'd better caII up the bureau of missing persons and have a description sent out.
It's Tony!
And his monkey!
Gee, that's a sweII hat.
I wish I couId have one Iike it.
- Here, take it.
- Oh, thanks.
- And you may have these, too.
- Thanks a Iot.
I know who you are. You're Tony.
That's right. Antonio is my middIe name.
I'm on my vacation.
Do you wanna come aIong?
You're very nice, IittIe bambina.
You go home to your mama.
- I have no mama.
- That's too bad.
Then go home to your papa.
- Say, what's your name?
- Betsy Ware.
I used to Iive in an orphanage, but they were mean to me, awfuIIy mean.
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- Huh?
I'm on a vacation. To see new faces.
Your face doesn't Iook very new.
WeII, it's good enough for me. Goodbye.
Here comes Papa! Here comes Papa!
- Why you chase me for?
- I'm Betsy Ware.
I used to Iive in an orphanage, but they were awfuI mean to me.
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- I know. You toId me that.
- And you no Iike my face.
- Yes, I do.
(Tony) Ma! Ma!
Who is she?
Mama, maybe she's hungry.
I go get her?
Come, you stay in my house tonight.
Eat the spaghetti. They're good.
Look, Iook. Like this. Look.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- I sneezed.
- Salute.
Salute.
- Don't I have to go to bed?
- What's the matter?
- You're sIeepy?
- You eat first.
I Iike it here.
So IittIe, and so sweet.
Maybe we keep her. Yes?
Are you crazy? What you want to do?
You want to go to jaiI for the kidnap?
Five chiIdren you have aIready.
Six with the monkey.
AII right. Then I take her to the poIiceman in the morning.
Come, bambina.
- So fast she sIeeps.
- Maybe we'II keep her, huh?
Mama, come on! Get up!
This music comes in handy for rehearsing.
- Rehearsing for what?
- Somebody may ask us to pIay a benefit.
Don't forget - we got another radio audition tomorrow.
You know, this radio racket is a Iot tougher than vaudeviIIe used to be.
- Remember when we got married?
- No, and don't remind me.
And, by the way, I'm getting tired of these radio auditions.
If we don't Iand a sponsor soon,
I'm going home to my mother.
WeII, that's better than bringing the oId battIe-axe here. I'm onIy kidding.
Honey, I've been working on a step that's gonna start BiII Robinson taIking to himseIf.
Watch this.
Like to see anybody tie that.
- I'm going to see who that hoofer is!
- WhiIe you're there, take a few Iessons.
(Mama) Bravo, bambina! Bravo!
It's a kid. Jerry, Jerry!
Are you the one who was answering my steps?
- Tony, who is she?
- She's an orphan.
She run away. She foIIow me here.
Jerry, she's a naturaI. Look at her.
Did you ever see a better bet?
- Who is she?
- She's part of our act, kid.
DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
Say, what's your name?
Betsy Ware. Are you Puddin' Head?
I'II say he's Puddin' Head. Come on.
- What's this aII about?
- Don't you see?
That kid's a noveIty.
Just what we need for the act.
You crazy?
What do you know about the chiId?
AII there is to know.
She ran away from an orphan asyIum.
Orphan asyIum! Did you notice her hands?
They don't manicure 'em in orphan asyIums.
WeII, I don't know. Friend of mine got his hair cut in Sing Sing.
You're aIways making mountains out of mothbaIIs.
Supposing the kid's story does turn out to be a phoney? So we beIieved it.
We fed her, took care of her and put her on the air.
- They can't hang you for that, can they?
- They can try.
Wait a minute.
I want the poIice department.
Bureau of missing persons.
Bureau of missing persons?
Is anybody missing?
Oh, thousands of peopIe?
That's very interesting.
Did anybody report a kid missing by the name of Betsy Ware?
But, Jimmy...
No record? Oh.
No, no. I don't wanna make a report.
No, thanks.
But if I shouId ever Iose a kid by that name,
I'II Iet you know.
What? Oh, wise guy, hey?
- You'd better turn her in anyway.
- I teII you, it's OK.
Wait a minute. Listen, sweetheart. Remember, you're Bonnie DoIan, the radio star.
Don't use your reaI name around here.
Just forget that you're Betsy Ware.
- Are we pIaying a game?
- That's it, a game.
- WiII you pIay aIong with it?
- Mm-hm. I Iove games.
- AII right. Now, don't forget, Betsy.
- The name's Bonnie DoIan.
We're DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
We have an appointment with Dan Ward of the Ward and WaIIace advertising agency.
Oh, yes. For an audition.
Room B to your right, pIease.
- HeIIo, Mr Ward. Mr Ward.
- Yes?
This is my wife, Jerry.
And this is our kid, Bonnie DoIan.
Have we got an act!
Have we got an act? I'm asking you.
Don't ask me, show me!

Not bad. I'II be right out.
I have a cIient who might be interested.
You wait here.
- Didn't he Iike what we did?
- Sure.
I guess he's gone to the next room to appIaud.
Margaret? This is Dan. Listen, I've got the greatest act that's ever been offered to radio.
It's no use, Dan.
Mr Peckjust won't go on the air.
I know he won't go for girIs, and I know he won't go for crooners, but he'II go for this.
But you said we were good.
Never pay any attention to what he says.
Maybe we were too good.
- Oh, uh...
- Yes?
- This cIient of mine...
- Yeah?
- ..that I was teIIing you about...

- Can you be there at three?
- Can we be there at three?
- Can we be there at three?
- We'II be there at five minutes to three.
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.
I don't care how good they are!
I teII you, I don't want a radio show!
But, Mr Peck, if you'd onIy give them an audition...
It's a most unusuaI act, Mr Peck.
They'II be up here in a few moments.
- Shut up!
- (phone rings)
Oh.
Mr Barry of the Barry Soap Company is here.
Says he has an appointment.
Do you know what that young upstart wants?
TeIephoned me, said he wanted to see me.
- I have no idea.
- WeII, I have.
He wants me to buy him out.
Buy him out?
Why, Mr Peck, the Barry saIes are...
I know he's been seIIing soap!
But he's been spending 11 cents on baIIyhoo for every 10-cent cake he's soId.
- But the figures show...
- Figures!
It takes no genius to offer five-doIIar biIIs for four eighty and do a voIume of business.
But the day of reckoning is aIways around the corner, and it's caught up with Barry.
ShaII I show him in?
Yes, show him in.
You stay, Gooch.
- WeII, weII. If it isn't Peck's bad girI.
- HeIIo, Mr Barry.
- Mr Peck wants you to go right in.
- That's mighty white of the oId man.
Listen, how wouId you Iike to have Iunch with your boss?
- With my boss?
- Sure. I'm gonna buy up the whoIe shebang.
It's on its Iast Iegs and Peck'II probabIy be gIad to seII it for a song.
- What's funny about that?
- (telephonist) Yes, sir. I'II teII him.
Mr Peck wants to know what's deIaying you.
The oId boy can't wait. See you Iater.
WeII...
Mr Peck...
Yes, Mr Barry?
Just what can I do for you today?
WeII, Peck, I understand that this pIace is going to... going to pot.
Now, I might consider taking it off your hands.
But... do I understand you to say...?
You understand me to say that I'II buy you out. How much?
Have you the coIossaI insoIence to suggest that I seII my business to you?
Why not? You've been Iosing money for two years. You're practicaIIy broke.
Get out! Get out, before I kick you out!
Now get out.
I gather that he doesn't want to seII.
Is that your impression too?
- DefiniteIy.
- Very weII.
Good day.
HeIIo, boss.
Boss or no boss, how about the date for Iuncheon?
WeII, I couIdn't possibIy.
Come on, be a sport.
You're even with me, aren't you?
I'm ahead of you.
When wiII it be?
- Oh, Friday at one?
- Fine. At the Savoy?
Say, Margaret, isn't he one of our competitors?
As far as I'm concerned, he has no competition.
(man) 16.
Peck's Soap Company.
- We're DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
- The radio stars.
Oh, yes. DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And which one are you?
I'm the one in the middIe.
Miss AIIen's busy at the moment.
WiII you wait in her office?
Thank you.
DarIing, don't do that.
Be a good girI and sit down over there.
- I wanna taIk to Puddin' Head a minute.
- Do me a favour and stop worrying.
- You're beginning to Iook terribIe.
- Why wouIdn't I?
I dozed off this morning at 3.30 and sIept Iike a Iog tiII four.
(Jimmy) The way you're acting, you'd think we were kidnappers.
(Jerry) That's what I'm afraid the judge wiII think. We may get off with Iife.
HeIIo.
- How'd you get in here? Who are you?
- I'm Bonnie DoIan, the big radio star.
You know, DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And are we good!
Ah.
So they sent you in here to soften me up, did they?
Young Iady, you're wasting your time.
Now get outta here.
- Why have you got so many doors?
- To keep out nuisances one door won't stop.
- But they aII open.
- Ah.
- What's this?
- Nothing to do with you.
Now, get aIong with you.
Why do you want me to go? You're aII aIone, and I'm not doing anything, either.
- TeII me a story.
- I don't know any stories.
You know, you remind me of oId Mr SpindIeshanks.
- Who?
- Mr SpindIeshanks.
He's the grouch in the Betsy Ware stories who heIps Betsy when she's hungry...
Hungry? You're not hungry, are you?
No. I just had Iunch, and I did something bad, too.
- What'd you do?
- WeII, we had spinach.
And whiIe Jimmy wasn't Iooking,
I put mine on his pIate.
No, no. That is wrong.
You shouId have eaten your spinach.
It's good for you.
So I've heard.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get aIong.
- Why?
- You said for me to.
I didn't say anything of the kind.
AII I said was that spinach was good for you.
Come back here.
Sit down over there.
Come over here.
You Iike these pictures?
- Do you know something?
- What?
I didn't think I was gonna Iike you at first.
But I Iike you now.
- Do you?
- Yes.
- Your eyebrows are so nice and ragged.
- (stutters)
AII right.
So you're a singer, are you?
Mm-hm.
- Sing a song for me.
- AII right.
? Buy a bar of Barry's
- ? Every grocer carries Barry's...
- Stop it! Stop it, I say!
- What's the matter?
- Where'd you Iearn that trash?
On the radio. I heard it on the radio.
Ah.
Radio. There oughta be a Iaw against it.
Now, come on.
Look at the pictures.
- Do you know how to pIay piggyback?
- (stutters)
- No, I don't think I do.
- Oh, it's easy.
Stand up. Stand up.
Turn round.
Now I put my arms around your neck Iike this.
Now go Iike this.

Sorry, foIks, to keep you waiting.

Where's the chiId?
You haven't forgotten her?
- She was just here.
- Mr Peck wants to see you at once.
You'd better go right in.
I'II Iook for the chiId. Right in there.
? Rings on her fingers and beIIs on her toes, she shaII have music wherever she goes
Come in.
Ah.
So you thought you'd trick me into going on the air, did you?
Oh, no.
You deIiberateIy sent this chiId to infIuence me.
WeII, I'II Iet you know, it didn't work.
As a matter of fact, I made up my mind a Iong time ago to go on the air.
But she had nothing to do with it, nothing whatever.
She didn't infIuence me the sIightest.
Now, understand that.
- Yes, of course.
- Arrange for time on the air at once.
I want these foIks to start on a series of 15-minute programmes five nights a week, starting tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
But, Mr Peck, I couIdn't possibIy do that...
Then make it possibIe!
Didn't I teII you aII we needed was a break?
- 13 weeks on the dotted Iine.
- It's wonderfuI, Jimmy.
- I hope we cIick.
- Why, we'II knock 'em dead.
- Do we have to kiII peopIe?
- No, we won't kiII them. We'II just sIay them.
Oh.
They'II be on in a few minutes.
And if you wanna see a radio show that'II make yours Iook sick...
They can't be that good.

I'II teII you about it at Iunch tomorrow.
Goodbye.

- Do you want me to be afraid?
- Heavens, no, darIing.

Besides being taIented, she's the sweetest IittIe thing. I'm crazy about her.
Yes? You ought to see my youngster.
She's away at schooI.
I'm going up there tomorrow for the weekend.

Oh, haven't I toId you?
You're having dinner with me tonight.
I'm going to be Iistening to our radio broadcast.
Fine. We'II both Iisten whiIe we're having cocktaiIs, and then we'II go out to dinner.
Are you, by any chance, giving me what's known as the rush act?
No. I'm doing this for my insomnia.
You see, you've turned the tabIes on me.
- What do you mean?
- I mean now you're keeping me awake nights.
''In their Iast night's premiere,
DoIan, DoIan and DoIan's radio act proved to be sock entertainment.''
Yeah. So is this.
You're aIways beIittIing.
And you can heave that stuff in the ashcan.
We're on top of the worId now. PeopIe don't waIk on top of the worId in darned socks.
That's just the pIace to wear 'em.
Your feet don't sIip so easy.
Oh.
Gee, that's sweII. DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
- Are you happy with us, darIing?
- Mm-hm.
My goodness, she sneezed!
Get the doctor, quick.

- Why don't you just say ''salute''?
- How about gesundheit?
- Danke schon.

WeII, nearIy time to get down to the broadcasting station, big shot.
WiII I have time to go and see

Hey! Where are you going with that kid?

Come on.

- It's uncanny.
- Isn't she wonderfuI?
I mean her voice, it's... it's just Iike Barbara's.
If I didn't know my chiId was at schooI, I'd swear to it.
AII chiIdren's voices sound about aIike.
It's just that sIight difference that makes Bonnie stand out.
A proud father probabIy wouIdn't even notice that difference.
? Marry me and let me be your wife
- That's Barbara. It is.
- Are you Iosing your mind?
- That's Bonnie DoIan.
- But, I teII you, it's my daughter.

HeIIo, operator? Give me the Forest Grove
SchooI. At FerncIiff. Yes, quick.
- This is CoIumbus 8514.
- You're just stirring up a mess of troubIe.
- Why are you so stubborn?
- You're stubborn.
Why do I have to marry a girI Iike this?
Who said you're going to?
I wouIdn't marry you...
You'II marry me if I want you to.
- HeIIo?
- This is Richard Barry taIking.
- Is my daughter Barbara there?
- No, Mr Barry. We're waiting for her.
- Haven't you received a wire from her nurse?
- No, Mr Barry. ShaII we...
- She never got to the schooI.
- ReaIIy?
Come on.
And were you good!
We certainIy sIayed them, didn't we?
Come on, darIing.
Great IittIe trooper, that kid.
Just Iike her father. I taught her aII she knows.
When she was six months oId, the name of the act was DoIan and DoIan.
- Then she used to...
- Mr Peck, Mr Barry just phoned.
Said Bonnie is his daughter and wants us to hoId her here.
Barry, huh? Trying to put something over on me again. The nerve!
- What eIse did he say?
- That's aII, except he was on his way over.
Good! I'II teII that cheap upstart just where he gets off.
Trying to steaI my taIent, is he? I'II sue him.
Here, you get your wife and chiId and get them out of here.
I know how to handIe Barry!
- Let's get outta here. Don't ask questions.
- Where are we going?
Taxi!
Taxi!
Taxi!
Listen, honey, teII us the truth.
Do you know Mr Barry?
- You won't be angry if I teII you?
- No, sweetheart.
Mr Barry's my daddy.
I toId you she didn'tjump out of a hat, that they'd catch up with us.
- What'II we do now?
- There's onIy one thing.
Take her home, teIephone Barry where she is and then duck. FIag a taxi.
- Taxi!
- I shouId have known better.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
AII we've got to do is...
Oh.
- An awfuIIy nice kid you have there.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Taxi. Taxi!
(Jerry) DarIing, we've got to go. Something has come up and we've got to go right away.
- (Barbara) Can't I go with you?
- (Jimmy) No, you stay here.
But I don't wanna stay here aII aIone.
Honey, do us a big favour. Stay right here.
Listen, sweet, you stay here, we'II caII your daddy and he'II come for you in a few minutes.
Oh.
Here, sweet. PIay with your toys.
Goodbye, darIing.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Puddin' Head.
Come on.
A fine cock-and-buII story. If she's your daughter, what's she doing here?
- I have no time to expIain now. Where is she?
- She's gone, and don't teII him where she is.
- Can't you see I'm teIIing you the truth?
- (phone rings)
Yes? Yes.
It's for you, Richard.
Yes?
What's the number of the house?
Yes, what fIoor?
The parIour fIoor, the first door to your Ieft.
I know where she is. She's aII aIone!
Is she reaIIy your daughter?
Isn't that what I've been teIIing you, you crazy oId buzzard?
We're a coupIe of heeIs, running out on the kid.
- I know, but...
- And a coupIe of saps.
- They're bound to get us.
- I guess you're right.
Everybody knows DoIan and DoIan.
They know we had the kid, too.
Of course, and if we run away, it'II Iook worse.
Come on. Let's go back and face it.
Come on, now. Be a nice IittIe girI.
I'II buy you a pretty present if you teII me who your father is.
I won't teII you. I don't Iike you.
- You'd better teII.
- I won't! I won't! You Iet me go!
- No, you don't. You're coming with me.
- I am not! I am not!
I'm waiting! I'm waiting! I promised Jerry!
Hey! Where are you going with that kid?
Jimmy, Iead with your Ieft!
Hit him hard, Puddin' Head!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Daddy!
- (Jerry) Are you aII right, Jimmy?
- Who brought you here?
- They did.
- Where's CoIIins?
- I don't know.
She Iost her purse and went away.
So I thought I'd go on a vacation.
I found Tony, and then
Mr and Mrs Puddin' Head found me.
What are they doing, Daddy?
They're hurting them, and they're my friends.
They're my best friends.
They saved me from that bad man.
She toId us she ran away from an orphan asyIum, and we beIieved her.
- Didn't you teII us that, Bonnie?
- Yes, I did.
But I wasn't teIIing a Iie. I was just pIaying a game, and they pIayed with me.
I see.
I've never had so much fun in my whoIe Iife.
But I'm gIad to be back with you, Daddy.
Barbara. Officers,
I'm afraid I've put you to a Iot of bother.
- You needn't hoId those peopIe any Ionger.
- Wait. I've got a contract.
- You know what that contract's worth?
- You've been trying to buy each other out.
Why don't you merge the two companies?
You can wash the neck of the whoIe nation.
- That's a thought.
- Merge with him? Never!
I don't know what that means, but why don't you do it?

Heidi!
Put those on!
Oh, not everything.
I'm so hot.
Well, keep on your Sunday dress... and your coat.
- Hurry up!
- Oh, all right.
Come a long way?
Yes. From Mayenfeld.
We had a ride part of the way on a cart.
Can you tell me the way to Adolph Kramer's?
Did you say Adolph Kramer?
I did.
A stranger hereabouts, aren't you?
Yes. Why?
You must be, or you would have... nothing to do with that old heathen!
Heathen or not, I'm taking his granddaughter to live with him.
Well do you know what kind of a man he is?
That's none of my affair.
Which path do I take?
There, by the church.
If you listen to us, you'll never take it.
Um-
Umm.
Hey! Turk!
Everybody knows you can't turn your back on old Turk.
Well, old Turk isn't much of a gentleman.
What's your name?
I'm Peter, the goat general.
Who are you?
I'm Heidi, and I'm going to live with Adolph Kramer, my grandfather.
Live with him?
Aren't you scared to?
Why should I be afraid of my grandfather?
You'll find out. If ever he gets good and mad at you... he'll probably cut your head off.
Like this!
Oh.
I don't care what you say.
She's my niece, and I can do what I please with her.
Come along.
Come along. Hurry!
I'm Dete, the sister of Gretchen... who married your son Tobias.
I've brought their orphan to live with you.
I've taken care ofher for six years... but I've got a job in Frankfurt now- a rich family- and I can't be bothered with her anymore,
I know you hated
Tobias and Gretchen... but you've got to take their daughter just the same.
Get out of here.
Here she is!
Her name's Heidi!
How do you do,
Grandfather?
I'm very glad to see you.
Aren't you going to show me our house?
Oh. It's a very fine house, isn't it?
Whew!
Where am I going to sleep?
Grandfather!
I found my bed.
I'll sleep on the hay.
But I suppose I ought to have a sheet and coverlet.
I say, I suppose I ought to have a sheet and coverlet.
Well...
I've always had a sheet and coverlet... but if there aren't any,
I could sleep under the hay.
Could I use these?
Grandfather, it's a beautiful bed.
Would you like to come and see?
Oh! Is that for me?
Thank you.
Ow.
Now I've got a table all my own.
Hello, laddie.
Is this Blind Anna's cottage?
- Yes. She's my grandmother.
- Thank you.
I do not know this Adolph Kramer, but the village thinks... the child should be taken away from him.
You've just come to
Dorfli, Herr Pastor... or you'd understand why.
They say you have known
Kramer for 50 years.
- What sort of a man is he?
- Who knows?
He was a grand young man, except for his wild temper.
And his son grew up just like him.
Tobias wanted to marry a girl from Mayenfeld.
Adolph disliked her and forbade it, but the boy married her... just the same and brought her home,
Adolph turned them away in a rage... and told Tobias never to come back... until he'd given up the girl.
But why should the village hate him and fear him so?
Feuds and weeds grow quickly, Herr Pastor.
The people of the village sided with the boy... and the father cursed them... and went and built himself a hut on the mountain.
Since that day, he's never spoken to a living soul.
Frau Anna, is the child safe with him?
God knows.
Living alone like that has made him a strange creature.
I like to hear the church bells, don't you, Grandfather?
- Get to bed.
- Shall I say my prayers out here with you?
- I told you to go to bed!
- Yes, Grandfather.
I think I'll go to bed now,
Grandfather. Good night!
And God bless Grandfather, and please make him like me.
And please make me a good little girl. Amen.
And please make Aunt Dete stay in Frankfurt for a long, long time.
Amen.
- Is this for me?
- Yes.
It's the most beautifulest chair I ever saw.
- Thank you,
- Mm.
- What are you making?
- Cheese.
Could I help?
Stir.
Do please help me tie my apron.
Agh!
Thank you.
- Are these ours, Grandfather?
- Mm-hmm.
- What are their names?
- Swanly and Bearly.
You don't look much like a swan... and you don't look anything like a bear.
I think you're a beautiful goat.
I wonder if you give black milk?
- You can milk Bearly.
- But I don't know how to milk a goat.
Well, then, it's time you learned. This way.
You may as well stand still.
I'm going to do it.
Oh, please, Swanly.
Don't be so st- stubborn.
Oh!
Bearly's a very warm goat, isn't she?
Pretty hard work, isn't it, Grandfather?
Is this the last load?
Not quite. The rabbit's fur is thick. It'll be a hard winter.
We don't care if it's a hard winter, do we?
There's wood to keep us warm and cheese to eat... and lots of hay for Swanly and Bearly.
May I go with Peter today?
It may be the last time before the snows.
All right. All right.
But be back early for your lessons.
I will.
Are you sure you can get along without me?
I'll try.
- You're supposed to be asleep.
- My eyes couldn't stay shut.
Look what I found!
Well.
Do you think there's any music left in it?
We'll see.
I'm afraid it's all tired out.
Hm.
Oh!
This looks like a wonderful story!
What's it about?
It's about magic wooden shoes.
All right, Grandfather, I'm ready.
Now... a long, long time ago... there was a little
Dutch girl named Netje,
Have you seen my new shoes
They are made out of wood
Such nice little shoes
Don't you think they look good
I can dance all around
With the greatest of ease
I can jump from the ground
To the top of the trees
I'll tell you something
I'm going to try
Put on your shoes and away we'll fly
We'll take a trip wherever we choose
We'll dance and skip in our little wooden shoes
How many miles will you travel with me
One mile or two miles and maybe three
We'll make a stop wherever we choose
We'll skip and hop in our little wooden shoes
Wasn't our journey a nice holiday
We'll take another some other day
We'll take a trip wherever we choose
We'll dance and skip in our little wooden shoes
- Hello.
- Oh!
- You come to see us?
- Yes, dear.
- I am Pastor Schultz.
- How do you do, Pastor Schultz?
How do you do, Frau Schultz?
Oh, no. I'm Fraulein Elsa, the schoolmistress.
Oh, you'd make a very nice Frau Schultz.
You're mending your grandfather's coat. How nice.
It's his Sunday coat, but he never wears it. He doesn't go to church.
Perhaps we could persuade him to go,
Would you like that?
The pastor and Fraulein Elsa have come to see us. Isn't that nice?
- Good day, neighbor.
- Well?
- We've come to ask about the child.
- Go inside, Heidi.
Save your breath.
I have nothing to say to you.
- That seems to settle it.
- No, it doesn't.
I'm sorry to insist, neighbor, but school will open soon.
- I'll not send Heidi to school.
- What will you do with her, then?
She will thrive up here with the goats and the birds.
- What will she learn from them?
- At least she will learn no evil!
That's hardly enough schooling for a child.
I'll teach her all that's necessary.
And you'll teach her religion too?
The mountains will teach her the only religion worth having... as I have found out.
Come back to Dorfli, neighbor. This is no life up here for you and the child- at enmity with God and man.
I know what they think of me in Dorfli, and they know what I think of them.
- It's better that we keep apart.
- I should not like to appeal to the law.
Heidi shall not go to school or to church, either. That is final!
I'm sorry, neighbor.
May God help you.
And if any man try to take Heidi away from me...
God help him,!
I used to go to Sunday school when I lived in Mayenfeld.
Are you going to be my
Sunday school teacher too?
We'll have our first lesson now.
I'd like to read this story.
Shall I?
"A certain man had two sons... and the...
Y- O-U-N-G-E-R-"
Younger.
"and the younger of them said to his father...
'Father, give me the P-O-R-"'
These are pretty hard words.
Perhaps you'd better help me.
"Give me the portion of goods that fall unto me. "
And he divided unto them his levy... and the younger son gathered all together... and took his journey into a far country.
You know this story by heart.
Yes. By heart.
Does the son ever go home to his father?
And the son said...
"Father, I have sinned against heaven... and in thy sight... and am no more worthy to be called thy son. "
But the father said to his servants...
"Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him... and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet... for this my son was dead and is alive again.
He was lost... and is found. "
"If a man have a hundred sheep... and one of them be gone astray... doth he not leave the 90 and 9... and goeth into the mountains... and seeketh that which has gone astray?
And if-"
Peter, what is it?
The grandfather and Heidi have come to church.
"And if so be that he find it... verily, I say unto you... he rejoiceth more of that sheep... than of the 90 and 9 which went not astray. "
Holy God we praise thy name
Lord of all we bow before thee
All on earth thy scepter claim
All in heaven above adore thee
Fill the heavens with sweet accord
Holy, holy holy, Lord
Holy
Holy, holy Lord
Good day, Adolph.
Good day.
Good to see you and the child.
You're looking well.
Here comes the grandfather now.
So the old eagle has come down from his perch.
It was lonely for Heidi.
Adolph, you're an old fraud.
Don't give me away.
Well-
I ask the Herr Pastor to forgive the words I said on the mountain.
The words are forgotten, neighbor.
This is a happy day for all of us.
I hope we shall see you here often.
- What do you say, Heidi?
- Well, I think everybody... really ought to go to church on Sunday... and I think there ought to be a Frau Schultz.
Aunt Dete, what- what do you want here?
Where's your grandfather?
He's up on the mountain cutting some logs.
Get on your coat and mittens.
We're going away.
I don't want to go away!
- What?
- I want to stay here.
I love the grandfather, and he loves me.
It's my birthday, and we're going to have a party.
Look. He made me these for a present.
There's Swanly and Bearly. And we're going down to the village to get sausage and butter... because the grandmother and Peter are coming.
Well, he won't mind you going on a little trip with me.
- Where?
- Just to Frankfurt.
You can come back whenever you like.
- I don't want to go to Frankfurt.
- You will do as I say!
- Where are your clothes?
- I've got to ask the grandfather first.
- Where are they?
- In there.
Now, there is nothing to worry about.
We'll have a sleigh ride to Mayenfeld and a nice trip on a train.
And I'll buy you a present for your birthday.
- Can I come right back for my party?
- Didn't I tell you you could?
Can I bring some soft rolls for the grandmother?
You see, she hasn't many teeth and can't eat her black bread.
Oh, yes. Come!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
First, I must go up the mountain and tell the grandfather where I'm going.
There isn't time. We might miss our train!
I'll send word back to him!
But I'd rather tell him myself.
Do you think if I put my birthday shoes by the fire...
- he'd know I'm coming back?
- Yes, yes, of course.
Now, come along!
Heidi?
Heidi?
Heidi!
Heidi! Where are you?
- Good day, little Heidi.
- Good day, Herr Pastor.
- Are you going away?
- Yes, to Frankfurt with Aunt Dete.
I'm taking her for a little trip,
Herr Pastor. It's her birthday.
- Oh, how kind of you. Pleasant journey to you, Fraulein.
- Thank you.
Oh, there's the grandfather.
I must go tell him.
- Sit down! Drive on!
- Grandfather!
Have you seen her?
Heidi! She's gone!
Don't you know?
Her aunt has taken her to Frankfurt.
She's stolen her!
Where are they?
Stolen? There.
Heidi!
- I don't think I'll go any farther.
- Oh, yes, you will.
Aunt Dete, tell them to stop!
Keep quiet.
I can't stop the train.
You've got to. It's getting late.
I'll never get back tonight!
Of course you won't.
Sit down and keep still.
- Then you-you knew all the time?
- Well, what if I did?
There's going to be sausage and butter at my party... and I won't be there.
And- And the grandfather will be lonely.
Do you remember what I told you?
I'm to say to the lady...
"How do you do,
Fraulein Rottenmeier?"
And to Klara,
"How do you do, Fraulein Klara?
I hope you will be well soon. "
But why are we going to their house?
You'll find out when we get there.
"The quality of a young lady's breeding... is indicated by her deportment when elders are present.
At such times, her manner should be sedate and diffident. "
It's time for them to be here, Fraulein.
Remember, Klara, no excitement.
You're still an invalid.
"The habit of interruption... should always be frowned upon.
The well-bred young lady always waits until her elders are silent. "
I wonder what she'll be like.
Your father expects a healthy, unspoiled, mountain child... of your age to share your studies.
Personally, I think the whole plan is a mistake.
Papa thought it might be good for me to have a playmate.
But you have me.
Don't I give you my entire time and devotion?
Yes, and it's very kind of you... but I don't have much fun.
Whoa!
Now, remember.
My word!
Well, come on.
Announce us.
Where did you pick up that?
- That is my niece.
- How unfortunate for the poor child.
Are you the king here?
You look like a king.
Ah, little fraulein, if only the rest of the world... could see through your eyes.
Hmm, quite a personage... under that extraordinary hat.
They are here, Fraulein.
- Andrews, what is she like?
- Highly intelligent.
- Don't be misled by the hat.
- Show them in,
How do you do,
Fraulein Rottenmeier?
- What is your name?
- Heidi.
Heidi?
Ridiculous.
What name did they give you when you were baptized?
I don't remember that.
Are you being impudent?
No, Fraulein.
She didn't understand.
- She was baptized Adelheid.
- Hmm.
She looks too young.
How old is she?
She's older than she appears.
She's nearly 11.
Aunt Dete doesn't tell the truth.
I'm eight years old today.
Grandfather was going to give me a birthday party.
How far have you gone in school?
I've never gone at all.
How do you do, Fraulein Klara?
I hope you will be well soon.
Not fraulein. I'm just Klara, and I'll call you Heidi.
- Why do you sit in that chair with wheels?
- I can't walk.
I fell last summer and hurt my back.
That's when Fraulein Rottenmeier came to take care of me.
Then you couldn't climb the mountain with Goat Peter, Swanly and Bearly.
Who are they?
Are they friends of yours?
Yes. They're the grandfather's goats... and Peter, he's the goat general.
Oh, tell me about them.
That's enough! You will take that impossible child back!
You'll have to give me more expense money then... and the 50 marks
Herr Sesemann promised.
You dare to speak to me like that?
- I'll not give you one pfennig!
- You'd better.
I've brought just the kind of child
Herr Sesemann asked for... unless you have your own reasons for not wanting her.
Get out, and take your wretched niece with you!
All right, but you'll give me the money... or I'll write to Herr Sesemann.
You think I don't know what your little game is?
A rich widower and his sick child.
You don't want Klara to get well... not yet... not until you've made him think... his little darling can't live without you.
Now you can get rid of the "impossible child" yourself!.
Sell her to the Gypsies, for all I care!
I'm afraid the grandfather will be worried.
He didn't know I was going away, so I must go back tomorrow.
- Didn't Dete tell you?
- What?
- That you're to live here with me,
- No, she didn't tell me.
You see, my mama's dead, and my papa's business keeps him in Paris most of the time.
- And I haven't anyone to play with.
- I can't live here!
I'm going back to the grandfather right away!
- Indeed, you are.
- No, I like her!
Andrews will take you home in the morning.
- No, I want her to stay!
- That is for me to decide.
- I know what is best for you, Klara.
- No! No! Papa sent for her, and you've got to wait till he comes home!
Klara, you're not strong enough for this excitement. You'll make yourself ill.
Yes, I will, I know I will if you don't let me keep Heidi!
- But, Klara, I can't stay!
- Quiet, dear.
Quiet. Remember what a sick little girl you are.
You do want me to get well, don't you, Fraulein?
- How can you ask?
- Then- Then please let me keep Heidi.
- Very well. For the present.
- You can't keep me here!
The grandfather is waiting.
He doesn't know where I am!
Dinner is served.
You'll like it here, Heidi.
We'll have such good times together.
And Fraulein can send word to your grandfather.
No, no! Aunt Dete must take me home!
Dinner is waiting.
We will attend to that tomorrow.
- Then it's all right? I can go?
- I said in the morning, Adelheid.
Adelheid...
I am waiting.
For what we are about to receive... the Lord make us truly thankful.
God bless Grandfather and Swanly and Bearly... and please make me a good little girl.
- Amen.
- Ha!
You may serve.
Remember, Klara, only a little,
- Must you hoard your food, Adelheid?
- It's for the grandmother.
I'm going to take it home with me tomorrow.
Put it back.
- What's that?
- It's technically known as false hare.
I think you'll find it rather tasty.
Will you serve yourself?
I think I'd rather just have some cheese.
Evidently our little friend has no idea of table manners.
Bring me the tray, Andrews.
Now watch, Adelheid.
This is the way civilized people serve themselves,
Stop!
Oh, dear, what a pity.
You may go.
This is not humorous.
You are not in your barbarous hut in the Alps now, but in a cultured home.
Adelheid,!
Did I actually see you yawn?
- I'm horrified!
- Don't scold her.
She's had such a hard day.
I am trying to be patient, Klara.
But it is the height of impropriety to yawn at the dinner table.
Ayawn at any time is a sign of disrespect... and lack of control,
It shows the attention is wandering... and that the young person is not interested in the improvement of her mind.
Oh!
Why, it's really more than it's worth.
- You're going for the child?
- I am.
You're not walking all the way to Frankfurt? It's over 100 miles.
- I shall get there.
- Let us lend you enough railway fare.
That's kind of you, Franz... but my legs will carry me.
I have money to bring us back on the train.
- Auf Wiedersehen. - Good luck,
Adolph. - Godspeed to you, neighbor.
Well, Little Miss Hasty Pudding.
I heard Goat Peter's horn.
He must be looking for me.
- Goat Peter?
- Yes. There. Don't you hear it?
I say, it's a little chilly outside for this sort of thing, isn't it?
Let's try the window. Come on.
Fresh fish!
Fresh fish!
Oh, it isn't Goat Peter at all.
It's only fresh fish.
You'd better get dressed, little fraulein.
Breakfast will be soon.
Well, I never thought I'd turn out to be a lady's maid.
There.
Hurry up.
Breakfast in 10 minutes,
Adelheid.
We insist on punctuality in this household.
"Punctuality. "
Don't dawdle.
"Adelheid-"
- Well, I-
- Shh!
It is the height of punctuality to yawn at the dinner table.
Isn't Heidi the funniest little thing?
I'm so glad she's going to stay.
- Is she?
- Yes, but she doesn't know it.
The poor dear thinks she's going home today.
But she'll be happier here.
Don't you think so?
I'll have some new dresses made for her.
Do you think you could manage a new hat?
Oh, Heidi!
It's lovely!
I wonder where Aunt Dete is.
It's time we started.
Oh, uh, don't think about that now.
We're going to have our lessons with Fraulein in a minute.
Well, maybe I could just this once... if there's time.
I'll be sorry to leave you.
I hope you begin to walk soon... and not have to sit in that chair.
Fraulein says perhaps
I'll never walk again.
Well, Goat Peter said
I'd never learn to read... but the grandfather told me I could, and I did.
Your back feels just like mine.
And your legs do too.
I should think you could walk if you wanted to enough.
- Why don't you try?
- Oh, I wouldn't dare.
- Why not?
- I might fall.
Lean on me.
I'm pretty strong.
Do you really think
I could walk?
We'll try, then we'd find out.
Come on, put your hand on me.
No, no, I can't!
- Don't ever tell Fraulein!
- I won't.
- What's that?
- A monkey.
I'd better let her in.
She's sitting in the snow.
Oh, Fraulein wouldn't like it.
She wouldn't want her to catch cold.
Besides, I've never met a monkey. Have you?
No. Not to speak to.
Oh, she says she's very cold.
Come on! Come on!
How are you?
She has very nice manners.
Fraulein Rottenmeier would like you. Come on.
Doorbell when the hall's being washed down!
- I want-a Louise.
- You want what?
- Louise, a-my monkey.
- Monkey? You've been misinformed.
This is not the zoo!
You'd make a very nice schoolteacher.
She wants you to name the principal rivers of Europe.
I'm afraid that's too hard.
Can't you ask me something easier?
If you young ladies have finished with you vulgar display of lack of restraint... we will begin our lessons.
Andrews! Andrews!
Help! Help!
Did you call?
Take that thing out of here!
My word. A gorilla!
Well, don't stand there fiddle-faddy.
Take that beast out of here!
This is no laughing matter!
Yes, uh, scat,!
Do you mind? Scat,!
Aah!
Get him off!.
Get him off!.
Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, I'm most awfully sorry. This is most undignified.
- How dare you!
This is really not my fault.
Can I help you up at all? There we go!
Well!
Get him out ofhere,!
Oh, my God!
You might try putting salt on her tail.
- Ah, what we need is strategy.
- Can I get it for you?
No, thank you.
I think I've got it.
Now the rest of you draw fire.
I'll attack from the rear.
Come here, little monkey! come here,! come,! come,!
- Come on! Come on!
- Here, monkey!
This has gone far enough!
Come on in.
Louise! Louise!
- She'll come down now. Here's your papa.
- Come, Louise.
Better get out quickly before she finds her tongue.
- Here you are.
- What's the matter with you?
- Who let that beast in?
- I did.
- But she was so cold out in the snow.
- That's no concern of ours.
Please, Fraulein, it was my fault as much as hers.
Such conduct is inexcusable!
She shall be punished severely!
Don't you touch her!
I'll write Papa!
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
Don't excite yourself.
I'd forgotten it might upset you.
Adelheid, you shall spend the rest of the day in your room.
I can't do that.
Aunt Dete is going to take me home.
Your aunt went away this morning.
She... went away?
But she's coming back.
- No, she's not. I discharged her.
- But she's got to take me home!
I'm afraid not.
She cares nothing about you.
- She told me to sell you to the Gypsies.
- Oh, Fraulein, don't.
I doubt whether you will ever see your Aunt Dete again.
- What does this mean?
- You mustn't stop me!
What have you got in that hat?
- Oh. So you were running away.
- I wasn't running away.
I was just going home by myself.
- Andrews, throw these rolls in the dustbin.
- Oh, no.
They're for the grandmother.
She can't eat her black bread.
Throw that wretched hat in the dustbin too.
Oh, no. Not my hat.
I need that to go home.
That is all, Andrews.
If you stop me, I'll run away again!
I can't stay here!
There aren't any pine trees or any mountains!
The grandfather doesn't know where I am!
- You've got to let me go!
- Stop this nonsense!
You're not going home until I send you!
Now you march upstairs!
You leave your room again today, you'll be whipped!
Come on, little fraulein.
Keep the chin up.
Here's your precious bonnet.
Don't you think we ought to put it under the bed to avoid the dustbin?
Try and cheer her up, dear, will you?
Oh, Heidi, I-
I didn't know you wanted to go home so much.
But you mustn't run away again.
- Promise you won't.
- Oh, no. I couldn't promise.
You must, Heidi.
Papa's coming home for Christmas.
That's only two weeks more.
If- If you still feel homesick then...
I'll ask him to send you back.
Are you sure he will?
Oh, yes.
He'll do it for me.
I won't run away.
I promise.
Come in.
I'm all new to meet Klara's papa.
And, I must say, very impressive.
And just look at this!
I was hoping for a new hat.
But I'm not going to wear my new clothes...
- when I go home tonight.
- No?
The grandfather might not know me.
You're going to leave us tonight, are you?
Yes. Klara's gonna ask her papa to send me.
He'll be here in a few moments, and I've come to tell you that when you meet him... you're to say, "How do you do, gracious sir?"
- And make him a little curtsy.
- What's that?
Well, it's uh-
That's a funny way to say how do you do.
I daresay, but don't you think you ought to practice it?
How do you do, gracious sir?
Yes, I think that ought to do.
A merry Christmas to you, sir.
- Merry Christmas to you, Andrews.
- Thank you, sir.
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite all right.
Quite all right.
- Merry Christmas, Karl.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.
Welcome, Herr Sesemann.
Oh, thank you,
Fraulein Rottenmeier.
- How is Klara?
- As well as may be expected... considering what we've been through.
I didn't want to disturb you by writing...
- but the child Dete brought is impossible.
- Indeed!
Her manners are dreadful, and she excites
Klara to do things beyond her strength.
I've been seriously worried.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why didn't you send the girl away?
Klara took an absurd fancy to the child... and I hadn't the heart to cross her.
You know I'm foolishly fond of dear Klara.
But I hope you'll act immediately for the sake of Klara's health.
- Papa, Papa, I'm waiting,!
- Coming, dear.
We will discuss this later, Fraulein.
- Oh, Papa, I'm so glad to see you.
- Oh, darling.
Klara, what has happened?
I expected-
That is, Fraulein told me-
But you haven't looked so well since your accident.
Of course.
Because I've been so happy.
- It's Heidi. My little companion.
- Heidi?
Thank you a thousand times for letting me have her.
But Fraulein seems to think she excites you beyond your strength.
I like to be excited, and she makes something funny happen all the time.
Oh, Papa, she's the dearest little thing.
Well, my darling, something has had an amazing effect on you.
I didn't have much to look forward to before.
Now when I wake up,
I think...
"I'm going to spend the day with Heidi!"
I don't see why
Fraulein doesn't like her.
Nor I. It's very odd.
This, sir, is Fraulein Heidi.
How do you do, Heidi?
How do you do, Sir Gracious?
I didn't do it very well.
Shall I try it again?
I don't think that could be improved upon.
We're going in to the
Christmas tree in a minute.
You'll never guess what your present is, will he, Heidi?
Let me see. Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?
Well, I suppose it's sort of animal.
I know. It's a Shetland pony.
We're ready for the ceremony, Herr Sesemann.
Come on, Sir Gracious!
Here we go.
Remember, don't excite yourself.
You'll tire easily.
Yes, Fraulein.
Silent night

Merry Christmas to you all... and thank you for another year's faithful service.
Our Christmas greetings to you, sir, and Fraulein Klara.
A long life and good health to you both.
- Thank you, Andrews.
- We're very grateful, sir.
- Karl.
- Thank you, sir.
- Fritz.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Merry Christmas, Frieda.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
We'll wait till we've had our presents.
He thinks it's going to be an animal.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.
For your Christmas,
Fraulein. And thank you... for the efficient management of my household.
Thank you, Herr Sesemann.
I've always felt like a mother to Klara.
Now, Papa, my present to Heidi first.
- Oh, Klara. Your back.
- Oh.
I forgot.
That one, Papa.
- Happy Christmas to you, my dear.
- Thank you.
To Klara, from her doting papa.
Turn it upside down, then right-side up, Heidi.
It's the grandfather's house!
He's bringing in the wood.
Can I keep it for always?
Longer than that.
Oh! Heidi, look!
- Oh!
- It's lovely.
Now it's my turn.
I don't see... my Shetland pony around anywhere.
Shall we give him his present now?
You hold my doll, Fraulein.
Now watch, Papa.
You stand over there.
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.
- Klara, stop!
- Wait!
Lean on me until you get started.
Now, try hard.
Merry Christmas, Papa.
Oh, my darling.
My darling child.
They told me you might never walk again.
- How did you? How did it happen?
- Heidi taught me.
Heidi-
I was afraid, but she made me try.
We did a little more every day.
You dear child, you've worked a miracle.
Oh, no. It was the grandfather.
Goat Peter said
I'd never learn to read... but the grandfather said
I could if I wanted to... and I did.
So I thought Klara could walk if she wanted to... and she did.
You've given me the happiest
Christmas of my life.
And I've had a nice
Christmas present too.
Shall I get ready to go home now?
No. I have another
Christmas present for you- a home with us as long as you live.
- No. I couldn't do that.
- Why not?
The grandfather's been waiting for me... such a long time.
Oh, Heidi, I hoped you wouldn't want to go now.
Yes, I'd like to be that... but I've got to go home.
Papa, I told Heidi you'd let her go if she wanted to.
But you don't understand, dear.
You'll be my own daughter.
You'll have clothes like Klara's... everything just like hers... and grow up to be a great lady.
- Now, wouldn't you like that?
- No, thank you.
I want to go home to my grandfather.
- I can't let you do that.
- But Klara promised!
- I- - I'm sorry, Heidi.
Someday you'll understand.
Papa, I did promise you'd send her home.
But dear, you don't know what her grandfather's like.
Dete told me that he was a very brutal man... feared by everyone.
No, Heidi will be much happier here with us.
You!
You've spoiled everything!
Don't break my snowstorm!
Fraulein Rottenmeier,!
What is the meaning of this?
Forgive me, Herr Sesemann,
I- I was beyond myself.
You must realize I cannot have you longer in my employ.
- Yes, Herr Sesemann.
- I'll give you a month's salary.
You will arrange to leave tomorrow.
Grandfather.
Grandfather.
I'll never see you again.
- Looking for somebody?
- My granddaughter.
You might find her at the theater.
Every youngster in town tries to get there on Christmas day.
Yes. She might be there.
Thank you.
- What is it, Grandpa?
- I'm looking for my granddaughter.
- But you can't go inside.
- I must see if she's here.
Sorry, sir.
The performance is just over.
You better wait over there.
All right.
Santa Claus!
- Santa Claus!
- Santa Claus!
Santa Claus!
Oh, Heidi, see the funny
Santa Claus over there?
Where? I can't see.
Papa, please take us over to see him.
We better not, dear. You've had too much excitement for one day.
- But Heidi hasn't seen him.
- Never mind. I don't care.
Heidi!
Heidi, where are you?
It's the grandfather calling me!
It couldn't be your grandfather, Heidi.
It sounded just like him.
You must be mistaken, dear. Your grandfather is 100 miles away on his mountain.
I'm almost sure I heard him.
I know it was his voice!
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Where are you?
Heidi! Heidi!
Whoa!
Don't you worry.
That wasn't your grandfather.
Heidi!
Heidi!
- Heidi!
- What do you want?
I thought this was the sleigh.
It must be the right street.
Heidi!
Schutzmann,
That old fellow is acting very strangely.
I think you'd better keep an eye on him.
Is my granddaughter here?
A child named Heidi.
Your granddaughter?
It isn't likely.
I'll see for myself!.
Come here!
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my granddaughter.
She may be in this house!
- Come! Come!
- You better come with us.
She's in one of these houses.
I'll not leave till I find her!
- What is this?
- You can't disturb people!
Herr Wachtmeister,
I heard her cry out from the sleigh.
I tell you, she's in some trouble.
We can't have you beating on all the doors of Frankfurt at this hour!
- I must find her.
- Of course. Of course.
But she can come to no harm tonight.
If you're still worried in the morning, we'll investigate your story.
I tell you,
I must find her tonight!
- Lock him up.
- The cells are full, Herr Wachtmeister.
Naturally, naturally.
Christmas night.
- Put him in the detention room then.
- But, Herr Wachtmeister-
Take him away.
Stop that.
Christmas comes but once a year
Ja, and with it comes too much beer. christmas comes but once a year
With it comes too much beer
Heidi. Get up.
And be very quiet.
Why? What's the matter?
We're going away.
Oh, is it morning already, and you're going to take me home?
Yes, that's it.
We're going home.
But I thought Andrews was going to take me.
Shh. He can't. You're to go with me. Now dress quickly.
If You are a just and merciful God... then help me... in this hour in my need.
Hurry up!
But first I must go and say good-bye to Klara and her papa.
No, you can't disturb them so early.
I said good-bye for you.
Oh, wait. I forgot.
Don't do that again!
Heidi! Heidi!
I'll put a stop to that.
Ah, let the poor chap enjoy his Christmas.
Why, it isn't morning at all.
- It's still night.
- Shh! It's a long way.
You've got to catch an early train.
- This isn't the right way!
- I know what I'm doing!
I don't think I'll go with you.
I'll wait for Andrews.
He will have to find you first.
Let me go!
Let me go!
- This is the child.
- Ah.
Nice little girl.
Let me go!
I want my grandfather!
- You'll never see your grandfather again.
- Come on!
Come on.
Ayyy!
- Heidi! Heidi!
- Grandfather,! Grandfather,!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
- Heidi!
- Grandfather,!
Grandfather, she's hurting me!
Grandfather, take me home!
What happened?
What's the matter?
That old man stole my child.
Hey, you! Stop!
Stop!
- They've stolen my sled.
- Who owns this one?
- I do.
- Get in, and follow that man.
- What happened?
- Stolen sleigh!
Follow that man with the child!
Stop!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
Whoa!
You broke out of jail.
You took a sled that did not belong to you.
You stole that child,!
- He didn't steal me!
- I tell you, she's mine!
Silence!
Herr Captain, we have found the woman.
Good. Bring her in.
- Is this your child?
- Yes, Herr Captain.
No, I'm not!
Is this the man who struck you and took her away from you?
- Yes.
- She's lying!
I don't know who she is or what she's doing, but Heidi is mine!
That's enough!
You will be held for trial.
You stupid fools!
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- Lock him up,!
You can't! You're not going to take her away from me again!
No! No, you mustn't take him away!
He's telling the truth!
He is my grandfather.
My really and truly grandfather!
Please! Please let him go!
- Come on! Don't be hysterical.
- Grandfather!
We'll want you for the trial,
Take your child home,
I am not her child!
She's a bad lady!
She tried to sell me to the Gypsies!
Please.
Please let the grandfather take me home.
He didn't mean to do anything bad.
I'll work hard and pay back for everything he broke.
- So will Swanly and Bearly.
- Pay no attention to her.
She'll be all right when I get her to bed.
I won't go with her!
She broke my snowstorm... and sent my Aunt Dete away so she couldn't take me home to the mountains!
If you don't believe me just ask Herr Sesemann.
- He'll tell you the truth.
- Herr Sesemann?
What has Herr Sesemann to do with this?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- He has too.
Aunt Dete brought me there to play with Klara.
- I taught her her how to walk.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
- Come along.
- Just a minute.
- Well, now, Lieutenant- - Perhaps we'd better send for Herr Sesemann.
Oh, absurd! We- Well, we visited the Sesemann house tonight.
Christmas, you know.
My sister's governess there.
It would be highly improper to disturb Herr Sesemann at this hour!
I think you'd better wait until we hear... what Herr Sesemann has got to say.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Dear, dear, dear.
Seems quite impossible.
Nothing emerges from the spigot.
- Not that way!
- Oh.
That way.
My word!
I say, Bearly's a very warm goat, isn't she?
- Of course, silly. All goats are warm.
- How cozy.
Heidi,! Heidi,!
They're coming,!
Really ought to master this.
Let's have a race to the grandfather.
Well, well.
Oh, Grandfather, this is Klara.
And just think- she beat me running!
And I beat Herr Sesemann.
How do you do?
This is the grandmother and Goat Peter.
And this is Pastor Schultz and Frau Schultz.
I guess I can't deny it this time.
They were married yesterday.
Come, sit down, all of you!
You must be starved after your climb up the mountain.
Bless us, O Lord, in these Thy gifts... which we are about to receive from Thy bounty.
And please make every little boy and girl in the world as happy as I am.
Amen.
41 st Street.
Here, son.
- Castle?
- That's right.
- Cash.
- Oh, cash.
Wait a minute.
Mr. Fields, can I trouble you for $ 10 advance on my next week's salary.
You'll never have a next week's salary.
You already spent it last week.
Mr. Fields, if my next week's salary can make a beautiful lady happy this week...
...it's my duty to spend it. Thanks.
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- Oh, thanks.
Say, Vernon, if those flowers are for Miss Ford, you're aiming too high.
- We're having supper after the show.
- But you haven't got the right ammunition.
- The what?
- Spondoodles, mazuma.
Something that you second comics never have.
But someday I'll be the first comic, after you.
- Thanks.
- I'm sure you're wrong about Miss Ford.
A lot of fellas have been wrong about Miss Ford. And you're next.
Look out.
She trifles with men's hearts.
Let her trifle with mine.
I'm not doing anything important with it.
- Addie.
- Yes, Miss Ford.
Be ready to dress me immediately after the finale.
I'm having supper at Rector's with Mr. Vanderpool.
Miss Ford.
- You're on next Mr. Castle.
- All right, John.
- Will you wear this tonight?
- Tonight?
- Remember our supper date.
- Oh, of course, I remember.
But my head is splitting and I should be in bed this minute. You'll forgive me, darling.
- How about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
Sunday. Well, I'm going to the beach at New Rochelle with my mother.
- Suppose I meet you at the club house?
- Oh, dear, well...
...if it's all right with Mother.
I'm so sorry about tonight.
Well, what did I tell you?
Mr. Fields, could you bag me for a round trip ticket to New Rochelle.
By the sea, by the sea
By the beautiful sea
You and I, you and I
Oh, how happy we'll be
When each wave comes a-rolling in
We will duck or swim
And we'll float
And fool around the water
Over and under
And then up for air
Pa is rich, Ma is rich
So now why do we care?
I love to be beside your side
Beside the sea
Beside the seaside
By the beautiful sea
Hello, pup. Who are you?
Well.
Mr. Castle. Mr. Castle.
Yes. Over here.
- You waiting for Miss Ford?
- Miss Claire Ford, yes.
She just phoned. Said, tell Mr. Castle her head was still splitting.
Oh, I see.
It's too bad.
Lots of other ladies sitting around here, Mr. Castle.
I dare say. Thanks.
- Have you seen a dog around here?
- Yes. Where is he?
Who is that fella?
Come on, there.
Get up you.
Oh, you poor little thing.
- Walter.
- I'm coming, Sailor.
- Isn't he your dog?
- Isn't he yours?
I never saw him until a moment ago.
Well, it must belong to somebody.
Walter, take the dog into the boat.
Well, I don't like the look of this,
Miss Irene.
- Take the dog.
- Drowning that dog to get acquainted.
Some of these whippersnappers go pretty far.
- I beg your pardon.
- Don't mind Walter.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Climb in.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Goodbye.
Walter, let the gentleman into the boat.
That's exactly what you want to do, ain't it?
No, no.
I'm quite comfortable, thank you.
Oh, please get in.
Thank you very much.
You are wonderful to jump in to rescue a little stray dog.
- I'm very keen on dogs.
- Me too.
I keep a sort of boarding house for wandering dogs in my dressing room.
- Dressing room?
- Yes, in the theatre.
In the theatre?
- Are you an actor?
- Well, yes.
- You're not the only actor in this boat.
- Do you act?
Me? No, I just work for the family.
- You?
- Hi.
She's a genius.
Walter practically raised me and he's sort of prejudice.
What show are you with?
She played the fairy queen in Miss Dodd's
Seminary's Annual Entertainment.
- Oh, amateur shows.
- Dances like a sun beam.
What's your name?
- My name's Castle.
- My name's Foote.
My name will be mud when I try to explain this to your mother.
- Why don't you start the motor?
- Because it's broke, that's why.
- Looks all right.
- Looks broke.
Irene was just 3, then.
Don't you love the flowers?
- And this is when she was 7.
- Very fetching.
The next one is Pinafore. Being English yourself, Mr. Castle, I know you'll like it.
She was in a school production when she was 10. Do you remember, Hubert?
- Oh, yes.
- Well, here's our dog.
- Our dog?
- I asked all around the neighborhood...
...and nobody claims him, so Sailor wants to keep it.
- Well, he's very sweet.
- Here boy. Here boy.
- What train you figure on making?
- The 5:30.
I figure the 4:30.
Oh, look.
How nice.
Irene's going to do a rendition for you.
- For me?
- Yes.
She's never had a chance to do it for a professional audience before.
I think I'll go out and work in the garden a bit.
Hubert, you stay right here.
I think my clothes must be dry by now.
You sit here, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, an imitation of Miss Bessie McCoy...
...doing her famous number,
"The Yama Yama Man." Thank you.
Mr. Castle, she may be a little nervous.
I'm a little nervous myself.
Every little tot at night
Is afraid of the dark, you know
Some big Yama Man they sing
As off to bed they go
Yama Yama Yama Man
Terrible eyes and a face of tan
If you don't watch out
He will sting you
Without a doubt, if he can
Maybe he's hiding behind the chair
Ready to spring out at you unaware
So run to your mama for here comes
The Yama Yama Yama Man
Bravo.
- You did very nicely, dear.
- Thank you.
- Well, sir?
- That was fine.
Yes, sir that certainly was fine.
Thanks very much.
Do you really mean it or you're just saying it?
No, really, I mean, you gave it quite a professional touch... here and there.
Here and there?
I mean everywhere.
It was very nice.
Now, if you'll excuse me, you see my train...
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry, I wish I can stay and see it again.
- But I'm afraid...
- You afraid to see it again?
- Not at all.
- You don't wanna see it again?
- What the young man means is that...
- Hubert...
...let Mr. Castle decide.
- I would like to, but I must go.
- You'd like to see it again?
- Walter, he didn't say that.
- The man said...
- No, he didn't.
- I'd like to see it again, except my train...
- No trouble at all.
Now Walter, not unless Mr. Castle wants to.
- I knew he didn't.
- I do.
Well, all right.
There's a possibility you may catch the 8:15.
I understand every one of your criticisms, except for one you sort of mumble.
Oh, that one.
- What does "ham" mean?
- That's just an expression.
Well, what does it mean?
In the theater we speak of certain actors as hams.
Well, that makes me feel so professional.
- Am I a real ham?
- Well, yes you're a little ham.
Oh, wonderful.
And after the way we ran.
Come Josephine
In my flying machine
Going up all on
Goodbye
Come Josephine
In my flying machine
Going up she goes
Up she goes
Balance yourself like
A bird on a beam
In the air she goes
There she goes
Up, up a little bit higher
Oh, my moon is on fire
Come Josephine
In my flying machine
Going up
All on
Goodbye
- Come on.
- Come on.
Go it, Vernon.
You didn't tell me you can dance like that.
- You're marvelous.
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
All aboard. Go ahead, kiss her.
Next Sunday is a long way off.
Next Sunday? Oh, yeah.
All aboard.
Hurry up, bashful.
Oh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
Let me put my arms about you
I could never live without you
Oh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
If you ever leave me
How my heart would ache
I want to hug you
But I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, you beautiful doll
- Oh, Irene, I can hardly wait.
- Does he dance soon?
Oh, here he is.
You see he's in the next scene and he plays with the star.
The Barber Lew Fields
The Customer Vernon Castle.
- My aunt once knew an opera singer.
- Did she?
- Wait till you see Vernon dance.
- Isn't it wicked?
I mean knowing an actor.
- He's coming down the stairs now.
- Are you sure?
Leave him to me.
Leave him to me.
I'll show him for insulting my daughter.
- Say something.
- L...
That's real ham comedy.
- What did you say?
- Ham.
- Where?
- You're looking at two of the best...
...right down there.
- Done it again, Vernon.
- Yeah.
- You were great today, Vernon.
- Oh, thanks.
Thanks very much.
Oh, hello.
Have you been out front?
How did you like it?
You were terrible.
Oh, so Ms. Irene Foote... actress of New Rochelle... thinks I'm terrible.
Thanks for taking the trouble to come back and tell me so.
You could be a perfectly wonderful dancer if you wanted to.
Instead you waste your talent letting people set fire to you.
It takes talent to make people laugh.
And I like being set fire to.
- Well, I won't have you doing it.
- Oh, you won't.
Say, what makes you so excited about me?
You have something no comedian will ever have and you're wasting it.
What other reason could there be?
Oh, I don't know. Girls, especially young girls, sometimes gets crushes on actors...
- Oh, I didn't...
- You called me a ham.
Well, you're a ham with mustard.
Oh, I know what it means.
And if you think I had interest in coming back here, you're mistaken.
- Wait.
- Don't think I'll annoy you...
...with my intentions, Mr. Castle. Just go on, be funny with soap on your face...
...and get to be a first comedian.
I thought you could be a first dancer.
A very beautiful first dancer.
Because you are a beautiful dancer, but you're so smug and conceited...
...that you can't see any further than your funny nose.
There!
Was you expecting someone, Sailor?
Can't a person sit in their own front yard on a Sunday without expecting somebody.
I knew he's a fly-by-night.
I knew it the minute I seen him.
- Who?
- The fellow you're not expecting.
Hello there.
Is Ms. Foote at home?
She's not?
Did she go out?
Come on, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie. Come on.
That's it.
- My, it's getting warm, isn't it, Walter?
- Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Castle.
I just happened to be out this way, so I stopped by to see if the dog is all right.
Oh, Zowie?
Oh, he's just fine, thank you.
Thought he might be sick, that's why I came out.
- No, he's just fine.
- That's good.
See, I thought he might be sick and just thought I'd...
Come out.
My, what a beautiful automobile.
- Is it yours?
- Just a little runabout.
- There's nothing like a good spin.
- Makes you dizzy.
No, it doesn't, Walter.
It's just I'm not one way or another about it.
Well, I guess I'd better be running along.
Bye.
Well, I'm glad the dog is all right.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Oh, dear.
Here, Zowie. Here, Zowie.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, Zowie, you bad little dog.
Sailor, you get down out of that contraption. It ain't safe.
Smile...
...walk...
...cross in front. To the audience.
- To each other.
- To each other.
- Cross in front.
- Cross in front.
- To the audience.
- To each other.
- Cross in front...
- That's enough.
We get two bows we'll be doing very well.
If we keep on like that, it won't be long before we can ask Mr. Fields for a trial.
Cuba pressed by Spain appeals to Uncle Sam for aid.
Niagara Falls.
That's quite a place for...
I mean, that's quite a place for people to go.
Oh, you mean on honeymoons?
Yeah.
Devil's Island. That's interesting too.
- Irene.
- Yes?
We've only known each other about three months.
Irene.
Irene, have you seen my copy of Vogue?
Oh, here it is, Mother.
- Anything yet?
- Not yet.
Well, I don't wanna interrupt anything.
You were saying that we've known each other for nearly three months.
Yes, you see my one aim in life...
...has always been to keep from getting involved.
"Vernon don't get involved,"
I've always said.
I mean I used to say.
Well, what do you say now?
Well, you know, I think when people dance well together...
...it's because they're sympathetic to each other.
In fact, that's part of what I was getting at.
Dancing brings people closer together.
I don't mean only closer together...
Oh, good evening, darling.
- Good evening, Vernon.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello, Dad.
- Anything happened while I was out?
- Everybody finished with the paper?
- Oh, I'll get it for you, Dad.
Oh, thank you.
Some new records I brought.
Somebody flying an airship across the English Channel.
Must have been in a hurry.
Dr. Foote, Mrs. Foote wants to see you right away.
Excuse me.
- Can't you leave them alone?
- I've been leaving them alone all winter.
Aren't we ever going to use that parlor again?
Do you like this tune?
Only when you're in my arms
I can reach up to heaven
And pluck out a star from the blue
It's true
But only when you're in my arms
I can live without riches
And still have a million or two
It's true
But only when you're in my arms
Though I'm ambitious
My wishes
Have always been simple and few
Give me the moonlight
The music
And darling an armful of you
I can see myself doing
The things that I never could do
It's true
But only when you're in my arms
Irene, look, I'm terribly in love with you.
I never thought I'd fall in love but I have, and I'm glad I have.
And will you please marry me?
Yes.
- I'm in love with you too.
- You...
Well...
...thanks.
Walter.
- Walter, we're going to be married.
- Are you surprised?
Gee, whiz.
Well, where do we go on the honeymoon?
Dr. Foote, you can start using the parlor again.
Vernon, I'm scared.
Now, now, sweetheart, that's no way to talk.
I don't feel so rosy myself.
Maybe we're not quite ready yet.
Maybe we should rehearse some more.
And come back next week, huh?
- Yes, that's it.
- Come on Walter.
What are you doing, running away?
We thought we'd go home, rehearse more and come back next week.
Next week? Now look, you've been practicing for months...
...and you know everything fine. Why, you did it for me last night. It was beautiful.
Come right back here and sit down.
When Mr. Fields tells you...
...keep your chin up, your chest out and put your best foot forward.
Hello, Vernon.
Hello, Mrs. Castle.
How are the newlyweds?
Well, Vernon, what do you wanna show me, a bride-and-groom skit?
Mr. Fields, it's a...
...it's a sort of a dance.
- It is a dance.
Since when have you had dancing ambitions?
- Since he met me.
- Oh. Well, all right, let's look at it.
- Thanks.
- Charlie, put on the front border.
You sit here.
- I hope I don't disappoint you.
- Come on. You know...
...chin up, chest out and best foot forward.
All right, Walter.
Very nice.
No?
Why not?
Well, now, who's gonna pay money to see a man dance with his wife?
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give Mrs. Castle a line in the show, and as for you, Vernon...
...next season I'll hand you a whole new scene.
- That will be...
- Mr. Fields, what kind of a scene?
Well, I'll tell you.
The idea is that I'm a bricklayer.
- Oh, and I'm your helper.
- Yes.
- You come on with a hat full of bricks.
- And you trip me up.
No, I shove you right in the cement.
- And I'm covered with it.
- You clumsy geek, pick up those bricks.
Oh, I see.
See, he is the one, Papa.
The droll one.
Oh, so droll in the barbershop.
Right back into the cement.
What's the matter?
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't do it.
- What?
Why not?
We're going to dance together.
- Say, whose idea is this?
- Ours.
Well, you know Vernon, as a comedian you're valuable to me.
But as a dancer... Even two dancers.
- You wouldn't bring in two nickels.
We're sorry, Mr. Fields, but we think you're wrong.
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're wrong.
Now, don't take it too badly, Mrs. Castle.
We all make mistakes.
See you later, Vernon.
Greenhorn.
Do you think it's true, what he said?
We can try some other managers.
We want to dance and we're going to.
I wish I knew where.
- Mr. Castle.
- Mr. Castle.
- Mr. Castle.
- Yes.
- I'm Mr. Aubel and this is Emile, my son.
- Oh, how do you do?
My father and I purchased from Mr. Fields the French rights to The Hen Pecks.
And we reproduce the play in the Paris next spring.
And we want you for our show.
You want...
Oh, Vernon, darling.
A honeymoon in Paris and we get paid for it.
- You come?
- Sure, we'll come.
Oh, Walter, I don't know about you.
Walter, goes with us if it takes our last cent.
Sure.
You think I'll let you two go alone?
Gee, whiz.
Wait a minute, there's the theater.
- There's the theater.
- Hold it.
Turn around. Tell him to turn around.
Back there.
No, no.
Have him wait, Walter.
- No, that's too expensive.
- Whatever, our salary starts any minute.
Hello, Mr. Aubel.
How do you do?
Here we are.
I believe you telephoned our secretary.
Oui, Oui...
I am very sorry...
...but it is so.
- What?
But you told him we were late.
Emile?
No, no. We are late.
Nous, not vous.
- The play is late.
- Au revoir...
...we see you in six weeks.
Vernon, what are we going to do in the meantime? We haven't any money.
- Wait a minute. Monsieur...
- No, no, let me.
I'm used to this. It's very simple.
Mr. Aubel, could we trouble you for the usual advance on our salary?
You don't understand. I mean, we're a little short of cash.
Mr. Aubel.
Please.
For you, madam.
Emile.
You will please sign... A formality.
Wait, this is for eight days' salary instead of seven.
Interest, you know?
- Like a bank.
- Oh, yes.
- What, is this customary?
- I guess so.
Our country seems so strange to you.
You must not bother about business.
- You are young, and it is Paris, it is spring...
- Papa.
Au revoir, madame.
Zowie, you bad dog. We're so sorry.
I wait.
From now on, we walk.
- Pay him, Walter.
- Take Zowie to that fancy hotel and pack.
We're going to look for a flat.
Bye.
What?
To you.
Well, we got our health, we're young...
...we're in Paris, we're on our honeymoon...
...what more do we want?
- Nothing.
Oh, look.
- Isn't that a darling Dutch cap?
- Well, we can afford that.
Oh, no.
No, we can't.
- But you want it.
- I told you, I don't want anything but you.
- Mr. Castle.
- Come on, let's hurry.
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Come on, Zow, come on.
Hurry up, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie.
- Oh, did you hurt yourself?
- Zowie.
Hurry up, hurry up.
- I hope I got the key.
- Get in here, Zowie. Hurry up.
That's it, hurry up.
Mr. Castle.
Where is my money?
For eight weeks you have not paid.
- Where is my money?
- Quiet, if you please.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Must we be subjected to all this brawling?
Pardon, madame.
Let me explain.
But those young people...
I am hoarse from screaming for my rent.
You will have to scream for his rent, too, if you don't mind your manners.
I've brought him a client...
...who can't stand noise.
- Maggie.
Quiet.
Such a quaint place, isn't it?
Veritable bit of Bohemia.
Really, Maggie, these obscure geniuses of yours.
- I don't know if they're worth it or not.
- I'm sure this one is.
Of course you're sure.
You get 10 percent of what I pay him.
My nerves are on edge.
- Can't you work faster?
- Faster? Faster...
Maggie, I can't stand it.
Lady Bolton, please, please.
You take your time.
Look.
- Madam, the pose.
- You expect me to pose...
...when we all may be killed at any instant?
I don't care if he is a genius.
Either this bedlam ceases, or I leave.
Stop it.
Stop it up there.
All right.
We heard you.
Well, at least we can eat.
I'm gonna move out of this place.
- Eat what?
- Oh, what have we here?
Would you carve?
- I'm not hungry.
- Oh, Vernon.
Why don't we get a call from the Aubels?
Why don't they start?
- Maybe we're not in the show.
- You know we are.
Oh, Vernon, you're the optimist. You're the one that always sees the bright side.
Bright side?
Look.
- Darling, that's all that's left.
- Walter.
Quiet. Quiet.
They've started rehearsals for the show.
- Started rehearsals?
- That's what it says.
- Repetition commences.
- Why didn't Mr. Aubel let us know?
What's the difference? The show starts, our salary starts. Come on.
- Walter, where are my dancing shoes?
- In the trunk.
- Oh, no, they're on your feet.
- Oh. Come on, let's go.
Oh, wait a minute.
I can't go until I press my suit.
- You and Walter go, I'll meet you there.
- All right. Hurry.
Hello, Mr. Aubel.
Ah, Monsieur Castle.
Why didn't you tell us rehearsals started?
Did you think we didn't need any?
- But you knew what you have to do.
- Come.
There she is.
- Oh, but you hired us to dance.
- Dance?
No, no, no.
We have the dance.
- Oh, you will be a knockout, Mr. Castle.
- All Paris will laugh.
You are a very funny man.
The whole French nation
You will hear them saying
A real sensation and the people
Will stay till the break of the day
While we are dancing
Well...
...what happened?
False alarm.
Hello, Zowie.
I got myself all pressed up.
You look nice too.
Don't she, Vernon?
Yeah.
What happened?
Well...
Here's a present for you.
Oh, my little Dutch cap.
We didn't have money to buy this.
We haven't now.
Darling, they didn't hire us to dance.
They just want me for the barbershop scene I did with Fields.
I won't do it, Irene.
I told them I wouldn't.
But then they brought up the money we owe them.
Vernon, would they let you dance alone...
...because if they would...
Do you think I'd wanna dance without you?
I should have let you keep on doing what you were doing.
It's all my fault.
No, it isn't.
Look, darling, we're all right now.
After all, you have got a job.
May not be the job we wanted, but still it's a job.
Maybe later on...
...we get a chance...
...sometime.
Maybe sometime.
Hey.
Dance with me.
All the people downstairs...
Look.
We can do it quietly, like this:
Just as if we're walking on air.
Funny, and we're down to earth for the first time.
- What do you suppose they're doing?
- And you call me nervous.
I'm not nervous, I'm simply curious.
That's nice.
Take a good look, Walter.
This is our farewell appearance.
Get me a chair.
I said get me a chair.
What do you call that...?
That... what you were doing.
Oh. Well, l... I don't know, I guess you might call it the Castle Walk.
- Castle Walk?
- Castle, that's our name.
I'm Vernon Castle, and this is my wife.
My name's Walter.
I'm Maggie Sutton.
Oh. Maggie Sutton, of course.
How would you like to try out for a dancing job?
- What?
- Where?
At the Cafe de Paris.
Cafe de Paris? Irene.
- You know the manager?
- My dear, the manager knows me.
- Darling, we got a job.
- Ah, just a tryout.
All I could guarantee would be your dinner.
Well, maybe you could arrange that for tonight... The dinner, I mean.
- And we could dance tomorrow night.
- Well, I think it might be arranged that way.
- Dinner at the Cafe de Paris.
- Dinner anyplace.
Dinner.
- Does this person dance too?
- No, but I eat.
Walter is our sort of manager.
He was your manager.
You mean you're an agent.
I'm an entrepreneuse...
...but I still expect my 10 percent.
That's some old crank downstairs.
Don't pay no attention.
I beg your pardon?
Everyone is staring at you.
Oh, dear, I hope not.
Because you look so beautiful.
Just like a bride.
I should in my wedding dress, my Dutch cap.
I hope it brings us luck.
I am honored by your presence,
Your Highness.
My dear Louis, thank
Miss Sutton. She is my guide to Paris.
And none better, Your Highness.
They look very respectable for dancers.
Dancers? Who dances?
You must come back tomorrow night,
Louis has a treat for you. Two Americans.
But tomorrow I'm leaving for St. Petersburg.
- Why do they not dance tonight?
- Well, I doubt if they're prepared.
How does one prepare for a dance?
One simply dances.
Have them dance.
I think it's going to be quite amusing.
American dancers.
- A little more caviar, please.
- Foie gras too.
And plenty of the truffles.
Such a rush all day,
I didn't even have time for tea.
I lunched at the club.
Food is very dull there.
- Can you dance now?
- Now, tonight?
I have a Grand Duke over there.
If he likes you, you're made.
- The orchestra.
- We haven't rehearsed with them.
Oh, they can play anything you want.
- But our dinner.
- No, no, no, dance first.
But if he doesn't like us, do we still get dinner?
If you feel like it.
Well, Vernon, we've nothing to lose.
Tell them to play,
"Too Much Mustard."
- Oh, Vernon, I've forgotten everything.
- No. Come on, dance with me.
I raised them.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Castle...
...will dance again in one half-hour.
You know, it's funny I'm not a bit hungry now.
- Neither am I.
- You can't waste it.
Oh, magnifique.
From now on you dance here every night,
I pay you.
A tip from the Grand Duke.
A tip?
We can't possibly accept it.
- We're very grateful but...
- No, this is no time to be proud. We need it.
Irene, look what they're doing.
I think you've started something tonight,
Mr. And Mrs. Vernon Castle.
Isn't there anything in this country except the Castles?
This is getting to be the most...
Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Hello, Frisco, Hello
Way down yonder in New Orleans
Take me back to New York Town
When are you going to break the news to Maggie?
The moment she mentions another tour.
- You're going to have trouble with her.
- Is it Maggie's life, or ours?
- It's ours.
- It's time she found that out.
Very nice.
Well, children, I have some vulgar financial matters to take up with you.
Here are some ideas for your next tour.
There isn't going to be a tour for a while.
Oh, of course, I know you're tired.
So I've arranged to have a week's rest before you start out.
- What's this?
- Going out on the platform. She needs air.
Another mouth to feed.
That makes seven.
- Where and when did you buy that?
- In Baltimore.
Here's the bill.
Hello, Maggie.
Maggie? Very touching.
We'll be in New York in an hour.
It would help if you would sign this now.
Maggie, we want to buy a house in the country.
- All right, buy it.
- Yes, but we want to live in it.
All right, live in it.
She don't want air, she wants water.
Come on, Mag.
Listen, you two, you better make hay while the sun shines.
Maggie, we're in love.
We've made enough money.
- We want to live like simple, married people.
- In a house with our clothes in closets.
We're not going to sign any contracts.
We've got it planned.
We'll visit England.
And Vernon's going to show me where he was born and where he went to school...
Well, everything he knew before he met me.
I didn't know anything before I met you.
Seems to be a strong smell of honey-suckling roses in this car.
And you can't raise horses and dogs...
...and children on a dancing tour, you know that, Maggie.
Well, if I were your age and had your opportunities...
Don't try to talk us out of it. We're firm.
- Don't interrupt me. As I was about to say...
- It won't make a difference.
I was about to say...
...l'd want to do exactly what you're going to do.
Where are we?
Extra! Extra!
Here, boy. Boy.
Germany declares war,
England mobilizes.
"Thousands volunteer for British army."
I guess it won't amount to anything.
It says here that Europe can't afford a war.
It would probably be over in a week.
- Will you spend the night here?
- I should say not.
I find the country quiet very disturbing.
How would you like to be back in Paris?
I see by the papers they bombed it again.
Here comes Sailor.
- Hello, Maggie.
- Hello there.
- Have you told Vernon who was here yet?
- No, but I will.
How are you, Maggie, old girl.
Irene, you ready to come back to the outside world?
As far as we're concerned, there's nothing going on in the world.
There's a war going on.
- Don't talk that way in front of Vernon.
- Then it's on his mind?
No, not at all.
Women are pathetic when they try to fight something bigger than they are.
I'm not trying to fight anything.
Vernon's my life.
I'm his life.
Isn't that enough?
One girl against an army?
It isn't quite enough, Irene.
Come on, let's find Vernon.
- Vernon, Maggie's here.
- Oh, hello, Maggie.
- Vernon.
- What's the matter?
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, the uniform.
It's for the British benefit, Sunday night.
They've asked me to dance.
I told you.
Well, if this is your idea of a joke...
No. Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
I haven't enlisted. Some crazy fellow in the Publicity department sent this down.
I'm... I'm not going to wear it,
I just tried it on.
So you went and done it, huh?
- No, Walter...
- You told me if you enlisted, I could join up.
It isn't real. It's just a uniform for benefit.
It doesn't mean a thing.
- He's not even going to wear it.
- Of course not.
Come on, Walter. We'll send this back.
I'll dig out something else to wear.
Looks like a regular soldier, don't he?
Here's the afternoon paper.
- I don't dare read the newspapers anymore.
- Neither do I.
- Oh, Maggie, what am I going to do?
- Nothing.
War is a man's business.
Women only do what they're told.
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know
You're next, Mr. Castle. Two thousand people waiting to see you.
They didn't come to see me.
They came to see them.
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there
Ready, Mr. Castle.
Mr. Castle?
Go on, darling.
Jeremiah Jones, a ladies' man was he
Any pretty girl could turn his head
But he got an awful fright
While strolling out one night
When someone winked at him and said:
There you are. Off you go.
Hello, hello
Who's your lady friend?
Who's the little girlie by your side?
I've seen you with a girl or two
Oh, oh, oh
I am surprised at you
Hello, hello
Stop your little games
Don't you think your ways
You ought to mend?
This isn't the girl I saw you with
At Brighton
Who, who, who's your lady?
Who, who, who's your lady?
Who, who, who's your lady friend?
This isn't the girl I saw you with
At Brighton
Who, who, who's your lady friend?
Take another bow, Mr. Castle?
No, Frank, let them take the bows.
Fine bunch of men.
Ladies and gentlemen, we want to thank all of the performers...
...who have willingly given their services to...
- Where's the recruiting officer?
- A man here wants to join up.
He's over there talking with Mr. Castle.
- To thank this splendid representative body of Canadian men.
- Frank, have you seen Mr. Castle?
- He went downstairs.
Oh, my.
Vernon.
Darling, I have enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps.
I had to, Irene.
Maybe if America were in the war, you'd understand how I feel, why I have to go.
I know.
It won't last long.
They say one more push, and it'll all be over.
That's not so bad, is it?
And I'll come back, and we'll settle down...
...and have the house again and everything.
Just as we were.
Yes, darling.
They may kick me out sooner than that.
I'll probably make a very bad soldier.
You'll make a very good soldier.
- Hey, look at your aileron, sir.
- Yeah, I know.
- How'd you get back?
- I had to get back.
- My furlough starts this afternoon.
- I'll say you earned it.
Telegram, Lieutenant Castle.
- Sailor's in Paris.
- What?
We'll be seeing her tonight, do you realize that?
We'll be seeing her. Come on.
- Castle.
- Yes, sir?
- You better see these plate holders.
- What's the matter with them?
- Busted the whole lot of them.
- I'm afraid so.
- That bullet had your name on it.
- It's a lucky thing this case was in the way.
- Well, we can get them tomorrow.
- But I start my leave this afternoon, sir.
I'm afraid it'll have to be postponed.
GHQ wants this sector covered.
- Can I go up right now?
- Without a convoy?
Yes, sir, I can use Morgan's plane.
- Well, go ahead. Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Hey, Flight, stand by that plane.
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't you get going?
- Where?
Paris. Tell Irene
I'll meet her at Louis' at 8:00.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Tell her to save the first dance for me.
Well, don't just sit there, talk.
- There ain't much news where I come from.
- Then make some up.
Well, we lost a couple of planes this morning, but...
- but they lost more.
I guess that ain't very interesting.
Did you tell Walter about your offer to go to California to make moving pictures?
No, is that so?
- Maggie, why doesn't he come?
- Now, now, he's all right.
Back home, I used to think,
"Oh, if I could only be over there with him."
And now I'm here, and...
...he's not.
Ladies and gentlemen, a few years ago,
I introduced for the first time...
...someone who is now most famous.
She has come back to dance for us again tonight.
Mrs. Vernon Castle.
Ladies and gentlemen, l... l...
Oh, Vernon.
It's quarter to 5.
It's almost daylight.
Oh, Vernon, how long do you think it will go on?
I don't know. Nobody seems to know.
Is it terribly dangerous in those planes?
I mean, worse than in the trenches?
Darling, we said we wouldn't talk about it tonight.
I know, but it's almost morning, and you'll be going back...
...and I won't see you for a long time.
I shouldn't worry, it's foolish.
I'm not the only soldier's wife,
I know that.
You will be careful, won't you?
I'll be careful.
And what's more I think
I'm going to be lucky.
- Lucky?
- Yes.
They say there's one bullet with your name on it.
If it misses you, you come out all right.
Well, I think my bullet missed me yesterday.
Darling.
And from now on,
I'm gonna be all right.
It's a good idea to hang on to.
I'll hang on to it.
You think of everything, don't you?
You thought of coming here instead of the Ritz...
...or some place that might not feel quite like home.
What's that?
Oh, Vernon, maybe the war is over.
What's happened?
The Americans have come into the war.
- America.
- Hooray.
- You know what that means.
- The war is practically over.
Yeah.
Get out, this is the picture.
- Now, camera, action.
- We're ready, Mrs. Castle.
All right, Mrs. Castle.
All right, Mr. D'Arcy.
Now, let's make this bigger than the war.
Ready... camera... action!
That's it, Mrs. Castle, closer.
Mrs. Castle, closer...
- Bigger eyes, Mrs. Castle.
- Irene, telephone.
Can't you see we're shooting?
Irene, Vernon's on the telephone.
He's in Canada.
Oh, Vernon. Oh, excuse me.
Cut!
Cut!
Cut.
Hello? Hello!
Darling, I just landed in Canada.
Yeah, but I'm being transferred next week to Fort Worth, Texas.
Fort Worth, Texas?
Well, that's practically here.
I know. I'm to be a flying instructor for the American Army.
Hello, Sailor, how are you?
- Tell her who it is.
- That was Walter.
Can you meet me there next weekend?
- Next weekend? Oh, I can't wait.
- Me too.
Yes, darling.
Now, I want a room where we can have dinner and absolute privacy.
You just leave it to me, captain.
This ain't so much.
- Nice set up, huh. Cozy?
- Yes, this will do.
I know the ladies, they like things nice.
- Say, who do you think is gonna be...?
- Walter.
- My friend here is a bit strait-laced.
- Sure, I know the type. Reformer.
Well, he's in the army now, eh, captain?
Can you close off that garden?
- You'll be as snug as a bug in a rug here.
- I want to reserve the garden too.
But that's for special occasions.
Our orchestra plays there.
- I want the orchestra.
- Oh, atmosphere, huh?
- No, music, you dumb...
- Walter...
...try to be a little more sophisticated, like the gentleman here.
Oh, here he is, in here.
Captain, you are to report back to the field immediately.
Not me, I've got weekend leave.
I'm sorry, captain.
I know you just got here...
...but a brigadier general blew in.
They want all pilots in the air this afternoon.
Thank you, lieutenant.
Well, it looks as if
I have to leave it all to you.
I know what you want. A hot bird, a cold bottle and a warm shoulder, eh, captain?
Look, here's the list of the music
I want the orchestra to play.
Take care of it and explain to the lady
I may be late.
- Sure will. What name will she give?
- It's his wife.
- Your wife?
- Yes, do you mind?
No, I don't mind, but I don't understand it.
All right, Castle.
Only one more hour.
Hey, young fellow, sit in the back.
But the officer just told me that student pilots...
- I know, I like to ride in front.
- Yes, sir.
Why won't Captain Castle ever ride in the back seat?
Nobody can make him since that crash in Canada...
...when the boy in front got killed.
- Gas on, switch off.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Here we are.
Nice, huh? Best suite in the house.
You're across the hall, Miss Sutton.
Did Captain Castle say how long he'd be at the field?
No ma'am, but he arranged for dinner at 7:30 in the private dining room.
- Sounds almost wicked.
- We cater only to a family trade, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon.
- Not at all. My card.
If we can ever be of any service to you, call on me.
- A wife-beater if ever I saw one.
- Maggie, won't you have dinner with us?
- We'd love to have you.
- Liar. You'd better get dressed.
Here comes Castle's squadron now.
Colonel, look out there.
Don't let that fool take off.
Flag him down.
Walter.
Oh, it's wonderful to see you.
- Hello, Sailor.
- Where's Vernon?
Oh, so that's it.
Vernon?
We wait months to see each other, now you play games.
Vernon.
Where is he?
What's happened?
Sailor, Vernon's...
He's hurt.
Well, where is he? I've got to...
No.
He had his choice of hitting another plane or crashing his own.
The student with him wasn't hurt much.
But Vernon was in the front seat.
He was a hero, Sailor.
Oh, Vernon.
They'll remember what he did this afternoon.
They'll remember a lot of things he did.
The way he laughed and the way he danced.
The way he made other people want to dance.
Walter, he was just beginning to live.
He'll go on living. For you, and me.
Maybe even for a lot of people that never knew him.
There's got to be something in him in every boy and girl that get up and dance together.
They were singing that the day I met him out in the water, with Zowie.
- I'd better get down and tell them to stop.
- No.
He wanted them tonight.
That was at the train, the first time he kissed me.
Don't, Sailor.
Don't you want to go to your room now?
Go tell Maggie.
Hey, this thing ain't working right.
It's working all right for me.
(Landlord) Mary! Mary Roberts!
Get busy now. Here he is again.
What's up with you?
Why aren't you helping Lola?
I'm sorry, sir, but the dishes...
Bother the dishes. You've got to help her make her changes.
- Yes, sir.
- Now get going.
Come on, get going, get going. Go on!
We want Lola! We want Lola!
Gentlemen, it's my aim to give you the best entertainment money can buy.
I've brought here at great expense...
Get a piece of fat and slide off!
Who said that?
All right, you'll get Lola.
Hurry, they're getting restless.
- I gotta look good.
- They shot at me!
- Aw, quit whining.
- Hurry!
If we ever get enough money, we'll leave this one-horse tank.
Come on, hurry.
- How do I look?
- Like a million.
# Say, I've been roamin' from Frisco to Maine
# Been huntin' a man that's not too tame
# He's gotta have somethin'
I need a lot
# Baby, dear, that's what you've got
# Will you be my lovey-dovey, my little honey man?
# We could bill and coo
- Baby!
- # The way all lovers do
# Will you be my ducky-wucky, my little sugar pie?
# Never make you blue
# I'd be so sweet to you... #
Say, Finn, you're a lucky skate, having a swell gal like Lola.
I certainly am...
What do you mean?
She's the lucky one, having a swell fellow like me.
- # Will you be my lovey-dovey
- That's me.
# My little honey man?
# I'm a little bit lonesome... #
Have you seen my husband?
Yeah, over there.
# Won't you be my ownsome
- # My little turtle dove... #
- Will I?!
Waiter, I want a big bottle of wine, right here!
Come on, this here's no good.
Sweetheart!
Oh!
Hi, Charley. Hiya, boys.
Oh!
Watch where you're going!
Hey, Ollie, look.
We're only two miles from town.
Well, I'll never make it.
I've got one foot in the grave now.
Hey, stop him.
Maybe we can get a ride.
I'll get my clothes on.
Hurry up.
Whoa! Whoa!
All right, mister. We're in.
Come on, Dinah. Come on.
Are you going to Brushwood Gulch?
Uh-huh.
We are, too.
A lot of weather we've been having lately.
Pretty.
It's only four months to Christmas.
Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Do you mind if I put my hand right here?
I saw her first. Come.
That's it.
Darling!
Not you! I meant my husband.
Have a nice trip, darling?
Lovely... until these two came aboard.
They've done nothing but annoy me all the way in.
Here, you run along home.
Goodbye.
Fiddlin', huh?
We don't like your kind around these parts.
And there's one thing we don't allow, and that's messin' with our women.
If you want to stay healthy, get the next coach out of town.
Yes, sir. We'll be glad to.
Just as soon as we've finished our business.
If you miss the next coach... you'll be riding out of here in a hearse.
- Good day, strangers.
- Good day, sir.
Goodbye.
Let well enough alone.

Howdy, gents. What'll it be?
Do you know the whereabouts of a lady named Mary Roberts?
(Bartender) Sure.
She's around here someplace.
I'm Miss Roberts' guardian.
What do you want to see her for?
We have some news for her.
What's it about?
I'm sorry, sir, but we're not supposed to discuss that.
It's private. Her father died and left her a goldmine.
We're not supposed to tell anyone but her.
Didn't we, Ollie?
- A goldmine?
- It's the biggest...
Now that he's taken you into our confidence, you might as well know the rest.
(Whispers ) We've got the deed to the property.
We have to give it to her in person.
What?
I said we've got the deed to the property and... Oh!
Say, you better show it to him.
Maybe he doesn't believe us.
It's the truth.
Say, did I give you the deed?
Oh, I know where it is.
Excuse me.
See? Mary Roberts.
Come here. Have you ever seen
Mary Roberts?
Good. I'll go and find her.
Don't tell a soul till I return.
- We won't.
- Thank you.
Good thing we found her.
Lola!
Lola, we've got a fortune right in the palm of our hand.
What?
There's men downstairs looking for Mary Roberts.
So?
They have a deed to a goldmine left to her by her father.
They're here to deliver it.
Well, ain't that just grand?
It would be if you were Mary Roberts.
Yeah, but I'd never get away with it.
Sure you would!
They've never seen her.
Then it's a cinch.
Put that shoe on properly.
- What's wrong?
- I can't eat that.
It's as tough as shoe leather.
- Think you can do it?
- Can I do it(?)
For a goldmine,
I'd be Cleopatra.
- That's the girl.
- Bring 'em up.
(Landlord) Hey!
- Come and meet Mary Roberts.
- Right away.
Did you call, Mr Finn?
Get back to the kitchen where you belong. Don't bother me.
This way, gentlemen.
Come right this way.
This way, gentlemen.
Sit down and I'll get Lola...
I mean Mary for you.
I've told her the news and she's terribly shocked.
- Lola, they're here.
- Swell, kiddo.
Put these in your arms.
Mary, these are the gentlemen
I was telling you about.
Tell me... Tell me about my dear, dear daddy.
Is it true that he's dead?
Well, we hope he is.
They buried him.
It can't be. What did he die of?
I think he died of a Tuesday.
Or was it Wednesday? Do you...?
I'll handle this delicate situation.
Little lady, you've heard the worst.
Now prepare yourself for the best.
Now, cheer up.
Smile. That's right.
Remember, every cloud has a silver lining.
That's right.
Any bird can build a nest, but not everyone can lay an egg, eh, Ollie?
That's right.
Do you know you own one of the richest goldmines in the world?
Your father left you the whole property.
And he gave me the honour of presenting you with the deed.
- Isn't it wonderful, Uncle?
- Yes, my dear.
Who's there?
- Mary.
- Mary who?
Mary... Merry Christmas.
Excuse me, Mr Finn.
One gentleman dropped this on the stairs.
Ooh, thank you, little lady.
You don't know what you've done.
All right. All right. All right.
There you are.
Signed, sealed and now... delivered.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.
Come, Stanley. We'd better go.
Oh, say. What about the locket?
- That's right...
- We've something else.
I almost forgot.
And besides that... your father left you this family heirloom.
Oh, yes. I remember it well.
Help me get it off, Stanley.
Am I hurting you?
No. Just a minute.
Won't be long.
Maybe I'd better try opening it again.
I think so.
(Whispers ) Slipped.
Maybe you'd better take your coat off.
Pardon me just a minute.
We'll find it in just a moment.
We got it.
I'll go in and change.
Pardon us.
- Say, Ollie?
- What?
Now that you're undressed, why not take a bath?
Would you mind leaving the room?
Can't I have a little privacy?
Just trying to kill two birds with one stone.
I'll take care of those bozos.
Don't worry, leave it to me.
I've done pretty good so far.
You certainly have.
I wish you were in my shoes.
- (Coughs ) How about a drink?
- That suits me fine.
- How did you dress so quick?
- None of your business.
Goodbye, and thanks for the use of your boudoir.
- You're very welcome.
- Goodbye.
Now you have the mine, you'll be a swell gold-digger.
Goodbye.
Why did you leave them?
You have her sign the deeds over to us.
You get those guys out of town now!
All right.
What a cinch.
Give the gentlemen the best in the house.
Yes, sir.
I'll be back in a minute.
# On a mountain in Virginia
# Stands a lonesome pine
# Just below is the cabin home
# Of a little girl of mine
# Her name is June and very, very soon
# She'll belong to me
# For I know she's waiting there for me
# 'Neath that lone pine tree
(In harmony ) # In the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pine
# In the pale moonshine, our hearts entwine
# Where she carved her name and I carved mine
# Oh, June, like the mountains I'm blue
# Like the pine
I'm lonesome for you-oh-oh-oh
# In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pine
(Bass voice ) # In the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pine
# In the pale moonshine, our hearts entwine
# Where she carved her name and I carved mine
# Oh, June, like the mountains I'm blue
# Like the pine
I am lonesome for you
(Sings soprano ) # In the Blue
Ridge Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pi-ine #
That's fine.
Miss Lola, what is this for?
Er... Now whatever we do on your behalf is legal.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it. Now run right along with your work.
Well, here's looking at you.
Shoo!
- Well, I've got to be going.
- So have we.
- Goodbye, Mr Finn.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.
Have a good time.
- Goodbye, Miss, er...? Miss...?
- Roberts. Mary Roberts.
- Goodbye, Miss Roberts.
- Goodbye.
Did you hear what her name was?
Sure - Mary Roberts.
How can she be if we've just given the deed to Mary Roberts?
I don't know.
- I smell a rat.
- I smell something, too.
Come on.
Pardon me.
Did you ever have a father called Sy Roberts?
Why, yes. He left me with these people when he went prospecting.
Who's that woman upstairs?
Lola Marcel. Mr Finn's wife.
She's my legal guardian now.
Can I speak to you?
- Pardon us.
- We'll be right back.
You know what?
I think we've given that deed to the wrong woman.
Our first mistake since that guy sold us the Brooklyn Bridge.
That was no mistake. It'll be worth a lot of money some day.
Maybe you're right.
Let's get the deed.
Say, maybe they won't give it back to us?
What do you mean?
We'll get that deed or I'll eat your hat.
That's what
I call determination.
Come on.
Splendid! Splendid!
She fell for it like you fell for me.
Lola, my girl, we're sittin' pretty.
- Who's there?
- Me.
- Me who?
- Me who(!)
What do you want?
Out of my way, you snake in the grass!
You toad in the hole.
Say, what do ya mean bustin' in here like this?
We want to know why you're not Mary Roberts.
I'll take care of this.
So, you got wise?
If it's this deed you're after, you're out of luck.
Take it, Stan. Beat it!
That's it. There you are!
Ow! Ow! AAAH!
AAAH!
That's it!
Get it, Stan! Get it!
Go on, get it! Go on, Stan!
Go on and get it, Stan!
Give me that deed.
Get away! Get away!
Why don't you...?
Give me that!
Go on, get it.
Get away from that door!
Get away from it!
Now, you stop.
Stop!
Back! Steady. Get back.
(Squeals) Ollie, come and get...
Don't you touch that!
Stop! Ooh, you're tickling!
Not yet! Not yet!
Stay where you are. Don't move!
Ah-ha!
Ho-ho!
Hee-hee!
Here, Stan, take it!
I can't stand it!
Now, get 'em outta here.
(Finn ) Get out!
Now! Get out!
- Who's there?
- The Sheriff.
Just in the nick of time.
Now we'll get justice.
Sheriff, you're just the man
I'm looking for.
And you're just the man
I'M looking for.
Thank you. This man... Oh.
I thought I told you two dudes to catch the next coach.
Yes, sir.
It left ten minutes ago.
It did? Maybe we'd better try and catch it.
I'll say you better!
- Look at them go!
- You can't see them for dust.
- Say, Ollie?
- What?
Are we taking a chance going back and robbing that safe?
Chance or no chance, we're getting that deed back.
As soon as my clothes are dry, that's exactly what we'll do.
That's a good idea.
If that girl ever found out...
Give me a light.
Those matches are soaking wet.
Thank you.
See if my clothes are dry.
Your hat's dry.
That reminds me, you made a statement this afternoon.
Did I?
You said if we didn't get the deed, you'd eat my hat.
Now you're taking me illiterally.
Nevertheless, I'm going to teach you not to make rash promises.
Eat the hat.
That's silly. Who ever heard of anybody eating a hat?
Who ever heard of anybody doing that?
- Eat the hat.
- I won't do it.
If you don't,
I'll tie you to a tree and let the buzzards get you.
- Would you really?
- I certainly would.
(Squeaks ) I never ate a hat.
Eat it.
Get my clothes.
Ow!
Shh!
(Whispers ) Wait a minute.
I'll help you.
What did you push me in there like that for?
You're the dumbest thing
I ever saw.
(Whispers ) Hey, hey,
I've got an idea.
Why don't we climb on the shed, get on the balcony and go in there to save us going in the front?
Now, that deserves consideration.
Hey! Psst! Psst!
Hey, Ollie! Psst!
Are you all right? Psst!
Wait. I'll get a ladder for you.
Won't be a minute. Shh!
I'm going to get a ladder for him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
We'll follow our original plan and go through the front.
Now, go ahead.
Do you mind if I have another idea?
If it's anything like the last one, yes. What is it?
How about me pulling you up on the block and tackle?
What are you doing out here?
There's something wrong...
Yes, it's you. Come back to bed.
Scaring me to death...
Here, hold that.
Now, are you all ready?
Upsadaisy.
Now, don't get fancy.
Just get me up there.
Wait till I spit on my hands.
All right... No!
Upsadaisy.
I'll spit on 'em again to make sure.
Uh!
Hand me the end of that rope.
Now hold out your hand.
Hold out your hand.
This one.
Now tie that on the mule.
Tie that on the mule.
Get on the mule.
Get on the mule.
Hey!
- Where are the tools?
- In the saddlebag.
Hand them to me.
OK.
I'll be right over.
Aaaaah!
What are you trying to do?
Get the mule down.
Not now.
We'll attend to that later.
- Maybe we can get in here.
- Good idea.
- Shh!
- Shh!
- Wait there. We'll be right up.
- Shh!
What's the matter?
- Stop laughing in your sleep.
- I'm not.
I'd know your laugh anywhere.
Go to sleep!
Keeping me awake all night like this...
Psst!
Shh!
(Ollie ) Ow!
What are you doing here?
As soon as I get out of here,
I'll explain.
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing?
Hide me! Hide me!
(Finn ) What's that noise down there?
(Finn ) Answer me!
Mary!
No! You must hide.
(Finn ) Mary, what's going on down there? What's that noise?
Why are you roaming around this late?
- Mr Finn, I...
- You...
Get back to bed and not another peep out of you.
The idea.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Shh!
Please, what are you doing here?
Come in and I'll tell you all about it.
- Ollie.
- What?
Wait there.
I'll be right back. Shh!
You put on your clothes and we'll see you later. Shh!
Ooh!
- Where have you been?
- I told Mary what happened.
When you get the deed, she'll leave with us.
Good. Where is she now?
She's getting dressed.
She'll meet us outside.
Fine. Now get me out of this.
OK.
Take it easy, now.
You can't...
You can't do it that way.
Take it easy. Shh!
Maybe I can pull you all the way through.
Let go, you're choking...
Oh, me apple!
Are you all right?
Oh!
What did you go and do that for?
Well, I didn't know...
Shh!
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing down there?
What's going on?
(Finn ) Mary! Mary!
(Finn ) Mary!
(Finn ) Mary!
Will you move over?
Aaah! Oh!
Give me that gun!
Put up your hands! Not you!
- What are you doing?
- Getting those deeds back.
- You can't do that!
- Go on! Go on!
Get in that room. Go on!
Open the safe and get the deed.
Hurry up.
Get back in that room. Go on.
Now give us that deed.
Come on, take it, Stan.
Get in there and get to bed.
- I-I-I...
- Go on! Shut up!
You can't get away...
- Get in bed.
- I'll fix you.
Tie him up.
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.
- Stop that. You can't do that!
- Shut up. Shut up.
You can't.
I'll get you for this.
Go and get Dinah.
I'll take care of him.
Let me out of this.
Let me go. You can't do that.
Stop that. Let me down.
Let me outta here.
What are you going to do?
I'll get you for this. Let me go! Let me go! Help! Lola!
Lola! Lola! Lola! Lola!
Help me, Lola!
Oh!
Hey, come back here! Come back!
Come back! Come back!
Let me out!
Stop! Come back here!
Now our troubles are over, where do we go from here?
I'd like to return to my hometown.
- Where's that?
- Way down south.
- You're from the South?
- Sure am.
Well, fan my brow!
I'm from the South.
You are?
Well, shut my mouth!
I is from the South, too.
South of what, sir?
The south of London.
London! Well, honey, we'll all go down to Dixie.
Oh, for a slice of possum and yam. Ooh!
Yes, sir, and some good ol' fish and chips.
Fish and chips(!)
# We're going to go, we're going to go
# We're going to go way down in Dixie

As magistrate of this village, it is my duty to warn you that Hi Chung, the bandit, is on his way here.
Thank you for telling us.
- Shall I pack?
- No.
- But, Alfred...
- We are missionaries.
Providence sent us here to fight evil, not flee from it.
Will you allow me to take little Ching-Ching out of harm's way?
Barbara will remain here with us.
And I wish you would not refer to her as Ching-Ching.
Mr Kruikshank, you may do as you wish with your own life.
But Ching... Barbara is a child.
- Her honourable parents were my friends.
- I know.
But they did not desert their post when danger threatened.
No.
And they were killed.
Please. Alfred!
I have decided.

- Greetings, most honourable Sun Lo.
- Greetings, Ching-Ching.
May your shadow lengthen always in the sun of happiness.
Thank you.
May the bird of prosperity continue to nest in your rooftop.
(they speak Chinese)
I hope you will always remember the sayings of our wise men.
I will, because you taught them to me.
It was a great privilege to instruct the daughter of my friends, your honourable father and mother.
Friendship is a tree of shelter from the rains of trouble.
Yes.
And so it is my wish to protect you from trouble that may be here very soon.
- What kind of trouble?
- Bad men.
- There will be looting and destruction.
- Oh...
I have arranged for Chang to take you to the home of my honourable brother in Shanghai.
Shanghai? Oh, that's wonderful.
I remember all the beautiful stories my daddy used to tell me about it.
But I'm afraid I'll have to ask
Mr Kruikshank for his permission.
You know, he's awfully strict with me.
Don't worry about that, my little one.
I will satisfactorily explain for you.
You will?
Oh, thank you, most honourable Sun Lo.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Goodbye, my little friend.
I shall see you very soon.
And until then, the memory of you will bloom like a flower in the garden of my heart.

Chang!
I guess he went for breakfast.
And that's what you want, isn't it?
Hey! Hey!

As Sun Lo says, one cannot eat gold, but one cannot eat without it.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Come on, Mr Wu, we'll find something to eat.
Oh, no, no. Is there anyone here who speaks English? I want to buy something.
(speaks Chinese)
Look, I want to buy a dragon's head.
Head. Though I can't imagine why.
(merchant speaks Chinese)
No, me likee buy one piecee dragon head.
Catch on?
(speaks Chinese)
Lookee.
Dragon. Head. See?
Isn't there anyone who understands English?
I can, mister.
Hello. You wouldn't by any chance be able to understand Chinese too, would you?
(speaks Chinese)
Oh...
- Can you ask him how much he wants for it?
- (speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- He says $15.
No, no.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- What's wrong now?
- He's trying to cheat you.
The price is $5. Look.
Oh, yes, so it is.
- (speaks Chinese)
(mimics Chinese)
Huh?
As Sun Lo says, all things have two prices, one for the foolish.
You know, you look so young but you talk so old. How come?
In a junk from Sanchow.
No, I meant how come... Oh, well.
I guess we don't talk the same language in more ways than one.
You've been so nice, I'll buy you something.
What shall it be?
Come on, what would you like?
A soup bone.
- A what?
- A soup bone.
For my dog. He's awful hungry.
You'll never get ahead in life if you go around asking for bones.
Do you think your mother would mind if you joined us in a soup bone?
- I haven't gotten a mother.
- Oh.
- Well, your father, or family?
- I haven't any family.
- I haven't even got Chang.
- Who's Chang?
He brought me from Sanchow, and then he ran away with my money.
Oh, a lady in distress?
Just my specialty. Well, you come along with us to lunch then you can tell me all about it.
- Thank you, but I couldn't eat any lunch.
- Why not?
Cos I haven't had breakfast yet.
(honks horn)
Menu, please.
There's the menu up there.
No, it's all Greek to me.
No, it's Chinese.
Well, go ahead and order for Mr Wu and your Uncle Tommy.
All right.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Those things cost a lot.
Have you got enough money?
- Too much, so I'm told.
- (speaks Chinese)
I told him to make it two soup bones.
- Do you live here, Uncle Tommy?
- No, just here today. My boat sails tonight.
- Going home?
- No, just travelling around.
- No place in particular.
- You must be an orphan too.
Unfortunately not.
You mean you don't like your father and mother?
Well, it seems we get along better with a couple of thousand miles between us.
So, there they are and here I am, and everybody's happy.
More or less.
There you are, Mr Wu.
You certainly are extravagant, Ching-Ching.
Thank you.
What's "stravagant" mean, Uncle Tommy?
- That means you're pretty nice.
- Then I think you're stravagant too.
I promised to pick up some friends here but first I'll get you straightened out.
- Will you wait?
- Sun Lo says patience is like wealth.
Many talk about it, but few possess it.
- Sun Lo is quite a conversationalist.
- I don't know, but he talks a lot.
Aw!
(honks horn)
Ah, hail to the chief!
- Hello, Tommy.
- Kay.
- Tommy, darling.
- Dora.
- Colonel, have you been drinking?
- A mere aperitif, a soupçon of brandy.
- Yes, master?
- Bring us flagons of your rarest nectar.
And bring it with the speed of an antelope.
We perish, we swoon.
Yes, master. Black Label all round?
- Right.
- Not for me.
Do these old ears hear right?
Could it be Thomas, the pride of the Randalls, has refused a drink?
- Right.
- My boy, are you ill?
Uh-uh. In fact, Colonel,
I am still under the spell of a good woman.
(barks)
Mr Wu! Mr Wu!
You come back here this very minute.
Mr Wu!
Mr Wu! Mr Wu!
Now, where did you find this good woman?
I didn't know there were any more left.
Come on outside. I'll introduce you, but remember, I saw her first.
- What about us? Can't we go too?
- Sure, come on. It'll do you good.
Now, none of your Rabelaisian lip.
This girl has led a very sheltered life.
As if I ever said anything that would raise a faint blush on the cheek of...
Looks like she stood you up.
Nice goings-on, I must say.
Here she is. Hey.
Why don't you go all the way in?
Maybe she's down the cellar.
- That's funny.
- At least she left you the car.
- Sometimes they don't even do that.
- She must be someplace.
- Come on, let's go on in.
- When you find her, yell. We'll be at the bar.
Now, let her go, lad. Better fish in the sea.
You know, this reminds me of an experience I had in Kansas City.
I met this little lady.
Very fine and very demure.
Mr Wu, you oughta be ashamed.
(thunder)
(Tommy hums a tune)
- Just like a lullaby, eh, Colonel?
- Hmm.
A Chinese lullaby.
- Oh, there you are, Mr Randall, sir.
- Little Lord Fauntleroy.
- Go away. I don't want to talk to you.
- Your car. We must get it aboard.
- The captain's holding up the boat, sir.
- All on account of you, Atkins.
You're a heedless, thoughtless butterfly.
No consideration for others. No...
I thought so.
Colonel, this man's been drinking.
Please, sir, we must hurry, sir. Now, please.
See here.
- Steady, Atkins, steady.
- Now, Tommy, we mustn't be too harsh.
I used to have an uncle that drank.
It's a madness in the blood.
Please, sir, I can walk for myself, sir.
You'll be all right, but you mustn't shout like that.
We'll get you back on the boat safe and sound.
It's quite all right.
I can really get there myself.
- It's quite all right.
- Get in there.
- Get in, Tommy, and hold him there.
- No, sir, I'm not drunk, I assure you.
- Are you sober enough to drive?
- Look out.
(ship's whistle)
(Mr Wu yaps)
- I could've sworn I heard something.
- I bet it's a stowaway.
Who's there?
If there's anybody down here, let's find them.
(rattling)
You search behind the sacks. You too.
You check behind the cars.
Steward! Steward!
We found a stowaway in the hold, but he got away.
Very well.
Jenkins, spread a general alarm.
We seem to have stowaways aboard.
At once, sir.
(bell)
Come in.
- Right there, steward.
- Yes, missy.
You were told to watch for stowaways before we sailed.
- I did, sir.
- Well, if we find one, you'll be out of a job.
You can come back for these things in half an hour, steward.
And, mind you, he was only 12.
Richard spoke up as quick as a flash, and what do you think he said, Susan?
"You may use my bicycle, Geraldine."
"I love sport, but I love the principles of manhood more."
- I'm afraid I'm boring you.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Hope.
- Richard told me that story three times.
- I tell it not because Richard is my son.
I tell it merely because I believe that you, as his future wife, might be interested.
Apparently, I was mistaken.
Mark my words, Susan, the time will come when you'll be just as devoted to Richard...
But I am devoted to him. Only...
Only you have a peculiar way of demonstrating your devotion.
Who is in there?
(Mr Wu growls)
(screams)
Help! Help!
- Help!
- What happened?
- There's a man in there.
- What's up?
- The stowaway.
- He growled at me.
- (door rattles)
- Come out.
Come out of there or I'll blow you out.
Well, I'll be...
- Aw, the poor little thing. We frightened her.
- She's frightened us.
- What's your name?
- In Chinese or American?
What?
In American it's Barbara Stewart.
But in Chinese it's Ching-Ching.
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.
Hiding? Why?
The man said I was a stowaway.
- Well, are you?
- I... I guess so. What's a stowaway?
- How did you ever get on this ship, anyway?
- I don't know.
I never heard of such a thing in all my life.
I can't understand it.
- Neither can I.
- Oh, please don't be impertinent.
- She didn't mean to be. Did you, dear?
- No, I didn't.
- What's all this?
- We found the stowaway.
- Where is he?
- It's a she, sir.
It's this child here.
What, you?
I guess so.
She doesn't even know how she got aboard.
- What am I gonna do with you, young lady?
- I'll look after her.
- Susan, don't be absurd.
- She won't be any trouble.
Fine, Miss Parker. Bring her to my quarters after lunch and we'll have a talk with her.
- You can return to your post now, Jenkins.
- Aye, sir.
See you later, stowaway.
(Mr Wu barks)
Captain, can we put this... animal in the kennel?
Oh!
They'll take good care of it.
You'll give it a big dinner.
Why, of course I will. Here.
Don't you worry, I'll take care of it.
It isn't an it, sir. It's a him.
I've never had a dress as nice as this.
The ship's store is full of them.
All you have to do is get this one dirty and we'll find you another one.
Do you think your mother will like me better now I look beautiful?
- Mrs Hope isn't my mother.
- No?
Well, that is, not yet.
- See?
- Yes, I see.
It's time we turned the child over to the captain.
After all, charity has its limits.
What did you mean when you said you didn't know how you got on this ship? You must.
But I don't, honestly.
The last thing I remember is that I fell asleep in Uncle Tommy's car.
Uncle Tommy? Tommy who?
Randall. Tommy Randall.
- (both) Tommy Randall!
- Mm-hm.
- Your Uncle Tommy is on board this ship.
- He is?
I might've known you were his niece.
- He's a problem child too.
- I'll take you to him, Ching-Ching.
Considering his reputation, you'd better turn her over to the captain.
Very well.
Well, it seems odd, but with Mr Randall, nothing surprises me.
- Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning, Atkins.
- We'd like to see Mr Randall.
- Mr Randall's still asleep, sir.
- Well, it's about time he got up.
- Mr Randall never gets up until two, sir.
(laughs) I'm sorry, but this is important, so you'd better call him.
- Mr Randall will be very annoyed, sir.
- Tell him a pretty lady wants to see him.
- If I know Tommy Randall, that'll get him up.
- Yes, I'm afraid it will, sir.
Won't you be seated, please?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- (snoring)
- I beg your pardon, sir!
- Go away, Fauntleroy.
Sorry, but there's a young lady to see you.
- Huh?
- There's a young lady to see you.
I think it's rather urgent.
- That's bad.
- She's very beautiful, sir.
Oh?
- Well, that's not so bad.
- She has a child with her, sir.
Oh, that is bad.
She also has the captain with her.
He insists on seeing you.
That's very bad.
Here you are, sir.
- What's that?
- Your chequebook, sir.
Oh...
I don't know what your game is, but I never saw you before.
I have witnesses to my whereabouts for the past 27 years.
- Mr Randall!
- Uncle Tommy!
Ching-Ching. What on earth...? Please forgive me, I'm awfully sorry. I'm not quite awake yet.
What are you doing on this boat?
I'm a stowaway, but I didn't mean to be.
- I waited in your automobile like you said.
- But I went out and looked for you.
Well, you see, after a while, it started to rain.
So I got in the back and pulled the cover down.
Oh, you poor kid.
- I'm awfully sorry.
- But I like being a stowaway, Uncle Tommy.
This is Susan Parker, my best friend.
He's my best friend too.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Don't you think she's stravagant?
- She's magnificent.
Oh, thank you.
- Charming little niece you have, Mr Randall.
- I'm not really his niece, Susan.
- He's just pretending.
- Why...?
- But aren't you the child's uncle?
- No.
We met in Shanghai yesterday.
- Oh, Ching-Ching, you told me...
- I didn't mean to tell a fib.
I was just scared, and I knew
Uncle Tommy would help me.
You know I will. I'm sorry, Captain, to have caused all this trouble.
I'll accept full responsibility.
I'll be only too glad to pay for her passage.
I'll have to communicate with her people.
From what she tells me, she has no people.
In fact, she has all the earmarks of a waif.
But she must have someone.
She didn't live in China by herself.
I lived with the Kruikshanks, but they won't care if I stay here.
- Who are the Kruikshanks, dear?
- They're missionaries in Sanchow.
Make a note of that name and get in touch through the American consul.
In the meantime, I'll look after her.
This time, I really mean it.
I'm inclined to think that Miss Parker is better company for the child.
Oh, he's good company too.
Maybe you had better go with Miss Parker.
You can call her Susan like I do.
Can't he, Susan?
Well, I suppose so.
I'll see you later, then, Ching-Ching.
- And I hope you too... Susan.
- Thank you.
- Bye, Uncle Tommy.
- Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
Uncle Tom's cabin.
(ship's whistle)
- I can't understand it, Atkins.
- Understand what, sir?
Your gross neglect of your duties.
The most beautiful girl in the world is on this ship and you never told me.
Begging your pardon, sir, but you don't usually have to be told.
- Who is she?
- You met her mother on Monday night.
- I did?
- Unhappily, sir.
I...
- I didn't...?
- You did, sir.
Let me have it, Atkins.
You emptied a bottle of champagne in her lap, sir.
Oh!
(meows)
(mimics a train whistle)
Ding, ding!
(mimics train whistle)
Ding, ding!
Now, now, come, come, Atkins.
You can do better than that.
- You're not even trying.
- I thought it was rather good, sir.
Perhaps you can suggest something else that I can imitate better.
Well, let me see...
- Sleepy?
- Mm-hm.
It's not ten yet. You'll never be popular if you fold up right after dinner.
Begging your pardon, sir, but I think it's customary for little children to retire rather early.
- Is it really your bedtime, Ching-Ching?
- Mm-hm.
- Atkins, prepare Miss Ching-Ching for bed.
- Me, sir?
- I don't know anything about children.
- I've never...
- There's a first time for everything.
- Sir, this is very awkward.
Please, Uncle Tommy, I can undress myself.
I always do.
- I wish I could say the same.
- Oh, thank you, Miss.
Now, you close your eyes. Come on.
Atkins, a lullaby for Miss Ching-Ching.
- A what, sir?
- A lullaby.
- You know, a vocal Mickey Finn.
- Sir, I can't sing a lullaby.
You're one of the most untalented persons
I've ever met.
Can't do imitations or sing.
How do you ever entertain your friends?
- I can try, sir.
- Very well, start crooning.

- Should I...?
- I didn't make any noise.
- Is she asleep?
- (Ching-Ching) Not yet.
Well, you should be.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Aunt Susan.
- Good night, Uncle Tommy.
- Good night, darling.
Good night, Atkins.
You've been very sweet to that child,
Mr Randall. Good night.
Good night? Don't tell me you go to bed at ten o'clock too?
- Let me see you to your room.
- It's only four doors away.
Still, let me come with you.
You might meet somebody.
Footpads, thugs, people like that.
It's not safe for a girl to be out alone after dark on the ocean.
(jazz band plays) it's beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
And so peaceful.
- Peaceful too.
- It's really almost overdone, isn't it?
The moonlight on the water.
Stars in the sky. Music.
They might've at least had the decency to omit the music.
Yes, everything is here. Including you.
And me. Taken all together, that spells romance.
- Not for me.
- Why not?
- Romance takes two.
- We've got two here.
Yes, but not the right two.
You see, I'm engaged.
Oh...
To Richard Hope. Mrs Hope's son, you know.
- Yes, I know.
- He's meeting the boat at Bangkok.
- We're to be married there.
- Mm-hm? And why Bangkok?
He lives there. He's with an exporting firm.
- Exporting what?
- Oh, ivory, apes, peacocks.
Things like that. He came out here two years ago and he's worked very hard.
You mean to say you've been engaged for two years and you haven't seen him in that time?
You Latins.
What a hot-blooded race you are!
Well, Richard isn't quite like that. We've known each other since we were children.
Oh, I see.
Well, I must say, it all sounds very lyrical.
- Well, it may not be exactly lyrical.
- Me, of course, I've never been engaged.
Not definitely, that is.
- But if I were to be...
- Not definitely is right.
I seem to recall something in the newspapers:
"Millionaire playboy sued for breach of promise."
I practically won that suit.
She only got $10,000.
Poor kid, she'd been counting on 50.
That's more than Richard earns in a year.
Well, you shouldn't be so narrow. After all,
I can't help it if I've been cursed with wealth.
Not that it isn't as nice a curse as anyone could ask for.
- Have you ever worked for a living?
- Pardon?
You know, work. Like most people do.
Oh, work. Of course. I've worked my father...
Why should I take a job from someone else who needs it?
I sacrifice myself for the good of humanity. See?
Do you know what you are?
No, but I have a feeling that you're about to tell me.
A museum piece. You should be in a glass case in an exhibit of the terrible Twenties, cocktail shaker in your hand, shirt scrawled with chorus girls' telephone numbers, and a label - "Playboy BC, Before The Crash, former habitat, Broadway, now extinct."
Hmm...
You don't exactly pull your punches, do you?
Would it please you to know that I feel about that high and six years old?
You should grow up.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Oh, but forget it. At least forget it for now.
I'm really not a reformer always.
Anyway, beneath that too-smooth exterior beats a heart of gold... I think.
- It's beating awfully fast right now.
- Good night.
(band plays "Goodnight, My Love")
Sing it. There's no one here but you and me.
And the China Sea.
But it's a love song.
Just doesn't fit the occasion.
That's all right. It's only a popular song.
You didn't write the words.
- I'm warning you, if you don't sing it, I will.
- You win.

- Good night.
- Good night.
- And... good night to you too.
- Good night!
- See that this is sent at once.
- Yes, ma'am.
- How long do we have here, Purser?
- 12 hours, ma'am.
- This would be nice for the little girl.
- Do you like that?
- I think it's beautiful.
- All right, we'll take that too.
When I get big, I'm gonna marry a man like you. Aren't you, Aunt Susan?
When you grow up, there aren't gonna be any men like him.
He's a dying race, the last of the easy spenders.
Nice jade bracelet for the lady?
- No, thank you.
- What a perfect piece of jade.
- It is lovely.
- It's all yours. Wrap it up.
- Send to the steamer with the rest.
- Tommy, I couldn't accept it.
It's all right, Susan. Mr and Mrs Kruikshank are good people, and they take anything.
Shoes, potatoes, rice.
See, if Ching-Ching says it's all right.
- Not even for Ching-Ching.
- All right, but you're being very silly.
- You know where we're going now?
- Back to the boat.
- She guessed wrong again, didn't she?
- You said it.
- We're going to a show.
- What kind of a show?
Beautiful, magnificent.
- (knocking)
- Come in.
- Mother!
- Richard!
Why did you cable me?
Where's Susan? She's not ill, is she?
- Go up on deck and call Miss Parker.
- Yes, missy.
No, Richard, she's not ill.
Why did you send for me?
After all, it's not exactly an inexpensive trip.
I know, I know, dear, but frankly the situation was more than I could cope with alone.
What do you mean?
Heavens, Mother, don't build it up.
Did you ever hear of a man named Tommy Randall?
Randall? The name's familiar.
- It should be. It's in the papers enough.
- What about him?
- He's on this boat.
- What's that got to do with Susan?
Richard, your mother's a woman of the world. You realise that. She can tell...
She can tell what?
Heavens, Mother, we're not getting anyplace.
I'm not saying there's been anything wrong between them.
So that's it?
I've flown here just to be told Susan is having a harmless little ship flirtation?
It may be harmless, and it may not.
After all, Richard,
Susan's a very headstrong young woman.
Well, marriage will straighten her out.
Wait till she hears
I'm the new assistant manager in Bangkok.
JB - JB Bradley, I mean - gave me the promotion as a wedding present.
Just think. My boy, an assistant manager.
Why, Richard, it seems only yesterday that you were in curls.
- It shows what hard work, determination...
- (knocking)
Come in.
Too sorry. Missy has go shoreside.
- Ashore?
- Yes, missy.
Thank you.
You see? She's with Randall now.
I knew I was right in cabling you.
A mother's instinct never fails.
- What do you think I should do?
- The first thing to do is to find her.
Oh, look at the Chinese Major Bowes.
That fellow, Li Ze Mon, used to run a chop suey place on Broadway.

He wants the people in the audience to get up and give imitations.
He says there's a prize of ten yuan.
Where are you going?
If I get the ten yuan, then I can buy some presents for you and Uncle Tommy.
- Ching-Ching, no.
- Nothing can happen to her.
Oh, hello. What can I do for you?
- You can give me the ten yuan.
- (laughter)
You likee sing song?
- I will if you don't start ringing that bell.

Hello, Uncle Tommy! Hello, Aunt Susan!
- I think you'd better put her down.
- There might be more water farther on.
- Richard! This is a surprise.
- Yes, it's a surprise for me too.
Uh... Tommy, Mr Randall, this is Mr Hope.
- And Miss Ching-Ching Stewart.
- Pleased to meet you.
- I never thought I'd see you here.
- Evidently not.
- Weren't you surprised to see him?
- Hardly. I sent for him.
That's marvellous. I love surprises, and usually I never get them.
- Susan, I think your friends will excuse you.
- I'm sorry, I must be going now.
- You be awfully careful of her.
- She'll be perfectly all right.
- I'm sorry if I...
- That's all right.
- Goodbye, Ching-Ching.
- Goodbye.
- You like her, don't you?
- You could call it that.
I don't see how anybody can have fun with that Mr Hope.
I'm afraid fun isn't everything, Ching-Ching.
Come on, we're gonna have a good time.
(speaks Chinese)
- Me likee see one nice piecee tapestry.
- This way, please.
- Something like this, sir?
- No.
Let me see that one.
(yapping)
Not bad.
You precious little puppy, you.
You're just like Waify.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, Ching-Ching.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- He went that way.
- Thank you.
(speaks Chinese)
Well, Ching-Ching, where do we go from here?
Hey, where'd you come from?
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!
(speaks Chinese)
No, wait, this is all a mistake.
Listen, be reasonable. Ching-Ching!
There you are, darling.
(speaks Chinese)
- (speaks Chinese)
- Wait. Give me a chance to explain.
If wishes were keys, there would be no prisoners.
So Sun Lo says.
Good old Sun Lo, always brightening the corner where he isn't.
It's been fun up till now, but it won't be so funny if we miss that boat.
- I bet the captain will be pretty mad.
- He must be, or he'd be here by now.
We've gotta get out of here.
Well, I guess we'll have to start a rebellion.
Pardon me, would any of you gentlemen be interested in getting out of this jail?
I said...
You speak to them.
Tell them about the great outside world.
- Ask them how they'd like to see it again.
- (speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Well?
They're not interested.
They said they like it here.
That's absurd. Where's their spirit?
Ask them are they men or are they mice?
(they speak Chinese)
Mice.
Well, at last. Sorry to have caused you so much trouble, Captain.
Now, see here, son.
I've been very lenient with you.
But there's a limit. You've overstepped it.
If it weren't for this child, I wouldn't be here.
- Any news about Ching-Ching?
- Sorry, Miss, not a word.
- Oh, I never should've left her with him.
- He should've known better.
It's an outrage taking a child of that age out at night in a city like Hong Kong.
Anything could happen.

- Don't tell me you've been robbed again.
- Clean.
Miss Parker. Miss Parker, here they come.
That's better. Nine and two are eleven.
Four and three are seven.
He thought I didn't have a card.
I trumped his ace.
You should've seen his face.
It was on a redouble.
- They play a lot of bridge in Bangkok?
- Great bridge town. We call it Bridgeport.
No, you're really very fortunate moving in with our crowd.
Only last week, JB - JB Bradley, I mean - said to me, "Dick." Calls me Dick for short.
"Dick," he said, "I'm sure your missis is gonna like it here."
- You will, too.
- Oh, I know I will.
- Tell her about the house, Richard.
- Oh, yes.
But just a description of it doesn't do it justice.
It's absolutely modern. Lots of closet space.
Fully equipped laundry. It's just as good as any house in any American suburb.
And roomy too. I'll show you.
Kinda L-shaped. This is our room.
- This is Mother's room.
- Mother's?
Yes. Oh, you think she'd be better off in this one?
(Richard) I don't know.
Bangkok is a very romantic city, isn't it?
There are a lot of old temples and places like that.
But our colony doesn't bother with the native things.
We have our own little set. Fine, substantial people too. Bridge and tennis.
You know your opponents so well you can tell in advance every move.
That must be interesting.
Susan! Susan!
You should be taking a nap, you and your dolls.
My dolls are. Shut your eyes and put out your hand. I've something for you.
All right.
- Susan, where did that come from?
- From Uncle Tommy.
- Who?
- Oh, I asked him not to buy it.
Look, he bought me a bracelet too.
- Why, that must've cost...
- $300. I saw the price tag.
$300! He wouldn't have spent that much money if he hadn't felt you were interested.
- I don't think I need even answer that.
- You'll return it, won't you?
Certainly. I asked Mr Randall not to buy it.
- Shall I give back my bracelet too?
- No, darling.
I think you'd better go take your nap or play or something.
Still, he might've meant it as a wedding present.
In that case, there'd be no harm in your keeping it. After all, it did cost quite a lot.
Will my boy be happy with a girl like that?
- Sometimes I wonder.
- Of course I will, Mother.
- Why do you say that?
- Oh, I don't know.
Susan seems to have changed a great deal lately.
She'll be all right after we're married.
Well, it's about time we declared an armistice.
I've been feeling terrible, Susan.
Well, this is very pretty, but of course I can't accept it.
Take back your baubles, is that it?
Listen, Susan, I think you're being very...
What, is it as bad as all that?
- Don't you like me any more?
- That has nothing to do with it.
Well, don't you?
Not particularly.
You know what you tell me: keep your chin up and you'll be OK.
As Sun Lo says, the strongest man in the world cannot lift a heavy heart.
Why is your heart heavy?
You know that Mr Hope?
Well, Susan's gonna marry him.
Oh!
She'll have Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
It'll serve her right, too.
Oh, no! Nobody should have
Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
Ah, there you are, young lady.
Just the one I want to see.
I've got a surprise for you.
As an unshelled nut is to a squirrel, so is a surprise to him who receives it.
Righto, darling.
You're going to leave the ship at Singapore.
What?
Now, you run down below and start to get ready.
Then when you come back,
I'll tell you the rest.
You oughta give Uncle Tommy a surprise too, just to make him feel better.
- He's been in the... What was it?
- Doghouse.
With Mr Wu.
- What is all this?
- I just received this wireless from Shanghai.
- What will the consul do with her?
- There's a home for girls in Shanghai.
- He'll probably see she's placed in it.
- Home for girls?
You mean grey uniforms and pigtails?
Ching-Ching was never meant for that.
I know, old man, but I'm afraid it's about all that can be done for her.
Captain, wait a minute.
This may sound crazy, but why can't I adopt her?
Now, see here, son.
You're a bachelor. And quite a bachelor.
No court would turn a child over to you.
- It would be different if I were married?
- Well, naturally.
- It's a horrible step.
- I don't think you need worry, old man.
You haven't got time now.
- Excuse me. Have you seen Ching-Ching?
- Yes.
- Do you know where she is?
- Yes.
Well, would you mind telling me?
Below, getting ready to leave the ship at the next stop.
They're putting her in a home for girls.
She'll be marching in lockstep and eating gruel within a week.
- I hope you like it.
- Oh, Tommy.
- Tears won't help.
- But surely something can be done.
This can't happen to Ching-Ching.
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
You're gonna marry old sourpuss, aren't you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, no of fence meant.
Look, I tried to adopt Ching-Ching, but I'm unmarried.
- You're getting married.
- Richard might...
- You don't want her to go to an institution?
- Of course not.
Then listen.
I've gone completely soft about that kid.
Incredible, I know, but true.
Adopt her. Let me pay for her upbringing until I can take her myself.
That'll be as quick as I can get to the States and come back with a wife.
Will you do it? It wouldn't be for long.
You may not believe it, but there are quite a few girls back home willing to marry me.
At least there used to be.
It's not for me, it's for Ching-Ching.
- I'll do it.
- I knew you would.
May I speak to you, Susan?
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.
Susan, I'm awfully sorry if I annoyed you in speaking of that bracelet as I did.
Imagine my becoming so upset over a mere trinket. Absurd, isn't it?
Oh, I was a little upset myself. I'm sorry.
There, that's better. Everything's all right now.
Here we are, the three happy Hopes.
One, two, three, and away we go.
Mother was a little weepy when you stalked out.
Somehow she got the idea you'd prefer her not to live with us.
- Why, whatever could've given her that idea?
- I don't know.
But I told her we couldn't get along without her. Didn't I, Mother?
- Well, I don't suppose we could.
- That's awfully sweet of you, Susan.
Heaven protect us all from interfering mothers-in-law is what I always say.
Goodness. I was married myself once and I know what I'm talking about.
Not that Mr Hope's mother didn't mean well, but then, you know... young love.
We do know, don't we?
- Richard.
- Yes?
Just one thing.
Well, I want to adopt little Ching-Ching as soon as we're married.
Whoever heard of such a thing?
If I don't, they'll put her in an institution.
- That's what institutions are for.
- Oh, Richard, please.
I'm sure Richard doesn't want to start his married life with a ready-made family.
Especially with a child called Ching-Ching.
It won't be for long, just until Mr Randall gets back.
- Randall? What's he got to do with it?
- Well... You see, it's a favour to him.
He wants to adopt her as soon as he can.
When he gets back to the States, he'll arrange to take her.
- Why should I do Mr Randall a favour?
- Why indeed?
It isn't for him, it's for the little girl.
Think of her future.
Don't meddle with other people's destinies, my dear.
Forget this child. She got along before she met you and she will after she leaves you.
Dismiss her from your mind completely.
Please, don't you think Richard and I should settle this by ourselves?
After all, it concerns us.
Anything that concerns Richard concerns me.
I think Mother's right, Susan.
- You do?
- Yes.
- Your mother's right and I'm wrong?
- Well, yes. That is, I think you're mistaken.
So do I. I've been mistaken about you and me.
- Now, Susan...
- Listen, marriage is for two people.
I'm breaking our engagement.
Richard, she'll come back.
Meanwhile you wait.
The man should always wait, otherwise he's weak.
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
The captain says I have to go.
No, you don't.
Didn't you say she could be adopted by someone who's married? She's going to be.
- Here she is now.
- Oh, darling.
- Don't I have to go ashore?
- Not now. Tell her, Susan.
- Miss Parker's going to adopt Ching-Ching.
- I'm not going to be married.
- What? Oh, but you said...
- I think we'd better go now, darling.
Just a minute.
This isn't really goodbye.
I'll come back for you real soon.
And in the meantime, you won't cry, will you?
No, Uncle Tommy, but remember, one... one minute of waiting is a century to the hopeful.
I'll remember, Ching-Ching.
Goodbye, sweetie.
If you ever come back again, you won't forget to come and see me, will you?
- I'll be in the orphan asylum in Shanghai.
- Oh, sure, we'll look you up.
- Won't we?
- Of course we will.
Maybe we'll have some more fun like we had.
We might even go back to jail again.
(Tommy) Yes, we might.
Well, I think I'd better run along now.
Before I really cry. Goodbye.
We can't let this happen to her.
Look, Susan, I've got an idea.
Please don't say no till you hear me out.
I know exactly what you think of me, but that isn't important now.
Marry me. Don't misunderstand me.
You wouldn't have to put up with me.
It'd just be a marriage in name only.
Soon as we dock in San Francisco, go to Reno and get a divorce.
My lawyers will take care of everything.
I wish you would. For Ching-Ching.
It's the only way.
- You'd really do that for her?
- I'd do anything in the world for her.
- So would I.
- Then you will?
Yes.
Hey, bring her back.
- What's that?
- We're getting married. We want to adopt her.
Come on, Ching-Ching, darling.
We're going back aboard ship again.
For as much as Susan Parker and Thomas Randall have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before this company, and have given and pledged their troth, each to the other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and joining hands,
I pronounce that they are man and wife.
Amen.
- All happiness, my dear. Good luck, my boy.
- Thank you.
Twice blessed is he who loves both bride and groom, for their happiness is his.
Congratulations, Mr Randall.
Much joy to you, Mrs Randall.
- Thank you.
- A sailor's knot is as good as City Hall's.
There'll be some formalities about the child.
I'll have my lawyer take care of that.
- Susan, why did you do this?
- Young man, you're talking to my wife.
- Richard, dear!
- And you told me to wait.
- Are you really and truly my parents now?
- We're the best you've got, darling.
Sun Lo says a child without parents is like a ship without a rudder.
Sun Lo ever say anything about going to sleep?
Oh, yes.
He said sleep without dreams is given to children for their innocence and old men for their wisdom.
Well, off you go, then.
I'm almost too excited to sleep, but I'll try.
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Aunt Susan, Uncle Tommy.
Good night, darling, but I'm not your uncle any more.
- What are you, then?
- Can't you guess?
I know. You're my father now.
- Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, here you are.
Did the stewardess move your things?
She said Mrs Hope almost bit her.
- I...
- I...
- Go ahead.
- No, you.
Well, I was just going to say if there was anything you wanted me to do to lend credibility to the situation,
I'll be glad to do it, you know.
- People will talk whatever we do.
- Sure, of course.
Well, I guess I'll be off.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll try to make things as easy for you as possible.
I'm cabling my lawyers tonight. You can go direct to Reno as soon as the boat docks.
- Everything's arranged.
- Very thoughtful.
Not at all. You'll like Reno.
It's a fascinating place.
Lots of fresh air and horseback riding.
Full of nice, emotional people.
Oh...
- This is the address you go to.
- Thank you.
You're really wonderful.
I suppose you know that.
Well, at the moment,
I don't feel very wonderful.
Well, if you must know,
I don't feel so good myself.
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Tommy.
I...
Begging your pardon, sir, where shall I lay out your pyjamas this evening?
- Where you laid them last night.
- Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, sir.
(knocking)
Come in.
Susan, why didn't you warn me you were going to do this?
Well, I... I didn't have time, and besides... (laughs) it's too late now.
- Well, it's hardly funny, is it?
- Not to me.
Well, tell me one thing.
You don't love him, do you?
Do you?
No, I don't, but even if I did it wouldn't make any difference.
Yes, it would. Listen, darling,
I've been a worm, I know that now.
But I've had an understanding with Mother.
You can have your way from now on, always, if you'll tell me there's a chance.
Oh, no, Richard.
It wouldn't work. You know it wouldn't.
You can be nice. You're nice now, but...
- Please, Susan.
- No, really, I'm too confused to talk about it.
I'm even too upset to think about it.
I'll follow you.
I'll follow you until you say yes.
No, Richard, I'd rather you didn't.
You'd better lock this.

You stay in here and I'll wait out in the courtroom.
- Is this Mrs Randall?
- Yes.
You mustn't be nervous when your case is called.
I've placed you at the beginning of today's calendar. Meanwhile, wait here.
That's awfully kind of you, Judge.
This is my first divorce, and I'm a little jittery.
It is a little strange at first, but they all get used to it.
- You know, like influenza.
- (knocking)
Come.
Right in here, please.
- Susan!
- Darling, I'm so glad to see you.
Oh, this is a surprise.
But I don't understand.
Well, you see, I thought
I might want another divorce sometime.
I was sort of curious to see how they made them.
(clears throat)
- Judge Booth, this is Mr Randall.
- The husband, I presume?
Yes. This is my daughter.
- Your daughter?
- Adopted.
- How are you, young lady?
- Fine, thank you.
To greet one you love is better for the health than medicine.
Well, I declare.
That sounds like a Chinese proverb.
Judge, you haven't heard anything yet.
Well, well, well.
Come over here and talk to me.
I... I tried to stay away, but I found I couldn't.
I had to see you again.
Suppose you and I have our talk in the other room.
Uh...
- Will you excuse us for a few moments?
- Oh, but would it be proper?
- I mean, our being left alone together now.
- Oh, it's quite customary.
- You're looking very well.
- I haven't had a drink in six weeks.
- That's wonderful.
- No, it isn't, it's terrible.
Still, I'll get along, and it does show what the influence of a good woman can do.
- Oh, really? Who is she?
- Ching-Ching.
I told you I'd do anything in the world for her.
You've proven that.
Honestly, you wouldn't know me.
I'm a changed man.
I may not be any better, but at least I'm different.
I'm so glad.
You know, you were right about Reno.
It's a fascinating place.
- So charming and...
- Susan. Darling.
- Oh, Tommy, please.
- Do we have to go through with this?
Richard is waiting in the courtroom to marry me. He's gonna take me back to the Orient.
Oh...
I see.
Well, I guess that's that, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Sorrier than I can say.
Everyone rise.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
The District Court of Washoe,
State of Nevada, is now in session.
The Honourable JG Booth, judge presiding.
Be seated, please.
Case of Randall versus Randall.
- Any witnesses for plaintiff?
- The case is uncontested.
In that case, the court would like to call a witness of its own.
But the case is uncontested.
I said the court will call a witness of its own.
Miss Barbara Randall.
We don't want her mixed up in this.
The witness will take the stand.
The defendant will please be seated.
- Raise your right hand, please.
- I think we can dispense with the oath.
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Now, Miss Randall.
- You can call me Ching-Ching, Judge.
- Thank you.
Now, Ching-Ching, the plaintiff alleges general incompatibility.
Have you ever noticed evidence of such a condition existing between the parties to this action?
To my knowledge, the contestants in this action have manifested nothing but the most harmonious, cordial and friendly feelings towards each other.
- But, Your Honour, I object.
- Who are you, young man?
- Why, I'm engaged to the plaintiff.
- Engaged?
To a married woman?
- This court recognises no such engagement.
- (laughter)
Now, Ching-Ching, have either of the parties in this action ever evidenced by their conduct any proper legal ground for divorce?
There's utterly no ground for disturbing the marital status of the contestants.
Most irregular, Your Honour.
The child doesn't know what she is saying.
Oh, yes, she does.
Tell the court.
Isn't this action the result of two grown-up people behaving like children, refusing to admit that they're in love with each other?
The allegations of the complaint insofar as it refers to...
Uh...
Matrimony.
Huh?
- Matrimony.
- Oh, yes.
- Insofar as it refers to macaroni...
- (lawyer) Macaroni?
There! See, Your Honour?
The child has obviously been coached.
I was not. I just forgot what the judge told me to say.
- (laughter)
- (gavel)
- ls counsel intimating that she is lying?
- Counsel charges just that.
Have you any witnesses to disprove her testimony?
Do you wish to testify that this child was lying?
Why...
- No, of course not.
- Then you admit that you love Mrs Randall?
She knows I do.
You, Mrs Randall.
Do you wish to attack this child's veracity?
- Why, no, certainly not.
- You admit that you love your husband?
- Well, yes, I do.
- Then what's all this nonsense about?
Divorce denied. Take your child and go home, both of you, where you belong.
Your Honour, what about me?
My advice, young man, is to stop tampering with the affections of married women.
- Well, we did it, didn't we?
- You bet we did.
Judge, you're simply stravagant.

ENGLISH SDH NN1
Step right up to the platform, ladies and gentlemen.
You will see the greatest show on the midway for only 50 cents.
These little ladies are entertaining you now, but in just a moment...
...Little Egypt will turn on her stuff.
She has danced before all the crown heads of Europe.
She makes blue blood turn into red.
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up...
...and buy your tickets for Sandow, the strongest man in the world.
He juggles pianos.
He plays marbles with cannonballs.
He lifts 10 times his own weight with one arm.
He can even raise his own salary.
Now, folks, step right this way.
You are looking at the sensation of the fair, the eighth Wonder of the World.
Ladies and gentlemen, this way. This way.
This little lady has wiggled herself...
...from the desert to the shores of Lake Michigan.
And she's about to give you an exhibition absolutely free.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the dance that Little Egypt does inside...
...but to prove our generosity, we're going to give a demonstration...
...of that famous dance, the hootchy-kootch. Egypt, wiggle.
That's sufficient.
Now, ladies and gentlemen--
He's a masterpiece of manhood.
Step up to the box office and buy your tickets. The show's about to begin.
--phenomenon.
Ladies and gentlemen, this--
Well, how's business, Ziggy?
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Sandow concludes this performance...
...by lifting, with Herculean strength, the largest dumbbell in the world.
An unusual feat, ladies and gentlemen...
...for inside this huge dumbbell, there are other dumbbells.
Ladies and gentlemen, look.
There you are. Aren't they beautiful?
Aren't they glorious?
A total weight of 750 pounds.
Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it marvelous?
Let's give him a big hand.
What made you bring me to a show of this kind?
Well, you wouldn't let me see Little Egypt.
I'll bet a heifer against a mare the weights ain't on the level.
Seven hundred and fifty pounds, my foot.
- I wonder what her total weight is. Oh, Bill?
- Yes, sir.
- Open the curtains, will you?
- Open up those curtains.
Hey, Bill, you know, it seems to me that this platform--
Oh, hello, baby.
Want some candy, Jane, huh?
Bill, we ought to have this platform built higher.
There ought to be more steps.
The people in the back row can hardly see.
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, there's never anybody in the back rows.
Well, nevertheless, I want this higher.
There ought to be a lot more steps.
Okay, Mr. Ziegfeld.
I'm sorry I lost my temper, Florenz...
...but I am awful disappointed.
I hope you never get downright disgusted.
What is wrong?
Why don't they come in?
You're the attraction, and you're asking me?
Maybe you would like to cancel my contract.
Oh, no, Sandow.
When I make a deal, it's a deal.
I like that. I like you.
Well, I like you too.
If you want to pay me some of my back salary, I take you to dinner, yeah?
Well, I'm not very hungry.
You're not worrying about your money, are you?
- You don't think I'd ever walk out on you?
- No, no.
Nobody do that to Sandow.
- Maybe I better take you to dinner.
- That's fine.
Hands up, mister, and give me all your money.
Well, I can't give you anything with my hands up, sweetheart.
All right, fresh, 23 skidoo for you.
I'll help myself.
Oh, no. Oh, I see you got my little surprise.
This morning. Gee, ain't it swell?
- Were you really surprised?
- Well, wouldn't you be?
- Yes.
- If you expected a diamond ring.
Oh, don't be--
Tell you what we'll do.
- We'll go to the Little Vienna Restaurant.
- Oh, I'd like that.
- Telegram, Mr. Billings.
- Oh, thank you.
Just wait a minute. There might be an answer. Let me see.
- Oh, well, I'll be.
- Bad news?
No, it's from Ziegfeld.
He's across the midway.
He can touch me, but he has to send wires.
Listen, "In Little Egypt, you have the best female attraction of the fair.
In Sandow, I have the greatest male attraction.
Why not fake a romance?
The people will eat it up.
Then we can show them together, and I'd be willing to split 50-50."
- Well, that sounds like a great idea.
- Oh, yes, great.
I'm selling out every performance, he's going to be thrown out...
...and he's willing to split 50-50.
Give me your pencil.
I'll answer this one.
- Jack?
- Yes.
- Is Ziegfeld a good friend of yours?
- Oh, yes, we've been pals for years.
- But you wouldn't like him.
- No?
No, he's up one day and broke the next.
If he got $ 10,000 tomorrow...
...he'd spend it on the girl he liked tomorrow night.
Wouldn't want to waste your time meeting a fellow like that.
- Not if I met him on the right night.
- On the right--? Oh, don't you--
- Shut up! And just send that collect.
- Yes, sir, and I'll deliver it too, sir.
Because every time I take Mr. Ziegfeld a message, he gives me 50 cents.
- Oh, he does, does he?
- Sure.
Yes, well, that's probably why he's always broke. Come on, dear.
This cheese is so strong it could walk over and say hello to your coffee.
Well, it had better not.
This coffee's too weak to answer it.
Florenz, you're wonderful.
You make jokes even when you're so worried you can't touch your cold cuts.
I got no appetite neither.
No?
Message for you, Mr. Ziegfeld.
- They told me I'd find you here.
- From Billings.
So soon he answers?
He must be crazy about your proposition.
- Yeah.
- Read it to me, Flo. Read it.
"Dear Ziggy, your proposition interests me."
What did I tell you?
"But why fake a romance between Sandow and Little Egypt?
Let's make Sandow marry Little Egypt, and I'll split the children with you 50-50."
That message was collect.
- Fifty cents.
- Have you change for a dollar?
- Sure, but you always....
- Keep it.
Gee, thanks.
Florenz, I love you.
I will break chains for you...
...I will lift buildings for you, but I will not have children for you.
But if I have children,
I will not split them.
- Oh, hello, Ziggy, I got your wire.
- I just got yours too.
Patterson tells me he's putting you out Saturday.
- He tells me too.
- How do you do, Mr. Ziegfeld?
How do you--?
- How do you do, Miss...?
- Yes, Blair, this is Mr. Ziegfeld.
- I'm very happy to know you, Miss Blair.
- I'm so happy to meet you, Mr. Ziegfeld.
And this is Mr. Sandow, the strongest man in the--
The strongest man in the world.
Jack tells me the loveliest things about you.
Oh, yes, I imagine.
- I could tell you lovely things about you.
- He's only just met you...
...and he's going to tell you all about yourself.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
- Oh, but no, we've got-- There's a table--
- I've seen you many times...
...on the midway.
- Fibber. I bet you never even noticed me.
- Yes, I have.
Yesterday, you were wearing a red dress trimmed in black lace.
- Yes.
- And a yellow hat, and it was atrocious.
- Oh, indeed?
- Each was all right in itself, mind you...
...but the combination....
And last Sunday, you were wearing a blue gown and an orchid hat.
- Well, yes.
- And you were wrong again.
Well, aren't we the observer?
Do you always check the right combinations for women?
- Always for beautiful women.
- Oh, well, that's nice. Thank you.
- How do I look today?
- Well, I don't like your hat.
- It shades your eyes, and I like your eyes.
- Thank you.
He ought to be packing his own clothes instead of selecting yours.
- Come on, Ruth, we've got to go.
- Yes. Well, goodbye, then.
- I'll be seeing you around the grounds.
- Yes. Well, not after Saturday, you won't.
- That fella Billings makes me mad.
- Yes?
Even that music from his Little Egypt drives me crazy.
You won't have to listen to it much longer. Wait a minute.
Come away. For five weeks you've been touching that elephant for luck...
...and now in five days, we get put out.
I know it's superstition, but an old Hindu told me...
...that if you touch an elephant's trunk, and he raises it, everything will be all right.
Wait, wait. We know we got hard luck without that elephant should tell us.
Say, I know what's wrong. You should touch him. You're the attraction.
- Me?
- Sure. Go on, go ahead.
It sounds silly, but all right, I'll do it.
Look, Florenz, would he do that for me?
The Great Sandow.
Sandow.
So that's what you call good luck, yeah?
Look, Sandow, you've got to expect a little rain with the sunshine.
That was very embarrassing, Florenz, very embarrassing.
Don't get your dander up. Who knows?
Maybe that little shower will bring us oodles of luck.
Well, I hope it brings us so much business like that Little Egypt.
Look at those peoples, how they crowd in to see that woman make wiggles...
...when yet they wouldn't come to see me lift weights no other man in the world can.
Sandow, I'm afraid your trouble is you developed the wrong muscles.
What you say? Every muscle in Sandow's body is developed...
...even the toes, like that.
With one arm I make a better dance than that Little Egypt with the whole body.
Look, boss.
Good heavens!
- Are you Mr. Sandow, the strongman?
- Yes, madam, this is the Great Sandow.
Oh, look at those huge shoulders.
Aren't they marvelous?
- Yes, dear, come on.
- And that big chest.
- I never saw a chest like that before.
- Oh, come on.
And his waistline, oh, it's simply magnificent.
- Precious, come on.
- Just a minute, dear.
Mr. Sandow, I think your muscles are simply astounding.
Perhaps madam would like to feel the muscles of Sandow.
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Sandow, your arm.
- Florenz, is she dead?
- No, she's only fainted.
- But, oh, what an idea. Come on!
- What? Wait a minute. What's wrong?
- Where are you going?
- The papers. To the newspapers.
I'll fill them so full, women will fight to see you.
Not to watch you lift weights, but simply to feel your muscles.
Why, you've got more sex appeal in your one arm...
...than Little Egypt has in her whole--
Sandow, the modern Hercules.
The miracle of strength.
Watch his muscles quiver in musical rhythm. Sandow, quiver.
Sufficient.
And now, ladies, if you want to see more of the Great Sandow...
...if your hearts are strong enough to stand the thrill...
...step up and buy your ticket.
The show starts in five minutes.
- Folks, this is the show--
- How's business, Jack?
All right?
- Doesn't it sparkle?
- Yes, doesn't it?
- You like it?
- I certainly do.
I'm glad.
- Dr. Ziegfeld.
- Yeah?
Can't I play my piece for you now?
I get awful tired of this....
I don't blame you, Mary Lou. So do I.
Go ahead, then.
Go on, play your little piece now.
- Dr. Ziegfeld?
- Yes, dear.
- Do you know I was mad at your son?
- What?
Mad at your best fella?
Oh, but why?
Because he left us for that old World's Fair.
Oh, well, darling, you know the fair closed yesterday.
And is he coming back here again?
Well, I hope so.
Go on. You go on with your lesson.
- Dr. Ziegfeld.
- Yes, dear.
Did you know I was going to marry your son?
Well, well, this is so sudden.
- Are you?
- Oh, yes. We got that settled months ago.
Oh, yes, Father, didn't you know
Mary Lou and I are engaged?
Well, don't I get a kiss today?
Not even a smile?
Well, Father, what do you think of that?
My future wife won't even kiss me...
- ...and I brought her a present too.
- What?
- Kiss first.
- No, present first.
No, kiss first. I'll tell you what. We'll both give at the same time. How's that?
I'll count three. Ready? One.
- Two.
- Same time, remember.
Three.
Thank you so much.
Dr. Ziegfeld, isn't it lovely?
- Beautiful.
- I'm going to open it right now.
- Right now. Yes.
- Oh, well, well, well.
Well, Florenz, what have you decided to do?
Well, I'm going to New York tomorrow, Dad.
With that Sandow, that strongman?
Father, I don't really belong here.
No, I don't like it.
You don't like it, huh? The greatest music conservatory in the country.
I built it all myself. Students from all over the world are coming here...
...and you-- You don't like it.
You realize that maybe somewhere in one of these rooms...
...we find a future
Beethoven or Liszt?
And you, my own son, all you want is a circus.
A circus with a fellow that can throw cannonballs.
Well, now, Dad, don't be upset.
- Sandow is a means to an end.
- Yeah, to your end.
When you was a little fellow, since then,
I've educated you in music and art.
From your mother, you got the refinement, taste, culture.
What good has it all done?
What has it done you?
What are you now anyhow?
A muscle manager. A beef exhibitor.
Then you got to go on the outside, and you gotta be....
You gotta act like a dog outside.
You act like a dog.
Wait a minute, what do you mean, a dog?
You know what I mean. I don't mean you're a dog, I mean you got--
You gotta go outside and be a barker.
That's a dog, ain't it?
Now let me tell you something.
If you go away from here...
...I'll never speak to you again as long as I live.
- Oh, Dad, you don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it.
And I mean-- I mean every word of it.
Hey, wait a minute here.
Now, you just stop that crying.
Now, you tell your fellow why you're crying.
If you're my fellow, why are you going away?
What--?
Now look here, you sit right up here, and I'll tell you all about it.
Now, I'll be honest with you.
- I'm not really your fellow.
- You mean you don't like me anymore?
I not only like you, I love you.
But you know, I'm the funniest kind of a fellow. I love all the girls.
How can you do that?
Do they let you?
Well, you didn't quite understand what I mean, darling.
Look....
Some people like beautiful paintings.
- Like that one?
- Like that one.
Some people love beautiful flowers.
- Like those?
- Like those.
Now, I love beautiful little girls like this one.
- You know what I'm going to do someday?
- What?
I'm going to take all the beautiful little girls like you...
...and I'm going to put them together and make pictures with them.
- Will I be in a picture?
- Well, I should say you will.
But in the meantime, I think that we ought to break our engagement.
- Why?
- Well, because...
...there are going to be lots of boys...
...who want to take you out and buy you sodas.
If you're engaged to me, you can't go with them.
- Why can't I?
- Because if you're married to me...
...I'm not going to have you running around with other boys. I couldn't stand for that.
- You couldn't?
- Well, of course I couldn't.
- Well, what are you laughing at?
- At you, you're jealous.
Well, you can just bet I'm jealous.
Well, now I've got to run along.
Florenz.
- Will you be home to dinner tonight?
- Yes, Dad.
Well, I'll see you then.
And in the meantime, son, remember:
Anything you do, I wish you luck.
I knew you would.
Hold it, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Thank you. Thank you.
Greetings. Greetings to San Francisco...
...from my troupe, including the strongest man in the world, Sandow.
Humane Society?
Say, what's this I read in the papers about a lion and a bear?
Is your society going to tolerate such an atrocity?
Are you going to spill the blood of animals over the good name of San Francisco?
Well, I didn't think you'd permit such cruelty.
Why, it would be a crime to send a poor grizzly bear...
...into a cage with a man-eating lion. Crime.
- What's so funny?
- Oh, you wouldn't understand...
...because you don't know Ziegfeld.
Police are after him...
...and this paper's two weeks old, so he's probably in jail by now.
- But do you know him, Jack?
- Oh, yeah, he's a pal of mine.
Hello.
- Well, Jack, this is a surprise.
- Yes.
- Certainly glad to see you aboard.
- Yes, well, I'm glad I--
Pardon me, I'll be back in a few minutes, darling.
I thought perhaps you were--
- Hey, who is she?
- You'll never know.
What happened in Frisco? Did you really send Sandow in against a lion?
Sure, but the lion wouldn't fight.
Wouldn't or couldn't?
To tell you the truth, Jack,
I didn't stay for the finish.
- I sort of thought that....
- Yes, I know.
Well, where is Sandow now?
He's in New York.
He's going into the legitimate.
- He's with Lillian Russell in As You Like It.
- Yeah, well, I don't think I'd like it.
What are you going to Europe for, another strongman?
Oh, no, no. Just a little vacation.
- London?
- Well, Monte Carlo first.
You're gonna lose all the money you made on Sandow, huh?
- No, I'm going to double it.
- Oh, yes.
What are you going for, another Little Egypt?
Oh, no, just a rest. Of course, if I see any exceptional talent, I'll pick it up.
Well, naturally. So will I.
Oh, you got anybody in mind?
No, no. Why, have you?
No, no.
Only the greatest artist in Europe, that's all.
Say, who's that?
If I told you, you'd cross me before we crossed the ocean.
Beg pardon, sir.
Miss Carlisle wishes to know whether there will be three for tea or just two.
Just two. Yes, just two.
- Miss Carlisle, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, thank you.
You're....
- You're Mr. Billings' man, are you?
- Yes, sir.
Well, you're very efficient.
- What is your name?
- Sidney, sir.
Sidney. How much does
Mr. Billings pay you, Sidney?
One hundred a month, sir.
Only-- Well, that's not very much, is it?
I hadn't thought of it, sir.
Well, think of it, Sidney.
London Evening News.
London Evening News.
Oh, take care of the luggage, will you?
And tip the doorman, Sidney.
Yes, sir.
You have a reservation for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr?
- Yes, sir. Will you register, please?
- Surely.
Is Mr. Billings still here?
- Yes, sir, on your floor.
- Oh, yes.
Boy. Rooms 325 and 26.
Thank you.
Sidney. Well, you ingrate, you deserter--
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Well, why didn't you tell me you were dissatisfied? I--
- You pirate.
- Now wait a minute, Jack.
Gentlemen don't quarrel over gentlemen's gentlemen.
- Oh, you--
- Let me tell you the whole story.
If you're still angry,
Sidney can go back with you.
- Oh, I--
- Look, Jack, it was this way.
I've always envied you.
Your dress, your style, the way you look.
So that when I saw your valet, and I realized...
...that it was he who took such magnificent care of you...
...well, I just couldn't resist the temptation of hiring him for myself.
You mean, you wanted to look like me?
Well, that's right, Jack.
I wanted to look just like you.
You faker.
What are you doing here? I thought you weren't going to be in London for weeks.
Well, that's a long story.
You know, I was going to break the bank at Monte Carlo.
Yes, I know.
But the bank broke you, huh?
- What did you lose?
- Fifty-thousand dollars.
- What have you got left?
- Fifty cents.
Fifty cents. Well, I'll see you later.
But, Jack, wait a minute.
Lend me 5000, will you?
Well, would you--?
Would you make it 2500?
If I gave you $2500, by the time you tipped six bellboys, you'd be broke again.
Look, Jack, I really need it.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you $500 if you'll catch the next boat back to New York.
There's one leaving in the morning.
Fair enough?
It's fair, but not enough.
Will you sail with me?
Oh, no, Mr. Ziegfeld,
I have business in London.
Oh, haven't you got the world's greatest artist yet?
No, not yet, but I will have.
Who is it, Jack?
Go on, you can tell me now. I'm broke.
I won't tell you till I have her name on the dotted line.
It's a her, is it?
Yes, and a beautiful her too, and she's signing the contract tonight.
- Goodbye, Mr. Ziegfeld.
- Goodbye, Mr. Billings.
I say, doorman, did Mr. Billings come out?
Just this moment drove away.
I've got a very important message for him.
- Do you know where he went?
- Palace music hall.
- Is it a good show?
- Not so much, sir.
Except for the French actress.
She's truly wonderful.
She has eyes this big, sir.
Every time she blinks them at you, you jolly well blink yourself, sir.
- Have you seen Anna Held, sir?
- No, no, I haven't, but I will tonight.
Thank you, sir.
I say, sir, do you realize you gave me Â£5?
Yes, I'm trying to lose weight.
Isn't it magnificent?
For me, Marie?
From whom?
Whoever gathered all the orchids in the world just for me?
I do not know, but they must've cost thousands of francs.
Was no card with it? Oh, yes.
- Marie, this is very strange.
- What, madame?
I learned the English words, I sing the
English songs, yet I cannot read English.
What shall that mean?
Please read it to me.
"My dear Miss Held, it is very important to your future...
...that you see me before signing any contracts.
I shall be waiting at the stage entrance immediately after your performance.
Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."
- Who's this Florenz Ziegfeld Jr?
- I do not know, madame.
- And why is it junior? Is he a little boy?
- I do not know, madame.
I will not see this Mr. Ziegfeld Jr.
You will see Monsieur Billings, oui?
Oh, Marie, these flowers are very nice.
I think I am polite and see this
Monsieur Junior Ziegfeld.
But Billings is coming to talk to you about the great American tour.
Has madame forgotten his cables?
Oh, yes, that's all right, but these flowers are very beautiful.
Well, Jack, she's all right.
Yeah, I know she is without you telling me.
- I wish you wouldn't keep following me.
- All right.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
I wish you wouldn't annoy me.
Miss Held is expecting me.
- I'm going to sign the contract tonight.
- That's great.
- You bet it is.
- I said it was.
- Yes, well, good night.
- Good night.
Will you stop shadowing me?
I'm not following you.
I just happen to be going your way.
You've got a date with a chorus girl,
I suppose.
You're going to spend that $500.
I can't spend it. I've spent it.
- Oh, you've spent-- Well, good night.
- Good night.
I beg your pardon, sir, but--
I have an appointment with Miss Held.
- Is Mr. Ziegfeld out here?
- Oh, no--
Yes, my dear. I'm Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Ziegfeld, Miss Held would like you to come in, please.
Would you mind that for me?
Well, good night, Jack.
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld, your orchids. They are the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen.
Won't you come in, Monsieur Ziegfeld?
Your flowers are so beautiful. I could not resist the temptation to thank you.
Miss Held. Do you mind my telling you...
...that you should never wear so many jewels on your hands?
- You think so?
- Some women, yes.
But your hands, no.
Oh, that's a very nice compliment.
Did you hear that, Marie?
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I did not know Americans could be so gallant.
Tell me, Monsieur Ziegfeld, are you in the theater?
Yes, I'm a producer.
Did you hear that, Marie?
Monsieur Ziegfeld is an American producer.
Do you know Monsieur Billings?
Billings?
- Billings.
- He's American producer too.
Oh, is that so?
- No, I've never heard of him.
- No?
Of course, not in New York, that is.
America's a big country.
We still have producers in the West putting on shows for the Indians.
- Indians? Do you mean the savages?
- Yes.
Did you hear that, Marie?
- I do not think I will like America.
- Oh, you'll love New York.
- Would New York love me?
- I think so.
You only think so?
Did you not like my performance?
Yes and no.
- Yes and no. Does it mean yes or no?
- Well, both.
- Did you not care for my singing, no?
- Yes.
A trifle nasal, I thought, but yes.
And you did not like my costumes either?
I thought one dress was very effective, but the rest, no.
Monsieur Ziegfeld,
I think you are very rude.
Please go.
Marie, open the door.
Monsieur Ziegfeld.
Yes?
Come back, please.
Sit down.
You know, you are very honest.
I like you very much.
Your note says it is important to my future to see you. Why is that?
- If you want to play in New York, it is.
- I have many offers for New York now.
I've no doubt, but so have many others.
There's foreign talent going into New York every day.
- What happens to them?
- What?
Well, they open at Tony Pastor's theater, and they get the hook.
The hook, what is that?
Hook, a little thing you catch fish with.
You know, a hook.
Now, if I take you over,
I'll present you on Broadway.
In a great show, in the best theater, to the best people.
I'll exploit you from coast to coast.
Exploit? What is that?
I'll put you over, I'll sell you.
- Sell me?
- To the public.
And I'll make them pay for you.
And how much will you pay me?
I'll advertise your name from every corner.
Women will be wearing Anna Held hats, shoes, corsets.
Even the children will know you.
But how much will you pay me?
More publicity than you've ever dreamed of.
Yes, that's all right.
But how much money will you give me?
I'll give you the greatest opening night that New York has ever had.
You'll see the Goulds, the Astors, the Vanderbilts.
"Diamond Jim" Brady, Lillian Russell.
- Lillian Russell?
- Yes.
- Oh, I would so much like to see her.
- Well.
No. First you must speak about the money because I have so many offers now.
I'll meet your biggest offer.
Really?
Well, that is very nice of you.
But maybe when you hear how much it is, you don't think I'm worth so much.
How much is it?
They are all very good, but the highest one is that of Mr. Billings.
He says he will give me 50,000 francs besides my salary, which is very big...
...just to sign the contract. That is how much in American money?
- $ 10,000, madame.
- $ 10,000, monsieur.
- Ten thousand dollars.
- Oui, that's a very big amount.
And even if you would give me the $ 10,000 and I sign with you...
...you still would have to wait till I finished my London engagement.
I couldn't do that.
You couldn't even wait for me?
I couldn't even give you the $ 10,000.
- You think it's too much, huh?
- I think it isn't enough.
But I haven't it.
What, you expect I should sign a contract for America with you...
- ...and you don't even have $ 10,000?
- I haven't even 1000.
I did have before I stopped at Monte Carlo, but right now, I haven't even 100.
- But I'll spread your name all over--
- It is enough!
You're just trying to make the fool of me.
You are the impostor.
You are no gentleman.
Please go.
Marie, open the door.
Monsieur Ziegfeld.
Come back, please.
Sit down.
You know, you're very honest.
I like you very much.
Mr. Vanderbilt's carriage.
Mr. Van Rensselaer's carriage.
- She has big eyes.
- But I couldn't understand a word she said.
- I'll take Lillian Russell.
- Mr. Astor's carriage.
- Did you like her?
- Cute. Did you notice the empty seats?
Miss Russell's carriage.
- I think she's charming.
- Why, there's Lillian Russell.
Mr. Thaw's carriage.
Never mind, I don't want a carriage.
The show's all right if they had an American star.
Mrs. Harriman's carriage.
Mr. Stuyvesant's carriage.
You made a bad bet, Jim.
- May I have your carriage called, Mr. Brady?
- Yes.
Oh, Ziggy.
Stanford and I just made a little wager.
He bet me 5000 that I wouldn't get back the 10,000 you borrowed...
- ...to bring Anna over here.
- Mr. Brady's carriage.
I'll split your end 50-50 with you, Mr. White.
I told you so. I told you so.
Well, what's a few thousand dollars anyway?
Mr. Chandler's carriage.
Mr. Saks' carriage.
Balcony 22.
Well, Sampston, what's the loss this week?
The show earned a profit of $ 1340.32.
You drew $2550...
...which gives us a loss of $ 1209.68.
That's terrible. We can't keep the show running with losses.
- Say, where's Sage?
- Upstairs.
What a press agent, never around.
Take a wire to him.
- But he's just upstairs in his office.
- I know it. Take a wire anyway.
How can you do business without publicity? Stop.
Anna Held was the sensation of Europe. Stop.
Appeared before kings and queens. Stop.
Yet you get nothing in the papers. Stop.
You're ruining me. Stop.
If you're a press agent,
I'm President Cleveland.
Stop.
Beg your pardon.
Pardon, madame.
It is not jolie. It is jolly.
Jolie, that's what I said, jolie.
Pardon, it's my mistake. I mean jolly.
Jolly. Good.
Please, let's start again. Jolly.
No, no, no. I won't sing today.
I can't sing today.
I'm much too much inside here.
Much too much.
Marie?
Marie.
It's so silly for Anna Held to take singing lessons.
But Ziegfeld did not ask me to teach you.
I simply want to help madame to lose her French accent.
But your accent is much more than my accent, and I don't want to lose my accent.
Marie, did you try to get
Monsieur Ziegfeld again?
- He is not home, madame.
- Please try it again.
- And the reporters?
- They are still in the lobby.
Tell them to go away.
Tell the hotel to push them out.
Tell them we are going back to France.
That's what we will do.
We are going back to Paris.
- Shut up, Pierre.
- I'm too happy, madame.
- Happy about what?
- We are sailing for Paris.
- No.
- No?
No, I changed my mind.
Marie, go unpack my things.
- You see, it's true.
- It is not.
- It is.
- No.
What is true and what is not true?
Pierre says madame is in love with Monsieur Ziegfeld.
Did you say that, Pierre?
- Why did you say that, Pierre?
- Because I'm afraid it's true.
Why are you afraid?
Don't you like Monsieur Ziegfeld?
Oui, madame, that's the trouble.
Everybody likes him, especially the ladies.
Oh, madame, you'd never be happy with him.
You'd never be able to hold him.
Why, he attracts women like the flowers attract bees.
Like the flypaper attract the flies.
Well, that's all right.
I've seen the flies on the flypaper...
...and it seems to me they stick very well.
- But, madame--
- Pierre, please.
How can I love someone who puts terrible things in the newspaper...
...has millions of reporters annoying me?
Pardon, madame, but the newspapers have been very nice to you.
Why don't you want to see the reporters?
Because I know exactly what they want to ask me.
- You do not understand, no?
- Frankly, no, madame.
Oh, then I will tell you what happened.
Two months ago,
Monsieur Ziegfeld says:
"Anna, from now on, I'm going to send you, every day, a big present."
I say, "Thank you so much, Flo--"
I mean, "Mr. Ziegfeld.
But already you send me orchids every morning."
Those are from him.
But he says, "No, Anna, this is something much more important."
So naturally, I cannot wait to see what he sends me.
And the next day, what do you think I get?
- A diamond ring?
- No.
- A bracelet?
- No. Four big cans of milk.
- Milk.
- Twenty gallons.
- Twenty gallons of milk?
- Twenty gallons of milk.
- Shut up!
- Twenty gallons of milk.
- Oh, please.
- No.
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
Well, that night I say to Flo--
I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld:
"Flo, why do you send me so much milk?"
And he just laughs and says,
"Anna, that's a great idea.
You get it from now on every day."
"Every day, 20 gallons of milk?"
I say, "Flo, who can drink so much milk?"
And do you know what he says?
"Don't drink it, bathe in it.
And you will be a big success."
- No!
- Well, I'm too angry to speak.
In Paris, I was a big success because they liked my voice.
In London, because they liked my singing.
But in America, to be a big success,
I need 20 gallons of milk and must sit in it!
- Well, do you bathe in it, madame?
- No, of course not.
But every day, we get the milk and take it in...
...because Monsieur Ziegfeld says we must carry out his idea.
And what happened?
Did you read this morning, the paper?
- No, madame.
- Please.
- "Ziegfeld is sued for Anna Held's milk bill."
- On the front page.
- Twenty gallons of milk.
- Oh, I'm so ashamed.
Marie, please call him again.
If he's not there, leave the message.
Tell him I do not want one can more of milk from him.
And I don't want the orchids either.
- Hello?
- Oh, those reporters again.
Tell them no.
I do not want to speak to them.
Madame, it is Monsieur Ziegfeld.
I don't want to speak to him either.
I never wish to speak to him again.
Where is he?
Downstairs in the lobby, madame.
Tell him to come up.
But if he brings one of those reporters, don't let him in.
No, Pierre. Let them on the floor.
I want him to see them there.
I make him pick them up.
He embarrasses me, I embarrass him.
Madame, if you will take my advice, you will not appear so excited.
Yes, you are right, Pierre.
Pierre, play. Play. I sing for you, yes.
Just like he's not here.
We'll let him wait till I'm finished.
Come on, play, play, play.
- Your missus is in lovely voice today, Marie.
- Oui, monsieur. You will see.
Marie, someone has apparently spilled the orchids.
Now, will you phone Sidney for me? Have him send up another dozen immediately.
Well? Why do you not pick these up?
Because fallen flowers, my dear, are like fallen stars.
They soon lose their luster.
Marie, pick them up.
No, I cannot sing today.
I'm much too angry to sing.
I'm sick of watching you roll your eyes like I do.
Please go home. I give you your notes.
Please take them. Go home, yes?
Go.
So I'm a fallen star, yes?
I have no luster, no?
Oh, yes, you have, my dear.
- But do you know what it comes from?
- I don't care.
What?
Milk baths. Or at least that's what you must tell the reporters.
I'm so hurt. The front page of the paper says you are sued on my account.
If you send milk, why don't you pay for it?
If I did, it wouldn't be in the papers.
Can't you tell them I just used the milk without buying it and being sued for it?
They wouldn't believe it.
Now it's a matter of record.
Besides, they don't care whether I ever pay the bill.
All that interests them is that in two months, you've used 1200 gallons of milk.
This is terrible.
- Ask the reporters to come up.
- Do nothing of the kind.
Anna, you must not insult the press.
If they come up, I tell the truth.
No, at first, tell them nothing.
Desk, please.
Pretend embarrassment.
Pretend it? I was never so ashamed.
Are the gentlemen of the press still waiting for Miss Held?
What are you doing?
Oh, yes, if you will, please.
I will say I never in my life took a milk bath.
I will tell them it is all a press story.
I will go back to France.
Marie, pack the things. Quick.
This time I mean it!
You cannot make a circus of me.
I'm not a strongman like Sandow.
I'm a real artist, and I never, never, never will say that.
Yes? Oh, ask them to come right up, please.
No!
Anna, don't you realize that if we put this story over...
...your name will be in headlines from coast to coast?
Every woman in the country will be talking about you.
I don't care.
I do not have to be a cow to be a success.
And before I make such a fool of myself,
I tear up my contract with you. So...
...where is it?
And besides-- Besides--
And besides, you do nothing as I like to have it.
It must always be your way.
I ask you 1000 times to have costumes like Lillian Russell.
She has not to take milk baths to be a success. She is beautiful.
But, no, I cannot have gowns like her.
There now.
Tell the reporters about that!
- Anna.
- I mean it. I'm determined.
Anna.
You let the reporters come up, yes?
All right, I tell them everything.
Anna?
Well, I should tell them, no?
No.
Now, you do what I ask you to, darling...
...and I'll do whatever you wish.
You mean, you'll let me have gowns like Lillian Russell?
Oh, no, darling.
You're not her type.
- But I'll tell you what I will do.
- What?
I'll put eight Lillian Russells on the stage behind you.
Isn't Anna beautiful?
I wonder if the milk baths really make her skin so nice.
Oh, they most certainly do.
I've been taking them for a long time.
Oh, Marie, were they not wonderful tonight?
And the girls!
Don't they look gorgeous?
Marie.
Look. From my Flo.
Oh, my Flo.
Oh, Marie! Marie!
You read what he says.
Oui, madame.
Read it to me, quick!
What does it say?
"My darling.
I never knew that one long year could seem like one short moment.
You are magnificent, my wife. Flo."
Oh, Marie.
- Marie, did you hear that?
- I just read it, madame.
No, no. Did you hear what he says?
"You are magnificent, my wife."
Oh, madame, look! Look!
Marie!
Come on, help me.
Oh, isn't it gorgeous?
Oh, madame, look, look!
Here's another one!
Oh, Marie!
Oh, that makes me so much inside. Here.
Much too much.
First, he gives me all the flowers in the world...
...and now he takes the stars from the heavens, just for me.
"You're magnificent, my wife."
- Am I magnificent, Marie?
- Oui, madame.
No, no, no.
He's magnificent, not I.
Marie!
Marie, I must show them to the girls!
I come back immediately!
And when Mr. Ziegfeld comes, please tell him he shall wait!
Girls, would you like to see something wonderful?
Oh, what is it?
- Look! And this!
- Diamonds!
- From my husband!
- May I try the bracelet?
- Yes, sure.
- That's gorgeous.
Audrey, are you not interested in my presents?
I would be if they were mine.
But, Audrey, you will have many of them someday.
Maybe you have to work a little, to suffer a little.
- But what is that?
- I'll work, but I won't suffer.
- Here you are, dear.
- Thank you.
Isn't it beautiful, Audrey?
I'll say it is.
I'd give my soul for one like it.
That would be a very bad bargain, Audrey.
All right, that's fine! Tie it off!
You're better with your feet than your broom.
Mr. Ziegfeld, you think so?
I wish you'd give me a chance.
I've got talent.
I'd like to get away from shifting scenery and moving props.
- How long have you been a property boy?
- Five years. But my heart hasn't been in it.
You've been working a long time without your heart.
- That tickle you?
- It does.
And this weekly return tickles me more.
Look, a profit of $5000.
If you'll just be conservative,
I mean, live reasonably.
Don't incur any fresh obligations, forget you have charge accounts...
- ...and you'll soon--
- You're right.
- I will.
- Darling!
Oh, Anna.
Anna.
You're the sweetest husband in the whole world.
Mr. Sampston!
Look.
From my husband.
On our anniversary.
This and this.
Are they not gorgeous diamonds?
Yes, indeed, Miss Held, gorgeous.
Good night, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Good night, Sampston.
He didn't seem very happy about my presents, oui?
Anna, men who keep books are never very happy.
Marie, you go out for a while.
He is my maid tonight. Go, go, go, go.
- Oh, I am, am I?
- Yes, you are.
Later, I count the diamonds in the bracelet and necklace and kiss you for each one.
What about the orchids?
Don't I get anything for them?
For each petal of each orchid, another kiss extra. So....
Take off my stocking, please.
You know, this might get to be a habit.
Flo, you're wonderful.
Do you know that?
I suspect it.
Everything you promise me, you do.
Everything you say will happen, happens.
And now I am a big success in America, thanks to you.
Flo!
Why do you do that when I am trying to say nice things to you?
Besides, you're a very bad mate.
But I love you.
- Flo?
- What?
Flo, are you as happy as I am?
Happier. Why do you ask?
Because sometimes
I think I am too happy.
Sometimes I get afraid it won't be always like this...
...working only for you while you do the show just for me.
Couldn't I do another show without spoiling our happiness?
Of course you could. Don't be silly.
Do you want to do another show?
Well, darling, now that you've made such a tremendous success...
...I have a little idea that I'd like to carry out.
Idea for a show?
- The biggest kind of a show.
- With music and girls?
- Beautiful girls and--
- And without me, oui?
Well, darling, you couldn't do two shows at once, could you?
Now, Anna, see here.
Suppose we go down to Rector's and celebrate our anniversary?
- No, I don't--
- Just us and a bottle of wine.
- I don't feel like it.
- Come on, now, dear.
- No, I'm so nervous.
- It'll be good for you.
I'm so tired.
I'm so disappointed in you
I could scream!
- Now, Anna--
- I mean it.
I thought you loved me more than anything in the world.
I thought I am your one ideal, your only ambition.
- Anna--
- No.
I think only of you, and I thought you will only think of me.
But it is not so.
You have big plans without me.
You will do a big show.
You will go broke again!
Anna, you're jealous.
- No, Flo!
- Yes.
Don't say that, no, no, no!
I hate jealous people, and I don't know what's....
I'm angry, and I wish you would go.
Please, please.
Please go. Go! Go!
Marie!
Marie.
Flo.
- Good morning, Mr. Billings.
- Good morning, Miss Drake. Messages?
Nothing important, except Mr. Erlanger wants to see you today.
Mr. Ziegfeld is in your office.
Well, why in my office instead of out here?
I thought he'd be more comfortable in there.
Well, I-- Oh yes, I see.
To what do I owe the honor of this visit, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Mr. Billings, if you've ever had it in for me, you've certainly avenged yourself.
This is positively the worst cigar I've ever smoked in my life. How are you, Jack?
- All right. How are you?
- Never better. Sit, won't you?
Thank you. Nice of you.
I'm here to do you a great favor.
I'm sorry, I can't take advantage of it.
I'm broke.
That's why I'm hooked up with Erlanger.
Oh, well, that's fine for me.
He's just the man I need.
Jack, I want to do a new show, a big show.
I'm willing to split it 50-50 with Erlanger, and all he has to do is put up the money...
- ...and furnish the theaters.
- Oh, that's all?
That's all.
Of course, you'd furnish the star.
Oh, this isn't for Anna.
Anna's show is all set.
No, in this one...
- ...I want to star the girls.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Without personalities, you haven't got a chance.
I'll have personalities, all right,
Iots of them.
But they'll mostly be blonds and brunettes.
What are you going to call this opera?
I'm going to call it the Ziegfeld Follies.
Follies. Follies, all right.
What's the matter?
That's a good title.
What's so unusual about a girl show?
We've got plenty now.
I don't mean that kind.
They're way out-of-date.
You're using the same scenery you used
20 years ago, wood wings and flats.
I want to do a show with silk drapes, with lace, with beautiful girls.
I won't dress them for the men in the front...
...but for the women in the back.
I want to surround them with glamour, glitter. Glorify them.
Say....
There's a good word, Jack. "Glorify."
Sounds all right if you know what it means.
It'll look all right too.
"Glorifying the American Girl."
Where you gonna find these beautiful girls?
I'll take them from homes, from stores, from shops--
From offices.
I beg your pardon.
Mr. Erlanger would like to see you now.
Oh, all right.
- Yes, well, that'll do, Miss Drake.
- Yes, sir.
Now, listen, Ziggy, not her.
She's the best stenographer I ever had.
- All right, Jack.
- Here, here.
- You will buzz the little giant?
- I'll tell him...
- ...but I doubt he'll be interested.
- He's missing a great opportunity.
Yes, I know.
But, well, I'll drop you a line about it.
Perhaps tomorrow.
Wire me, will you?
Well, if you'd rather hear the sad news sooner, I'll wire.
Yes.
What's that? They won't give us our share of the profits?
All right! Open him in Boston...
...jump him to New Orleans, and then on to Frisco.
Funny thing, Billings.
You just can't be nice to some people.
Yes, that's what I was thinking.
Ziegfeld was just here.
What did he want?
Remember when he stole Anna Held right from under my nose?
Then, so I couldn't get her back, he married her and made enough to retire.
Now he comes back, broke again...
...asking me to ask you for the money to put on a new show!
Well, that's nerve.
What do you want me to do?
Give him the money.
- Cantor and Will Rogers!
- $50 a pair!
- Best show in town!
- Tickets, boys? And gentlemen?
Standing room only.
Come on, girls, come on, come on!
Get up those steps! Come on!
You realize this is opening night?
You take that brace and put it down here!
What is it?
I've only got two minutes.
You ready to go in with those steps?
I've built so many steps for Ziegfeld, they go in by themselves.
- What follows this number?
- The--
I know, Greg Williams.
Have the finale costumes arrived?
Mr. Sampston's talking to the costumer now.
Oh, I see. Trouble again.
You can't do this!
It's an unheard-of procedure!
I'm very sorry, Mr. Sampston,
I want my money.
It's preposterous! Ridiculous!
- No money, no finale costumes.
- It's a holdup! Oh, hello.
You can't do this to Mr. Ziegfeld.
Wait here a minute.
- Allen!
- Yes, sir.
- Where's Ziegfeld?
- Haven't seen him in 10 minutes.
- See if he's in the front.
- Yes, sir.
No, no, I'll go.
No, no, you go.
- No, no, send somebody else.
- Yes, sir. Joe!
Tell him I must see him immediately.
The show depends on it.
This is going to be the death of me.
This is awful.
Wait here for me. You will wait?
You bet I will.
Yes?
- Hello, Sam. How are y'all?
- Mr. Rogers?
You look kind of worried.
What's on your mind, Sam?
I was looking for Mr. Ziegfeld.
Just a minute, Sam.
Mr. Ziegfeld, it's very important.
The costumer's--
Will, the audiences love to hear you talk.
Well, shucks, Flo.
I can't talk any more than I do.
Gotta get the rope tricks in, don't I?
I think they like to hear your wisecracks better.
Perhaps they do, but what will I talk about?
I ain't got anything to say that's funny.
- Mr. Ziegfeld--
- Now wait a minute, Sam.
Your wife tells me you keep her laughing all the time...
...just about things you read in the papers.
I catch on. Betty's been putting you up to this, huh?
Well, I got a sort of a habit of telling her all I know is what I read in the papers...
...and she says that's what I ought to tell the audience.
Just sort of be kind of a running gag item.
- She's right.
- Oh, sure, Betty's always right.
But she don't have to stand on the stage and catch those overripe tomatoes...
- ...if the gag don't work.
- Mr. Ziegfeld, I must interrupt you.
- The finale costumes are here.
- Oh, good.
- Will you do it?
- I might.
- They won't leave without the money.
- Give them a check.
- Will you do it tonight?
- They want the cash.
They sent the costumes for this show COD?
No, sir, not this show.
They want some money on the last show.
Reckon you got your shows mixed up?
Well, I reckon. A little.
If I can help you out on anything, why, let me know.
Thanks, Bill. I'm all right.
Well, tell me if I can.
Of course, I don't suppose it makes a lot of difference, because...
...even with the costumes on, girls in this show...
...ain't exactly overdressed.
You save your wisecracks for the audience, Bill.
- Hey, buddy! Hey!
- Yes?
Your opening night, your big chance, and you're still moving scenery?
I can't help it, Mr. Ziegfeld.
It gets in the blood.
Besides, I don't know how
I'm gonna go over tonight.
I don't wanna lose a job till I'm sure of the other.
When I hired you as an actor,
I fired you as a stagehand.
Better make good.
You'll find yourself without any job.
- Well, what seems to be the trouble?
- No trouble, I hope, except--
Except he's holding us up!
- He refuses to leave the costumes unless--
- Unless he gets some money, and he's right.
Let me see them first.
At once, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Open up the basket.
I tell you, Mr. Ziegfeld, these dresses are wonderful.
The finest work I have ever done.
Look, Mr. Ziegfeld, isn't it stunning?
Perhaps you made a mistake.
This isn't for me.
Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld, for the finale.
Not my finale.
Mr. Schutz, this is the
New Amsterdam Theatre.
This is the Follies.
I know, Mr. Ziegfeld, and this is the costume for the finale.
Well, not for my show.
Why, I couldn't let my girls appear in a thing like that. That's horrible!
Oh, take it away.
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, they were made from the sketches of your own designer.
You yourself made the changes on the sketches when you gave me the order.
I never ordered that. That's terrible!
Take it away, take it out of my theater!
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, I worked over three weeks on these dresses.
I have plenty of money invested in them.
I'm sorry, but I can't help that.
What do you want to do? Disgrace me?
No, no, Mr. Ziegfeld. But please do not disgrace me.
I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld, please let your girls wear my costumes tonight.
No, I wouldn't humiliate them.
If you aren't satisfied, I'll make it up to you, but please don't make me take them back.
All right, but just this once.
Send them up to the dressing rooms.
See me in my office next week.
- Next month.
- Next month.
Thank you very much, Mr. Ziegfeld.
- They are beautiful, aren't they?
- Awfully expensive.
All right, girls, places for the melody number!
He's singing very well tonight, Mr. Ziegfeld.
He's all right, but there's too much white.
Merv, he's too white.
Bring up the pink in your footlights.
Are the steps high enough for you this time, Mr. Ziegfeld?
No, I don't think so.
We could use more, a lot more.
- I'd like to see them higher.
- How's that, Mr. Ziegfeld?
That's perfect now.
Keep it that way the rest of the number.
Ain't that something?
Don't you like your flowers, honey lamb?
- They're beautiful. Was there a card?
- Oh, sure. Here it is.
And there was a package too.
I done unwrapped it for you.
- You've done looked at it too, I suppose.
- Oh, no, honey lamb, I never.
- Pour me a drink, Flossie.
- Another? Ain't you all forgetting...
...you got a midnight show to do on the roof tonight?
And ain't you all forgetting to pour that drink?
Well, scratch my back, honey.
Is them diamonds, or is them stars?
- Who sent them to you, honey lamb?
- Who do you think?
I know.
They's from Mr. Zieg--
- Here he is.
- Tell him to come in.
Yes'm.
Audrey.
- You were beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.
Flossie, pour us a drink.
No, no, no, please, dear, no.
I just came to tell you--
Somebody else thought you were beautiful too, oui?
From an old friend.
Not too old, I hope.
What a beautiful bracelet, Audrey.
Is this from your old friend too?
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's charming!
You know, your friend must have very good taste...
...because this is just the sort of jewelry Flo would like.
I told you someday you will have lots of diamonds, didn't I?
Yes, you did.
And I told you
I wouldn't suffer, remember?
Yes...
...I do.
Well, congratulations again, Audrey.
I'll see you later.
On the roof, oui?
She's really quite beautiful, Flo, oui?
- Yes, she is, isn't she?
- You're very much interested in her, oui?
I'm interested in all my girls, dear.
But maybe a tiny, little bit more in her, oui?
A lot more.
- She's very unusual.
- Yes.
I could make a great star out of her, if she'd only let me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
On behalf of the rest of the company,
I've been asked to make a little speech.
Well, you see,
I have a confession to make.
Little Audrey is a wee bit tight tonight.
No, but seriously, you really shouldn't applaud all of us...
...because everything we've done we owe to Flo.
You see, I was just a little chorus girl when Flo discovered me.
He taught me how to walk and how to dress...
...and how to smile.
So....
Well....
Here's to Flo.
I am afraid you must forgive
Miss Lane tonight.
She just passed through many weeks of very tedious rehearsals.
And the nervous strain of an opening night.
She's not really herself.
On behalf of my company,
I want to thank you.
You've been very kind to my girls and my stars.
And speaking of stars...
...there's a young lady here tonight who, in my opinion...
...is destined to reach the top of her profession.
She doesn't work for me,
I'm sorry to say...
...but I'm very proud of her. She's here tonight with her producer, lucky fellow.
And if she will, I'm going to ask
Sally Manners to take a bow.
Sally Manners.
Nice of him to pay my star a tribute, isn't it?
Yes, it is. I hope you've got her on a long contract.
- Are you ready, Mr. Ziegfeld?
- All ready.
Now, you'll be signing the contract but look in the camera.
The picture wouldn't be right without the Manners smile.
All right?
All right, shoot!
Those things horrify me.
- I think we're both to be congratulated.
- I feel it's a great opportunity.
- Thank you.
- Sage, if you'll take Miss Manners...
...and the boys into your office,
I'm sure she'll have things to say.
- I could tell them how happy I am now.
- May I congratulate you?
- Thank you.
- Right this way, Miss Manners.
- Ms. Manners....
- Come along now, boys.
- Where's that girl you said was my friend?
- Here I am.
I didn't want to disturb you.
You told them out there that you were a friend of mine, huh?
Yes, I did.
Well, I see.
Just to get into my office, huh?
- Smart girl.
- Well, I am a friend of yours.
Have you forgotten me?
No, no, of course not. I....
I remember you very well.
Who am I?
- As if I didn't know.
- Do you?
Of course. I always remember the time, the place and the girl.
It was....
- Atlantic City.
- Nope.
- No?
- No.
Well, that's funny. I seem to remember a chair on a boardwalk...
...you beside me and....
Are you sure it wasn't Atlantic City?
It might have been Atlantic City, but it wasn't me.
Now I remember!
Why, it was right here in this office.
You came up to see me about a year ago.
Oh, now it all comes back to me.
Well, how are you?
Where have you been?
No.
- No?
- No. You don't seem to remember...
...the time, the place or the girl.
Well....
Perhaps this will help you.
Mary Lou!
Well, how's my girl?
How's my fella?
Well, my little Mary Lou is a big girl now, isn't she?
Yes!
Yes, indeed, a very big girl.
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- Yes, I certainly am!
Even if I wasn't at Atlantic City with you?
Don't be silly.
I knew you all the time.
Now, fibber....
- Well, how long you been in New York?
- One day.
- One day. You seen my father lately?
- Yes, just before I left.
Oh, that reminds me, he told me to give you a big kiss.
Well.
You know, I think that in all fairness...
- ...I should tell you I am a married man now.
- Yes, I know. I read about it.
It nearly broke my heart.
But being married in New York doesn't mean anything, does it?
Oh, yes, it does, young lady.
Now, why are you here, and what can I do for you?
Well, first of all, I want to give you a big kiss for all the candy you sent me.
You've already done that twice.
Now, what else?
- Well, I want to go into the Follies.
- You do?
- I've been taking dancing lessons two years.
- Yeah?
- How do your father and mother feel?
- I haven't a father and mother anymore.
I'm so sorry, my dear.
Of course, Jimmy won't like it.
- Who's Jimmy?
- Just another fellow I've been engaged to.
Oh, well....
- All right, I think we can look after you.
- Do you think we can have dinner tonight?
Well, no, no, I'm afraid we can't.
- Oh, Alice!
- Yes, sir.
Take this lady down to the stage and tell
Julian to put her on as an extra dancer.
- For the time being.
- Oh, gee, thank you!
Mary Lou is an old friend of mine from Chicago, and she's a stranger here.
- So I'd like you to sort of look after her.
- Yes, sir.
- This way, dear.
- Oh, may I say one thing before I go?
- Well, yes, of course. What?
- I forgive you for not marrying me.
- All right. Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.
- Hello. Pardon me. Hello, Alice.
- Say, Flo!
I know! You got a new song.
I'll say we have.
Play him the melody, Danny.
Oh, you'll go crazy over this, Flo.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
I must interrupt you.
This is important.
- I got an idea.
- How much will it save?
- This has nothing to do with money.
- Feeling all right?
My usual headache, but this is about talent.
- Good and cheap, no doubt?
- Exactly. A young lady, the name of Brice.
- Fannie Brice. She's working in burlesque.
- I've seen that gal, Flo.
- Pretty?
- Well, yes and no.
Shut your eyes and listen, yes.
Open them and look, no.
- But a great performer.
- We should see her at once, tonight.
- Shall I take your coat?
- Why not? You bought it for me.
I gave it to you because you've been behaving yourself this week.
What are you going to give me next week?
- Watch the show.
- I don't see how you can find...
...great stars in a place like this.
Some of our greatest stars have come from places like this.
Well, of course, not being a star yet,
I wouldn't know.
You can, if you behave yourself.
- What's on now, Fannie?
- Jim Boss.
- If that guy's funny, I'll be a--
- That guy's gonna be a big star someday.
- He can make you laugh and make you cry.
- Yeah, and he can make me sick.
Comics bore me.
You give me a pain in the neck too, always telling me who's gonna be a great star.
Once in burlesque, always in burlesque.
Unless you got looks or a voice or something.
- Well, that's what I got, kid.
- What?
- Something.
- On the level...
...you don't hope to get out of burlesque?
You're good here because these people are from 10th Avenue.
How good do you think you'd be on Fifth Avenue?
Half as good.
Another silk stocking gone.
I'll never buy anything from those stage-door peddlers again.
That's what you said before.
What'd you let the fella in for? Here.
He told the stage doorman his name was Belasco.
And you thought it was the Mr. Belasco, the producer.
- Calling personally to see you?
- Well, maybe I was a little optimistic.
Miss Brice,
Mr. Ziegfeld is here to see you.
Another peddler.
First it's Belasco, now it's Ziegfeld.
Tell Mr. Ziegfeld I'm not in, and if
I was in, tell him I wouldn't see him.
And if I did see him, tell him I wouldn't buy a thing.
- Yes, miss.
- Thank you.
Miss Brice?
I hope I'm not intruding.
- I'm Florenz Ziegfeld.
- Is that so?
Sarah, this is Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is Sarah Bernhardt.
Not the Sarah Bernhardt?
Well....
- A pleasure to run into you.
- If you run into your friend Belasco...
...tell him about the runs in his stockings.
- Do you know David Belasco?
- Better than you know Ziegfeld.
Well, come on, what do you want for it?
I'm not interested.
Miss Brice, I am here to offer you a great opportunity.
That's what they all say.
What kind of fur is this?
This?
- That's mink.
- That so?
And what's the price?
Well, the original cost was $2700.
Who cares from originals?
Copies is just as good.
Come on, I'll try it on.
Yes, of course.
As a matter of fact, it ought to fit you very well.
Don't give me the talk, just tell me the price.
I don't wanna buy it, but I'll give you $50 for it.
- And not a cent more.
- Miss Brice, the coat is yours.
- Stuck again.
- Fannie! Are you really gonna buy it?
If I can give Belasco 4 dollars for silk stockings made of cotton...
...I can give Ziegfeld more for a mink coat made of skunk.
Besides, a bargain's a bargain.
Here.
Here's your $40.
Get out before I change my mind.
Thank you.
Fannie!
- Fannie!
- What?
Fannie, look!
- What? Moths already?
- No, feel! It's real mink.
How do you know?
I've been promised one often enough to tell.
It's real mink, all right.
It's probably stolen goods.
- You mean it's hot?
- Of course it's warm.
- Then I'll be arrested if I keep it?
- Of course you will.
Call the stage manager!
Call the police! Call my mother!
Come in.
Message for Miss Brice.
You read it. I'm dying.
"Dear Fannie Brice.
I can't accept your $40, but you can please me by accepting the coat.
I shall expect you at my office in the New Amsterdam tomorrow...
...as I want to engage you for the Follies.
Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."
Fannie, it was him!
It was Ziegfeld!
How do you like that?
I like it.
Fannie! Fannie!
Have you fainted?
Can't you see I have, you chump?
Get me some whiskey!
- Oh, Miss Brice?
- Yes, sir?
- We're ready for you.
- I'm coming right down.
Yes, sir, I'll be right down.
I'm coming as fast as I can.
I thought I had more time.
Don't lose your nerve, kid.
This is your big chance.
Be a trouper!
Look at you. You're working for Ziegfeld now.
And you look like a million dollars.
For the first time in your life, you're class, you mug.
Wait a minute! Ho!
What in the--? Fannie!
What in the world are you made up for?
Veronica? Clarence?
Anything I can do, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Yes. Come here, will you?
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Will you rip off that train?
- But, Mr. Ziegfeld!
- Go ahead.
Take off the hat.
Get rid of this boa constrictor.
Now, will you get me a shawl?
An old shawl.
Yes, sir.
How do you expect Miss Brice to sing a sad song about her man...
...dressed up like a nightingale?
I find personalities, you try to destroy them.
I didn't engage Miss Brice as a showgirl.
- Is that all right, Mr. Ziegfeld?
- Well, that's all right for now.
Tomorrow, buy her another outfit.
Go to a secondhand store and get her an old dress.
She's supposed to be an apache, a poor French girl, an urchin.
So to work for Ziegfeld,
I gotta be an urchin.
Even in burlesque,
I was middle class.
Now...
...let me see this, Fannie.
Fannie?
Sing the song. Now!
Vic? All right. Let's go.
If she can turn those tears on in front of an audience, she'll be a sensation.
Look.
Look at the girls.
Mr. Ziegfeld, shall we get back to that conference?
The boys are still waiting, you know.
Yeah, yeah. Tell them I'll be right up.
She's all right.
She's gonna be great.
- Who's that?
- Brice. Fannie Brice.
- I've got a great spot for her in this show.
- And I discovered her!
That's right, Sam, and you deserve a raise.
And I'd give it to him, but I'm afraid he wouldn't approve of the expense.
- How's it look, Gene?
- It's the best we've ever done.
You're the best author.
Herbert's the best composer.
Julian's the best director. Joe's the best artist. Sam's the best bookkeeper.
I'm dying to hear it.
Every line he writes is a laugh.
We open on a street in Cairo.
Didn't I tell you every line was a laugh?
We open on a street in Cairo.
Along comes a man leading an elephant.
Wait just a minute, Gene.
- Can you boys stand a shock?
- Well, what do you mean, Flo?
I hate to tell you this because
I know how hard you've worked....
- But I've decided not to do another Follies.
- What?
I'm going on with this new edition with Brice...
...but after that I wanna do a story.
Something with a plot.
Something with all the glamour of the Follies, around a sweet, simple story.
Something that will fit this little girl
Sally Manners.
We might call it Sally.
Oh, Jerry.
Hello, Flo. How are you?
- I was just thinking of you.
- It's nice to be thought of.
- Hello, boys.
- Hello.
Remember that melody you played at my house a few weeks ago?
- I played several.
- And they were all beautiful.
But this one was.... You remember?
You were going to send it to me.
Oh, I know.
"Look for the Silver Lining."
That's the one. Come on, play it.
Do you mind?
Sure, I will.
I've got the lyrics right here.
Fine. Get this.
"Look for the Silver Lining."
See what I mean?
That's what I want.
A story just as simple and sweet as that tune.
Sing it, Jerry, will you?
Ziegfeld...
...these gentlemen are pestering me about money for scenery, costumes and whatnot.
And I wanna tell you in their presence,
I have no interest in this show...
...and in no way am I concerned with it.
Our agreement is for Ziegfeld Follies and nothing else.
You understand that, gentlemen?
Nothing else.
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is very unpleasant at a rehearsal...
...but we insist on at least 50 percent of our money before opening.
- We are selling a lot of tickets.
- Sampston, that's our best proposition.
- Mr. Ziegfeld, we're ready for the finale.
- All right, Benny.
Boys, what are you worried about?
Have I started anything I couldn't finish?
Don't my curtains always go up?
Why, if I owed you 100 times the amount I do, you'd get it.
- Come to me tomorrow, I'll pay you.
- 50 percent, Mr. Ziegfeld.
A hundred percent if you want it.
Maybe I can give you an advance on the Eddie Cantor show.
I'm doing a story with him too.
Eddie Cantor?
How are you gonna do it?
- I don't know.
- Finale.
Mr. Ziegfeld, Audrey Dane is visiting backstage...
...and she brought a lot of champagne with her.
- Well....
- Yes, sir?
Never mind.
- It looks very good, the show, huh?
- Yes, it's wonderful, really.
- I'll be back in a moment, darling.
- All right.
Hello.
I wanna see every one of you in my office in the morning.
Get out.
Audrey, you know I've forbidden drinking in the dressing rooms.
Oh, Flo, don't be mad at me.
I just asked the girls up to have a drink.
It isn't their fault.
You see, it's my f--
Now, Audrey, please.
Please stand up now.
I can't. I wanna get down, but I can't get down.
Lift me, Flo.
Audrey.
Oh, don't put me down.
Don't put me down.
Audrey, you've broken your last promise to me.
Flo!
You should have at least closed the door.
Wait!
Anna!
Anna, please don't misjudge me.
I couldn't help it.
She's drunk.
Do you always do that when she's drunk?
The members of your company must enjoy that very much.
Oh, Anna, don't say that.
Don't you understand, dear?
When one of my girls--
Poor Flo. You have so much trouble with your girls, oui?
Anna!
Aren't you going to eat your grapefruit, sir?
No, nothing, Sidney.
Well, we know now why she didn't come home last night.
I'm sorry, sir.
- Did you send the flowers?
- The minute I learned the address.
- A dozen orchids as usual.
- Good.
Mr. Sampston called again, sir.
He says the bank positively refuses to increase your loans.
- Thank you, Sidney.
- Yes, sir.
- Miss Dane, sir.
- Here?
Undoubtedly she's read the paper, sir.
Show her in, Sidney.
Well, Flo, congratulations.
- On what?
- I just saw the headline.
I don't think I'm to be congratulated,
Audrey.
Little Audrey is speaking out of turn again.
- And I was a bad girl last night too.
- I don't think you should have come here.
So that's how you feel.
- Going to Atlantic City tonight?
- No.
- Isn't the show opening there tomorrow?
- No.
Broke again?
Yes, broke again.
- Please don't turn the elephant, Audrey.
- Afraid I'll spoil your luck?
So...
...nobody thinks enough of your new star to loan you money.
I don't blame them.
Why didn't you star me in the show?
You, with all your promises.
"Audrey, if you'll just behave yourself,
I'll put your name on Broadway."
"Audrey, if you'll only stop drinking,
I'll have great shows written for you."
Why didn't you make me a great star?
- I couldn't depend on you, as I could on--
- Yes!
Well, all right. Depend on her now.
Go on, star her.
Do anything you like with her.
I hate you!
I'm never gonna see you again.
I'm quitting you and your show.
I hope you don't get the money to open it.
And if you do, I hope it's a flop!
That's how I feel about you!
And this is how I feel about your elephant!
- Sidney?
- Yes, sir?
Take a wire to Mr. Billings.
Will that be all, Mr. Billings?
Yes, that'll be all, thank you.
- Miss Jones, take care of that right away.
- Yes, sir.
I got another telegram from Ziegfeld.
He can't open his show unless we help him.
We won't help him.
I told him so yesterday.
I'm not interested, and I won't loan him 5 cents.
- Send him a wire--
- I just did.
- Did what?
- Wired him the money.
Isn't that Mr. Ziegfeld?
Say, Flo, why don't you go put on the costume...
- ...and get into the spirit of the dance.
- I'm tired, Gene.
Come on, Flo.
Don't lose interest in everything.
No, I'm going home.
Good night.
- Let me have that megaphone, honey.
- Yes, sir.
- Willie.
- Flo, you're not leaving.
- Yes, I am.
- We're starting a Paul Jones inside...
...and I promise whenever you get a pretty girl, I'll blow the whistle.
Not tonight, Willie.
Say, who is that girl with the gorgeous red hair?
Why, that's Billie Burke.
Thanks, Willie.
- Good evening, Jack.
- How do you do? Come on.
Willie.
- Yes, Flo?
- I'm staying for the Paul Jones.
Whenever you see me with Miss Burke, blow the whistle.
Okay.
Take your places for the Paul Jones, everybody.
The Paul Jones!
- Well, do you think we ought to? I--
- Oh, yes. I love the Paul Jones.
- Perhaps we could both go the same way.
- No, we can't do that!
Oh, Well, I....
Miss Burke.
Mister...?
It doesn't matter.
Oh, no, I'm supposed to--
I've got to-- We're not--
- Oh, no, this is our dance.
- Oh, is it?
- Miss Burke.
- We meet again, Mister...?
It still doesn't matter.
Won't you tell me?
- Tell you what?
- Your name.
- Why don't you ask Mr. Billings.
- I will, if I can find him.
But you seem to stand in with the whistle.
Oh, yes, when I was a little boy,
I used to love to whistle...
...and a whistle never forgets.
- Aren't you getting bored?
- No. Are you?
- I'm afraid not.
- Tired?
- Are you?
- No, but I'd much rather just talk.
- Would you mind?
- No.
Don't you love the lights of New York?
For me, they're more beautiful than any landscape.
- More beautiful than the mountains?
- Yes, I think so.
- Are you too cold out here?
- No, indeed. I'm enjoying it.
That is, I....
I mean, the electric signs fascinate me.
"Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Fleischmann's
Yeast, Ziegfeld's Follies."
- Do you know Ziegfeld?
- No, I don't want to.
- I understand he's a horrible person.
- Horrible?
Yes, they say he's a terrible lady's man.
Well, I suppose that's forgivable.
He's surrounded by so many beautiful women.
Yes, yes.
Strange you've never met him.
I don't want to. I love his shows.
They're so beautiful and in such good taste.
It would disappoint me to meet him...
...and find him to be a fat, pudgy man with a big stomach.
He's not fat and not really so pudgy.
- No? You know him?
- Oh, yes.
Yes. He would like you.
- How do you know?
- Didn't you just say he had good taste?
Well, you're sort of a lady's man yourself, aren't you?
I think with you as the lady,
I could make Ziegfeld look like an amateur.
- You haven't told me your name yet.
- If you don't mind, Mr. Ziegfeld...
...Miss Burke, with the permission of her producer...
...came here with me tonight.
And if you've no objection,
I'd like to have one dance.
Mr. Ziegfeld? Well, you were right.
He isn't pudgy.
- Shall we go in?
- Yes!
- Don't I get one more dance?
- I'm afraid not.
I imagine it's Mr. Frohman you're really afraid of, isn't it?
- Oh, I'm....
- Perhaps.
He doesn't want you to appear too much socially.
Frankly, no, he doesn't.
And you don't like me very well anyway, do you?
- Frankly, no, I don't.
- No. She doesn't!
You put him in his place, all right.
What would Gen. Grant think if he knew we were using...
...the very shadow of his tomb as our meeting place?
Well, I never knew the general personally, but I have an idea he'd approve.
I don't know. Nobody else seems to.
At least, Mr. Frohman doesn't.
And why not?
Why can't we meet where we like?
Go where we want?
Just because he has you under contract...
...is no reason he should dictate your personal life.
- I'm here.
- Yes, and so am I.
But it must seem like kindergarten to you.
Why?
The great Mr. Ziegfeld, producer of the Follies...
...surrounded by hundreds of beautiful women...
...sitting on a bench, holding hands...
...watching the riverboats go back and forth.
- Doesn't sound a bit like you, does it?
- No, it doesn't.
But here I am, sitting on a bench...
...holding hands and watching the riverboats go back and forth.
And regretting all the years
I haven't known you.
Didn't Anna Held take up a few of those years?
Yes, Billie, she did.
She was truly a wonderful woman.
I love you for saying that.
Look, there's another ferryboat going across to the Palisades.
Will you keep your eyes on it while I tell you something?
Must I look at a ferryboat to listen to you?
Yes, or I won't be able to tell you.
You mean the great lady's man is bashful?
Strange as it may seem, in your presence, he is.
All right, I'm looking.
I love you, Billie.
The ferryboat.
I haven't anything to offer you, because there's nothing you really seem to need.
You've made the most of yourself unassisted, and that's grand.
Ferryboat.
You're a great star already, so there's little I can offer you.
Nothing I can give you, except my love.
That isn't enough.
I'd expect part of your ambition, half of your trouble...
...two-thirds of your worries and all of your respect.
Here's your medicine, madame.
No, thank you, Marie.
I'm tired of it.
- But, madame....
- No, no, no, no.
Perhaps you would like to go to Paris?
No, I'm too tired to go anywhere and to do anything.
Marie....
Look at the paper...
...and tell me where did they go on their honeymoon?
But they couldn't go anywhere, madame.
Miss Burke is appearing in a play here.
We saw her only two weeks ago.
You insisted, madame.
You remember.
Oui, I know. And we enjoyed it very much too.
She's a lovely actress, Marie, oui?
She has such twinkling eyes...
...and such a funny little twitter when she speaks.
Yes, I can well imagine
Flo being in love with her.
Marie?
Call his office.
I will congratulate him.
Hello? Brian 3093, please.
I should wish him luck, oui?
- Oui, I should.
- Mr. Ziegfeld, please.
- Miss Anna Held speaking.
- No, Marie, hang up!
- I cannot speak with him today!
- Mr. Ziegfeld?
He's on the telephone, madame.
He is?
Hello, Flo.
Yes, here's Anna.
I'm so happy for you today.
I could not help but call on you and congratulate you.
Wonderful, Flo.
Never better in my whole life.
I'm so excited about my new plans.
I'm going to Paris.
Yes, for a few weeks, and then I can get back...
...and then I'm doing a new show, and I--
Oui, it's all so wonderful.
I'm so happy.
Yes, and I hope you are happy too.
Yes?
I'm so glad for you, Flo.
It sounds funny for ex-husband and ex-wife to tell each other how happy they are, oui?
Yes, Flo.
Goodbye, Flo.
Goodbye.
If you love him so much, why did you divorce him?
Because I thought it would bring him back to me.
I was sure that it would bring him back to me.
Goody, goody, goody!
Is that all for me?
That certainly is, every bit for you.
And that isn't all. Sidney?
Yes, sir?
Now, if you don't like the view from this side...
- ...then--
- I don't.
- That's the chimney Santa came down.
- Yes!
- That's where the reindeer stopped.
- I wonder how they kept from sliding off.
Probably the bricks stopped them.
See, Mommy, it's almost big enough for me to get in.
- It is!
- It's almost big enough for us all to get in.
- Oh, yes! Sidney....
- Yes, sir?
Hasn't Santa Claus brought the elephant yet?
Not yet, sir, but he, she-- It may be here at any moment, sir.
- You didn't buy an elephant?
- I did.
- A live elephant, Daddy?
- A great big, live elephant.
I beg your pardon, sir, madam.
In behalf of the help, and as their spokesman...
...I wish to express our thanks for your thoughtfulness and generosity...
...and to wish you a very merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
- That's very nice, Sidney.
And may we wish a very merry Christmas to all of you.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam.
Merry Christmas.
And to you, Miss Patricia.
Same to you, Sidney.
Now, how about opening your presents?
With all this extravagance,
I'm a little afraid to.
Nonsense, darling, that's what Christmas is for.
Come on, now.
- Oh, Flo.
- Now.
- This isn't all for me?
- Well, who else?
- I don't know which one to open first.
- Well, suppose you try this one.
Oh, Flo!
A crown of diamonds.
How beautiful.
This proves that America is not a republic.
Because you are the queen, and queens always wear crowns.
A bracelet for the regal wrist.
A pendant for the royal throat.
- And....
- Flo!
A cloak for Her Majesty's shoulders.
- Darling!
- And....
- Oh, no, Flo. Nothing else!
- Yes.
A kiss from her most humble subject.
Darling!
Oh, everything's so lovely.
- But you shouldn't have done so much.
- Oh, well, I....
I hadn't anything to do with it.
It was Santa Claus.
He brought everything.
Yes, I know, but Santa Claus was far too extravagant.
You should take some of it back.
Oh, Mama, I don't want Santa Claus to take back any of my presents.
Don't worry, he won't.
No, and he won't take back any of your mama's either.
I'd cry if he took my circus back.
- You would?
- Why, darling?
- You like it better than your other presents?
- But I wish it was a real, live circus.
Well, I guess you'll have to do a circus, Flo.
Could you, Daddy?
Well, I don't know. Let's see.
I've never had any experience with circuses.
But I can try.
I'll tell you what. Let's make a chorus in front of these two wagons.
Who's this fellow? That's the ringmaster in the center, where a ringmaster should be.
Now, we'll put these two acrobats up next to him...
...then we'll put this Tyrollean fellow there. Put the clown next to him.
He's a funny fellow, and there's the lion-tamer.
Gosh, I bet he's a brave fellow too.
And there's the drum major.
And here is the strongman.
We'll call him Sandow.
- And who is this?
- Well, that's....
Oh! Of course.
That's little Harriet Hoctor.
I've always wanted to give her a chance.
I'll tell you what. Now, you hold her for a minute, and we'll bring her on later. Now...
...let's put it all back of a curtain, just as I do in the theater.
Now, this is the curtain.
- What's the laugh, Jack?
- This article on Ziegfeld.
Says he's broke and can't borrow a nickel from any bank.
He wouldn't have to borrow if he'd commercialized.
He'd never send out a number two company.
He wanted the public to see his best production.
Why doesn't he stick to his Follies?
That other show is terrible.
- Guess the old boy's washed-up.
- He's been slipping for years.
- White and Carroll have got it all over him.
- Bob....
Let me have a cold towel, will you?
Well, the guy's getting old.
Yeah, and broke. He won't have another hit on Broadway.
- Isn't someone making a theater for him?
- Yeah. It's to be his monument.
It's about time.
He could use a monument.
- I don't know you fellows.
- You got nothing on me. I don't know you.
You ought to. You've been burying me for five minutes. I'm Ziegfeld. You're right.
I'm not gonna have another hit on Broadway. I'm gonna have four.
Four at one time.
You get that? Four!
And all hits.
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld!
You forgot your tie.
He's gonna have four hits, and he hasn't got a tie left.
Flo.
Darling.
Why did you come upstairs without saying hello? Are you trying to elude me?
Well, I'm not feeling very well, dear.
Poor darling. You're just tired.
Where's your tie?
What do you think of that? I....
I must have left it in the barbershop this afternoon.
And you've been around without it ever since?
Darling, that isn't like you.
What's wrong, Flo?
Billie, I'm all through.
- Through with what?
- Everything. I'm slipping. I'm...
...getting old.
And who told you that?
- Three men in the barbershop.
- That's why you forgot your tie.
Yes, I've never done anything like that in my whole life.
Isn't that tragic? For the first time in your long career, you forgot a tie.
It's a calamity.
- Who were those men, Flo?
- I don't know. I never saw them before.
They said I'd never produce another hit.
And what did you say?
I told them I'd have four on Broadway at the same time.
- Sounds more like you.
- Yeah, but it was only a bluff.
I'm sorry, dear.
I don't mean to worry you.
Where's Patricia?
She's having her dinner.
- You came home very late, dear.
- Yes, dear. I'm sorry. I....
I've been so worried.
The play is such a terrible failure.
But you're not, darling.
Afraid I am.
- Well, shall we have some dinner?
- Flo.
I'm disappointed in you.
I didn't think you'd ever lose confidence in yourself.
But I must be the failure, not you.
- Oh, Billie.
- No, I mean it, darling.
Before we were married...
...you never thought of failure even when you were broke.
It was your sublime superiority more than anything else...
...that made me admire you so much.
Please don't change, Flo.
Don't let Patricia and me become a worry to you.
We don't expect you to reduce your life to just us.
I want you to go right on being just as you always were.
I would never be jealous...
...because with your love of beauty, you could never be cheap or common.
So in whatever you do...
...you need never fear me.
And what is more important...
...don't be afraid of yourself.
I'm not gonna be afraid, Billie.
All right, young man.
I'll give you a chance to prove it.
In my vault, I have all the jewelry you've ever given me...
...even the queen's crown...
...and some very good bonds.
They're all yours...
...on one condition.
That you keep your promise to those three men and have four hits on Broadway.
- Is that a bargain?
- Oh, Billie.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Just a minute.
Mr. Ziegfeld, it's Police Inspector Doyle.
He says it's important.
- Why didn't you say so? Send him in.
- All right.
All right, Mr. Doyle.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Hello, inspector.
- We got them, all right.
- You did? That's wonderful.
It is wonderful, with the descriptions you gave us.
- Where are they?
- Right outside.
- Bring them in.
- All right, sir.
Bring those birds in here.
- Here they are.
- What's going on?
- Pipe down, pipe down.
- What's the charge against these men?
- Murder.
- Murder?
Yes, murder.
About a year ago, these three gentlemen killed me and buried me.
- Killed? Buried?
- Yes. In a Times Square barbershop.
- Remember?
- Oh, yes, I remember. Don't you?
Now, I'm going to give each of you a box to all four of my shows.
Four hits, all in one season.
And then I want you to tell me whether or not you still think I'm washed-up.
I'm sorry, but this is the only way
I could locate you.
I knew that if you were to be found at all,
Inspector Doyle was the one to do it.
Sam, have Goldie take their reservations for whatever nights they wish.
- Good day, gentlemen.
- This way.
- Thank you.
- That's getting even with a vengeance.
That's not a bad ending for a practical joke, is it?
Goldie, take these gentlemen's names and addresses.
Don't you realize what you may have let yourself in for?
- What?
- They can sue you for false arrest.
- And the police department.
- Don't you realize we have nothing...
- ...to worry about anymore?
- I hope so.
No need to hope.
You know what I've been doing?
- What?
- Buying stocks. I've bought over a million.
- Outright?
- No, on margin.
But all solid securities.
When I've paid for them, I'm gonna buy another million and another.
- Sam, I'm going to be really rich.
- I hope you're right, sir.
But the market's been behaving very queerly these last few days.
- Yes?
- Croydon & Company on the phone.
- Put them on.
- Been trying to get you.
They're my broker. Hello? Speaking.
Oh. Well, what happened?
Down 20 to 40 points?
How much?
- Three hundred thousand?!
- What is it?
Oh, no, no, no! Don't do that!
I'll cover. I'll get the money to you in just a little while.
- Will you put Holloway on the phone?
- Flo, what is it?
The market, Sam, it's crashed.
I've got to get $300,000 in cash, immediately.
- How are we gonna do it?
- I don't know.
- Maybe I could borrow it from a bank.
- On what?
On your shows.
It's too late. I've already mortgaged the shows for the first payments on the stock.
What's that?
But you've got to locate him!
Yes, I'll cover. I'll get the money to you in a while. Just hold the wire.
- Sam, get Billings.
- Yes, sir.
Try his house, his office, anywhere, but get Billings!
Mr. Nagus, we haven't received your check, and your margin's wiped out.
Hello, Mr. Billings. I'll be right with you.
No, we can't, Mr. Nagus.
I'm sorry, but we can't hold your stocks any longer.
Mr. Billings, we've had to sell you out too.
Well, that takes me back to my second childhood consistently.
I was a poor kid when I started.
- Mr. Ziegfeld's on number six for you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Billings.
Hello? Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Yes, we had to sell you out about half an hour ago.
Yes.
I know it is, and I'm terribly sorry.
- I didn't know Ziegfeld was in the market.
- Yes, very heavy.
- He'll lose everything.
- Everything?
Everything.
Well, this is one time he can't get it from me.
Yes, madam. Yes, madam, it is.
The doctor left about 10 minutes ago, madam.
He seemed very happy about Mr. Ziegfeld.
Said he might stay up for a while longer.
Oh, he did so enjoy sitting up to dinner with you and Miss Patricia.
- No, madam.
- But don't let him stay up too long.
Yes, I know, but the more he rests, the sooner he'll be well again.
And tell him I'll be home immediately after the performance.
- It's time for your entrance, Miss Burke.
- Yes, yes.
Sidney, be sure to call me right after the second act.
Yes, about 10:05.
Yes, madam.
Madam was very happy about you, sir.
Oh, my poor Billie.
I wish she weren't working.
But it does help some, Sidney.
- Get those wires off as quickly as you can.
- Yes, sir.
Were you able to reach
Eddie Cantor by phone?
The Los Angeles operator's been trying for some time, sir.
Tell her to keep on trying.
- Sidney?
- Yes, sir?
When you get him...
...tell him that I want him for a new show.
Tell him I'll start rehearsals the instant he can get away from those pictures.
Tell him I need him.
- I haven't had a real show in two years.
- Yes, sir.
- Wasn't that the bell, Sidney?
- Yes, sir.
Well, why don't you answer it.
Yes, sir.
- Mr. Billings.
- Hello, Sidney.
How's Mr. Ziegfeld?
Well, he's much improved, sir, but he's very nervous.
He will be glad to see you, sir.
If we could get him started on a new show, sir.
- Yeah.
- I mean to say, if he had the money, sir.
Yes, well, we'll see that he gets it.
My valet isn't as efficient as you used to be, Sidney.
He lets me neglect things.
All right for me to see him?
- Yes, sir. I wouldn't stay too long.
- No, no, no.
Well, hello, Ziggy.
How are you feeling?
Hello, Jack.
I'm feeling much better.
- Thank you. Sit down, won't you?
- Yes.
Let me look at you.
I don't think you've been sick. Just playing possum so your creditors can't find you.
No.
No creditors.
No. No creditors.
- When are you gonna be up and around?
- Well...
- ...pretty soon now, I hope.
- Hurry up.
I'm expecting you to go to Europe with me.
Oh. Well, when are you sailing?
In a couple of weeks.
We'll stop off at Monte Carlo.
You can break the bank again.
And then we'll go to London. Maybe we can find some new talent together.
Does it interest you?
Yes. Yes, I'd like to go to London.
Yeah? Why?
- You got someone in mind?
- No.
- Why, have you?
- No.
But I wouldn't tell you if I had, not if you were 10 times as sick as you are.
Oh, those were great old days, Jack.
Yeah.
Remember the fair?
Do I. Little Egypt.
- Sandow.
- Yeah, and then Anna Held.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ziggy.
Why is it, Jack, that in a world so old...
...life must be so short?
Short? I feel as if
I'd been here 1000 years.
And I'm gonna stay 1000 more.
And you'd feel the same way if you'd snap out of it and get a new show started.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like to do another Follies.
Why don't you do it.
Don't you think it's about time that you and I split 50-50 in something?
I'd love to, Jack.
But it'll take a lot of money.
I've never refused you before, have I?
No, but...
...that was all in the dark ages.
Before the Depression, I mean.
- I heard that the market got you.
- Me? Why, I.... Don't be silly.
I'm too smart for any stock market.
Oh, I lost a couple of thousand or so, but I got out in time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
How about you? Did it get you?
Oh, no. No, I....
I never played the market.
Oh, I may have dropped a few hundred, maybe...
...but nothing to speak of.
Well, how much money do you suppose it'll take, Ziggy?
- A couple of hundred thousand.
- A couple of hundred thousand?
Well, okay, it's a deal.
Pull yourself together, get well, and I'll give you money.
Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Doesn't that make you feel better, sir?
Yes, that makes me feel much better.
Jack...
...you're a real person.
Yeah, well, you're....
You're not a bad sort yourself, Ziggy.
Well, I'll drop in tomorrow.
Yes. Do that.
And, Ziggy, if you just put your mind to it,
I think you'll be up and around in a week.
Don't let me rush you, because while you're here convalescing...
...I'll be picking out the gals for the new show.
- Well, he looks all right to me, Sidney.
- Undoubtedly he will be, sir.
Thanks to you.
I hope so.
Take good care of him, Sidney.
Because if anything happened to Ziggy, I....
Well, take good care of him.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
I wouldn't tax my strength if I were you, sir.
Sidney...
...I've got things to do.
I must get Cantor, Bill Rogers,
Bill Fields.
They must come back to me!
I'll have all my old stars together in one great show.
I must do the biggest Follies of my whole life!
I....
Oh, Sidney, I'm so terribly broke.
But Mr. Billings, sir, isn't he going to help you?
Sidney, he hasn't a nickel.
He was lying to me just to make me feel better.
We're both broke.
I wouldn't worry about that, sir.
You've been broke before, sir.
Yes, I know.
I've always laughed about it.
But I can't laugh anymore, Sidney...
...because I've been wrong.
I've got nothing.
Nothing to leave anyone.
Nothing, sir?
You leave them the memories...
...of the finest things ever done on the stage, sir.
You'll leave them a name that they can be proud of all their lives.
You'll soon feel better...
...and then you can do more beautiful things than ever before, sir.
It's nice of you, Sidney, to say that.
I must call madam again now, sir.
It's after 10.
The memories...
...of the finest things ever done on the stage.
Chicory 5161.
Hello? Get me Miss Burke's dressing room, please.
Yes.
Oh, Miss Burke. He seems to be resting comfortably.
Yes, I thought you'd like to know.
Yes, Miss Burke.
Yes, I'll deliver your message.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Z--
Hello. Is Dr. Hassel still in the building, please?
Would you ask him to come up to Mr. Ziegfeld's apartment at once?
Yes. Hurry, please.

I need more steps.

How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am Charles Irwin.
And this book is Paul Whiteman's scrapbook.
Its pages are crowded with melodies and anecdotes which we are going to bring to life for you by the magic of the camera.
Here we have Paul himself.
And by the way, you may be interested in knowing how he came to be crowned the King of Jazz.
Once upon a time Paul, tiring of life in the great city, had a grand idea - he would go big-game hunting.
No sooner said than done.
Suiting the action to the camera, we find him a few weeks later in darkest Africa.

- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Paul.
Where's the band?
Are you standing in front of them?
- Oh, the band?
- Yes.
I have them right in here.
What, 40 boys in that little bag?
In the bag.
I'm really very proud of the boys.
Some of them have been in the band for a great many years.
- Mike, how long have you been in the band?
- Eleven years, Mr. Whiteman.
Goldie, how long have you been in the band?
Six years, Pop.
- “Six years, Pop"?
- Pop.
Been in the band so long he's commenced to look like me.
However, as I said before, I'm really very proud of the boys collectively and I'd like to have you meet them individually.
Now that you know the boys,
I want you to meet our girls.
We call our next advertisement
“The Bridal Veil."
It tells the story of a little girl who finds in an old treasure chest
the laced veil that had been worn by her ancestors.
The ghost brides of all the ages pass before her
and, in fancy, the boy who was to become her future husband joins her
and they start on their honeymoon to the land of dreams.
Of course they lived happy ever after.

The next page in the scrapbook was inserted one day while Paul was away.
And the boys in the band prevailed upon the property man to do his stuff.

I had a funny dream last night.
I dreamt I saw two fishes fight.
The champion was a tuna fish.
His opponent was a bass.
Before the title fight began they introduced a few.
They introduced Kid Sharkey.
Battling Whitefish.
And Piccolo Pete.
Ahh!
- Ace of clubs?
- Right!
The house was packed with poor fish who paid 20 fish to get in.
And now they're madly yelling for the main fight to begin.
Everyone's excited.
In the gallery, some fresh trout -
Come on, you tuna fish!
Knock his teeth out now!
The champion leads his left fin.
He leads it to the jaw.
He lands!
The bass, he flounders.
- Catch on?
- Oh, we get it, we get it.
The signal’s off.
The bass went down. He can't get up.
The champ is in his glory.
And then I woke to find my dream was only a bedtime story.

All Quiet on the Western Front inspired us to produce our own little war drama,
All Noisy on the Eastern Front.
In it we hope to prove for all time that Sherman was right.
Come in!
Marie!
My big American baby!
- Cigarettes?
- Have you been true to me?
Hide! Quickly!
Come in!
- Marie!
- Mon capitaine!
You look so handsome!
Soap.
- Smells good.
- Have you been true to me?
Hide! Quickly!
Come in!
- Marie darlin'!
- Mon colonel!
Oh, girl, girl, girl, girl!
Mm-mmm!
You are my jazz baby, no?
- Look what I got for you.
- Chocolate! Yum-yum-yum.
Marie, have you been true to me?
Hide!
Quickly!
Come in!
General.
Marie, have you been true to me?
Need you ask me that, baby?
The enemy is shelling the town.
We must leave immediately.
Come! My car is waiting.
Have you got any room for me?
How about me?
How 'bout me?
How about us?
No record of American music would be complete without George Gershwin's
Rhapsody in Blue, which was written for the Whiteman Orchestra and first played in the Aeolian Hall in 1924.
The most primitive and the most modern musical elements are combined in this rhapsody, for jazz was born in the African jungle to the beating of the voodoo drum.
- Oh, good evening, Mr. Kent.
- Hello, Wally.
- What are you gonna have?
- Oh, I don't know.
Most anything.
Thanks. What is that?
Just what you ordered - most anything.
Well, here's a go, here's a go.
You know what’s the matter with this country?
It's a tariff.
That's who.
Partly tariff and partly income tax.
Now, you take my wife.
All right. Who you gonna take?
Here's a go, here's a go, here's a go.
Wait a minute. Don't kick that dog.
That's not a dog.
It's a cat.
Well, don't - Then don't kick the cat.
- Don't you like animals?
- No.
Do you like goldfish?
Goldfish? I hate 'em!
Whew. Nat so quiet. Not so quiet.
My boy, don't ever let anybody hear you talk that way.
A goldfish is one of the most faithful animals we have.
To mankind.
To the goldfish.
Would you mind if I told you a story about two little goldfish that I once had?
No.
I bought 'em at a spawn shop.
Two little walli - walli - uh - goldfish.
I call 'em Ella and Emma.
I brought them home and put them in a glass bowl full of water.
And I used to sit and watch them grow, grow into women, into men -
Big fish.
Then prohibition came, and they jumped out of the bowl onto the floor.
They used to follow me around wherever I went.
How I used to love them.
I used to come home each night and I'd stand at the bottom of the steps and I'd cry out,
“Hello, Ella!
Hello, Emma!"
And they would answer me back -
One day I'd been working very hard.
I worked so hard, I broke my shovel.
I came home, and I stood at the bottom of the steps, and I cried out...
“Hello-lo-lo-lo, Ella!
Hello, hello, Emma!"
But there was no -
No -
Ella! Emma!
Emma!

- Thank you, Mr. Irwin.
- You're welcome.
Say, Charlie, what's the big idea?
Don't you think I'm entitled to a little consideration?
What for, Paul? After all is said and done, it's dancing that puts a number over.
All you do is stand back there, wave a little stick, and form a background.
And what a background.
How do you know that I can't dance?
You don't mean to tell me that you're well-versed in the intricacies of the an of Terpsichore?
No, but I can dance.
Charlie, I have a secret confession.
Ever since I've been a little fellow,
I've been able to dance, oh, quite well.
Ever since I was about - oh, about so high.
Yeah, but how wide?
Ouch.
You really want to dance?
All right, Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Paul Whiteman will now dance, so help me, Bob.

"Transparent sources"
Writing on the gateway:
"Close the gate when you walk in"
Re-lieved by joyfull song
She never lest sadden
Cities and countrysides admire the song
And admire the song bigger towns
Song helps us to live and to love
She like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
Re-lieved by joyfull song
She never lets sadden
Cities and countrysides admire the song
And admire the song bigger towns
Song helps us to live and to love
She like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
We are able to sing and laugh, like children
Among obdurate fight and work
So we were born like this
That we never give up, nowhere and never
Song helps us to build and to live
She like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost

Oh how you played walking through the countryside
For a music like this they should rip hands off.
You, Germans are a hot nation.
Can this be called "playing"?
You should play like Sapojnik!
Mister, please don't compare me to him.
I can't play likeSapojnik.
Sapojnik has been doing it for seven years,
And I only for two!
Shut up!
Take your violin and play!
What should I play?
Oh... play this!
Well!
The scores came to bits.
Costa Frascini!

Conductor. He arrived today.
Mom, mom!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Where he is?
Here!
In foreign bathrobe.
I'm going to meet him.
But it's not quite the thing.
Stay calm.
I'll do it subtly.

Allright.
Enough for today.
Auf viedersehen.
Goodbye.
Please tell me, do we have hot water today?
Yes.

And what are you doing?
Me?
I'm a singer.
A singer!
Sing something, lady.
Now?
Here?
Well... yes.
In costume it's not quite a thing.
But if you'd agree...
What?

I? To you?
And where do you live?
In "Black Swan".
Oh, you made a life.
I'll get you to know with my mother.
Please come.
And she won't be angry?
What you..?
My mum will die from joy!.
Well.
If she dies, I'll come.
So, everything is established,
I'll be waiting for you.
Ay, what a woman?
You could die for her!
In this frock-coat I played in 1893 in Stuttgart.
Oh God, I was the same about 40 years ago.
Today you're playing in front of the audience.
Bring dignity out of you.
Guest house for disorganized patients, earlier "Black Swan"
He's not here yet?
He's not!
Someone should go for him.
And whou would do it?
I.
And only for you, madam.
We'll start when he arrives.
He'll arrive for me,

I'm all burning and I don't know why
Dear heart! How should I live now?
Ah, why from all the men, the only one
Can we love in our life!
Heart in chest!
Is falpping like a bird

Heart in chest
Is flipping like a bird
And you want to know, what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
No,no,no no one's better than him

Immediately go and dress up.

Well, let's dance.
Maestro, so far you ran from me?
Why are you so devoted to this place?
- You can see it?
- What?
That I'm devoted.
Of course, on this place you're visible for everyone.
About what place are you talking?
- About a window.
- Oh, a window.
I thought that about a place
I'm deovted to.
I mean you haven't noticed nothing?
No.
And that I'm devoted, haven't you noticed?
It seemed to me...
Oh, it seemed to me.
Please don't scare me.
You're joking and I, thought you noticed.
How strange you are.
Well. let's dance.
All right, go without me

So?
Och, strong!
It can sweep a bull off his feet.
When I'll see you again?
Tomorrow I can't, I have a hairdresser.

You'll come to the oak.
Will you?
Will you?
Yes.
I feel...
...that my heart is goning to rip apart!
Maestro, maybe play something for us?
Please.
I don't have my violin...

Bravo.
Without glasses I can't see a thing.
Time to eat something!
Maestro, to the table.
Aniuta, Aniuta!
Where's Aniuta?
In a minute, a minute.
In a minute, a minute.
Please fetch spirit of camphor.
Where it is?
In bedroom.
My God, who's this?
First time in my life..!
Good toy, well made.
Looks like it's living.
Better are made abroad.
Please look at the head.
Is this a sheep?
Head indeed... it's not the best part.
But the chopper is very similar.
By the way,
I'd like to keep the memory about today evening.
Do you have a photograph?
I have, but it's really small.
Here it is.
If you are so kind, please give it to me with your autograph.
With what?
With autograph.
Miss Helena,
I wouldn't scant you anything...
...but I don't have what I don't have.
Where you came, run away.
Carefully, hang tough lady.
Carefully, hang tough lady.
Carefully....
Hang tough lady!
Carefully...
A tiger!
Tiger.
God... who's this?
It's me.
How you came here?
I went to the composer, Frascini.
But he'a already here.
No, he's there.
How he could be there, if it's him?
No.
It's not him.
Who are you?
Me?
Kolka Patiechin.
- What Patiechin?
- Herdsman.
How herdsman?
As per usual, herdsman.
Usual herdsman?
No, not usual, but main!
- Young man...
- Please call Lena...
Herdsman has nothing to talk to my daughter.
I hope that this misunderstanding will remain between us.
Please take this and go away.
But you invited me yourself...
Yes, but the thought that you are a musician...
... and you are a herdsman.
Today herdsman... and... and tomorrow musician.
So please come "tomorrow".
Now get along!
Away!
There are lots of pretty girls
There are lots of pretty names
But only one bothers
Taking calm and sleep away
When you are in love.
Love will stun you unexpected
When you don't bide it
And suddenly every evening becames
Suprisingly beautiful
And you sing
Heart, you don't want to be calm
Heart, how good is to live
Heart, how good you are like this
Thank you heart that you can love like this.
Heart, you don't want to be calm
Heart, how good is to live
Heart, how good you are like thid
Thank you heart that you can...
...love like this.
Hours have passed..
Konstant Iwanowicz.
To me?
I'm here for Helena Siergiejewna.
Lena sent you here?
Wait, wait...
I've seen you before.
I've seen you many times.
By morning.
When I buy milk...
...you always pass by with your herd.
Is she mad?
A mosquito was sitting on you,
Konstanty Iwanowicz
There are lots of mosquitos.
But why she didn't came be herself?
Who?
Lena.
You live here permanently?
She's mad at me.
Who taught you to play like this?
Where is Lena?
I'm going away tomorrow.
And Lena?
Today.
Is going away?
Oh, she went away!
She sailed by steamboat.
And I'm going by train, tomorrow.
She went away.
It was a big mosquito,
Konstanty Iwanowicz.
Mosquito, mosquito...
...and she, unfortunately, went away.
I thought...
... thought, thought.
Too late.
Konstantynie Iwanowiczu.
Kostia!

I'm all burning and I don't know why
Dear heart! How should I live now?
Ah, why from all the men, the only one
Can we love in our life!

Is flapping like a bird
And you want to know, what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
And you want to know, what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
Joy is singing like spring skylark
Life is warm and bright
If I had ten hearts
I'd give every single one to him.
Heart in chest
Is flipping like a bird
And you want to know, what's waiting for you

Month's up.
The minute hand runs throught clock face
Quickly as mad are running cogwheels.
Minutes are jumping throught troubles and cases
Jumpin, jumping, jumping...
...and so month's up.
Yes.
But the conductor is still not here!
How will he conduct, if the orchestra had never seen him?
- It a scandal.
- What to do!
- The audience is making you mad?
Yes.
So why are you staying here?
Go and calm them!
You, why are you staying?
Come here!
Hold!
Strange.
We only have 5 minutes and he's not here!
How will we play?
The worst is that without any rehearsal.
And also they say, that he's a freak.
We need to follow his every move and gesture.
"Passing on the backstage prohibited"
Haven't you seen the one in jacket...
... and white hat?
To hell with it all!
Could be worse.
We lost him.
- Here, please.
- Gracias.
Please don't aggrevate.
Everything will be allright.
Understand me!
Understand me!
Oh, stupid.
Original conduction.
Mom!
We threw away the real one!
Guve me binocular!
Emma, for these tears
I love you even more.
Maestro, you're mad at me.
But it wasn't me.
It was my mum.
I'm so rancorous.
Forgive the elderly lady.
Let's bow... bow.
It was nice to meet you.
Let's go for a dinner.
The races begin again.
Now that's a man!
Amazing.
We need one like this to the orchestra.
Hold him!
Hold!
We do, we do!
Hold him.
Harder.
And so, are you joining our orchestra?
Orchestra?
Do you agree?
Agree!
Months have passed.
"Friendship" music band
How you play?
It's not me.
I can't exercise in those conditions!
It unnerves...
Behind a wall.
Hey, you!
Couldn.t you be quiet?
I can't work!
Do your best, I'll go and make a complaint to commandant.
Well, come on, let's try.
This phrase should be played differently!
No, like this!
He's right.
No, he's not!
No, he is right!
This phrase should be played like this!
No, this!
And so?
Okay, play, but hands close to yourself!
Comrade commandant.
We are artists.
We need dead silence.
And devil knows, what's going on from the morning.
Szum, tararam.
Please embark something, comrade commandant.
Please pay attention, to what's happening there.
Devil knows what comrade commandant.
Please do your best.
O, that's how it sholud be played!
Please pay attention, comrade commandant, it's a mess!
To my mind, it's not there.
To my mind, it's nearby.
It's not you, comrade Patiechin?
Comrade commandant.
We are artists...
Of course it's you!
But what are you, comrade, but...
...artists...!
We're in silence!
Dead silence.
What was happening here?
We ha.. had.. ha... had rehearsal!
You had a rehearsaland I'll kick you out!
Everything fizzled out.
First time in our life...
...we go into Great Theather...
...and so... very well.
And where are we going to do rehearsal now?
Rehearsals?
We have no place for it!
Me must serve notice, that we won't play.
I know where're going to do rehearsal.
Where?
Boys, follow me, we're going.
We're going, boys.
Lena is working.
Lenoczka!
Eggs worked?

Lenoczka.
What's up with you?
Comrades.
Concert in fifteen minutes.
Twenty roubles to the Great Theater.
What's with you are you joking?.
I'm going to the garage.
Alone.
Go, I wont't do you any harm.
Boys, get in.
Citizens, beware.
The hearse is not made of rubber.
No more will fit in.
Whereinto?
We're off.
Did anything happen to you?
Aniuta!
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Going with us?
I don't know.
So, we're off.
Boys, take her.
Hey, and who will pay?
Puszkin?
Pay for what?
We rode?
We rode!
You decided 30 roubles extra?
Decided!
No doubt!
You'll sit here, lady.
Unless they pay,
I won't let you.
Let's continue our concert.
And now...
Liszt's music band from mill operators' guild
Whereinto?
Sit!
What. isn't it working?
No.
Give it to me, I'll try.
Play!
- On what?
- With your lips.
But how?
She's shaking.
She will catch cold.
Shroud yourself.
Filemon, Filemon, wake up!
Take out half a liter.
Stay, stay...!
Leave something for the lady.
Drink.
What you.. I don't drink.
Please drink, or you'll catch a cold.
I don't want.
Don't talk, drink!
Go on, squarely, to be happy!
Pot...
Get together, lady.
Whereto?
You'll go with me.
We're going to them.
I'll wait here.
We're going, as I say!
Where are ours?
Wait here.
Don take offences, comrades, but I have a witness..
Forgive me comrades, the ride is made?
Made!
We decided 30 roubles?
Decided.
And no talking!
I need to drive the deceased back.
Wait, we'll finish our work and go back.
Deceased, comrade.
Deceased will wait, he's got no hurry.
Give me the money!
Aniuta, Aniuta, Aniuta, Aniuta, what you... what you?
Sing!
Sing!
Aniuta, sing! sing, Aniuta.
Sing as they please you.
Heart in chest
Is flipping like a bird
And you want to know, what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
Love will stun you unexpected
When you don't bide it
And suddenly every evening becomes
Suprisingly beautiful
And you sing
Heart, you don't want calm
Heart, how good is to live
Heart, how good you are just like this
Thank you heart, that you can love like this.
...thant you can love like this.
Ciuch, ciuch, ciuch, ciuch,
Our iron has already warmed up.
You fell in love, realized
You met a wrong womam.
You got mad, looked behind
And saw a beauty one.
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,
Our iron has already warmed up.
Everyone can make a mistake,
Love is really tiring,
Cause not in vain they say:
We learn the hard way.
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,
Our iron has already warmed up.
I'm nothing in comparision to her,
But it'll change.
He'll be mine -
And never go away.
Aniuta, I always wanted to say to you...
Leave her!
Aniuta, I always
Let me speak!
Aniuta, I always wanted to say to you...
Song helps us to live and to love
Like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
Song helps us to live and to love
Like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
Song helps us to live and to love
Like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
We are able to sing and laugh, like children
Among obdurate fight and work
So we were born like this
That we never give up nowhere and never
And who with song strides through life
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
Never and nowhere be lost!

Order, order.
Silence for
Mr. Keggs.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I assume you're all aware of what we're here for.
This sweepstake has been inaugurated in order to provide a harmless little sporting flutter for the ladies and gentlemen of the domestic staff of Tottney castle.
Get on with it!
When does the balloon go up?
Order, order.
Silence.
We have come to the conclusion that pretty soon lady Alyce will be making up her mind to get married.
So, I put all the eligibles in this hat and whoever draws the happy man...
Gets the pot!
Whoever draws the happy man will become the possessor of the total amount subscribed.
Well, we will now proceed with the drawing.
Thomas, the footman.
He draws the honorable
Wilfred Washington Watkins.
Ahh, why couldn't
I pull Reggie?
I don't know why you all favor Mr. Reggie.
With lady Caroline backing him?
Did you ever know when the old girl didn't get her way?
Antoine, our respected cook.
Sir George Belgrave.
Ha ha.
Too bad.
Now I draw.
Oh. Heh.
Mr. Reggie.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the proceedings.
Eh, what about me?
What about my 10 shillings in the pot?
I'm sorry.
There are no more starters, my boy.
Well, what's the matter with writing me out a ticket marked,
"Mr. X"?
Mr. X?
Man in the field.
Then if her ladyship turns down Mr. Reggie and the rest of them and marries some teetotaled stranger,
I'm tops.
Any objections?
No.
No.
Very well.
There we are.
Ha ha!
Ha ha, yourself with knobs on it.
Shall I tell you something?
What?
Lady Alyce is in love with a young
American fella she met in Switzerland last year.
Balmy.
That's what you are.
Oh, balmy, am I?
And why has lady Caroline appointed you to watch her wherever she goes?
How do you know all this?
Listening at key holes.
Mr. Keggs, she's run off to London...
Lady Alyce.
She told me not to tell a soul.
To London.
What for?
To see Mr. X.
It's a walkover!
Lady Caroline mustn't hear a word of this.
Where are you going?
And where are you off to?
To protect my investment.
Hello?
Yeah, this is
Jerry Halliday's apartment.
No, I'm his publicity man.
About what?
Oh.
Oh, well, you'll have to talk to my secretary.
She's not in yet.
Yeah, you'd better call about 12:00.
She'll be in then to go out to lunch.
Hello.
You should have been in two hours ago.
Why? What happened?
What happened?
Yeah?
If you're not here on time,
I'll have to get myself another stenographer.
Another stenographer.
Do you think there's enough work for the two of us?
Look, I mean
I'm gonna fire you.
You... fire me?!
Yeah.
Why, if it weren't for my father backing Jerry Halliday's first show in the United States...
You wouldn't be here in London now.
Now!
If it weren't for your father, you wouldn't be working for me for two weeks.
You wouldn't even be working for me for two days.
Not even for two minutes!
Well, a girl couldn't ask for shorter hours than that.
Here, sharpen this pencil.
Did you type that letter
I dictated last night?
Well, no,
I didn't have time, so I mailed them my notebook.
I hope they can read my shorthand.
You mailed your notebook?
You know, Gracie,
I'm beginning to think that there's nothing up here.
Aw, George, you're self-conscious.
There.
That's it, huh?
Yes.
I'm not in.
He's not in.
Find out who it is.
Oh. Uh, who?
It's a Hawaiian.
A Hawaiian?
Well, he must be.
He says he's brown from the "morning sun."
Look...
The man's name is brown.
The "morning sun" is the newspaper he's working on.
But tell him
I'm not here.
Oh, he's not here.
I tell you he's not here.
Oh, you don't, huh?
Well, you can ask him yourself if you don't believe me.
George, will you tell him you're not here.
He doesn't believe me.
Hello, Mr. Halliday is not in.
Mr. Jerry Halliday, the destroyer of feminine hearts...
I just saw a crowd of women running, and why do you suppose they were running?
Because you were chasing them?
No, because they were chasing me.
Oh.
You and your publicity.
Jerry, as long as these people want to believe that you're the same character off the stage as on, what's the difference as long as you cash in at the box office?
Thanks to you, every woman who can read either rushes at me or away from me.
Did it ever occur to you that it might be interesting for me to meet a young lady who could stand still for just one second.
Ahem. Ahem.
Sit down.
Sit down!
A story is a story, Jerry.
And as long as they're read...
All right, here's a story...
A true story for you.
I'm through.
What?
What do you mean?
Oh,
Jerry!
Until I can live down this butterfly character you've pinned onto me, there'll be no more love scenes, no more love songs, no more love dances, and no more love-sick publicity men.
Listen, Jerry, you...
Jerry! Wait! Jerry!
Good morning.
Can I hide here, please?
Now, listen, miss, this is just too much.
But Keggs mustn't see me.
Keggs?
Yes, he's following me.
Keggs, aunt Caroline's pet watchdog.
There he is.
Hide me.
You, sir!
You, sir!
And what's your trouble, my friend?
So, you're the American, eh?
Well, you can't get away with this sort of thing.
What sort of thing?
A young lady just got into your cab.
Oh, surely not, sir.
What do you mean,
"surely not"?
Well, I mean to say,
I've been in the cab all this time and I would have noticed her, sir.
Will you let me look inside this cab?
I will not, sir.
Very well.
Than I shall be bound to force my way in.
Then, Keggs,
I shall be bound to force you out, sir.
Good heavens.
How did you know my name is Keggs?
Why, it's written right on the wall in back of you.
Who is he?
He's Jerry Halliday!
He live there?
Yes, at the Devonshire.
The Devonshire.
Mm-hmm.
You're the American!
Right!
I'm your friend.
Don't give her up.
We're gonna win!
I suppose you're wondering what this is all about.
Oh, no, it's none of my business.
And... and of course you're much too well-bred to inquire into other people's business.
Of course I am.
What's it all about?
Well, ha ha.
I'm in a perfectly simple piece of trouble, and it would bore you to death if I told you about it.
Open that door, sir.
Do you hear me?
Go away, my good man.
Hello.
What's all this?
I have another little idea here.
I say...
Hello, hello, hello!
Come out of there.
You've committed a breach of the peace.
You'll be charged for this, you know.
Officer, I'm glad you arrived.
I don't know who this man is, but he's been annoying me.
Officer, I insist...
There is a young lady in this cab.
Oh, ridiculous.
There is!
There isn't, officer.
We shall see.
A practical joker, eh?
Playing jokes on the law.
Come along with me...
The both of you.
But there was a young lady in the cab, and you're evading the truth if you deny it.
Listen, my friend,
I'm admitting nothing, and I'm denying nothing.
And I'll...
Oh!
Ladies and gentlemen, with your kind attention,
I will give you my impression of that celebrated artist
Jerry Halliday.
Jerry Halliday.
It's him himself!
Come on,
Jerry old boy.
Give us a song, will you?
A bit of music for Jerry.
Come on, Jerry.
Music!
Hello.
Come here.

Take that.
And that.
And that!
Beg pardon, your Lordship.
What is it?
Your milk, Milord.
Milk?
What am I, a baby or a calf?
Take it away.
Reggie!
Yes, uncle John?
Stop that noise!
Right-o!
And stop saying "right-o."
Right-o!
Take it away.
Beg pardon, Milord, lady Caroline's orders.
I'm not to move until you've drunk this to the last drop.
Father!
Hello, my dear.
Would you do me a favor?
What?
Marry that saxophone-playing pest and take him away from here.
I'm not going to marry Reggie and you know the reason.
All right, then.
The next time you step up to London, let me go with you.
I'd like to take a look at it.
So would I.
Didn't you see him...
Your American?
How could I with
Keggs following me and fighting in the streets?
I wish you'd be sensible and forget him.
Keeping us apart a year hasn't made me forget him.
I should imagine that proves I love him.
Stop that nonsense!
Look!
Uh-oh.
Stormy weather approaching.
John!
Read this, please.
You know perfectly well
I can't read without my glasses.
What the devil is it?
It may interest you to know that Keggs spent last night in prison.
Keggs!
Keggs! Come here.
Oh, Keggs!
So, you hit a policeman, eh?
No, Milord,
I kicked him.
Caroline, if you can put up with a kicking steward,
I cannot.
You're sacked for being drunk and disorderly in a public place.
Keggs was not drunk and disorderly.
I suppose you were an eyewitness.
Yes.
Then you were in London yesterday.
I'm appalled!
I went there to meet a man, and Keggs followed.
I jumped into the first cab to avoid him and that's where he had the struggle with the man in the cab.
You met your
American!
I've never seen the man before!
It just happened that
I got into his cab.
As if you'd get in a cab with a stranger.
You're only saying this to put us off the scent.
From now on, you'll remain in the grounds and be watched at all times.
Those are your father's orders.
Are they not, John?
Right-o.
Good morning, children.
Hi, Jerry.
Good morning, Jerry.
Ah! Fan mail.
Yes.
I'm through with that.
Now, listen to reason, Jerry.
You can't quit even temporarily.
I am going to hide away in the country where no one has ever heard of
Halliday the butterfly man...
Beneath whose feet women's hearts are crushed as grapes in a winepress.
You wrote that!
Isn't this cute!?
"And if you come then,
"no one will suspect your presence.
"I love you.
Alyce M."
Ha ha ha.
That's the girl in the cab.
What cab?
Well, she was in trouble.
Trouble?
Tottney castle.
I wonder where that place is.
Look, it's got a coat of arms.
It's a bona fide castle.
Oh, that's where
Napoleon came from.
Napoleon?
Yeah, Napoleon Bonafide.
Her father backed your first show, remember?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, here it is.
Tottney castle.
The present owner is Lord Marshmorton.
He has a sister, lady Caroline, and a daughter, lady Alyce.
Since the 15th century,
Tottney castle has been the seat of the Earl of...
Oh, George, you'll have to do something about that Brooklyn accent.
You mean oil!
I mean Earl.
Oil and Earl are two different things.
Your daddy doesn't go to bed oily, does he?
He did when he worked for the gas station.
Listen, Gracie, in England, there are several titles for the nobility...
Lords, Dukes, earls...
Yeah, oh!
That's my daddy!
If he ever gets his Dukes on the oil company's money,
Lord help them!
I made that up myself.
You did, eh?
Yeah.
Where's the car?
Downstairs.
Say, have you any idea what a publicity story this will make?
Can't you see the headlines?
"Pretty heiress putty in Halliday's hands."
"I love you.
Alyce M."
Ha.
I mean, it's incredible.
How can the girl write like this when she doesn't even know me?
Everybody reads my stuff.
Thursday is visitor's day.
What's today?
Oh,
I don't know.
Well, you can tell if you look at that newspaper on your desk.
Oh.
Oh, this is no help, George.
It's yesterday's paper.
Her father...
Backed my first show.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Hurry, Thomas.
Yes, Mr. Keggs.
The bus will be here at any moment, and we shall be overrun by the proletariat.
Yes, Mr. Keggs.
Why they should want to pay a shilling a head to be led about like dumb animals gaping into the interior of the bedrooms is a thing I could never understand.
It makes them feel envious of us.
Keggs, I'm expecting the madrigal singers this morning.
When they come, show them into the ballroom.
Yes, milady.
Oh, dear.
Is this Thursday?
I fear so, milady.
Oh, well, open all the doors and windows after they've gone.
Yes, milady.

Kindly keep in line, please.
Kindly keep in line and hand me your shillings as you pass.
Thank you.
Good old
Tottney castle.
Ooh, isn't it beautiful?
It's almost pretty enough to be a filling station.
Filling station?
Why, this castle is over 300 years old.
Oliver Cromwell went through here in 1628.
Well, that was pretty fast time in those days.
I mean he went through the castle, Gracie.
Oh. Couldn't stop the car, huh?
No, he couldn't stop the car.
Admission is one shilling.
Oh, well, we usually get more than that.
But give us our shillings, and we'll go in.
Oh, but I don't pay the people, madam.
The people pay me.
Oh.
Well, then give me my money back.
But you didn't give me any money.
Well, that's not my fault.
Here's your money, mister.
Oh. Thank you.
Come on, Gracie.
How much did he give you?
Two shillings.
And how much is the admission?
One shilling.
Oh, well, then give me my change.
Oh, I beg your pardon, madam.
I was a little confused for a moment.
You!
Don't mention it.
Hey, not so fast there!
Oh! Oh, hello there.
How are you?
Say, I'm sorry about your hat, old man.
This castle is not open to you.
Oh, I thought it was open to anyone that paid a shilling.
To you, not on payment of £1 million.
Thomas, Henry.
Eject him.
Come, Albert.
But, look...
Outside the ropes.
Oh, George, imagine meeting a deep sea diver here.
Of all places!
A deep sea diver.
Yeah.
That's a suit of armor.
Oh, well, Mr. armor must be around somewhere in his underwear.
He's not in his suit.
Probably slipped out for a smoke.
Yeah, oh.
Oh.
We are now in the main hall.
Bang, bang!
Do you notice what that sign says, madam?
"Do not finger art..."
Oh, well, I don't blame art.
If I were art,
I'd object, too.
I don't get it.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Next, I would like to point out this portrait of a very famous countess, mother of 5 daughters whose husband was...
I know,
Eddie cantor.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Go right ahead.
Thank you.
I'm happy to relate that his Lordship gave more than £5,000 for that portrait.
5,000 pounds of what?
I told you I was your friend, didn't I?
Now I prove it.
Good boy.
Don't muss my hair!
Got a cigarette?
Sorry, this is my last one.
Then I'll have to have one of my own.
See them?
They're the madrigal singers.
You can slip in with them, and then I'll take you to see lady Alyce.
Good.
You got here just in time.
If I've ever seen an impatient woman, she's one.
Now, this balcony is an historical spot known in the family tradition as Leonard's leap.
In the year 1787, a young Scottish nobleman,
Lord Leonard Strathbungo, hurled himself from that balcony to avoid compromising the beautiful countess of Marshmorton.
This was a feat of bravery and daring which, in the whole history of the castle, has never been duplicated.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Did he break his neck?
Oh, George, maybe he didn't even lighten his neck.
Maybe.
Now, those of you who may wish, will be conducted by the footman to inspect the model dairy.
Why?
I'm happy to relate that his Lordship is the owner of no fewer than
1,500 cows.
Does he herd sheep?
Oh, George, you can't say does he heard sheep.
You mean does he hear sheep or has he heard sheep.
But you can't say...
Does he heard sheep.
No.
Well, now we will return by way of the ballroom.
Oh, ha ha.
George, isn't he a silly man?
He is!
Now let's all start together.
Right-o.
And let's try and finish together.

Very well, milady.
Thomas, Henry!
Sit down.
Hurry up!
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
Now count.
Count?
You're surprising her, ain't you?
It'll make it more romantic.
She can creeps all the way in and plant a kiss on your brow.
Heh heh heh heh.
All right.
Count.
Louder.
Give it a bit more.
No, I said that before.
Twent...
Well, I got here just as quickly as I could.
You did?
Yes.
You're feeling quite well?
Well, I'm not used to all this excitement.
One of our gardeners got sun stroke yesterday.
Is that so?
Yes.
He stood out in the sun too long without his hat on.
It, uh, made him all funny in the head.
Yeah.
Uh, now what happens?
What can I do to help you?
Help?
Well, you're in distress, aren't you?
Why, in a way, yes.
They're keeping you prisoner.
Yes.
Well, I wouldn't have dreamed it possible in this day and age.
Locking a girl up like a prisoner to keep her away from...
The man she loves.
How did you know?
Uh, you're quite sure about this being in love thing?
I mean, it isn't just a quick schoolgirl crush?
Oh, no.
It's the real thing.
Oh, really, I...
I find it quite embarrassing.
Oh, well...
Don't be shy...
Not with me.
I mean, I...
I want you to just, well, tell me everything.
But I couldn't possibly.
I've only met you once.
I'll tell you what.
Let's pretend that I'm an old friend of the family, an uncle or something like that.
And, uh, well...
You're talking about a third person who isn't here.
How's that?
It might make it easier.
Uh...
All right, here we go.
Uh, you do really...
Shall we say...
Care for this man.
I love him!
Why?
Well, in the first place, he's the most charming man in the world.
And in the second place, he's divinely handsome.
You're crazy.
Well, I beg your pardon,
I think so.
Well, all right, then.
We won't argue that point any further.
Go on.
Uh, American?
Yes.
You'd say, "he's got what it takes."
Listen, you know,
I can stand just so much and then...
Alyce! Alyce!
It's aunt Caroline.
- Alyce!
- Yes?
Well, I want to speak to you.
Just a moment!
Get out of here, or aunt Caroline will find you.
The balcony.
Alyce?
But don't go near the edge.
Where's that man?
What man?
Now it's no good staring at me like that.
That man was seen coming upstairs.
I know you're hiding him.
Psst!
The balcony.
Oh, don't be silly, aunt Caroline!
The balcony?
Well, it appears
I was mistaken.
I'm sorry.
He did it.
Did what?
The leap.
Leonard, I mean.
Well, of course he did.
Aunt Caroline, has any man been known to do it since Leonard?
Certainly not.
Oh! What courage!
Leonard, you mean?
Yes, Leonard.
Of course.
Oh.
Keep the motor running.
Did you see her,
Jerry?
Yeah, yes.
Good. Now we can go to Paris.
"Don't lose courage.
I'll be waiting to help you.
What do I do next?"
Thanks.
Say, you, gardener.
Look, where can one stay around here?
There are several cottages down the road.
Can you keep your mouth shut?
Look, I want you to give this note to lady Alyce the first chance you get.
And here's a pound for your trouble.
Did you tell his Lordship I wished to see him?
Yes, milady.
Where is he now?
He's coming now.
He was taking his bath.
Very well.
Stop that infernal noise!
Yes, stop it, Reggie.
Oh, right-o.
Well, what is it?
What is it?
I want to speak to you,
John.
A nice time to choose.
Keggs, repeat to his Lordship what you just told me.
Very good, milady.
I have been informed,
Milord, by the cook, who was informed by the second footman, who was informed by the scullery maid, who had it from the milkman...
You forgot the first maid.
Will you shut up?
Right-o.
Well, go ahead, man, what did the syndicate tell you?
The 3 mysterious
Americans are now the occupants of Leonard's manor,
Milord.
Alyce's American and his friends.
They're just down the road.
Well, John?
What do you mean,
"well, John?"
What do you expect me to do?
You will go and horsewhip him immediately.
Oh, but I couldn't possibly.
Why, I hardly know the fellow.
You will horsewhip him directly you've had your breakfast.
Oh, all right.
I'll think it over.
Well, now that you rented this bungalow, what am I expected to do?
Sit around and watch you being a hermit, huh?
Where's your sense of romance?
Didn't you hear what she said?
Leonard lived here.
Oh, have some sense,
Jerry. Come on!
Oh, I can't go now.
She needs me.
She's in trouble.
Oh, Jerry, don't be so pessimistic.
Maybe she'll still be in trouble when you get back.
Go and pack your things,
Mr. Halliday!
He's on his way over here!
Who?
His Lordship!
He's coming over to chase you out of the place!
Chase me out of the place?
Please, sir, you better hurry!
If you don't go, he's going to horsewhip you!
My, my, how old-fashioned.
Horsewhipping a man in this day and age, when they can run over him with an automobile.
What won't they think of next?
Please, sir, hurry! Hurry!
Relax, my dear boy,
I'm not leaving.
I like it here.
I'm filled with the spirit of Leonard.
Please, sir, change your mind!
You can't defy him!
It's time someone defied the old wolf.
Blimey! That's him!
He'll kill me if he finds me here!
You better take Gracie into the next room.
Oh, no, I want to see what happens.
You'll hear.
Come on, come on.
Ohh.
Enter.
Oh, I was expecting someone else.
However, peasantry is always welcome across my threshold.
Take the cat off the stool and sit down, son.
As a matter of fact,
I...
I was expecting your boss, and it would have been a most unpleasant fortnight he'd have spent the next 10 minutes.
And pray tell, who does he think he is, ordering me out of the country and threatening to horsewhip me.
Why, I'd like to see him try it.
What do I care if he's the Earl of yon neighboring castle?
An Earl? So what?
And how did he become an Earl?
Because some ancestor of his gypped the poor common people out of their lands.
The old pirate!
And do you want to know what else I think of Earl Marshmorton?
Why, he's nothing but a... a high-binder.
Have you finished?
Yes. I think that's all.
Good.
Come out, you young scoundrel.
Come out of it!
Yes, Milord!
Please, Lord Marshmorton,
I am sorry.
Oh, get out.
Please, sir.
Yes, Milord.
Very good, Milord.
Ahem.
You're Lord Marshmorton.
I am.
Oh! Oh!
What?
Oh, isn't it awful?
Isn't it terrible?
Isn't what awful?
Isn't what terrible?
I can't hear a thing!
What's this?
The answer to the letter you gave me.
Do you mean that you gave my note to lady Alyce?
Of course I did.
You tipped me most liberally.
There's her answer.
Oh, then you're on my side.
Of course I am.
Alyce loves you.
What?
And I respect her judgment.
She loves you, and that's good enough for me.
I don't think the Marshmortons are fenced off from the rest of the world by some sort of divinity.
My sister does, but she's a...
Ha ha, isn't she.
I mean, is she?
Of course she is.
Always has been.
Why, she wants her stepson Reggie to marry Alyce.
Over my dead body, sir.
Well, she didn't specify that, but I've no doubt she'd be glad if it could be arranged.
Look, he's going to take her to a fair this afternoon.
Caroline expects him to propose to her on the shoot-the-shutes.
Well, I'll be darned.
Is that all you're going to say?!
No, sir, it is not.
Well, if I were a young man in your position,
I should go to the fair myself and take her away from him!
That's just what I shall do, sir!
Good boy.
Well, I must be getting back to my roses.
Oh, by the way, if you should happen to run into my sister, you tell her
I horsewhipped you within an inch of your life!
Right-o.

I don't like those things.
I never did and I never will.

Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I'd been hoping that
I'd meet you again.
Oh, you have?
Yes, to thank you about yesterday.
Did you hurt yourself?
Oh, no, no.
No, I just skinned my hands a little.
It's nothing at all.
This is a lot of fun, isn't it?
Yeah, it's all right.
What do they call this thing?
The tunnel of love.
Oh.
I say, I'm with the lady in the car ahead.
Oh, my, you must be a magician.
No, but really, aren't you with the gentleman in the car ahead?
Oh, so I am.
Well, if we're both in the car ahead, then who can the two people be in this car?
Yes, that's right.
There must be some mix-up.
Shall I strike a match?
Well, why hit a poor little match?
It isn't his fault.
Although I always say that...
How do...
Although I always say...
Say, you're pretty.
You know,
I was going to say the very same thing.
But why don't you say it if you think you're pretty?
You have as much right to say it as I have.
I say, do you live here?
No. Where I live, we sit in chairs.
I must admit something else.
I, uh... it's, um...
It's lovely weather, isn't it?
Yes, it's a shame we can't see it.
Oh, rather.
How do.
Oh, by the way, did you see the newspapers this morning?
No, did you see them?
No. But I wish this was yesterday.
Although I didn't see the papers yesterday morning.
Did you see the papers yesterday morning?
No.
I never see the papers.
But they're nice to talk about.
Yes, they're so true to life.

I say, everybody knows you, don't they?
Yes.
By the way,
I saw your father this morning.
Oh, yes?
Yes, he called at my house.
I thought him a grand person.
Oh, he is.
And truthful,
I suppose.
What do you mean?
I mean, you can rely upon what he tells you.
I mean, he wouldn't just have a little fun, make a practical joke or anything like that.
Of course not.
No.
Why, what did he tell you?
About you.
What about me?
He told me about you having fallen in love with...
Oh. Well,
I'm not ashamed of it.
Of course not.
You can't help falling in love.
I know it. Ha ha ha.
It's like being hit by a thunderbolt.
That's right.
Ha ha ha!
I know some people laugh at the idea of falling in love at first sight.
They're wrong.
Oh, I'm glad you think so, because I did, head over heels.

So sorry.
I thought it was clearly understood, Keggs, that I would not tolerate another of these outbursts.
Yes, milady, I...
I fight the urge constantly, milady, but this time it seemed to get the better of me.
A man of character, Keggs, should learn to control his passions.
Yes, milady.
Thank you, milady.
Father!
Just a minute, dear,
I'm looking for a snail.
He's behind that bush somewhere.
Go round there and cut off his retreat.
I'll teach him to eat up the flowers.
Father, do stop talking about snails.
I want to ask you something.
Do you think it shows a very weak character changing one's mind?
What about?
Well, about, for instance, falling in love?
Hello, what's this you're telling me?
You've changed your mind about that ski-jumping fellow of yours?
Mm-hmm.
I just found suddenly that I don't love him.
I suppose that delights you.
Not at all. I'm sorry.
I liked the chap.
But you've never met him.
Of course I've met him.
I called at his house yesterday to deliver that note you wrote.
Oh, but that's not the man.
Not the man?
No, that's the American
I met in London in a cab.
Well, whoever he is,
I told him you were potty about him.
Practically gave him my blessing.
You told him I was...
Oh, then that's why.
Why what?
Why he kissed me.
Naturally.
But, father, you don't understand.
I slapped him.
Naturally, if he's a stranger.
But he's not a stranger.
That is, in a way he is, and isn't.
I realized in a flash that
I love him.
I can't help myself.
Now don't you think
I'm crazy?
No, but you said just now you didn't.
I didn't say I didn't,
I said I did.
But now I guess he won't have anything to do with me anymore.
Why? Because you slapped him?
What rot!
Why, your poor mother used to slap me frequently before we got engaged.
Do you think I minded?
Of course I didn't.
Showed she was beginning to take an interest in me.
Every time I kissed her, she slapped me.
And every time she slapped me, she came and apologized.
And every time she apologized,
I kissed her again.
And before long, there we were, in a private suite, shaking the confetti out of our hair.
Well, do you think
I ought to apologize?
Well, he might kiss you again.
But suppose he didn't?
I mean, suppose he didn't forgive me?
He'll forgive you, everything will end happily, and I shall come along and dance at your wedding.
Oh, father, you're a darling.
There, there.
You go along and do your apologizing.
I've got to get this snail.
Hello, Keggs.
Milady.
Come here, you.
I want a few words with you in private.
Eavesdropping is a low habit his Lordship will not tolerate.
And so, young idiot Albert,
I'm afraid I'm now forced to give you the sack.
Please, Mr. Keggs, let me off this once.
Well,
I'm a soft-hearted man, and I should hate to ruin a young lad's prospects.
You promise you won't do it again?
Word of honor.
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Keggs.
Ahem.
Oh, by the way, do you happen to have that ticket, the one marked
"Mr. X"?
Yes.
Would you mind exchanging it for the one marked
"Mr. Reggie"?
Fat chance.
Just as you please.
I'm afraid, on second thought,
I'll have to discharge you after all.
Pity it is, too, being dismissed without a character, breaking your poor old mother's heart.
It's men like you what lead to half the crimes in the country.
Here you are.
Gosh. Thank you.
Thank you.

Hmm. I suppose you'd like to stay here and play Leonard so you could save lady Alyce again, huh?
I never want to see her again.
She's here.
Who?
The girl who slapped you.
Where?!
On the jaw.
She's coming up the Lane.
Let's go outside.
When a man is in love, he wants to be by himself with the girl he loves.
Oh, Georgie,
I didn't know you felt that way about me.
And this is so sudden.
Yeah.
Come on!
Ohh.
Hello.
How do you do.
Uh, may I come in?
Is there something
I can do for you?
I suppose it seems very odd to you, my coming here like this.
Not at all. Neighborly.
Won't you have a seat?
No, thank you,
I can only stay a moment.
I'd feel safer if you were sitting.
I just wanted to speak to you.
You've come just in time.
You see, I'm leaving for Paris almost immediately.
You mean you're never coming back?
You can always buy a punching bag.
But that's what I came to speak to you about.
You see,
I came to say that I'm sorry
I slapped you.
You see, father's just explained everything to me, and now I understand how it happened.
Oh, I see.
Your father explained to you why you slapped me.
No! No.
Ha ha! Things are frightfully mixed up.
I mean, father made a mistake about you, and then after he spoke to you yesterday, where you naturally thought you were somebody else.
Naturally.
And I didn't know, of course.
I thought you were being yourself.
And then father explained that he thought you were the other man, and, of course, how were you to know that I didn't mean you?
Do you understand?
Perfectly.
And do you see why
I slapped you?
Let me get this straight:
Whom did you slap, me or the other fellow?
Why, you.
And who is the other fellow?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey? Who's he?
An American I met in Switzerland about a year ago.
Oh.
They don't want me to marry him.
That's why they locked me up, to keep me from seeing him.
Oh, I see.
Your father thought
I was he, and naturally,
I thought he meant me.
I see.
Well, I'm afraid
I've made an awful fool of myself.
No, no, you haven't.
And this chap,
Egbert...
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey.
He's the man you love.
No, no.
What do you mean... no?
Well, I... I suddenly realized that I didn't really love Jeffrey.
All that had just been a schoolgirl crush, and the reason that that was so clear to me was because I...
I suddenly realized that... that...
I loved somebody else.
A third man.
No.
Will you please stop saying no and talk sense?
You're just about the stupidest man
I ever met.
How I ever came to fall in love with you,
I'll never understand.
Did I hear correctly?
Did you just say...?
Yes.
Well, are you sure it's me?
Yes.
Well, when did you first feel this...
What you just said...
Coming on?
Yesterday in a flash right after
I slapped you.
Whoa. Then slapping me made you love me.
Yes.
Darling, slap me again.

I do.
Very well.
Then I am happy to relate that I am now in a position to extend to you what is known as a helping hand.
You didn't exactly give me that impression the last time we met.
No. But since then there's been a readjustment of certain matters very close to me.
The result of which lady Alyce's wishes and yours are very close to my heart.
Keggs, I have always felt that beneath that macabre exterior there lies a heart of gold.
Thank you, sir.

You just thought you wouldn't?
I changed my mind.
I don't understand.
Well, I was a little too tired to come down.
I'm awfully lazy, you know.
And it did seem a lot of trouble to take.
What's happened?
I mean, what's caused this sudden change in you?
Change?
Why, yes.
This afternoon, you said...
Oh, surely you didn't take that nonsense seriously.
Imagine. A man of the world like you.
You always believe everything a girl tells you?
Yes. When it's a girl like you.
How simple you are.
I can't believe this is you.
Yes, it is.
And when you're leaving, you'll find the front door much more convenient than jumping from my balcony.

Albert, my boy, we were misinformed.
Huh?
I mean, regarding the state of lady Alyce's feelings.
You were mistaken;
Father was mistaken;
I was mistaken.
Now I find that she was mistaken.
She does not love me.
Did she say so?
She did, and in no uncertain terms.
Shall I tell you something, mister?
Yes, do, my boy.
And make it funny, will you?
I need a good laugh.
You aren't the first one to have this happen to you.
She does it to all the boys.
Well, that's some consolation.
Toodle-oo.
Albert.
Well, my little man,
I've got some good news for you.
Thank you, Mr. K.
I'm going to give you back your original ticket.
That's fair enough, isn't it?
But I don't want
Mr. Halliday.
Oh, yes, you do.
Or would you like me to remember that I caught you eavesdropping?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, now how are you getting along?
Oh, just wonderful.
Reggie made up his mind.
Well, good.
But I don't know whether she'll have me.
Well, why don't you ask her?
Well, sure.
You always ask a girl first.
You see, I don't know how to do these things gracefully.
Well, Reggie, maybe
I could help a little bit.
Just sit right down.
Right there.
That's it.
Now, I sit on your lap like this.
Gracie, you sit right there.
Oh, but isn't this fun?
Yep. This is fun.
Now, just carry on from there.
Well, now that that's over with, will you marry me?
Yes.
Did you say marry you?
Yes.
Well, certainly.
Well, uh, thank you.
Ha ha. Thank you.
George!
Yes?
We've just become engaged.
What do we do now?
Well, how about a little kiss?
Oh, I'd be glad to.
Well...
Would you play this, please?
It's a request.
Certainly, Albert.
♪ Ahh...
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, sir.
I asked you not to let to him in.
You know, you change your mind so often,
I thought I'd make it up for you.
I believe you're moonstruck.
Your poor mother always got very eccentric at the time of the full moon.
She used to write poetry about elves and gnomes and things.
Father, would you mind if we didn't dance anymore?
I've got a headache.
I'm going to my room.
Stop there.
Who me?
Yes, you.
Letting the girl you love walk past you without so much as an effort to stop her.
The spirit of Leonard.
Hah!
Well, I couldn't very well make a flying tackle, could I?
I don't love her.
Nonsense.
Of course you love her.
I suppose what's happened is she's told you she doesn't love you.
Dear boy, her mother told me that 100 times.
And you married her.
Well, you see,
I... why, of course
I married her.
At St. George's.
Hanover square.
In a dash tight pair of trousers,
I remember.
If it isn't too personal, um, how did you convince her?
By being firm, dash it, firm.
Resolute.
Ruthless.
Oh, hello, Johnny.
Hello, John.
Alyce is just like her mother...
Always changing her mind.
First, it's the ski jumper, then it's you.
In my case, it was a roller-skating instructor.
He was the most conceited, arrogant, supercilious...
I'm sorry.
What I'm driving at is Alyce needs a lesson, just as her mother did, and I gave it to her.
I dashed madly up to her room and I said, "Emmaline,
I mean business."
Oh, I see.
You'll find her in her sitting room now.
Though you may not imagine it, my boy,
I had the reputation in those days of being quite a fellow with the ladies.
I could tell you an episode of a tobacconist's assistant that, well, that's neither here nor there.
Now, you go to her.
And I'm glad I've not been too subtle.
Oh, um, do you think lady Caroline will approve of this?
Never you mind about Caroline.
You do your part.
I'll take care of her.
Right-o.
Uh, Thomas?
Yes, Milord.
Find lady Caroline.
Tell her I want to see her in the library immediately.
It's most important.
Very good, Milord.
Who's there?
Opportunity.
And it only knocks once.
What are you doing here?
I shall need a little time to explain.
And also, a little privacy.
Palmer, stay here.
Palmer, go.
Go!
Oh!
This is much better, don't you think, you and I, here alone?
Get out of here!
Oh, no.
I mean business.
I demand that you leave here immediately.
I'm not the kind of fellow who can be led on and then pushed aside, just another one of those fish you've caught until you reel it up alongside the boat, and then give the bat.
This time, the fish jumps out of the water and bites you.
Are you mad?
Yes, I am.
About you.
I'm like the northwest mounted police.
I always get my girl.
Get out of here.
Oh, anger makes you even more beautiful, Alyce.
I imagine you'll be very interesting after
I get to know you.
Whoa!
What do you expect to accomplish by this?
You're the sort of girl who has to have her mind made up for her.
And I am going to bend you to my will.
Oh, I see.
It ought to make a good story for the papers, you... you wine press!
Wine press?
"Beneath those twinkling feet, women's hearts are crushed like grapes in a wine press."
Where did you get that?
I read it.
In a newspaper?
Yes.
Oh.
And despite the fact that it might spoil your publicity,
I'm not going to be number 28.
Oh.
This is the reason you changed your mind about me.
Yes.
But it's entirely untrue.
And not one of these other women exists, except in his horrible imagination.
Whose?
That wine press agent of mine.
The idiot.
Oh, Alyce,
I can't tell you how sorry I am, you being in all this.
Number 28.
Tsk. Tsk.
Well, I wouldn't have minded being number 28, if it weren't for the other 27.
I beg your pardon, milady.
Well, what is it,
Palmer?
There's something very odd going on in lady Alyce's room.
Quite, quite.
I understand.
You can go, Palmer.
Well, go go go!
You see?
In half an hour, it'll be all over the house.
What are we to do?
What are we to do?
There's never been a scandal in Tottney castle before.
If I remember correctly,
150 years ago,
Lord Leonard was seen slipping into lady Marshmorton's room.
It had quite slipped my memory.
Oh.
But you recollect, John.
They subsequently married.
Do you seriously suggest Alyce should marry that awful bounder Halliday?
Of course!
There's nothing else to do.
Otherwise, we shall be centuries living down this scandal.
Come, John.
We will act.
And now, how are we gonna break the good news to aunt Caroline?
Well, I think father ought to tell her after we tell him.
Father.
Yes. He always says that he doesn't believe in letting the boy scouts do all the good deeds, so here's his chance.
Good old father.
Alyce, open the door, please.
She mustn't find you here.
It'll ruin everything.
But we're going to be married, aren't we?
Yes, I know, but if she finds you here now, she won't understand, and we'll never be able to get married!
Alyce, open the door, please.
Well, well, what can I do... hide?
You can't hide.
They'll find you.
Alyce.
Alyce!
What shall I do?
Do? Do it again?
Do what again?
The leap.
Leonard's leap.
The leap?
Yes.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
The leap.
But isn't there some other way that we could...
Hurry! Hurry!
This one out here.
Yes. That one.
Oh, you meant over here.
Yes.
The leap.
Wait!
He's done it again.
What a man.
Young man, come back.
Are you all right?
Come back into the house.
Me?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Alyce.
Think of the scandal.
You might have at least considered us...
Ok. I'm... inside.
You know, you only go on a honeymoon once.
Wouldn't you like to go to Paris for a few days, then Venice, and then home to your own little love nest?
Well, George, I didn't think you cared.
Good-bye, Reggie.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
You can't leave
Reggie like this.
Oh, don't be silly.
You can't take him with us on our honeymoon.
Good-bye!
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Hmm. Good-bye...
My boy, we win.
We do?
You're going to marry Alyce.
I am?
Tonight.
You mean it?
Come on, you Tottney wildcats.
Give!
