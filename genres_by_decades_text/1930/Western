{2496}{2551}Now listen, friend.
{2553}{2615}The railroad's gonna come|right smack through your land...
{2618}{2691}and there ain't a thing in the world|that you can do to stop it.
{2693}{2798}But, mister, a dollar a acre?|Why, I paid $15 a acre for it.
{2800}{2873}And then there's my home|and the barn and the crop.
{2876}{2923}Well, take it|or leave it, friend.
{2925}{3007}But if you won't sell,|all we gotta do is call in the government.
{3010}{3082}They'll confiscate your land,|and then you won't get nothin'.
{3085}{3142}But if that's the way|you want it.
{3205}{3283}- What'll I do?|- I don't know.
{3285}{3355}- Mister! Mister!|- Here he comes.
{3358}{3425}- Mister!|- Well?
{3428}{3515}I reckon if that's the way|they're gonna do it-
{3517}{3614}Now you're talkin' sense.|Can you write?
{3617}{3680}- No, sir.|- Here.
{3683}{3749}Put your mark right there.
{3853}{3906}I'm telling you like a friend, lady.
{3908}{3965}If you won't sell,|the government will take it from you.
{3968}{4045}You can save yourself a lot|of trouble by just signing now.
{4048}{4134}It's- It's so little-|two dollars a acre.
{4137}{4235}But... well,|if that's the way-
{4237}{4293}Don't sign it, Ma.|Please don't.
{4296}{4369}- Let's see a lawyer first.|- Oh, you're wasting your time.
{4371}{4469}Let's see one anyway, Ma. We can go to town|this evening and see Judge Harvey.
{4472}{4550}- He'll tell you what to do.|Wait till you see him, please.|- Oh, what's the use? Right here.
{4553}{4670}- Oh, please, Ma!|- Well, I suppose it can't hurt|to talk to somebody first.
{4673}{4761}You don't mind waitin'|till tomorrow, do ya?
{4764}{4858}Well, it won't do you any good,|but whatever you say, ma'am.
{4930}{4995}No hard feelings, son.
{4998}{5046}Why, no, sir.
{5081}{5143}Trying to hold us up, huh?
{5146}{5236}- Leave him alone!|- Tryin' to jack up the price, are ya?
{5239}{5321}No, no, please! Leave him alone!|Don't hurt him! I'll sign!
{5324}{5390}- I will right now.|- Don't sign it, Ma!
{5393}{5446}- I will.|- My arm. Please let go.
{5448}{5505}- Right there, ma'am.|- Ma!
{5672}{5721}Whoa.
{5724}{5772}Howdy, bud.
{5857}{5929}- Sir?|- I just said howdy.
{5932}{5995}Oh. Howdy.
{5997}{6093}- What's your name?|- James. Jesse James.
{6095}{6161}Do you own this farm?
{6164}{6214}No, but my ma does.
{6217}{6271}- Where is she?|- Up at the house.
{6274}{6327}Thanks, bud.
{6695}{6796}Whoa.
{6909}{6966}Mornin'.
{7008}{7074}Oh, good mornin', ma'am.
{7145}{7198}Are you the lady|that owns this farm?
{7201}{7261}- Yes, I am.|- My name's Barshee.
{7263}{7346}I'm with the railroad. Now, we're comin'|through this way, you know?
{7348}{7396}Yes, I heard so.
{7398}{7448}I wanna get this deed|signed up.
{7451}{7506}Now, if you'll just put|your name right there.
{7509}{7571}- For nothing?|- No, no.
{7574}{7632}We're payin' a dollar an acre,|just like everybody else.
{7634}{7703}That's the law. Everybody's gettin'|the same thing-dollar an acre.
{7705}{7756}Seems mighty little, don't it?
{7758}{7831}I can't help that, lady, but|that's all you're gonna get.
{7834}{7926}- So you might as well sign up now as later.|- You mean right this minute?
{7929}{8022}Now look, lady.|We ain't got all day to hang around here.
{8024}{8105}Now, you either take what I'm offering|everybody else, or you'll get nothin'.
{8107}{8158}We'll get your land just the same.
{8161}{8263}I wouldn't dream of signing a thing like that|till I talk to some lawyer about it.
{8265}{8348}Are you gonna waste my time|with some jackleg lawyer?
{8351}{8412}Your land ain't any different|than anybody else's.
{8414}{8510}Well, there's no use talkin'.|I'm not gonna sign that thing right now.
{8513}{8591}Now look, lady.|I don't wanna have any trouble with you.
{8593}{8683}Didn't you hear her say no?|She said she wasn't gonna sign.
{8687}{8763}- Who are you?|- That's my son, Frank.
{8765}{8862}Ah, well, if you're so smart,|how'd you like...
{8865}{8942}for the government to condemn this land|and take it for nothin'?
{8945}{9022}- Wouldn't like it.|- Then you better understand...
{9024}{9096}that I'm doin' you folks a favor|when I offer you a dollar an acre.
{9099}{9150}I don't want no favors.
{9152}{9215}Well, maybe you'd like|to go to court about it.
{9218}{9278}I might at that.
{9280}{9344}Well, you folks|have it your own way.
{9347}{9484}All right, son. No hard feelings.
{9486}{9552}Frank!
{9554}{9625}Kinda tricky, ain't ya?
{9658}{9708}Yeah.
{9761}{9824}- Get him, boys.|- Frank! Frank!
{9827}{9908}I ain't a-scared.
{9910}{9965}Ya ain't gonna all|jump on him, are ya?
{10074}{10167}Back against the wall, you fellas.|Keep your hands out of your pockets.
{10170}{10227}- Wanna fight him, Frank?|- Please, Frank, don't.
{10229}{10286}Keep them others|from runnin' up my back.
{10288}{10342}They ain't gonna do|anything. Are ya, fellas?
{10344}{10412}- Jesse, stop him! Stop him!|- Sorry, Ma. He started it.
{10415}{10487}Oh, please, Jesse,|don't let him.
{10490}{10571}Frank!
{10741}{10815}Oh, Jesse, stop him.|Stop him!
{10970}{11026}He's gonna get hurt.
{11191}{11255}Looks to me like he's got enough.
{11298}{11350}Who's next?
{11352}{11413}Think you can lick 'em all?
{11416}{11511}I'll fight 'em or wrestle 'em if they'll|come at me and pile 'em up under the tree.
{11514}{11582}You'll do nothin' of the kind.|You men, get away from here!
{11584}{11631}Jess!
{11662}{11712}Well, if he ain't|the tricky one.
{11714}{11823}Now, get off this land.|All of you! Move along!
{11865}{11912}And jump!
{12037}{12115}But we're still gonna get|this land just the same.
{12235}{12306}Jesse!
{12308}{12355}- I'm all right, son.|- What happened?
{12358}{12421}Well, I don't know.|It went black.
{12423}{12471}- What's happened, Ma?|- She fainted.
{12473}{12546}- No, I didn't. I just gotta lay down.|- You better get Doc Hall.
{12548}{12596}Pinkie!
{12624}{12685}- Pinkie!|- Yes, sir?
{12688}{12737}Get on your mule|and go after Doc Hall.
{12740}{12773}- Tell him to hurry.|- Yes, sir.
{12775}{12810}- And, Pinkie?|- Yes, sir?
{12813}{12846}After you get him started...
{12848}{12895}get to all the farmers|this side of Liberty-
{12898}{12951}Mr. Crump, Mr. Clayton,|Mr. Thompson, all of them.
{12954}{13007}Tell 'em we're gonna have an|important meeting here tonight.
{13010}{13059}Tell 'em to come as soon|as they knock off work.
{13062}{13109}Yes, sir.
{13216}{13283}And furthermore...
{13315}{13396}if the St. Louis Midland...
{13398}{13491}don't know|the way its agents...
{13494}{13566}are swindlin' the farmers...
{13568}{13662}it's high time|they found out.
{13663}{13731}Uh, comma.
{13733}{13800}Because it's|the goldangedest...
{13802}{13884}dag-blastedest,|"consangulest" outrage...
{13886}{13961}ever perpetrated|on a law-abiding citizenry...
{13964}{14030}in the whole history|of the world.
{14033}{14080}Paragraph.
{14083}{14142}Uh-oh.
{14290}{14356}Trouble, by gravy.
{14358}{14406}- Uncle Rufe.|- Huh?
{14409}{14461}You want me to take those|cuss words out, don't you?
{14463}{14511}Oh, I guess so.
{14639}{14708}You mean you want to swear out|warrants for their arrest?
{14710}{14800}I'm charging both Frank and Jesse James|with assault with attempt to murder.
{14802}{14850}- Too bad they didn't finish it.|- Jesse?
{14853}{14912}Yes. While my back|was turned.
{14914}{14988}Nice shootin'.
{14990}{15085}If you'll swear in me and my men as deputies,|we won't bother you anymore.
{15087}{15165}We'll bring in these|buckaroos ourselves, tonight.
{15227}{15276}It's Jesse.|He's in trouble.
{15278}{15352}No! What did he do?|Uncle Rufe!
{15355}{15460}You know them cuss words|I told you to take out? Put 'em back in!
{15527}{15607}Uncle Rufe! Uncle Rufe!
{15610}{15702}What we gotta do is chip in some money,|whatever we can afford...
{15704}{15770}and send down to St. Louis|for a lawyer.
{15772}{15837}We bought our land, built|out homes and raised our crops.
{15839}{15912}If we have to give 'em up,|we got a right to a fair price.
{15914}{15962}- You're right.|- I'm glad somebody done something.
{15964}{16036}- We don't want any trouble, Jesse.|- Not unless they start it, Ma.
{16039}{16087}What we need is somebody|that knows the law...
{16089}{16137}to tell us our rights|and how to protect 'em.
{16139}{16200}- Jesse's right. We need a lawyer.|- Jesse! Frank!
{16203}{16288}Jesse! Frank!
{16329}{16411}Jesse! Frank! You boys|gotta get outta here.
{16414}{16497}They already got a warrant for you,|and they're headed here now.
{16499}{16576}So you gotta skip out, both of you.|I told Pinkie to get your horses ready.
{16579}{16638}- Ain't nobody gonna arrest me.|- I ain't gonna run.
{16641}{16708}- Now, listen, Jesse!|- Oh, listen to the major, Frank.
{16710}{16775}Don't you understand|you ain't got a chance?
{16778}{16835}The St. Louis Midland's|got this whole state hog-tied.
{16837}{16893}They got the police. They got the courts.|They got everything.
{16895}{16943}A trial right now would be a joke.
{16946}{17024}The railroad's got too much at stake|to let two farmer boys bollix things up.
{17026}{17081}- We got a right to defend ourselves.|- Jesse!
{17083}{17147}- Well, sure, Ma.|- Do what the major says. He's right.
{17150}{17255}All you gotta do is hide out till I can get|the governor to give you a fair trial.
{17257}{17334}- But if we run away-|- Jesse, please go like the major says.
{17337}{17395}If you don't, it'll mean trouble.|I know it will.
{17397}{17445}I couldn't stand it.|I'm not well enough.
{17447}{17495}- Massa Frank.|- Please go.
{17498}{17560}The horses are ready|at the back gate.
{17563}{17635}All right, Ma, if it'll|make you feel any better.
{17638}{17692}Oh, be awful careful, Son.
{17694}{17761}- Don't worry, Ma.|- Take care of him, Frank.
{17763}{17846}- Yes, Ma.|- Bye, Jesse.
{17849}{17921}- Good-bye, Ma.|- Major, Pinkie'll know where we are.
{17998}{18046}Pinkie.
{18048}{18122}Yes, sir.|I knows where it is.
{18125}{18216}Be careful, boys.|Be careful.
{18593}{18687}- Now, ladies, you all go|down the road a piece and wait.
{18690}{18767}There's apt to be a fracas here,|and just let us men handle it.
{18770}{18837}Go on. Step along now.|Just get right down there.
{18919}{19012}Now, men, listen to me.|Let me do all the talkin'.
{19014}{19062}Yes, Major.
{19065}{19137}Here they come.
{19291}{19339}Evenin', gentlemen.
{19341}{19407}- Where's the James boys?|- We got a warrant for them, Major.
{19409}{19496}They ain't here. They're gone. And if you|wanna know who got 'em away, 'twas me.
{19499}{19560}- Easy, Major.|- Get outta the way!
{19563}{19655}Just a minute, Mr. Barshee.|You have my word for it. The boys are gone.
{19658}{19712}Your word.
{19715}{19772}Come out,|Frank and Jesse James!
{19775}{19830}Come out, or we'll come in|and pull you out!
{19833}{19928}Their mother's that sick in bed,|and her heart won't stand you|stompin' through the house.
{19931}{19987}Are you gonna let this old goat|make a fool out of you?
{19990}{20036}- He says they ain't there.|- They ain't!
{20039}{20142}Well, I got a way to find that out.|Lynch, bring me that mush melon.
{20145}{20212}- Major!|- The major's tellin' the truth.
{20214}{20302}If you ain't outta there in one minute,|I'm gonna blow you out.
{20305}{20383}- You think I'm lyin'?|- Major! Major!
{20386}{20458}They can come in!|Let 'em!
{20531}{20618}- Look! There's somebody|in there! What'd I tell you?|- It's the mother, I tell ya!
{21088}{21172}There's no use. She's dead.
{21174}{21266}This is bad. Mighty bad.
{21269}{21324}I'm sure sorry.
{21357}{21415}Well, I'm sorry too.
{21417}{21522}Oh, I wasn't talkin'|about her. She's gone.
{21525}{21593}It's you I'm sorry for.
{21835}{21886}Whoa. Whoa.
{22069}{22117}Zee!
{22120}{22167}Frank.
{22169}{22218}- Frank!|- Yeah?
{22221}{22290}- It's Zee!|- Zee?
{22380}{22439}- I couldn't hardly believe my eyes.|- Zee!
{22442}{22511}- Frank.|- How are you, Zee?
{22514}{22577}I've worried so|about y'all.
{22579}{22627}- About us?|- How's everybody?
{22630}{22683}How's everything|at home? How's Ma?
{22684}{22764}- Jesse.|- Ma?
{22766}{22848}- What happened?|- Barshee-
{22934}{22982}You mean she's dead?
{23066}{23117}Oh, Jesse.
{23215}{23291}Well, let's go.
{23377}{23426}Bye, honey.
{23429}{23476}Oh, Jesse, don't you go.
{23479}{23541}- I've got to.|- Oh, no, Jesse! Please!
{23543}{23600}I can't help it, Zee.|I've just got to.
{23602}{23672}- Let Frank.|- Sorry, honey.
{23674}{23763}- Frank, make him!|- Take care of her.
{23765}{23852}- What about me?|- I'm the one he did it to, 'cause I shot him.
{23855}{23923}Go ahead. If you|don't get him, I will.
{23925}{23982}It might be a long time|before I see you again, Zee.
{23985}{24036}- I can wait.|- Bye, honey.
{24039}{24086}Bye, Jesse.
{24630}{24710}Just keep anybody|from bothering me. That's all.
{25128}{25182}Keep your hands in sight.
{25185}{25271}Bartender,|count three and duck.
{25274}{25334}- Yes, sir.|- Now, wait a minute, Jesse.
{25337}{25385}It was an accident.|I swear it was.
{25388}{25451}- Count.|- No, no. I can explain it.
{25453}{25510}I didn't know she was there.|I swear it.
{25512}{25578}Keep your hands|in sight. One!
{25580}{25647}- No. No! Jesse!|- Two.
{27117}{27183}Now, stand still.
{27185}{27276}One, two, three,|four, five.
{27277}{27343}- Thank you, gentlemen.|- All aboard!
{27345}{27402}Thank you, Mayor.
{27405}{27495}All aboard!
{30367}{30438}Hands up!
{30440}{30518}Keep right on driving|until I tell you to stop.
{30520}{30567}What you aimin'|to do, partner?
{30570}{30671}I ain't aimin' to do nothin'.|I'm doin' it. I'm holding up this train.
{30673}{30756}- The whole train?|- Slack up at this next curve.
{30759}{30841}Stop her just this side of that|clump of trees around the bend.
{30893}{30946}It's your funeral, partner.
{31565}{31642}Unhitch it!
{31644}{31722}If you don't know what this is,|folks, it's a holdup.
{31725}{31798}Stay in your seats! Keep your hands in sight.
{31800}{31860}The gent who just throwed his|pocketbook in the spittoon...
{31862}{31931}will kindly take it out and wipe it clean|before we get to him.
{31933}{32007}- No jewelry, folks. Just cash.|- That's every cent I've got in the world.
{32010}{32081}This'll teach you not to ride on the|St. Louis Midland Railroad. Thank you, sir.
{32084}{32142}No, ma'am. No jewelry.|Thank you just the same.
{32145}{32216}That's very nice of you, sir.|That's a fine-lookin' pocketbook.
{32219}{32310}Thank you very much, lady. Don't forget|to sue the railroad for everything you give us.
{32313}{32377}It's responsible.|Thank you very kindly, sir.
{32380}{32466}Just drop it in the sack,|and nobody'll get hurt. Thank you, brother.
{32469}{32543}Have your wallets ready|by the time the gentleman gets to you.
{32545}{32616}- Don't take all day. Thank you, brother.|- Sit down.
{32618}{32676}Thank you, sir.|Thank you kindly.
{32679}{32770}You'll hear about this!
{32772}{32855}No back talk. Thank you, brother.|Thank you, brother.
{32921}{33021}Everybody sit quiet, and nobody'll get hurt.
{33024}{33078}All right. Let's go. Lights out.
{33703}{33798}And then he stuck a pistol|as big as a cannon right there and says...
{33800}{33861}"Brother, we want that mail safe."
{33864}{33954}Where was the protection|we're entitled to? Where was the law?
{33956}{34012}Just a minute, cap.|I'm just the law in Liberty.
{34015}{34103}I don't cover the whole United States.|If you wanna give me a description of these men-
{34106}{34188}You know as well as I do|who it was. Jesse James!
{34190}{34278}Who else picks on my road?|Who else would have the nerve?
{34281}{34350}Sure, it was. But you don't|have to yell about it.
{34353}{34400}I'm not deaf.
{34769}{34832}What's that?
{34904}{34973}Look! It's him!
{35139}{35221}- Well, you crazy son of a gun.|- How are you, Major?
{35224}{35276}Oh, Jesse, you're just|asking to be caught.
{35279}{35366}- Don't you know they're looking|all over the county for you?|- Sure. How about a cup of coffee?
{35369}{35439}The marshall's got 30 men|out lookin' for you, son.
{35441}{35507}In all this rain too. Tsk, tsk. Poor boys.
{35510}{35582}- It's no joke, Jesse.|- Oh, it's all right, honey.|I ain't gonna stay long.
{35584}{35656}The way I figure it out,|as long as they keep runnin' around out there...
{35659}{35711}in here is the safest|place for me.
{35713}{35799}- Go on. Set down. Leave the man alone.|- But he's taking chances!
{35802}{35900}If I could just think of some way|to let you know how wrong you are.
{35902}{35975}It's no use, honey.|It's just like I always told you.
{35978}{36055}I hate the railroads. When I hate,|I've gotta do something about it.
{36057}{36122}- That's the stuff.|- Can I get you anything?
{36124}{36188}People ain't hatin' like they used to.|They're gettin' soft.
{36191}{36286}I've got to admit that I like a man|that hauls off and hates good and hard.
{36289}{36366}It's the lawyers are|messin' up the whole world.
{36369}{36462}Ten years ago here in Liberty,|we didn't have no lawyers and got along fine.
{36465}{36530}A man killed somebody,|then somebody killed him.
{36533}{36596}The marshall shot 'em all,|and that was the end of it.
{36599}{36686}But look at it today. Right here in Liberty,|we got hundreds of lawyers-
{36689}{36759}thousands of' em-as far as the eye can see,|nothin' but lawyers.
{36761}{36836}Uncle Rufe, there are|only two lawyers in Liberty.
{36838}{36931}Huh? Two? Is that all?|Then they run around too much.
{36933}{37020}Goldang it, I'm gonna write me|an editorial about that.
{37022}{37070}- Roy!|- Yes, sir?
{37072}{37142}Take an editorial|on lawyers.
{37144}{37262}- "Liars"?|- That'll do. We'll begin easy.
{37264}{37311}Paragraph.
{37314}{37442}If we are ever to have|law and order in the West...
{37445}{37571}the first thing we gotta do|is take out all the lawyers...
{37574}{37658}and shoot 'em down|like dogs.
{37714}{37753}Paragraph.
{37755}{37822}They're bound to get you|someday, Jesse.
{37995}{38111}That's why I hate to see you|go out that door-
{38114}{38212}because I keep thinking of you|all the time out there in the hills...
{38215}{38290}just going on and on|to nowhere...
{38293}{38372}just trying to keep alive.
{38374}{38486}And everybody after you,|wanting to kill you to get that money.
{38488}{38637}And, Jesse, sometimes at night|when it's cold and rainy...
{38639}{38711}I wake up crying...
{38712}{38785}because in a dream I saw you|lying dead in the mud.
{38822}{38884}Oh, Jesse, I'm so scared.
{38994}{39101}You're the only one that it matters to,|Zee, one way or the other.
{39103}{39168}You're the only one|that means anything to me.
{39205}{39299}I know it was a fool thing|to come here, but...
{39302}{39383}I never knew how much|I did want to see you...
{39386}{39433}until I saw you.
{39589}{39684}The dag-blamedest|outrage ever-
{39686}{39760}- Hi, Horace Greeley.|- Oh, hello, Will.
{39837}{39903}- I thought you was-|- I was.
{39906}{39963}Is, uh, Zee inside?
{39965}{40013}Well, she's-
{40015}{40093}- Evenin', Zee.|- Evening, Will. I thought|you went out with the posse.
{40094}{40156}I did. I just got back.
{40159}{40212}Did you catch him?
{40308}{40371}Uh, this is|Mr. Howard, Will.
{40374}{40438}Mr. Thomas Howard,|an old friend of ours.
{40441}{40492}This is a United States|Marshall, Mr. Wright.
{40494}{40548}- How do you do, Mr. Howard?|- How do you do?
{40551}{40620}- Uh, Mr. Howard's from St. Louis.|- Yes?
{40622}{40674}I used to live|in St. Louis.
{40677}{40752}Uh, what business|are you in, Mr. Howard?
{40755}{40834}Guns.|Guns and horses.
{40837}{40934}Guns and horses, eh?|No, we didn't catch him.
{40937}{41010}You couldn't find a white|elephant on a night like this.
{41013}{41073}Zee used to know Jesse James.|Did she ever tell you?
{41075}{41172}They kinda grew up together. She's told me|so much, I almost feel I know him myself.
{41175}{41252}- You do?|- Good biscuits. You make 'em, Zee?
{41254}{41303}Uh, uh-huh.
{41306}{41365}Try one, Mr. Howard.
{41462}{41526}I don't mean that we|ain't after him, understand.
{41528}{41600}I'm still a peace officer.|If we ever come on each other...
{41603}{41681}in the right place, it's just gonna be|me or him, one or the other.
{41684}{41759}Yes, I, uh- I understand.
{41762}{41881}What I'm hoping is, either he'll|stop messing around my district|or else keep out of my way.
{41884}{41963}'Cause it'll save Zee|some hurt either way.
{41966}{42021}You know your job, I guess.
{42024}{42071}I know it,|and I'm good at it.
{42074}{42133}I'm just as good at my job|as he is at his.
{42135}{42232}That's why next time, I'm either gonna blow|his head off, or he's gonna blow mine.
{42235}{42292}I, uh, got a little business|up the road a piece.
{42295}{42363}Take me about an hour. Maybe I'll|drop in again later if your light's on.
{42366}{42414}- All right, Will.|- Good night, Horace Greeley.
{42415}{42487}Uh, huh?|Oh, good night, Will.
{42490}{42593}I, uh, don't expect|I'll be seeing you again.
{42596}{42679}No, I don't expect so.
{42682}{42731}Take care of yourself.
{42947}{43032}You got a better grade|of law than it used to be.
{43035}{43101}Don't waste time, Jesse.|Go now.
{43146}{43197}I think I'd better|go that way.
{43270}{43343}Will you blow out that light?|I don't want to be a target.
{43346}{43408}Yes.
{43570}{43617}Zee.
{44098}{44157}Is that why|you won't marry me?
{44215}{44271}I can't help it, Will.
{44515}{44597}Well, let's load him on a horse|and take him to town.
{44970}{45052}Hey, one of you fellas|come here and give me a hand.
{45054}{45124}Get outta the way, you young 'uns.|This ain't no place for you.
{45127}{45179}Get over on the other side.
{45181}{45241}- Is... that-|- No, ma'am.
{45243}{45314}We didn't get the jackpot this time.
{45316}{45366}They keep on|running up that price...
{45369}{45429}one of Jesse's own men's|liable to take a shot at him.
{45432}{45507}Yeah. Some of them fellas|would scalp their own ma...
{45509}{45564}for a lot less than $5,000.
{45625}{45683}Let him down on this side.
{45924}{45984}Are you really as pretty|as I think you are?
{45987}{46061}Oh, Jesse, read this.|Read it!
{46138}{46201}Will arranged it.|I asked him to.
{46235}{46301}- I can't do that, Zee.|- Why not?
{46304}{46399}L- I trust Will, but-
{46402}{46508}He's given his word. He's promised.|He'll see that it works out all right.
{46511}{46586}Jesse, listen. It isn't only now...
{46588}{46637}although that's bad enough.
{46640}{46702}It's what's going|to happen to you.
{46704}{46792}Inside of you.|You understand?
{46795}{46862}I mean, right now|you're a hero...
{46864}{46937}to yourself and a lot|of other people too.
{46939}{47028}It's a fight you're in,|and it's the railroad that started it.
{47031}{47107}But that's not gonna last, Jesse.
{47109}{47181}The more luck you have,|the worse you'll get.
{47184}{47253}Shooting and robbing.|It'll get in your blood, Jesse.
{47255}{47369}You'll get like a wolf,|just doing it because it's your nature.
{47371}{47462}It'll be your appetite|for shooting and robbing...
{47498}{47577}until something happens to you.
{47580}{47658}And if anything ever|happened to you, Jesse...
{47660}{47731}it'd be like it was|happening to me too.
{47770}{47848}Oh, darling,|there's only one way out.
{47851}{47937}Come in. Give up.
{47939}{48016}Let me draw a free breath again.
{48190}{48294}I can't, Zee. I'd go crazy in prison.
{48335}{48410}L- I couldn't do it.
{48412}{48473}But if we went away now-
{48476}{48541}That's all there is to it, Jesse.
{48599}{48647}Good-bye.
{48649}{48711}- But, Zee, please!|- Good luck.
{48996}{49056}Zee, you said you'd wait.
{49058}{49106}However long it took.
{49108}{49168}Well, would you|marry me now, before?
{49171}{49233}Today, if you want me to.
{49235}{49293}Then that's the way, I guess.
{49295}{49343}The only way.
{50237}{50337}And then the Prodigal Son...
{50340}{50418}come home to his ma and pa.
{50491}{50561}Welcome, brothers and sister.
{50564}{50611}Thank you, sir.
{50614}{50671}Sit down.
{50674}{50734}Just find a seat anywhere.
{50782}{50831}Could, uh, we get hitched?
{50944}{51004}- Huh?|- Uh, married.
{51007}{51065}You ain't eloping, are you?
{51068}{51124}- How's that?|- Oh, no, sir. I'm grown.
{51127}{51183}We're in a kinda hurry,|if you don't mind.
{51186}{51244}- Oh, uh, your brothers?|- I have no brothers.
{51246}{51328}- Sorry. What's your name, sister?|- Zerelda Cobb.
{51331}{51389}- And yours, son?|- Jesse Woodson James.
{51390}{51484}Jesse Wood-|Jesse James!
{51486}{51522}- Thank the Lord!|- Sit down.
{51524}{51580}Yes, sir, and we don't|want no trouble.
{51582}{51633}Trouble? Why, son...
{51635}{51730}you're as welcome|as rain to the flowers.
{51732}{51854}Do you realize, boy, that I had a farm|giving 900 bushels of corn...
{51857}{51928}until that railroad|had taken it from me?
{51929}{52052}Why, I'd given up preaching and was|making an honest living off the land...
{52054}{52179}until that dag-swinged railroad|swindled me out of my own home.
{52182}{52272}- Us too, Mr. James.|- By golly, son...
{52275}{52344}do you know|I had a big house...
{52346}{52421}two barns,|three outhouses...
{52423}{52541}until that goldanged|railroad "honswoggled" me?
{52543}{52598}Amen. Amen.
{52600}{52676}All right.|We're gathered here...
{52678}{52772}to join Zerelda Cobb|and Jesse Woodson James...
{52773}{52825}in the bonds|of holy matrimony.
{53010}{53086}- Howdy, Jesse.|- Howdy, Will.
{53089}{53169}I, uh, guess Zee|explained things.
{53171}{53240}She said they're|willing to go light.
{53241}{53313}From the way they talk,|they're so glad to get rid of you...
{53316}{53383}they're liable to make you|a conductor on the road.
{53385}{53439}- What do you think I'll get?|- Two, three years.
{53442}{53513}Maybe five. It won't be much.|All they're charging you with...
{53516}{53600}is that little old depot at Pine Hills|that you knocked over last April.
{53603}{53674}That one they got proof on.
{53676}{53743}I'm much obliged|for all you've done.
{53746}{53793}Don't mention it.
{53840}{53888}Shall we go?
{54335}{54423}Is it all right, Jesse?
{54426}{54473}Jesse!
{54826}{54896}- Howdy, Jesse.|- Howdy.
{54899}{54984}- Howdy, Jesse.|- Judge. Major.
{54987}{55034}Jesse.
{55084}{55138}You ain't got no more guns|on you, have you?
{55140}{55188}- No.|- All right.
{55190}{55243}- You're doing the wise thing, son.|- Am I?
{55246}{55334}Judge Mathews here is gonna try your|case, son. You can trust him, all right.
{55336}{55392}I'm aiming to go as light|as the law allows.
{55395}{55448}When you come out,|the slate will be clean.
{55450}{55512}- The past will all be forgotten.|- Thank you, Judge.
{55514}{55594}- Well, Jesse, if you're ready.|- Well, I-
{55653}{55714}All right, Jesse. Go ahead.
{55868}{55933}You ain't worried,|are you, kid?
{55936}{55993}- I could do it on my head.|- Good boy.
{56166}{56243}Oh, my darling. My wife.
{56246}{56293}My husband.
{56382}{56479}Oh, I'm proud of you, dear.|Proud of you.
{56535}{56603}Bye, Zee. Good-bye.
{56786}{56833}I'll be waiting.
{57698}{57759}Yes, sir.|You can go right in.
{57840}{57932}- Mr. James?|- Oh.
{57935}{58001}I'm Mr. McCoy,|president of the railroad.
{58003}{58060}Ah, yes. I know|who you are, Mr. McCoy.
{58063}{58159}I just want to welcome you and tell you|how glad I am to see you here in jail.
{59022}{59096}- From this point-|- What's all this soldier business?
{59098}{59157}Oh, this is Mr. Wright,|peace officer here.
{59160}{59225}- Mr. Clarke, the state prosecutor.|- How do you do? Well?
{59228}{59294}Well, we're gonna try to hang|our lawless friend, of course.
{59296}{59348}Before or after the trial?
{59351}{59439}- Well, the penalty for murder is death.|- That wasn't the idea.
{59441}{59513}- The idea?|- That wasn't the idea you|gave me, James or the girl.
{59516}{59610}Now get this straight, Wright.|When you're dealing with|a criminal, anything goes-
{59613}{59661}anything that'll trap him.
{59662}{59714}James is a thief|and a murderer...
{59716}{59781}the most notorious bandit|and outlaw in America.
{59783}{59898}He has burned my property, robbed my trains|and scared people out of riding in my cars.
{59900}{59977}Three years ago,|I swore he'd hang for what he done...
{59980}{60057}and by the Almighty|he is going to hang.
{60059}{60115}That still ain't the way|things are done around here.
{60118}{60188}- You're a peace officer, aren't you?|- But not a skunk.
{60191}{60270}- Did you explain all this to Judge Mathews?|- It won't be necessary, my boy.
{60271}{60327}He's been superseded|by Judge Rankin of St. Louis...
{60330}{60413}who's not so sentimental|about train robbers.
{60415}{60482}He arrives tonight.|The trial's tomorrow morning.
{60485}{60581}- Anything else?|- A nice frame, eh?
{60583}{60637}And while we're|about it, Marshall...
{60641}{60729}it might be better for you if you dropped|this role of attorney for the defense...
{60732}{60780}and confined yourself|to the duties of your office.
{60782}{60873}- Who, me?|- Any interference on your part-
{60876}{60946}- It ain't me you gotta worry about.|- What do you mean?
{60949}{61020}Suppose Jesse|don't wanna be hanged.
{61199}{61258}Roy, stop the press.
{61260}{61318}Take a new editorial|on railroad presidents.
{61321}{61383}- Yes, sir.|- Paragraph.
{61386}{61498}If we are ever to have law|and order in the West...
{61500}{61624}the first thing we gotta do|is take out all the railroad presidents...
{61626}{61677}and shoot 'em down like dogs.
{61680}{61728}- Paragraph.|- Where's Zee?
{61731}{61798}- Where've you been?|- Up to Pine Ridge. Where's Zee?
{61800}{61848}- Zee? She's out.|- Out where?
{61851}{61937}Well, she set out-
{61939}{62012}I wouldn't want this to go|any further, you understand?
{62015}{62094}- I understand.|- Well, she set out for the hills.
{62097}{62162}- Alone?|- Not exactly alone.
{62165}{62287}She was being guided by a darky|named Pinkie on a mule named Stinky.
{62290}{62337}I see.
{62384}{62408}Whoa.
{62409}{62431}Whoa.
{62629}{62706}- Halt! Who goes there?|- It's me- Pinkie.
{62708}{62764}All right, Pinkie.|What do you want?
{62767}{62848}- I got a letter here for Mr. McCoy.|- Give me.
{62851}{62919}- A letter for Mr. McCoy!|- Is you sure he'll get it, sir?
{62922}{62968}- He'll get it.|- Yes, sir.
{62971}{63046}- For Mr. McCoy.|- Mr. McCoy.
{63049}{63096}For Mr. McCoy.
{63099}{63175}We want the trial to get started|as early as possible.
{63270}{63352}Judge, read this.
{63507}{63569}Listen.
{63572}{63669}"Mr. McCoy, if Jesse ain't|out of jail by midnight...
{63671}{63745}I'm a-comin' in and get him.|Frank James."
{63807}{63863}Well, that gives us|an hour and a half.
{63865}{63933}The nerve of him!
{63966}{64014}What ails you?
{64016}{64064}- It's this note.|- What about it?
{64066}{64137}I don't know if you gents|know it or not, but, well...
{64140}{64189}both these James boys|does things.
{64192}{64278}- What are you driving at?|- I've known Frank James a long time.
{64279}{64373}When he says he aims to do somethin',|he's liable to come good near doin' it.
{64375}{64428}Now, what on earth|do you think he can do?
{64431}{64495}He says he's gonna take|Jesse outta here.
{64497}{64568}I wish he'd try it.|We'd grab him too.
{64571}{64629}Of course we would.|You're crazy.
{64631}{64695}He's a mighty set man,|Frank is.
{64943}{64990}Hello.
{64993}{65069}Have you heard about|this ridiculous note?
{65072}{65143}- The word's got around.|- You mean everybody knows about it?
{65144}{65263}Everybody I met. They all regard it|as a very interesting situation.
{65266}{65342}Interesting?|Why, it's preposterous.
{65345}{65418}What do they think a few|ragged-pants bandits can do?
{65421}{65477}Don't they know|this is a brick jail...
{65480}{65544}surrounded and guarded|by United States soldiers?
{65547}{65626}Don't they know we could hold this jail|against an army of outlaws?
{65629}{65711}They do. That's what|makes it so interesting.
{65714}{65788}But they know, too, that both the James boys|are mighty set in their ways.
{65791}{65860}- Mighty set.|- That's what I told him.
{65862}{65946}Didn't I tell you to shut up?|How many deputies have you got?
{65948}{66040}Six on call, but I could swear in|as many more as you want.
{66043}{66090}That's it.|That's what we'll do.
{66093}{66156}We won't wait for the rascal.|We'll go out and get him.
{66159}{66233}- We could try.|- Do you think he'll really come?
{66236}{66340}- Well, don't you?|- Oh, sure. He wouldn't fool|around about a thing like this.
{66342}{66420}- He's probably on his way now.|- Well, let's not waste time.
{66422}{66488}Swear in some good men|and surround the town.
{66491}{66553}Tell them to take him|dead or alive.
{66556}{66613}Tell them to shoot first|and ask questions later.
{66615}{66694}- Tell them-|- Am I telling you how to run your railroad?
{66696}{66785}- What do you mean?|- Don't try to tell me how to take a man.
{66787}{66883}Just a minute, Marshall.|Where are you going?
{66886}{66969}- I'm going to swear in some good men.|- Wait. I'll go with you.
{66971}{67043}I'm not a bad hand|at picking men myself.
{67046}{67114}Whatever you say, cap, is|exactly what I'm going to do.
{67116}{67168}Turn out all your men.|Cover the whole town.
{67171}{67218}It's an utterly|ridiculous situation...
{67221}{67274}but by crikey I'm not|gonna take any chances.
{67276}{67320}Mighty, mighty set.
{67408}{67414}Five dollars. One-to-three he will.
{67415}{67476}Five dollars. One-to-three he will.
{67478}{67601}Ten dollars he won't.|Twelve dollars even money either way.
{67603}{67680}I've got $10, one-to-five...
{67683}{67774}that Frank James will bite|Mr. McCoy in the leg.
{67843}{67922}Bartender!
{67993}{68065}Gentlemen!|I want some deputies...
{68068}{68168}some volunteer deputies,|who've gotta be able to shoot straight|the first time... or else.
{68171}{68238}- For Frank?|- For whoever I say.
{68239}{68293}But if anybody|has got a mercenary streak...
{68296}{68385}Mr. McCoy here is talking about doubling|the pot for whoever rings the bell.
{68388}{68452}- Ten thousand dollars?|- All right, boys.
{68455}{68528}Line up at the bar|so we can get a look at you.
{68531}{68605}You and you. Ed, you're all right.|Bill, get over there.
{68608}{68693}You and you and you and you.
{68696}{68764}- Charlie, you're a good man with a gun.|- I don't like him.
{68766}{68833}- What's the matter with the big fella?|- Nothing that I know of.
{68836}{68895}- Then him.|- All right. And you.
{68898}{68973}- And these two.|- All right. You're the doctor.
{68976}{69088}All right, men. Face me,|raise your right hands and take the oath.
{69091}{69149}Up a little higher. One,|two, three, four, five, six...
{69152}{69209}seven, eight, nine,|10, 11, 12, 13-
{70252}{70306}Wild goose chase.
{70309}{70424}I don't care how many he brings.|He won't be able to get into|town, much less this building.
{70426}{70492}- The whole thing's a bluff.|- Well, it's 12:00.
{70495}{70577}- Nothing's happened-|- You!
{70580}{70669}- You-|- I couldn't help it. I'm|just nervous. That's all.
{70672}{70756}Frank said he was gonna give you|till 12:00 to let Jesse out...
{70758}{70806}and if he wasn't out by then-
{70860}{70911}- That's Jesse.|- Well, stop him!
{70914}{70974}I'll stop him,|but it won't do no good.
{70977}{71030}It's dead certain|Frank's comin' now.
{71033}{71133}And Jesse feels it.|That's the way them boys is.
{71232}{71354}No matter what happens|tonight-fire or flood-
{71356}{71471}I'm gonna have that man|fired tomorrow.
{71682}{71761}Major! Zee!|They got him!
{71763}{71834}- Frank?|- Yeah. They jumped him in the woods.
{71836}{71897}- Who? Who got him?|- Two of them deputies.
{71900}{72010}Oh, them goldanged, dag-blasted,|gol-burned deputies!
{72012}{72060}- Roy!|- Yes, sir.
{72200}{72324}Ah, I just want to thank the young men|for simplifying one of our worst problems.
{72326}{72392}Take him in there.
{72497}{72571}I sure am sorry, Frank.|Any guns on you?
{72573}{72690}- I got it.|- I sure wasn't lookin' for this. Come on, son.
{72692}{72736}Frank.
{72903}{72963}- Sorry.|- That's all right, Marshall.
{73007}{73078}You understand this ain't|any of my doing.
{73080}{73134}I just want you|and Jesse to know...
{73136}{73230}that all the honor and credit for this victory|of law and order goes to Mr. McCoy.
{73232}{73305}- We understand.|- Is that all, Marshall?
{73308}{73358}That's all. Thank you.
{73361}{73425}Get outta here.
{73428}{73485}Get out and stay out.
{73487}{73564}For a peace officer,|your attitude has been incredible...
{73566}{73664}and make no doubt it'll be reported|to the governor tomorrow.
{73667}{73738}You mean, you won't want me|anymore tonight?
{73741}{73802}Neither tonight or|any other day or night.
{73805}{73853}- Is that official?|- It is.
{73855}{73928}Sorry, Will. We didn't aim|to get you over a barrel.
{73931}{73978}Forget it, son.|The way I figure...
{73980}{74066}that barrel's gonna be mighty crowded|before this night's over.
{74069}{74122}Good night, everybody.
{74156}{74210}Good night, Marshall.
{74260}{74328}Pretty smart, aren't you?
{74330}{74401}- You ought not to have done this, Mr. McCoy.|- No?
{74404}{74508}You ought not to have tried to trick|Jesse and me when we were trustin' you.
{74511}{74597}- You ought to have kept your word.|- The way you're gonna keep yours?
{74600}{74673}- Sir?|- You said you were gonna|take Jesse out of here.
{74675}{74726}But I am.
{74830}{74902}- Hey, Jesse.|- Is that you, Frank?
{74905}{74962}It's me. You all right?
{74964}{75017}You're a cool one.
{75020}{75066}Gettin' along|just fine, Frank.
{75069}{75175}He'll be glad to see you too.
{75202}{75249}Lock the door, Tom.
{75252}{75324}- Soldiers!|- Take it easy, boys.
{75386}{75478}Now untie me.|No noise, understand?
{75553}{75669}We don't aim to kill a soul if we can help it,|but the first man that hollers-
{75672}{75757}All you gotta do is to keep your hands up|and your mouth shut.
{75760}{75814}Everything's gonna be all right.
{75817}{75889}You'll never get away|with this in the world.
{75892}{75943}I knowed it, and I told you.
{76001}{76065}Lay down.
{76145}{76207}Lay down or be shot down.
{76369}{76466}- What happened?|- Mr. McCoy was kind enough|to deputize Tom and Hank.
{76469}{76555}- On purpose?|- Guess he just didn't have any better sense.
{76665}{76714}What is this? A game?
{76716}{76774}Grown men playing|on the floor like children.
{76777}{76850}- Ain't it the truth?|- They wouldn't have it any other way.
{76984}{77033}Remember that?
{77136}{77184}Remember it?
{77187}{77284}Don't- Don't kill me.
{77287}{77385}I ain't. Not with a gun.
{77387}{77468}But, brother,|I'm gonna worry you to death.
{77507}{77553}Now, chew.
{77556}{77655}See how it tastes. And swallow.
{77657}{77714}Chew!
{77776}{77845}You look like a man|that's got good sense.
{77847}{77898}Just name it, friend, and I'll do it.
{77901}{77964}You'll do it if you don't want|your pants full of lead.
{77966}{78020}All you gotta do is name it.
{78023}{78105}Give him a glass of water as soon|as we're gone to wash it down.
{78108}{78206}Everybody set? All you gotta do|is throw that door open and then step back.
{78209}{78281}- You don't have to tell me to step back.|- Don't hurt nobody.
{78284}{78374}Don't forget to throw a few rounds|down the street just for the fun of it.
{78376}{78429}Ready? Open it.
{78718}{78796}Stop them! Stop them!|Hurry! Hurry!
{78799}{78877}Get over there!|Get after them!
{78925}{78988}Get after them!|Come on! Everybody!
{79099}{79184}- Good-bye, Uncle Rufe.|- Good-bye, honey.
{79186}{79240}I don't blame you.
{79322}{79416}Jesse played fair.|He did everything he promised.
{79417}{79486}So you gotta keep|your part of the bargain.
{79489}{79604}And stick to him, honey, 'cause you're|the only hope there is for him.
{79606}{79672}- I'll stick all right.|- Miss Zee?
{79674}{79728}Is we|got everything?
{79731}{79785}Oh, I-
{79788}{79845}- I-I think so, Pinkie.|- Yes'm.
{79847}{79908}- Good-bye, Uncle Rufus.|- Good-bye, honey.
{79910}{79967}Let's go.
{81024}{81077}Come on, son. Play Pony Express.
{82418}{82501}Well, I guess they'll be|busy there for a while.
{83250}{83300}- Darling!|- Oh, Zee.
{83303}{83353}Oh, darling!
{83354}{83403}Darling.
{83559}{83608}Just let me|look at you.
{83743}{83834}You like the curtains?
{83837}{83901}Why, they're just as pretty|as they can be.
{83904}{83953}I made them.
{84007}{84063}Oh, my goodness, Zee. L-
{84066}{84141}I never expected ever|to have a house as nice as this one.
{84144}{84231}- I made that too.|- "God bless our home."
{84234}{84293}That's better than you|can get in a store, Zee.
{84295}{84360}- That's a mighty pretty frame too.|- Oh, Pinkie made that.
{84362}{84444}- Oh? Good work, Pinkie.|- Thank you, Mr. Jesse.
{84447}{84553}Oh, it sure is fine,|Zee. The whole place.
{84555}{84626}I'm just as proud of you|as I can be.
{84628}{84678}Git.
{84836}{84916}Whoa. Hello!
{85057}{85106}Hello.
{85164}{85225}- Uh, evening, ma'am.|- Good evening.
{85227}{85286}I'm lookin' for the Wilsons.|Do you know where they live?
{85289}{85338}About a mile|on up the road.
{85341}{85397}Thank you, ma'am.|Giddyap.
{85462}{85511}- Pack.|- Yes'r.
{85514}{85566}- Jesse.|- Pack. We're getting out of here.
{85568}{85629}- But it was only a farmer.|- How do you know?
{87148}{87280}- How is she, Doc?|- She's weak, of course, which is only-
{87282}{87373}- You're a friend of Mr. Howard's, aren't you?|- You might say so.
{87376}{87454}- Have you any idea where he is?|- He travels a lot.
{87455}{87533}- Salesman?|- Uh, something like that.
{87536}{87585}You can tell him for me...
{87588}{87676}any husband who would stay away|from a wife at a time like this...
{87679}{87729}I can't say I've got any use for him.
{87732}{87826}- There's a lot in what you say.|- You can go up, but don't stay long.
{87903}{87971}Ain't he|the dag-blamedest...
{87974}{88029}cutest little cuss|that ever-
{88167}{88309}Now, honey, you mustn't blame Jesse|for not gettin' here.
{88312}{88408}Maybe he just couldn't|get away, and, uh-
{88410}{88482}- It doesn't matter.|- Well, you-
{88484}{88556}You shouldn't feel|that way about it.
{88559}{88608}I can't help it.
{88611}{88691}I'm too tired to care.
{88785}{88839}This is the way|it always is.
{88887}{88986}We live like animals,|scared animals.
{89027}{89121}We move.|We hide.
{89124}{89204}We don't dare go out.
{89206}{89263}All day and all night,|we just sit.
{89306}{89363}Scared of a shadow|on a window.
{89404}{89486}Scared of a footstep|on a porch.
{89489}{89538}Scared of a door opening.
{89588}{89642}And when he's away,|it's worse.
{89679}{89741}All I can think of is,|is he dead?
{89744}{89832}- Is he lying dead in the mud in the woods?|- Shh. Shh, shh, honey.
{89899}{90006}Maybe he's dead now.
{90008}{90077}Oh, Uncle Rufe,|I wanna go home.
{90138}{90228}You're home, Zee.|This is your home-yours and Jesse's.
{90231}{90339}I mean home with you,|back to Liberty.
{90375}{90446}- Will you take me?|- But, honey-
{90449}{90547}Doggone it, I-|But Jesse promised.
{90550}{90617}Oh. Yes, I know.
{90651}{90700}And I used to believe him.
{90735}{90812}But he'd never change.
{90815}{90905}Jesse will be an outlaw|as long as he lives.
{90908}{90957}I know it now.
{91000}{91050}He's wild, Will.
{91053}{91124}He's like a horse|you can't break.
{91126}{91176}He's crazy with wildness,|and there's nothing...
{91179}{91278}either you or me or him|or anybody else can do about it.
{91343}{91425}That's why all last night|I wanted to die.
{91427}{91482}I prayed and prayed|that I'd die.
{91484}{91561}And my baby. L-
{91564}{91614}I prayed that he'd die too|and end it all!
{91742}{91792}Oh.
{91795}{91852}My darling.
{91855}{91936}Mommy didn't mean that, honey!
{91939}{91988}Oh, my precious baby!
{91991}{92058}Mommy didn't mean that,|honey.
{92061}{92138}That's-
{92140}{92238}That's-|That's all right, honey.
{92240}{92297}I'll-
{92299}{92371}I'll take you home.
{92373}{92422}I'll-
{92745}{92794}- Hi, Pinkie. Zee!|- Howdy, Mr. Jesse.
{92796}{92846}- Oh, Mr. Jesse.|- Yes?
{92905}{92986}- She's gone.|- Gone? Gone where?
{92988}{93038}- Herand the baby, they've gone-|- The baby?
{93041}{93092}- Yes'r.|- Was she-Were they all right?
{93095}{93161}Oh, yes'r.|They's all right, both of' em.
{93163}{93213}But she gone now.
{93215}{93285}The major come and took' em away|back to Liberty.
{93288}{93354}This here's a letter she gimme|to give to you, sir.
{93932}{93981}Poor kid.
{94030}{94090}I tried to get here, Pinkie,|but I- I just couldn't.
{94093}{94182}They got after me, and-|Did you see him?
{94184}{94269}Mr. Jesse, he's the cutest|little ol' thing I ever did see.
{94272}{94347}Just yellin' and a-hollerin'|so it'd nearly bust your ears.
{94350}{94452}I bet he's the loudest-yellin'|baby that ever was born.
{94455}{94520}- What color eyes he got, Pinkie?|- Blue.
{94522}{94604}Great big ol' blue eyes, big as a saucer.|Lookin' right at you, sir.
{94607}{94658}Does he look like Zee?
{94661}{94719}- Like you.|- Naw!
{94722}{94772}He's the spittin' image|of you, Mr. Jesse.
{94774}{94824}Well, I'll be doggoned.
{94826}{94905}'Ceptin' he's bald.|He's bald as a peeled egg.
{94908}{95012}But, my goodness, Mr. Jesse,|that sure is one cute little ol' baby.
{95015}{95067}Well, I'll be doggoned.
{95069}{95143}Just yellin',|wavin' his little ol' arm.
{95186}{95260}- Doggone.|- Yes'r, we was all mighty proud of that baby.
{95263}{95348}Lord, Lord.
{95350}{95408}I guess we'd better go after them, Pinkie.|When did they leave?
{95410}{95472}- They left Monday.|- On the train?
{95475}{95528}No, sir.|In the major's buggy.
{95531}{95598}Oh. I don't like that.
{95600}{95650}We'll have some supper,|and then we'll go after them.
{95652}{95704}- But, Mr. Jesse.|- Yes?
{95707}{95816}- I don't know if I'd go after' em right now.|- No? Why not?
{95818}{95869}They got that Mr. Wright|with 'em.
{95912}{96023}- Wright?|- Yes'r, the police marshall. He come too.
{96147}{96212}I see.
{96215}{96273}Never mind the supper, Pinkie.|We'll start right now.
{96275}{96363}- You mean after' em?|- Yes. Right now.
{97019}{97078}What did she say|about being unhappy?
{97080}{97148}It was just like|I told you, Mr. Jesse.
{97151}{97244}She said she's scared all the time,|and I know she cried a lot.
{97247}{97325}She said she don't know|how she could stand it.
{97328}{97377}I see.
{97523}{97608}- I guess I can't blame her.|- That's just what she says.
{97651}{97700}I guess it was|pretty bad for her.
{97736}{97795}Yes, sir, I guess it was.
{97938}{97992}Pinkie, I'm not going|any further.
{97995}{98066}You mean you ain't|goin' after' em?
{98068}{98136}I've changed my mind.
{98138}{98242}She's right. There ain't any happiness|to be found with me.
{98245}{98344}If she can find it at all,|it's- it's without me.
{98347}{98418}- Yes'r.|- Tell her that.
{98420}{98476}Tell her I ain't gonna|bother her anymore.
{98478}{98568}If she can be happy now,|I'm- I'm glad.
{98570}{98641}Tell her that... too.
{98643}{98692}Yes, sir.
{98724}{98816}- And, Pinkie, tell her-|- Yes, sir?
{98905}{99006}Tell her not to let the baby|know anything about me. I won't mind.
{100044}{100102}- Roy!|- Yes, sir.
{100104}{100161}Take an editorial|on dentists!
{100164}{100224}Yes, sir.
{100227}{100297}Paragraph.
{100300}{100378}If we are ever to have|law and order in the West...
{100412}{100472}the first thing|we've got to do...
{100475}{100524}is take out|all the dentists-
{100527}{100585}Choo-choo! Choo!
{100587}{100641}Clang! Clang!|Choo! Choo!
{100644}{100705}Choo! Choo!
{100707}{100801}Help! Help! Save me! Save my life!
{100804}{100905}...and shoot 'em down|like dogs.
{100992}{101070}- Save me! Save me!|Don't let him get hold of me!
{101073}{101148}- Help! Help!|- Stop it! Both of you!
{101151}{101209}Stop it. Stop it.
{101212}{101261}Stop it.
{101264}{101358}- He's worse than the child.|- Ah, but they're great fun.
{101360}{101426}How old is he?
{101429}{101516}- Just five.|- You don't say? Mine's going on three.
{101518}{101590}Wait a minute.|Here.
{101592}{101642}- Can he have a piece?|- Uh, yes.
{101745}{101804}- Ah. Say, "Thank you, sir."|- Thank you, sir.
{101807}{101886}Ah, you're welcome.|Wonderful child.
{101888}{101954}- Thank you.|- Are you the editor, sir?
{101957}{102048}I am, sir. What can I do|for you, my friend?
{102051}{102113}- I want to run this card in your next issue.|- Eh?
{102116}{102180}"George Remington.|Remington Bluing Company, Philadelphia."
{102183}{102233}- "Now at Dixie Belle Hotel."|- Mm-hmm.
{102236}{102312}- How much, sir?|- Oh, I guess about a dollar will cover it...
{102315}{102380}- Mr. Remington.|- There you are.
{102382}{102430}- Thank you, sir.|- And thank you very much.
{102433}{102509}- Good-bye. Good-bye.|- Good-bye. Roy! Set this-
{102511}{102621}By the way, didn't that fella Jesse James|come from somewheres around here?
{102623}{102727}He did. Why?
{102729}{102826}Then I suppose you're protesting against|this amnesty offer by the governor, aren't you?
{102829}{102939}- What amnesty offer?|- Haven't you heard?
{102941}{102997}Well, sir, it's an outrage.
{102999}{103097}In Jefferson City the other day, a friend|of mine, a banker, was telling me about it.
{103100}{103157}The governor has promised amnesty-|a clean pardon-
{103160}{103232}to any member of the James gang|that will kill Jesse.
{103235}{103286}And that's in addition|to the reward.
{103288}{103342}- Are you sure of that?|- Positive, sir.
{103345}{103407}But that makes the state|a party to murder!
{103409}{103523}- Exactly what I said.|- Why, the dirty rotten things they-
{103525}{103625}- Thank you, sir. Thank you for the news.|- Not at all, sir. Not at all.
{103628}{103725}- I'll just have time to get it|into this week's edition.|- Zee.
{103728}{103781}- And an editorial!|- Please.
{103784}{103834}That don't prove anything.|He might've got it all wrong.
{103837}{103899}It doesn't matter.|It doesn't matter to me.
{103901}{103969}- That's all over now.|- Roy!
{103972}{104041}- You got that editorial|on dentists started yet?|- Yes, sir.
{104044}{104092}Well, change it|from dentists to governors...
{104095}{104162}and finish it like the one|I did last week on horse thieves.
{104164}{104213}Except this time, it's governors.
{104525}{104614}Whoa. Morning.
{104672}{104754}- Nice day, isn't it?|- I don't wanna buy nothin'.
{104756}{104852}I'm not selling anything.
{104855}{104906}You're Mrs. Bob Ford,|aren't you?
{104967}{105053}I'm Mrs. Ford, all right, but if'n it's|about my husband, I don't know anythin'.
{105056}{105110}I ain't see'd him in months.
{105112}{105180}He rid off|with them James boys...
{105183}{105238}and I ain't see'd|hair nor hide of 'im since.
{105241}{105326}It's not him I was looking for,|Mrs. Ford. It's you.
{105329}{105380}I got this here|Liberty paper yesterday...
{105383}{105441}and it's got some news in it|that might interest you.
{105444}{105521}And, uh, here's my card.
{105524}{105612}That's all.
{105966}{106016}- Here.|- What is it?
{106018}{106068}You know I can't read.
{106288}{106336}What's it say?
{106720}{106770}Well?
{106961}{107046}The bank at Northfield, Minnesota,|is the strongest bank in the Northwest.
{107049}{107113}It's wide open for us.
{107115}{107165}They've got $50,000 in gold|in the safe...
{107168}{107240}and all we gotta do is walk in|with a shovel and help ourselves.
{107243}{107306}So that's what|we're gonna do.
{107360}{107408}Well?
{107456}{107530}Well, uh,|as a matter of fact, Jesse-
{107533}{107592}- Well?|- Well-
{107595}{107644}Say, what is this|anyhow?
{107647}{107745}For more than a month, there's been|something funny goin' on. Now, what is it?
{107746}{107815}Well, to tell you|the truth, Jesse...
{107817}{107898}we don't exactly know|if we like this idea or not.
{107900}{107974}For one thing, that's|a mighty strong bank at Northfield...
{107977}{108049}and it's a long ways away.
{108051}{108116}- And for another-|- Yeah, go on.
{108119}{108224}Well, I been talkin' it over|with some of the boys, and, uh-
{108227}{108276}and, uh-
{108279}{108344}Well, you're taking chances,|Jesse, that we don't like.
{108347}{108399}Now, I ain't no coward,|and you know it...
{108402}{108459}but some of the things|you've got us into, it-
{108461}{108512}It scared|the livin' daylights outta me.
{108515}{108563}- You're takin' too many chances.|- Shut up!
{108566}{108649}- Go on.|- We all know you got your troubles.
{108652}{108766}- Forget that.|- Maybe you don't care if you get|shot full of buckshot or not.
{108768}{108833}But the way we feel about it-
{108836}{108912}We got a lot of respect for you,|Jesse, and you know it.
{108915}{109022}But the way you're goin' on is just like|you was tryin' to commit suicide.
{109115}{109188}- And just who do you think you are?|- Now, listen, Jesse-
{109191}{109245}Go on! Reach!
{109360}{109412}So you talked things over, did you?
{109414}{109497}And who are you,|the captain of this band?
{109499}{109569}Who's handling these jobs,|you or me or somebody else?
{109571}{109621}Well, I'll tell you|if you don't know. It's me!
{109622}{109734}I'm doin' it, see. And I'll ride up|the capitol steps if I feel like it.
{109841}{109935}So you talked it over, huh?|Without me.
{109937}{110066}Well, I don't like it, and it ain't|the way I aim to have things.
{110069}{110121}If that's the way you want it,|I give you leave now-
{110124}{110174}all of you-|to talk it over again.
{110177}{110264}Now. Outside.|Go on! Get out!
{110296}{110346}Now listen here, Jesse.
{110348}{110404}Yes, and you too.
{110407}{110456}You talked it over with 'em.
{110459}{110537}You think I need you-any of you?
{110539}{110619}You think I can't get a thousand men|to come in tomorrow morning with Jesse James?
{110621}{110690}Well, if you don't,|you're crazy. Now get out!
{111116}{111183}He acts like he's going crazy.
{111186}{111238}Ah, he gets worse every day.
{111240}{111305}I'll kill him for that,|if it's my last act.
{111364}{111438}Wait for me down at the creek.|I wanna talk to him.
{111800}{111849}Well?
{111852}{111902}In the first place, Jesse,|I just want you to understand...
{111904}{111977}I ain't a-scared of you|and I ain't a-scared of your guns.
{111980}{112029}So if you get to feelin'|like shootin'...
{112032}{112086}you just start drawin',|and I'll start drawin' too.
{112088}{112142}- Is that what you came back to tell me?|- No.
{112145}{112243}- That's to clear your conscience|if you get to feelin' ornery.|- I'll remember.
{112245}{112328}What I come back to tell you|was, you're a skunk.
{112420}{112534}- Wanna draw?|- Go on.
{112536}{112642}You're mean, Jesse,|and you're gettin' meaner every day.
{112644}{112726}I don't know if you're goin' crazy or not,|but sometimes it looks like it.
{112729}{112819}Ever since you come back from St. Joe,|it's been lookin' like it.
{112821}{112878}For one thing, there ain't enough money|in the world to take the chances...
{112881}{112952}you been makin' us take|the last year or two.
{112955}{113019}And for another, you wouldn't be slappin'|an old friend like Tom-
{113021}{113106}and him a slow draw-|if you was in your right mind.
{113109}{113180}So you're either crazy|or you're a skunk.
{113229}{113295}Go on.|Draw if you feel like it.
{113345}{113426}You go on.
{113429}{113497}You're my brother, Jesse. You're my|kid brother, and I reckon I love you.
{113547}{113621}But it ain't provin' anything|to let you get my head blowed off...
{113624}{113674}or your own.
{113675}{113752}I know how you feel about what happened|after the baby was born.
{113792}{113854}And I know you don't like|to get talked to this way...
{113857}{113971}but it's either this or see you get|"blammed" right outta your pants.
{113974}{114038}Somebody had to tell you|before it was too late.
{114104}{114166}So, what do you figure|you wanna do about it?
{114272}{114320}I'm sorry, Frank.
{114367}{114461}- Want me to fetch 'em back?|- Can you?
{114463}{114513}Sure, I can.
{114515}{114577}- Frank.|- Hmm?
{114580}{114656}- Much obliged.|- You're welcome, kid.
{114870}{114950}- Jesse.|- Bob?
{114953}{115016}- It's me.|- Come in.
{115146}{115233}- Where is everybody?|- They'll be back after a while.
{115597}{115696}- What's the matter with you?|- Nothing.
{115699}{115782}- Sit down.|- Nothing's the matter.
{116051}{116130}- I been to see my wife.|- I know.
{116300}{116370}- Hi, Bob.|- Hiya, fellas.
{116371}{116453}- I'm sorry.|- It's all right, Jesse. I understand.
{116456}{116518}Northfield's|all right with us.
{116521}{116591}Good. We'll get going|at daylight.
{116594}{116670}Northfield's 450 miles from here.|We oughta make it by Friday.
{116672}{116755}We'll hole up just outside of town|overnight and jump the bank|about noon on Saturday.
{116757}{116873}If it's as rich as they say it is,|why, maybe we can all retire then.
{116875}{116933}Sound all right to everyone?
{116935}{117003}That's fine.|Very fine.
{117371}{117428}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{117431}{117480}- Mr. Layworth?|- Right over there, sir.
{117483}{117532}Thank you.

{118279}{118329}- What does it mean?|- It's the James gang.
{118332}{118418}- They're on their way here.|- Here? The James gang?
{118421}{118487}- Mm-hmm.|- The James gang!
{118489}{118539}- To rob my bank?|- That's it.
{118542}{118596}Great thunderin' hallelujah!|That's ruin!
{118599}{118671}They'll take everything!|I've got $50,000!
{118673}{118743}Shh. Easy, easy.|There's no danger.
{118745}{118795}Don't you see?|I'm here.
{118798}{118847}Yeah, but-but-but-
{120619}{120668}Why, Cousin Bushrod!

{122568}{122643}I'll have to get the money from the safe.|Will you wait, please?
{123017}{123106}- Holy smoke.|- Come on!
{123368}{123418}- Tom. Come on, Tom.|- It's no use.

{125658}{125715}We gotta keep goin', son.|Hold on.
{125717}{125795}Hold tight, Jesse,|'cause there's only one way outta here.
{125798}{125847}Are ya holdin' on?
{125924}{125973}Giddyap!
{126343}{126420}Jesse!|Jesse!
{126832}{126906}Hurry up, boys. Hurry up.|He's in here somewhere.
{128354}{128470}"Of the eight bandits who attempted|the raid on the Northfield bank...
{128472}{128535}"two are dead|and four are prisoners.
{128538}{128631}"But of the two leaders,|there is less definite news.
{128634}{128764}"Reports yesterday indicated|that Frank James had made good his escape.
{128766}{128850}"But of Jesse James,|there is no news at all.
{128852}{128937}"The beliefis|that he was drowned.
{128940}{129035}"But if he escaped,|he is thought to be badly wounded...
{129037}{129087}and unable to travel far."
{129089}{129182}Holy dag-blasted...
{129185}{129245}goldang city police!
{129248}{129297}- Roy!|- Yes, sir?
{129300}{129379}I'm gonna write me|an editorial!
{129414}{129469}"If he escaped."
{129545}{129619}- You gotta stop it, Zee. You got to.|- I know it.
{129622}{129676}He ain't the Jesse|you knew and loved.
{129678}{129739}That fella's gone,|gone a long time ago.
{129742}{129811}I kinda liked him too.|But not this fella. Not this bad one.
{129813}{129902}This one, I could-|Well, if I ever come on him again-
{129904}{129973}- If he escaped-|- Can't you understand, Zee? He's no good.
{129976}{130025}It's like I told you that time.
{130028}{130077}Once you let yourself go,|the way he did, you can't stop.
{130079}{130170}He ain't a knight anymore fightin'|a bad railroad. He's a wild animal.
{130172}{130223}You can't love him. Nobody can.
{130226}{130341}Why, everybody that liked him,|he's done wrong to.
{130343}{130425}And with his men gone,|he hasn't a friend left...
{130428}{130481}not a friend in the world.
{130484}{130538}That's right too, isn't it?
{130602}{130653}Not a friend in the world.
{130886}{130935}Ho.
{131157}{131260}Hey. Hey, you. You. We're here.
{131450}{131508}Thank you.
{131616}{131674}- Keep your mouth shut.|- Thank you. Thank you very kindly.
{131743}{131796}- Do you think you can make it?|- Yeah.
{131902}{131976}- Do you need some help?|- No. I'm all right.
{131978}{132030}- You go ahead.|- Giddyap.
{133877}{133954}Oh, my poor, poor darling.
{133956}{134015}My poor, hurt darling.
{134157}{134261}Zee? Is it really you?
{134264}{134359}I knew, if you could,|you'd come here.
{134362}{134429}That's why I came.
{134432}{134481}I knew you'd come.
{134511}{134567}What's left of me.
{134608}{134672}But... I'll get you well.
{134701}{134761}Wait.
{134821}{134871}Jesse.
{134873}{134940}Hurry, Pinkie.|Hurry.
{135425}{135483}Well, I'll be doggone.
{135696}{135745}It's Daddy, dear.
{136016}{136064}My son.
{136106}{136184}Oh, Mommy.
{136186}{136241}Daddy's been hurt, dear,|but he'll be all right.
{136298}{136352}Well, I'll be doggone.
{136445}{136504}Doggone.
{136537}{136587}Don't you think|he's big for five?
{136759}{136846}Does he- Does he|know anything about me yet?
{136849}{136912}No, not yet.
{137102}{137168}Oh, Zee.
{137170}{137271}Is it-|Is it too late?
{137273}{137359}Could we-|Could we still go away?
{137362}{137423}To California?
{137426}{137489}No, it isn't too late.
{137492}{137542}We'll go just as soon|as you get well.
{137545}{137600}Pinkie's gone|to get the doctor now.
{137633}{137723}Oh, Jesse,|I do love you so.
{138304}{138362}Jesse.
{138365}{138423}- You mustn't do that.|- Oh, go on. I'm all right.
{138425}{138508}But Pinkie will take care|of all that, darling.
{138510}{138595}Ah, Zee.|Kinda happy, ain't ya?
{138597}{138650}Aren't you?
{138653}{138771}Oh, Jesse, if we were|just leaving today, this very hour.
{138772}{138846}- Nothing's gonna stop us, honey.|- Oh, I hope not.
{138906}{138959}But I'm scared, Jesse.
{138961}{139052}I'll be scared every second|until we're on our way...
{139054}{139126}maybe until|we get to California.
{139129}{139194}Well, we-we won't have|any money, remember.
{139196}{139298}- That money I hid in the hills-|- I don't want you to talk about that anymore.
{139301}{139380}We'll make money-|money we won't be ashamed of.
{139382}{139448}- I wasn't ashamed of that mon-|- Stop it, I say.
{139451}{139533}Mr. Howard.
{139536}{139597}- Yes?|- There's two gentlemen to see you, sir.
{139692}{139756}- What do they want?|- You knows 'em, sir.
{139788}{139880}Oh. All right.
{139882}{139936}He's human, ain't he?
{140081}{140130}Well, hello, Bob.|How are ya?
{140132}{140183}I'm all right, I reckon.|How are you, Jesse?
{140185}{140261}I'm still totin' some lead around|inside of me, but it doesn't bother me any.
{140264}{140333}- This here's my brother, Charlie.|- Hello, Charlie.
{140336}{140386}Oh, Pinkie,|get us some coffee.
{140388}{140436}- Yes, sir.|- Sit down, Bob.
{140498}{140557}Looks like|you come a long way. It's hot.
{140617}{140690}I escaped. They couldn't hold me.
{140693}{140755}Me and two fellas you don't know|jumped over a wall.
{140758}{140825}How'd you know where I was?
{140828}{140896}We seen Frank. He sent us.
{140898}{140948}That's what we come|to see you about.
{140951}{141007}How's Frank? Where is he?
{141009}{141103}He's fine. He's up in the hills.
{141106}{141156}He's aimin' to come down pretty soon.
{141159}{141210}That's what he wanted us|to see you about.
{141213}{141255}Jesse.
{141348}{141415}- Are you going to be long?|- You remember Bob Ford, honey.
{141418}{141512}- That's his brother, Charlie.|- Howdy, Miss Zee.
{141514}{141569}- Are you going to be long?|- Go on now. Stop your frettin'.
{141572}{141644}I'll be up in just a minute.
{141748}{141850}What Frank wanted us to tell ya|is if you feel strong enough,|he wants you to meet him.
{141853}{141972}- He's at the Platte Bank.|- No. I'm going to California.
{141974}{142087}- Frank's mighty anxious.|- Sorry. My mind's made up.
{142090}{142167}There ain't even a marshall in town.|There's a farm payroll there on the seventh.
{142170}{142218}Frank's got three men|that know their business.
{142221}{142299}He don't figure it'll be any trouble at all.|Just walk in and take it.
{142794}{142843}No.
{142906}{142956}If you got plenty of money|to get a start in California...
{142958}{143010}you don't even need|to think about it.
{143012}{143076}But if you was to need|a bankroll, why-
{143185}{143275}I haven't got much money,|hardly any money at all.
{143578}{143627}What else did Frank say?
{143667}{143721}He says it's the easiest|job he ever seen.
{143724}{143786}He says it won't take|more than a day to look it over.
{143787}{143861}And then if you're set on goin'|to the coast, you got some money.
{143901}{143950}We sure could use|some money.
{143952}{144027}The way this is, it's just like pickin' it|up off the ground.
{144080}{144138}- When did he wanna meet me?|- He says right away.

{144201}{144270}I wanna come in!|I wanna come in!
{144273}{144322}He can't go in.|He'll spoil the game!
{144325}{144414}All right. Come in,|but stop that hollerin'.
{144417}{144499}Frank figures we oughta clear|about 2,000 apiece.
{144560}{144628}Sure could use $2,000.
{144630}{144725}- Daddy! Daddy!|- Oh, those kids. Just a minute.
{144777}{144871}- Oh, excuse me, Mr. James.|- Howard.
{144873}{144926}Are you gonna walk around|outside with them guns?
{144929}{145006}No. You're right.
{145008}{145100}Bang! Bang! Bang!
{145102}{145187}Bang! Bang!|Bring him down!
{145406}{145504}- We didn't hurt him, Mr. Howard.|- We just killed him. That's part of the game.
{145506}{145557}He's such a little fella.|You shouldn't play so rough with him.
{145560}{145617}- That's the way you gotta play outlaw.|- He's Jesse James.
{145620}{145707}- He's gotta die.|- I'll die, but they stick me with sticks.
{145709}{145776}- Just shoot me. Don't stick me.|- Bang! Bang!
{145778}{145847}- Bang! Bang!|- You're Jesse James. You're dead.
{145849}{145898}I'm dead.
{146074}{146123}Go home, boys.
{146877}{146950}Get him ready.|We're catching the afternoon train.
{146952}{147012}Pinkie can follow|with whatever we can't carry.
{147043}{147091}That suit you?
{147140}{147190}Oh, thank goodness, Jesse.
{147404}{147487}I'm sorry Bob. Tell Frank I'm sorry.|I'll write to him from California.
{147488}{147562}- You mean you ain't gonna come with us?|- That's it.
{147565}{147634}- What'll Frank say to that?|- It can't make much difference what he says.
{147637}{147686}I ain't goin' to him,|and that's all there is to it.
{147689}{147738}Bye, Charlie.|Nice to meet ya.
{147741}{147823}Bye, Bob. I'm sorry you had to come|all the way up here for nothing.
{147826}{147875}What'll we tell Frank?
{147878}{147974}Tell him he'd better come join me|while the joining's still good.
{147977}{148035}#Oh, Mr. Howard|We've got to run #
{148038}{148139}- # For we're going to California-#|- #With a banjo on our knee #
{148198}{148259}Ah, Zee.
{148261}{148315}- Honey, what can I do to help?|- Oh, Jesse, that.
{148318}{148374}Oh, you can|bet your life. Zee.
{148414}{148472}#'Cause we're going|to California #
{148474}{148553}#On a train this afternoon ##
{149192}{149243}Jesse!
{149310}{149388}Pinkie!
{149390}{149471}Oh, Jesse.|Jesse.
{149504}{149567}Oh, Jesse!
{149618}{149673}There ain't no question|about it.
{149676}{149794}Jesse was an outlaw,|a bandit, a criminal.
{149796}{149918}Even those that loved him|ain't got no answer to that.
{149921}{150005}But we ain't ashamed of him.|I don't know why...
{150008}{150119}but I don't think even America|is ashamed of Jesse James.
{150122}{150198}Maybe it's because|he was bold and lawless...
{150201}{150290}like we, all of us,|like to be sometimes.
{150293}{150368}Maybe it's because|we understand a little...
{150371}{150426}that he wasn't|altogether to blame...
{150429}{150478}for what his times|made him.
{150481}{150547}Maybe it's because|for 10 years...
{150550}{150620}he licked the tar|outta five states.
{150623}{150742}Or maybe it's because he was|so good at what he was doin'.
{150745}{150820}I don't know.|All I do know is...
{150822}{150916}he was one of the|doggonedest, goldangedest...
{150918}{150978}dag-blamedest buckaroos...
{150981}{151107}that ever rode across|these United States of America!

So you're John Longhorn eh?
Well John, let's see.
Yep, Uncle Sam has a nice, tidy little something for you, John.
The earnings and interest on your oil lands amounts to just $4000.
Sign your name right here.
Oh, Chris Morrell, step up here will you please?
Hello Nina.
The money from Nina's mother's oil land is amounting to quite a pile.
About $50,000 right now.
If you can locate Nina's father and get his signature to these documents, then Nina will still remain the ward of the
United States government, but you will be her guardian, legally.
[Chris] That ought to be simple enough.
Or if you can bring evidence or proof that her father is dead, then that will clear the situation.
I've got a pretty fair idea that he's still alive.
Well, what did you find out?
The half-breed kid's worth 50,000 right now and if Chris Morrell locates the kid's father and he signs the papers the agent give him, as her guardian Morrell gets $50,000.
Oh, he does?
That is, if he gets to the kid's father before we get to him.
Where are we going, Daddy Chris?
We're headin' north.
Why are we moving away?
I like it here.
To see if we can find your real daddy and if we can, well we may able to scrape up enough money to send you away to school.
But I don't wanna go to school.
I wanna be a cowboy like you.
Aw, girls can't be cowboys.
Can too, I can ride as well as you can.
But you still can't be a cowboy.
What do you want?
I guess you know what we want.
There's no use of beatin' around the bush.
We came here for Nina and we're willin' to offer you a fair proposition for her.
If that's all you came for, you might just as well leave right now.
Now don't get hostile
Chris, you know as well as we do that Sam Black runs things in these parts.
When he sends us out to get the girl, we're gonna get her.
Besides, he's been mighty good to you, offerin' to cut you in on that oil money.
Well anyway, she isn't here.
You can tell Sam Black for me that she's left this part of the country for good.
You can also tell him that if he'd had the nerve to come himself instead of sending you renegades, that I'd have shoved that offer right down his throat.
Now come on, get outta here, all of ya.
We'll get out, maybe she ain't here but we're not givin' up that easy.
We're watchin' you and we're watchin' the place, so don't think you're gettin' away with nothin'.
Can I come out now Daddy Chris?
Oh!
Get her!
Come on Daddy Chris, hit 'em!
Look out, it's me!
What's that?
He's gone.
He got plum away from us.
We better get Sam Black and go after him.
Goodbye little pardner.
You want me to ride all alone?
Well it's the only way out for us.
What about you Daddy Chris?
Oh me, I'll be all right.
Now you ride to the second bend below and you'll hit Snake
Trail, you understand?
Uh huh.
And when you get to Bud Moore's ranch tell him that I sent you.
Tell him where I am and that I'm needin' help.
There's his tracks.
Shorty, you stay with the horses.
The rest of you scatter around that thicket.
Hey fellas, I got him, I got him!
Come on boys, Sam's got him.
Thought you said you got him.
I had him all right, but I guess he got away.
You guess he got away?
He sent that kid on alone while he stayed here to cover the trail, and that kid means $50,000 bucks to us.
Ahh, heeya!
Ahh, heeya, ha!
Get out and see if you can round up them horses.
Is this the Moore ranch?
Used to be, but it's mine now.
Well maybe you could tell me where I can find Bud Moore.
He ain't here.
Oh!
You ain't goin' nowhere.
Let go of that youngster Vic.
You been a hollerin' for kitchen help, well here it is.
Well, what are you doin' here?
Daddy sent me to find Bud Moore and he said he'd take care of me.
We'll take care of ya all right.
Go on, get in the house.
Now you let her alone, if she's gonna help me, I'll take care of her.
All right.
You ain't scared o' me are ya?
Aw you needn't worry none about him as long as I'm here.
Come on, let's go in the house huh?
Now now, there ain't nobody here but you and me.
Up you go there.
Now then, what's your name honey?
Nina Morrell.
Is your pop's name Chris?
Yes, you know him?
Yeah, I used to.
How come he ain't with ya?
Sam Black and his gang were after us and we only had one horse, so Daddy Chris told me to get on and ride him and--
Okay.
Oh Mr. Norton would you order that bowl of calico for me?
I will Miss Clara.
You haven't seen my brother Jim--
No, I haven't.
I thought if he were in town, he might want to ride back with me.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Help!
I'll meet you at the old ranch.
Help, help!
Help, help, help!
I've been robbed, a fellow with a checkered shirt, black hat, and he had a black handkerchief across his face.
No, I tell ya I can't be mistaken.
He had on a checkered shirt and a black hat.
Why, he took $6000 from me and stuffed it into a gunny sack.
- Which way did he go?
- Well I don't know which way he went.
So you can see for yourself there's nothing else for me to do but turn you over to the sheriff.
Seriously ma'am, you've got the wrong man.
Well why are you wearing the checkered shirt and the black hat?
Not to mention the gunny sack.
If I knew who these belonged to,
I'd know who robbed the express office.
You mean they don't belong to you?
That's what I mean.
You expect me to believe that?
Well I hope you will.
And if I did, what would you do?
Well, first I'd see that my little pardner was safe, then I'd find the man that belongs to this shirt.
You wouldn't run away?
Do you think I would?
No, I don't think so.
Where'd you send your little partner?
To Bud Moore's ranch down River Valley.
Bud Moore?
Yes, I used to ride herd with him in the panhandle, you know him?
Why yes, he's my brother.
That is, he was my brother.
I don't quite get you.
Bud's dead.
- Oh.
He was killed in a range war last year.
Oh I'm sorry.
It was a bit of a shock at first, but
I guess you can get used to anything.
Well, did Bud ever mention my name?
Chris Morrell?
Are you Chris Morrell?
Why he used to say you were the best friend a man ever had.
I guess that's puttin' it pretty strong, ma'am.
Clara.
Come on let's go up to my place and change that shirt.
There'll be a lot of people looking for it.
Yes, ma'am, I mean Clara.
Nina's mother was a full blood old sage.
She married a good for nothing white man who left her two months before the kid was born.
Her mother died.
Hello Clara.
Chris, this is my brother Jim.
I'll make you some coffee before you go.
Well thanks ma'am, I mean Clara.
So you're Jim.
What about it?
Nothing, only I came to for a minute when you changed shirts with me at the creek.
Well why don't ya tell her?
In the first place, because it'd break her heart.
In the second place, because snakes like you usually die of their own poison.
What was that noise?
Why, Jim was showin' me his gun and it dropped out of his hand.
Have some coffee Jim?
Not now, later.
I'm glad to have met you.
Same to you.
How do you like Jim?
Well some men are like books written in a strange language, and that makes it awfully hard to read them.
I hope I wasn't wrong in reading you, Chris.
Oh no, ma'am.
You were telling me about
Nina just before Jim came in.
Well Nina--
That guy recognized you, he knows you pulled that job at the express office.
I told you not to stop.
Well I thought it'd be a good way to hang it on him and leave us in the clear.
Where's the money?
The old hollow stump.
Let's go get it.
In order to protect her interests, we started out to find Nina's father.
Sam Black and his gang figured that she was worth a lot of money.
Luckily, I got the best of them and stampeded their horses and made a getaway.
Well I guess I'd better be going.
Oh no, you'd better take this one, it's Jim's.
Thank you.
You'll bring Nina back won't you?
I sure will, Clara.
Thanks a lot.
Goodbye Chris.
Here pig, pig, pig
- Oink, oink, oink.
Pig, pig, pig, pig-
Hey kid, come here.
What's your name?
Nina Morrell.
- Nina Morrell?
- Yes, sir.
Daddy Chris is my daddy.
How come?
She rode in lookin' for Bud Moore.
Vic made her stay.
I didn't know Chris was a squaw man.
He ain't, neither.
What do you mean?
She ain't his kid, she's your kid.
How do you know?
Chris and me was there when she was born and for two days after when your wife died.
Come here kid, I want to talk to ya.
I'll bet that's the bunch that belongs to
Sam Black and his gang.
Gosh, I wish I had somethin' to put on my dogs, they're sure sore.
Well it was your fault for lettin'
Morrell stampede the horses, now go find him.
Well where'll I go?
I don't know of any place around here to get horses.
I don't care where you get 'em, get 'em.
Hey you fellas, wait a minute!
Wait a minute there.
Them's our horses.
- Who's ours?
Sam Black and the boys.
Sam Black?
That's the man I wanna see.
Well come on, we're camped right over yonder.
Got our horses back.
- Sam Black?
- That's me.
You lookin' for a half-breed kid named Nina Morrell?
- You said it.
- I got her.
What's the idea?
I'll exchange if you count me in.
For how much?
10,000 and--
What's the and for?
Chris Morrell's scalp, do you know him?
Yeah, where do I find him?
Clara Moore's homestead,
I'll show ya how to get there.
You're on.
Good, you cut me in for 10,000 and bring the scalp of
Chris Morrell to my ranch and I'll turn the kid over to ya.
Where's your place?
Here, I'll show ya how to get from the Moore homestead to my ranch.
Why Matt Downing, you old buzzard.
Chris Morrell.
I know from the what the kid said you couldn't be far away.
Well is she all right?
Where is she?
At the Byrd ranch, used to be Bud Moore's.
Dad's there too.
- Her dad?
Yeah, come on, I'll tell you all about it on the way.
It's a cinch.
All right, I'll be seein' ya, come on fellas.
50/50 on that money for the kid.
Sure, but we'll go split that express money first.
Look!
Vic got me.
Vic Byrd?
He made me rob the express office and he got the money.
You know where he went?
Yeah, to the ranch to get your kid.
To give her to Sam Black.
Please don't tell my sister about me.
Get him into a doctor, quick, and bring the sheriff back with you.
Where's Chris Morrell?
- He's gone.
- Where?
I don't know.
Take a look inside, she might be lyin'.
- There's nobody inside.
- All right.
You're ridin' with us, maybe you can remember where he went.
Look out now, look out, hold on tight,
I'm gonna buck ya!
Hold on now, oh he's a regular old sun fish this horse is.
What's the idea?
Well you see, she's my kid, Vic.
I just found it out, my kid.
Yeah, well she's worth
10,000 bucks to me.
What do you mean?
I told Sam Black I'd turn her over for 10,000.
Well you're out of luck, she's worth more than that to me.
You better change your mind, Tom.
You heard me.
You keep your hands off my kid.
I ain't takin' orders from you.
Daddy, Daddy Chris!
Sam Black and his gang.
- Look out, Chris!
They won't get my kid.
Who told you she was yours?
Matt told me, and Vic told me about
Sam Black and his gang wantin' her.
I got an idea without us takin' any more chances.
Empty.
Hey fellas!
One left.
Fellas!
Hey you!
Hey you fellas!
Hey there, trade you the woman for the kid.
How about it?
Hey fellas, what's the matter with ya, ya deaf?
Trade you the woman for the kid, did you get it?
No, not in a million years!
Don't worry little pardner, I wouldn't give you up for anything.
Hey Sam Black, are you listenin'?
Yeah, say it.
- How'd you like to trade me for the woman?
- Sure.
You're on, come out with your hands in the air and we'll send the woman at the same time.
Only one cartridge left, and I've got an idea.
Come on.
Come on.
Be sure and use that last bullet right.
Goodbye, cowboy.
Keep going Clara, no matter what happens.
Now rush 'em.
Help!
Help!
That kid's comin' with me.
Oh no she's not.
Where's Nina?
Black took her.
Naughty, naughty!

So don't come back without it.
All right.
We'll get him when he comes out.
Come on.
What was that?
Sounds like Duke.
That's just why I've got to go
Get back there.
Get out of here.
Take this.
Hurry up, boys, and be careful. with a horse that's gone bad.
Granddaddy. You're not gonna let them kill Duke.
We'll have to abide by the judge's decision. over a poor little horse.
All ready, Your Honor
Oh. what all this ruckus is about.
Uh, I'd like to say a word, judge.
Oh, you must believe me.
Why, yes. He don't seem to bother her.
I'm trying this case.
Miss Ruth, I'd keep away from that horse if I was you.
I am about to pass sentence in this case.
Just a moment, judge.
I'll fine you for contempt of court.
Shut that gate
He's ready to go.
It's a bet,
Henry.
Stay on him!
Foul! He throwed the horse!
He sure knows horse flesh, honey.
All right.
Yes they could, all right.
Because it's a meeting of the vigilantes. of this killer and his gang for good and all?
Maybe he could tell us how to catch a hawk.
We need 'em.
Sit down, old man. Sit down. now's the time to speak up. like to back up his own idea
It's the least we can do for him.
I'll be on hand.
Well, I guess that's about all.
Well, good luck, Drury.
Thank you.
Thanks.
All right. John. if he met up with the Hawk.
Oh, gosh,
I sure love to dance.
Well, why don't you try it sometime?
A birth of a teardrop?
The birth of a smile
When we meet
In the after a while
Do you wonder that we're all afraid of him?
I promise to be on guard.
I don't think it's right.
What on earth is Duke up to now? if I know what
Duke's up to.
Well, Duke, would you like to go Hawk hunting with me
But that settles it.
Don't worry, Ruth,
I won't forget
Bye-bye.
Bye.
All set to go.
Let's go.
We may as well rest here a while.
Whoa
Huh?
Stay here, boy, and cool off.
You won't be needin' a guide much longer. and a dead shot. with a shootin' iron yourself, Sims
You can take care of yourself, all right.
Why, n-no.
Well, that's the kind of shooting I'd like to see.
Come on. Get up.
Go ahead.
Ah. Let's keep back.
Catchin' hawks is out of your line.
You won't have much use for this, I reckon. with old Sol to keep you company.
Well, you're gonna play it all by yourself. food in your saddlebags...
Just a step away.
Adios, amigo.
Oh, here he comes now.
He's inside, boss.
Howdy, boss.
All right.
Saddle up, men.
Come on, boy.
Keep it up, boy.
Come on, Duke.
Oh!
My boy!
Oh, my boy. Jimmy!
But Sims is just the man
I want to see.
All right, Grandpa.
There. Hm?
Looks like a mouth organ.
Heh.
What's this?
"J.D." and scour the desert for John Drury.
Let's go.
Whoa, boys.
Come on.
Stick'em up!
All right, boys, let's get goin'. with you now, Ronald?
Oh.
Bring him over there. till after the trial.
And the prisoner will get every consideration.
Sims?
Heh. It's my duty to stay here and protect this sick man. the court appoints you persecutin' attorney. in plain cow-countryman talk
He sure is. you may proceed.
Hey, here he comes now.
Oh, look.
Who's this comin'?
Get out of sight, men.
Why, uh...
They may be hanging him now.
Let's ride, men. when we were out on the desert.
Objection overruled. unnecessary and extraneous.
Have you got anything furt her to say for yourself?
That's all.
I forgot.
All right, miss. retire to deliberate.
The jury will rise.
And don't spend too much time arguin'. and you can recommend hanging. from hanging an innocent man.
I know John Drury is innocent, judge.
Henry Sims.
I tell you that
Henry Sims is the Hawk
Come on.
Stick'em up.
We got 'em all covered. and I'm takin' company.
Keep back, Gaunt.
Let me go. Stop!
Get in there.
Get around that wall there.
Duke, come on!
And be sure you're slow about doin' it.
Hold 'em now.
All right.
Come on, boys.
Ronald, wail till I-
Aw, Ronald.
Oh, it's the boss.
Take care of him on the inside.
Lock that door.
Let me go.
Make yourself at home for a while. you and I'll be on our way across the border.
Ronald, come on.
Now, now- What-?
I've ever seen.
Hey.
Come on, quick.
Now!
The boss is in trouble.
A little harder, fellas.
Look out,
John!
Stick 'em up!
Get their guns, boys.
Get back there!
Reach for the ceilin' there!
Go ahead.
There's the 23rd marker, sir.
Twenty-three miles in one hour and 14 minutes.
Gentlemen, that is moving.
Our engineer is trying to set a record on the first run.
But I doubt if we can maintain this speed on our regular schedule.
Why not? If this train can do it, the rest of them can.
Providing Col. Dodge's new town is worth speeding to reach.
Worth it? You wait and see.
Now it's just the end of the line, but in a few years... it'll give your railroad more business than any town west of Chicago.
I hope you're right, Colonel. You've stuck to that argument for five years.
Why shouldn't I?
I've raised that town from two hog pens and a buffalo waller.
How big is it now, Colonel?
Well, at the last census, gentlemen, they had three buffalo wallers.
Look, there goes the stagecoach from Wichita.
We'll be carrying the mail from now on.
Listen to that snorting teapot.
She's already winded.
By Jove, we'll run her into the ground.
Better put your whip to them.
- Willie?
- Yes, sir, boss?
You go up and tell our engineer... if that stagecoach beats us to the end of the line, he's fired.
Yes, sir. And if this train go any faster...
I'm gonna get off and walk...
'cause I don't like this zest of the Lord.
By George, he's making a good showing, you know it.
- We'll get him.
- We'd better get up some speed here.
- There he goes.
- We've got him.
Gentlemen, that's a symbol of America's future: progress.
Iron men and iron horses.
You can't beat them.
Lucky devils.
Nothing to do, but eat and sleep.
That's right, hardhead.
The only difference between you and them is a pair of horns.
Hush.
Say, Wade, let's cut out a couple of them.
No. We've killed our last buffalo, boys.
The railroad's finished and so is our contract.
Besides, we've a little appointment to keep, you know.
Come on.
Here comes our meal ticket for the last six months.
So that's what a steam engine looks like: a coffeepot on wheels.
Come on, let's pay our respects to the Colonel.
- Hello, Colonel. How are you?
- Fine, son. See you soon.
We'll be there.
By golly, Dodge, you know everybody in Kansas.
Not quite.
Those boys have been working for us... hunting buffalo to feed our construction gang.
The young Irishman is Wade Hatton.
I met him during the war.
He fought for the rebels in Jeb Stuart's cavalry.
Been everywhere, done everything.
Sort of a rover.
Well, it takes all sorts of men to build a railroad.
No, sir. Just a couple of us Irishmen.
On your toes, men!
We're gonna start moving.
Watch those hides they don't slip.
Keep on your toes.
We're gonna start moving.
You drivers keep close together.
Ready to start whenever you say, Jeff.
All right, let's move fast!
- Which one of you men is Jeff Surrett?
- I am. Why?
I'm John Barlow, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, from Kansas.
- You're under arrest. All three of you.
- For what?
For the illegal killing of buffalo and selling their hides.
We got those buffalo on free land, just the same as he did.
He has a government permit to kill buffalo for the railroad workers.
- You got any such permit?
- No.
- Is this some of your business, Hatton?
- I made it my business.
As soon as I found out you were shooting buffalo on Indian territory... stealing the hides, and letting the meat rot in the sun.
When any Indians protested, you shot them down in cold blood.
This has been going on all winter.
It took you till now to catch up with us?
We didn't want to. We just watched you and counted the animals you killed.
You're lying. You'd have made them stop us before, if you'd known.
Why? It seemed a better idea to let you and your pals work your head off... packing and curing those hides until they caught you.
So that's why you waited so long?
The Indians might just as well get the hides in good salable condition.
All right, Hatton.
But I hope you stick around Kansas for a long time... because we're gonna collect for every one of those hides in full.
Right. If you're ever around our way, look us up.
All right, boys.
- Congratulations, Colonel.
- Thanks, Rusty.
Wade, you've been a great help in building this railroad.
Now the real work begins.
We've got to make it pay.
That's up to you.
No, it isn't. I've got other work to do.
We're looking further westward.
I want you to take charge here, help build up this town.
- Organize trade for our road.
- No, thanks, sir.
We're on our way back to Texas.
We'll drive cattle up to meet your railroad.
If we keep hanging around here, these two galoots are gonna get civilized.
We better leave here before old fog head starts eating with a knife and fork.
A knife, anyway.
You couldn't keep Wade here, Colonel.
He's the most moving-on man you ever saw.
First off, he was in the English Army over in India.
Then he got mixed up in some kind of a hooray revolution down in Cuba way.
Then he started punching cattle in Texas.
That was before he enlisted in the war.
So he's either the greatest traveler ever lived... or else he is the biggest liar.
And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you... the man who made this progress possible:
Col. Dodge.
Ladies and gentlemen... today a great chapter of history has been written... and we take justifiable pride... in bringing this railroad to the terminal furthest west in this country.
Someday, and I believe it will be in the near future... a great city will spring from this very spot upon which we now stand.
A city which will represent all that the West stands for: honesty, courage, morality, and culture.
For all the noble virtues of civilization.
I can see a great metropolis of homes, churches, schools.
A fine, decent city, which will become the flower of the prairie.
A city whose name...
Yeah, Colonel. Just what do you aim to call this here perfect metropolis?
What are we going to call it?
Why not call it after the man who made it possible? Dodge City.
That's right. Dodge City it is.
Be sure to give those cattle plenty of salt.
The more water, the more weight.
Cattle is sure some business.
They must come to Dodge City from all over the world, don't they, Pop?
Almost, son. Hold my horse.
Wait, Surrett. You can't ship those cattle.
Where's my money?
You'll get it, Cole.
Why don't you stop worrying?
You've got no right to ship those cattle until I'm paid.
$15,000 dollars, cash in hand.
Those were the terms we agreed on.
Take it easy. I can't be running to the bank every time a train leaves town.
If you don't trust me, other cattle brokers will.
Maybe they used to, Surrett... but not since what happened to Sam Chapin and Kit Sproull.
They trusted you, too, didn't they?
But not me.
I'm coming to your place tonight to collect for these steers.
You have the money waiting for me, or I'm slapping a warrant on you.
You gotta get what's yours when dealing with men like that.
They're no good.
Sure, Pop, but we can handle them.
Hold my horse, son.
I won't be but a minute.
Take your time, Pop, but get all that's coming to us.
- Come along, boys, this is the place.
- Here's the Texan!
You look great tonight, Ruby.
I sure like that new dress.
- Thanks, darling.
- Just for luck.
You don't need any more luck.
That's right, I don't, not as long as I've got you.
That's me.
- Hello, Surrett, I was looking for you.
- Hello, Matt.
You ready to see me?
- I was on my way up to get your money.
- I'll go with you.
Mind waiting a few minutes?
I got some business first.
I don't mind.
But don't try and run out on me.
This is the last chance I'm giving you.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of you in a minute.
Come on over and wet your whistle.
- Hey, Jack.
- Yes, sir?
Give Mr. Cole anything he wants, on the house.
Yes, sir. What'll it be, Mr. Cole?
- A glass of beer, please.
- Yes, sir.
Nice-looking bunch of steers we shipped today, Cole.
Yeah. They'd look a lot better if I'd been paid for them.
What do you mean?
Haven't we always paid?
Not from what I've heard.
Maybe you've been listening to too much talk.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Are you calling me a liar?
I'm not calling you anything, Yancey.
In fact, I'd rather not talk to you at all.
- Keep your hand off that gun!
- Why, I...
"... in sure and certain hope of the resurrection of the dead.
"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
"Give us day by day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts...
"as we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us.
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. "
To have him go this way.
It's so cruel, so useless.
You promised you wouldn't cry, Mom.
John, will you look after Mrs. Cole?
You don't have to, Mr. Orth.
I can take care of her.
That's right, Harry.
You're the man of the family now.
Funeral's over.
There's your man, Marshal.
Serve your warrant.
It's about time those guerrillas were taken in hand.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
Don't push me. I know my duties.
Hello, Marshal.
Yancey, I've got a warrant here to arrest you for the murder of...
Matt Cole.
Why don't you go ahead and serve it?
What are you waiting for?
- Mind riding back into town with me?
- Yeah.
That's all right, Yancey.
You go ahead and ride in with the Marshal.
Why, sure, Marshal. Come along.
Come on, boys. Come on, Al.
After all, the law's the law.
Now, just a minute, Marshal.
- This is your...
- Now, hold on there, boys.
- Wait a minute.
- Get him in there, boys. Hurry up.
Come on, boys.
We'll ride him out of town in style.
What's the use of trying to make an honest town of Dodge City?
Surrett's crowd scares off the honest, law-abiding settlers.
They're all going on to Wichita and Kansas City.
I tell you, Ellen, we're the public disgrace of America.
You know what the New York newspapers are saying?
There's no law west of Chicago, and west of Dodge City, no God.
I'm afraid they're not far wrong.
It's becoming unsafe for a woman to walk on the streets in this town.
And as for children...
I almost wish Lee and Abbie weren't coming to live with us.
They'll be all right, unless they're as bullheaded as their father was.
We haven't had a word from them since they reached Texas.
When do you suppose they're gonna get here?
I kept a record somewhere.
- I always used to...
- They're on the table.
Yeah, the dates.
They left Fort Worth three weeks ago with a cattle-drive party.
Now, let's see.
Yeah, they must have crossed the Red River about here... then on up the Chisholm Trail into the Indian territory.
I'd say they'd be about Broad Plain by now.
Tex.
- Have you seen my brother?
- Yes'm.
He's over yonder somewhere hotfooting it around.
He swiped one of the boss's horses and I reckon he sure is drunk again.
I consider that a very impertinent remark.
Yes'm, I guess maybe I shouldn't have said he's drunk... even if he is drunk.
I don't know what I'm going to do about you.
Broad Plain, huh?
This is where the Indians are supposed to be?
Yes. If you keep up the fuss you're making... you'll have them right on our doorstep.
I wish they would attack us.
It's dull plugging along like this day in and day out.
It's dull, but that's no reason for you to act like a lunatic.
Maybe they don't even know we're here.
Let's tell them.
Stop it!
Was that you who fired those shots,
Mr. Irving?
- Sure it was him.
- Sure it was. What about it?
Nothing, except it seems like a silly waste of ammunition.
He won't do it again. He was just bored.
Faith, now, that's a great shame.
- So am I.
- Really? Well, I'm sorry.
Perhaps things will get enlivened for you if that shooting stampedes the cattle.
Since you seem to know what troubles him...
I'd suggest you see he drinks less.
Them two youngsters is more trouble than they're worth.
I'll certainly be glad to hand them over to their uncle in Dodge.
She sure is pretty, though.
Yes. I'd still trade the two of them for one good cigar.
All right, this is it! Tex! Rusty!
Tex, get the steers watered.
Rusty, line up the wagons at the bottom of that slope.
- Get moving, flat neck.
- Hush, I'll get moving.
All right, folks, we're bedding down.
Watch your cook fires, now.
The grass is awful dry.
- Don't you wander off.
- Ma, I'm hungry.
All right, get your teams hooked up.
We're pulling out.
- Move as soon as you're ready.
- Tex, get the herd started.
Wade, you better watch old bullet head here.
I caught him riding in the wagon yesterday.
- Hush. I was...
- Hush up.
Good morning, Mrs. Harper.
Did you rest well?
- Thank you. Fine.
- Good.
Be sure you boil that water before you drink it.
I'll bet two minutes after you were born, you were telling the doctor what to do.
Think so? I'm sorry, Miss Irving.
You know, it's really no fun playing boss... but someone's gotta say what's to be done, haven't they?
You know, out here... a trail boss has sometimes got to take the law into his hands.
Yes. "Pioneering," I believe you call it, don't you?
That's right.
You don't seem to be enjoying it much.
Enjoying it?
Can anyone enjoy being jolted along week in and week out... through a nightmare of heat and dust... with sand in your teeth, eyes, and hair?
Faith, now. If you didn't like sand, maybe you shouldn't have left home.
I wouldn't have.
But we didn't have much choice after Father died.
I see. I'm sorry.
Here, can I take that?
It looks heavy for you.
No, thanks. I can manage it.
I'm sure you can manage a bigger one in each hand, if you wanted to.
But why should you?
- Because I happen to be in a hurry.
- We'll wait for you.
There. See?
If everyone in the camp obeyed orders as willingly and charmingly as that... we wouldn't have any trouble at all.
My brother and I seem to be causing you a great deal of trouble, Mr. Hatton.
No, just your brother.
You know, I think you spoil him by mothering him, don't you?
Maybe I do.
May I make a suggestion?
Why don't you go...
Look here, Mr. Irving!
This ain't no picnic grounds.
Put up that gun before you stampede them cattle.
Get down off your high horse, will you, cowboy?
Watch me shoot the handle right off of this one.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Hiya, Abbie.
You're just in time to witness an exhibition of some real fancy shooting.
Put up that gun before somebody takes it away from you.
Who's gonna take it away from me?
You're drunk, you don't know what you're doing.
Don't start to lecture me.
I've had enough of that for now.
Lee, don't!
It's a run!
Tex, head in those leaders and keep them milling.
See what you've done.
I hope you're satisfied.
I've been waiting to see some action since this trip started.
You crazy galoot!
You saw what nearly happened.
What? Just gave you lazy cowhands a little exercise, that's all.
Irving, you're giving us a great deal of trouble.
- You're gonna force me to be unpleasant.
- Let me alone.
I'm not on your payroll, and I'll do as I please.
No, you'll do as I please.
You people in the wagons came to us for protection.
You paid for it, and you're getting it.
You'll obey orders until we reach Dodge City.
You may not realize it, but the Civil War is over... and you're no longer in the Army, Mr. Hatton.
I'm not gonna argue with you.
Sober up and stay sober, or I'll confiscate your liquor.
If you lay a hand inside our wagon,
I'll blow it off.
Look, Irving... we've got a very special treatment for bad little boys like you.
You behave yourself or you'll ride into Dodge City backwards on a mule.
You'll look very silly.
Now we're moving. You better get started.
- Lee, be sensible.
- Let me alone.
I can hardly wait to see you on that mule.
You sure will look funny.
Take that stupid grin off your face, you big hyena.
Drop that gun, Irving! Drop it, I tell you!
You've killed him.
Here you are, Tex. That's for Dr. Irving.
Take the shortcut into Twin Forks.
Bear left from there.
It's three hours to Dodge. Understand?
Sure I do, Wade.
I tried to explain in it.
Tell him I'll call on him when we get there.
I sure hope that doctor is more understanding than his niece.
- Good luck. Get going, Tex.
- Goodbye.
Miss Irving.
I know how you must feel about all this... and I know how you must feel about my part in it.
My shot was unavoidable.
I'd never have fired it except to defend myself.
I've no words to tell you how badly I feel about it all.
Will you leave me alone, please?
Well, so this is Dodge City, huh?
It sort of smells like Fort Worth, don't it?
That's not the city you smell. That's you.
We'd better get you to a bathtub before somebody shoots you for a buffalo.
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?
Lady, can I carry your basket?
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?
Gentlemen, can I hold your horses?
I'll watch them real careful.
- What's the idea, sonny?
- I'm in business.
I'm the man of the family now.
You're certainly making an early start.
What do you charge?
A quarter just for keeping an eye on your horses.
50 cents for watching them extra good.
All right, then.
We'll take $1 worth of the extra good.
Didn't Shakespeare begin by holding horses?
- Who?
- Hey, stranger, where's the money?
So you don't get any credit here, either?
Here you are.
- Thanks, mister. Much obliged.
- You're welcome.
William Shakespeare.
I never heard of him.
What part of Texas is he from?
Stratford-on-Avon.
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning.
- You fellows look pretty dusty.
- We certainly are.
It's on us about an inch thick for each state in the country.
What's the news in Dodge?
Just about the same as always: gambling, drinking, and killing.
Mostly killing.
Had one here just the other night.
Coldest-blooded thing I ever heard of.
Man named Yancey shot Matt Cole over at the Gay Lady.
Matt Cole? I used to know him in Texas.
What was the trouble?
What was the trouble?
How long since you been in Dodge?
Quite some time.
We always ship up through Wichita.
This town is run by a man named Jeff Surrett.
Cole was trying to collect for some cattle he sold.
$15,000, Surrett owed him.
Good morning, gentlemen.
How long before you'll be through with this fellow?
In about 10 minutes, Mr. Surrett.
All right, hurry it up.
I'm gonna take a bath. Yancey.
I'm sorry, there's somebody in there already.
Hey, shut that door!
There's a draft in here.
What's the idea, Charlie?
You know I always take a bath on Saturday mornings.
Get that fellow out of there.
I'm sorry, I can't do that, Mr. Surrett.
He ain't been in there half an hour.
He's been in there long enough.
You tell him to get his clothes on.
All right.
- Wait a minute.
- What did you say?
My friend in there paid for that tub.
Much as you undoubtedly need a wash, he needs it even more.
If it ain't our old friend Hatton.
Right. Quite a coincidence, isn't it?
You figuring on being around Dodge City long?
No, just as long as it takes me to finish my job.
Maybe longer, if I find it interesting.
Any objections?
No, I think we can make it pretty interesting for you.
Yes, I'm sure you might.
I hear you made it pretty interesting for Matt Cole the other night.
You always did hear a little too much.
It's possible you boys were always a little too noisy.
Come on there, Charlie. Finish me up.
Put some of that green stuff on.
Make me smell like a geranium.
- Say, Wade.
- What?
You know, it just come to me who that fellow was.
It did? Marvelous.
Naturally, our nephew's death was a great blow to us.
But now, since your explanation,
I can understand how it happened.
There's no sense in holding any grudge against you.
Thank you, sir.
We're used to death here in Dodge City,
Mr. Hatton.
Even of the people we love.
That's hard to say, but it's true.
Yes, I suppose so.
Thanks again, Doctor.
I wonder if I might pay my respects to Mrs. and Miss Irving on my way out?
No, my boy. I wouldn't advise that.
Walter, Mr. Evans wants you to come as soon as you can.
- Excuse me.
- Ellen, this is Mr. Hatton.
- How do you do, Mrs. Irving?
- He's come to tell us about Lee.
It's regrettable that we have to meet under these circumstances, Mrs. Irving.
I'm sorry, my boy.
But, you see, we never had any children of our own.
And to my wife, Lee was...
Well, you can understand how she feels about it.
Yes, of course.
Anyhow, it was very gracious of you to receive me, sir.
Don't bother about that thing, sir. I can...
Miss Irving.
I'll not be troubling you with any further apologies.
But I would like you to know that if ever I can be of any service to you...
- I shall be only too happy.
- Thank you.
The only way you can be of service to me is to keep out of my sight.
I wouldn't take that too seriously, my boy.
Women's logic and emotions are often very confusing.
I think I've heard my father say the same thing.
I'm sure that Miss Abbie has a more biting tongue... than my mother ever had.
All right, gentlemen, let's begin the auction.
One thousand six hundred and nineteen head of prime Texas steer.
Grass-fed, fat, frisky, fresh off the Chisholm Trail.
Is that correct, sir?
Go ahead.
But don't make any sale until I tell you.
Right. The agent reserves his right to refuse all bids.
Now then, who'll start us off?
What am I offered?
$25 a head.
$25 from Mr. Surrett. I'm going to $28.
$28 for the finest herd of steers that ever come out of Texas.
- Who'll say $28? Mr. Cagle?
- No, sir.
Mr. Orth?
Here's a cash profit of $50,000 begging to be picked up.
- All right, $28.
- Thank you, sir.
$28 is bid. Who'll say $30?
- Nobody will raise it?
$30 from Mr. Surrett.
Anybody raise that? Anybody say $32?
How about you, Mr. Orth?
Going to Mr. Surrett for $30.
Once. Going twice.
Hold on.
Will Mr. Surrett and Mr. Orth be kind enough to step up here?
Mr. Surrett, Mr. Orth, will you come over here, please?
You offered $30. Was that cash?
What's that to you?
Do you own those cattle?
I'm the agent for them.
I'm protecting the owner's interest.
I see.
I'll give you part of it in cash tonight and the balance in 30 days.
I see. How about you, sir?
I could've paid the full amount in cash today.
- You could have? Right. They're yours.
- Mine?
- But he offered...
- I said, sold.
What are you trying to do?
I made the high bid on those steers.
I heard you. But I prefer to make my deal with cash buyers... who don't pay off in the back rooms of saloons.
I'm at the Drovers Hotel, Mr. Orth.
If you care to meet me at 3:00 in Room 15, we can close this deal.
- I'll be there.
- Right.
Deal is made, Mr. Auctioneer.
Thanks. Good day.
Sold to Mr. Orth.
- Joe, did you hear that?
- I'll put it right on the front page.
- Who's that fellow?
- I don't know.
But you can bet I'm gonna find out.
- How are you, Harry?
- Hello, Mr. Orth.
- I'll hold your horse for you.
- Good.
- For a quarter.
- Well, that's fair enough.
- Here.
- Thanks.
How are you, Frank?
- Fine. How are you, Mr. Orth?
- Just fine.
- Howdy, Mr. Orth.
- Howdy.
Stick 'em up.
Rusty, we're done for.
It's Dangerous Ambrose, the terror of the prairie. He's got us in his power.
Yes, sir. I'm a pretty desperate character.
I can see that.
Would you take ransom if we offered it to you?
Try it and see.
How's that?
Thanks, mister.
I'll watch your horses better than they were ever watched before.
That's fair enough.
I sure hope you stay in town a long time.
I'll bet you do at that.
Mr. Orth come in yet?
He went upstairs a few minutes ago,
Mr. Hatton.
My name is Joe Clemens.
I'm editor of the Star.
I'd like to publish your impressions of Dodge City, if you don't mind.
Jack Orth. Somebody shot him.
He's laying right outside of Room 15.
That's too bad, Hatton.
I don't think your deal with Orth will go through.
But I'm still offering you $30 a head for those cattle.
Listen, Surrett. Those cattle aren't for sale to you at any price.
It's a shame about Jack Orth being killed, isn't it?
Must have been a big surprise to you.
Excuse me.
Another murder. Four or five a day.
Surrett's getting to be the undertaker's best friend.
It's sure getting dangerous to live around here.
Why don't you get out?
Clemens, I see by that bulletin that you're looking for trouble again.
What's the matter?
We're just printing the plain facts.
We've put up with you and your paper long enough. Now we mean business.
Yancey, you're not scared of that fellow from Texas, are you?
We'll take care of him.
But I'm warning you, don't print no story about Surrett. Is that clear?
I'm waiting for an answer.
I reckon you get the general idea now.
Rusty, I don't like the look of those clothes.
They look like you're up to no good.
I ain't had store clothes on for a long time.
I kind of felt like I wanted to clean up.
I got a call to make down here, so you're on your own.
Just try and keep sober and stay out of trouble.
You know I signed the temperance pledge before we left Texas.
Sure, I know that.
You were blind drunk when you signed it.
No, you're confusing the issue.
I'm a reformed man.
Even a reformed man can get into trouble when the boys get paid off.
No, I ain't gonna touch a drop.
I'm just gonna mosey around and take in the sights.
Look out you don't become one of them.
Wade, don't you worry none about it.
You don't think after me getting store clothes... that I'll have anything like that happen to me, do you?
Hey, mister.
Please help me over, will you, young man?
Come closer.
There you are, ma'am. Glad to be of help.
- Hi, Rusty. Come on, have a drink.
- Hi, Rusty.
Come with us and get your feet wet.
- Sorry, Tex. I'm just leaving.
- What do you mean, leaving?
We got a lot of Kansas dust to wash down.
Come on.
Waste my pay on liquor and gambling?
Not me, boys. I'm on the pledge.
You ain't serious, Rusty?
I tell you, boys, I've saw the light.
I'm through with your sinful ways and your riotous living.
He must be crazy with the heat.
Hey, you old walrus, you!
I don't want that. Give me one of those.
That's more like it.
My gracious!
Howdy, young man.
Are you a stranger in town?
Yes, ma'am. But I sure didn't know this was just for women folks.
But it isn't. Not at all.
We're mighty glad to have you.
But first of all, let me introduce our beloved president, Mrs. McCoy.
So delighted to meet you in this charitable institution.
Ma'am, my name is Hart. Algernon Hart.
Mr. Algernon Hart.
Well, Mr. Hart, you're just in time for the meeting.
But first, come and have a cup of tea,
Mr. Harvey.
Hart, ma'am.
I'm so sorry. Mr. Hart.
Come, girls. Help me.
Now, here's your tea. I hope you like it.
- One or two?
- Three, ma'am.
Are you married?
- Hey, Joe!
- Yeah?
How about that Dixie?
That's for the Fifth Kansas Infantry.
He chased those fellows so far from Fredericksburg... they ain't stopped running yet.
Yeah? They must have stopped running long enough to get their picture took.
Nobody ever chased the Fifth Kansas, mister.
- Do you belong to it?
- All of us do.
So is that a fact?
You must have had to run a long way to get back to Kansas.
Well, it's gonna be a longer run back to Texas.
It's that dreadful saloon next door.
Mabel, please close the shutters.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Hart.
And there I was, a poor orphan, no ma, no pa.
Brung up by Comanche Indians.
No matter where you go, fighting ain't good.
It ain't no use to fight.
Fighting is a thing I...
I don't like it myself. And now I want...
That's a present from U. S. Grant.
That's for Robert E. Lee.
Yes, sir. And I want to say to you, sisters... that when righteousness flows from the...
It was smooth.
Who's next?
Come get these fleas out of my hair.
Stop it, you fools! Stop it, I say! Stop it!
Thanks, Rusty. Just in time.
Stop it, you fools!
All right, boys. Looks like we dusted this place out pretty good.
That's one fight you Yanks didn't win.
But take it easy.
We'll send a veterinary right over.
Come on!
Somebody's gonna pay for this and it ain't gonna be with money.
When I seen the light, it come to me sort of vision-like.
And I was saved.
Hey, Jeff, there's one of them
Texas heroes left behind.
- Let me take a sock at him.
- No, I'll handle this.
You boys had a lot of fun, didn't you?
- We sure did.
- That's fine.
I've been waiting a long time for you and your pal to make a move...
- and this looks like it.
- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna have some fun now paying back an old debt with interest.
Come on, boys.
Let's take him out to the plaza.
Bring him along.
- Hey, Doc! Mr. Hatton!
- What's wrong, Joe?
Your men just wrecked the Gay Lady saloon.
- Anybody hurt?
- I don't know.
They're gonna hang one of your boys.
- Where are the rest?
- They've ridden back to camp.
- Where's the hanging party?
- Right in the middle of the plaza.
You're plum loco.
- I ain't done nothing to be strung up for.
- Shut up.
Hold on, boys.
Be careful, Mr. Hatton. Take it easy.
That rope is strong enough for both of them.
What do you think of that?
I've no wish to spoil your fun, Surrett.
But would you be kind enough to tell those men to let him go?
Sure. We'll let him go just as quick as he gets through dancing around up there.
You heard what I said, I think.
Tell them to let him go.
All right. String him up, boys.
Put 'em up! Stick 'em up!
Keep reaching high, boys, or you know what happens to Surrett.
Get over here, Rusty. Get his gun.
We may never be this close again, Surrett.
I'm anxious to hear what the sheriff has to say about this hanging.
Start walking.
- What are you gonna do with him?
- No warrant for his arrest.
Did he have a warrant to hang this man?
You can't jail him without a sheriff's order.
That's where we're going.
To get a sheriff's order.
Wait a bit. What's this?
Where's the sheriff?
Somebody ran him out of town.
Mr. Surrett's the law in Dodge now.
I see.
Why don't you make him sheriff then?
Yeah. That's not a bad idea.
Why not?
And if I can be of any service to you gents, just let me know.
That's the first jail I've ever seen you couldn't get in.
Come on. Good day, gentlemen.
- It was all a mistake.
- A mistake?
I thought you promised me you weren't going to get into trouble.
Shucks, Wade, I really wasn't in trouble.
I see. You're the sort who doesn't really get into trouble... until they start nailing the lid down on your coffin.
What's that?
"Pure Prairie League of Dodge City. "
Wait till I tell Tex about this.
Don't tell Tex.
Well, gentlemen, what's this all about?
You all look as though you lost a dollar and found a dime.
All right. Go ahead and tell him, Doctor.
Thank you.
Mr. Hatton, we've invited you here this afternoon with a special purpose.
We want you to help us clean up our city.
Up to date, our police officers have not been equal to the job.
They've either got killed or run out of town.
Won't you take the job?
Gentlemen, I certainly appreciate your confidence in me.
But I'm afraid a position like that isn't quite in my line.
You're asking me to turn policeman.
I have about as much qualifications for that as I have teaching the ballet.
You seemed to be well-qualified the other day in the plaza.
I had to get that big hardhead out of that somehow.
Any one of you would have done the same. No.
We know what we're asking of you and the chances you'd be taking.
But it's finally come to a showdown.
Who's gonna run Dodge: we or Surrett?
We're inviting peaceful emigration here, family men with women and children.
And we meet them with what's come to be called Hell Street.
I can certainly appreciate everything you say.
But as far as I'm concerned, it can't be done.
I'm in the cattle business.
That demands all my time and attention.
I'm sorry.
I wish you'd think it over, my boy.
We need you.
You're asking the wrong man,
Uncle Walter.
He isn't interested in the lives of innocent people.
Why should he care what happens to you and your families?
Your struggle to make a living in a decent city?
What Dodge City needs is a man with a sense of public pride... and the courage to back it up by shooting it out with men of equal skill.
But Mr. Hatton's bravery consists of gunfights with impulsive boys.
Abbie, stop it.
Well, gentlemen,
I don't think much remains to be said.
Mrs. Irving, thank you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Quickly as you can. Come along.
Harry, keep out of that lunch basket.
I can't seem to get my mind off those pies, Miss Abbie.
- How long before we eat?
- Not till we get to Sycamore Springs.
- Come along.
- I'll do my best to wait.
Everybody in?
Here we go. Come along.
Cross the river here, Russ, and bear due west on Wichita.
When are you fixing to get started?
First thing in the morning.
I'm sick of this town.
Good morning.
I know that man.
Hello, stranger.
Hello there, Shakespeare.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You'd better watch that riverbed, too.
It's probably gonna be dry.
Steady!
I'll help you! Give me those reins.
Let me drive.
Let me through. Darling!
He was trying to help me.
Get a doctor, quick.
I'm afraid a doctor won't be any use.
Even children.
This has got to stop.
Oh, my darling. My little baby.
Go on.
You're all under arrest.
Take them out, boys.
Get in there.
I wanted to be sure you'd seen this, Surrett.
So I paid you a special visit.
I've already seen it.
It looks like you're trying to run everybody out of Dodge City.
No, not everybody.
Just the undesirable element.
There's no law in Kansas that prevents a man from carrying a gun...
- or coming or going where he pleases.
- There's going to be one.
Sit down, Hatton.
The merchants are not gonna stand for this.
Yes, I think they will. The merchants helped me draw this law up.
They're willing to take their chances.
I just wanted to be certain about you, though.
- Let's get down to cases, Hatton.
- Right.
What cases?
You and I have had a couple of run-ins.
But I'll forget them if you do, and see if we can't work together.
If you really mean that, that'll make my job easier.
- Your job is just what you make it.
- So I hear.
The last few sheriffs here didn't do so well, did they?
They weren't your type. Just a bunch of dumb sheep wearing badges.
I never even bothered to talk to them.
I'll bet if you had, you'd have told them a thing or two.
Not what I'm gonna tell you anyway.
Now listen, Hatton.
There's no reason that Dodge City can't be run properly.
Just so long as you don't try to change things too much.
Because this is a cattle town, the biggest one on earth.
And that's what it's always gonna be.
There's more than $20 million worth of beef and hides... comes through here every year.
You know that because you bring them up.
You've been holding the wrong end of the sack... because the real money ain't working for those Texas breeders.
No, sir. It's right here in Dodge City because this is where they pay off.
You mean, on your roulette tables.
Sure, coming and going.
If not for the Gay Lady, that money would go out of Dodge City... and the trade would move right on to Wichita.
You know that cattle crowd.
After months of backbreaking work getting the cattle here... they want a little fun and freedom.
If it's not here, they'll go where they can get it.
- And you'd go broke.
- Sure. But I ain't aiming to.
You see, I make $100,000 a year one way or another.
Frankly, I don't need that much money.
Naturally, I'd be willing to make a deal with anybody... that would sort of see things my way.
Make a mighty good deal for both of us.
You mean, a little friendly bribery?
You can catch more flies with molasses than you can with vinegar.
True enough.
I hope you'll not be offended... but I don't like the smell of your molasses.
You'd better get rid of that gun by Monday. You're north of Front Street... and that jail's apt to be a little crowded.
What's the matter? Didn't it work?
He wouldn't listen to reason?
No, he wouldn't.
All right, Russ, let's go. We've a lot to do.
Don't ever do nothing like that unless I tell you to.
This ain't the time. We gotta wait a while.
They sure make a fella feel at home around here.
Yes. They'll even dig you a home, if you're nice to them.
One at a time here, fellas. Line up.
There you are.
- Will I get this stuff back again?
- You sure will.
- Disarm me? Not for no man.
- Nobody gets my gun.
- What a leery idea.
- Who does he think he is?
- Bet two.
- I'll call it.
- Raise it five.
- Call five.
- I'm dead.
- Kings up.
- I guess we better quit, boys.
- Quitting because you're winning?
- You read that sign, didn't you?
- We don't believe in signs.
That sheriff's a big four-flusher and that sign's been bad luck to me all night.
Guess that'll show you
Hatton ain't bluffing.
That's right, gentlemen.
Hatton's not bluffing.
- You're all under arrest.
- For what?
For not believing in signs.
All right, deputies, take them.
- Come on.
- Let go, now.
I tried to warn them, but I guess they gotta learn through experience.
I don't know what you're warning people about.
- What do you mean?
- You're north of Front Street, aren't you?
- And you're carrying a gun, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Right. You're under arrest.
- What?
Come on.
But I'd feel undressed without my gun.
Where you're going, you won't need any clothes for a few days.
If I was you,
I'd rather arrest my brother than me.
Hey, Rusty, you are a traitor...
I'm sorry, boys,
I can't do anything about it.
Wade, you ain't gonna keep me in here, are you?
Sorry, Tex. You read that notice the same as anyone else.
Three days in there won't do you a bit of harm.
You can't do this to me after all we've been through together.
We fought the war together, built the railroad... we ate, drank, slept, lived, and died together.
Now we're gonna be in jail together: you in there and me out here.
Isn't that wonderful? That makes seven families that have moved in this week.
That does my heart good.
There's the Turner family, moving back from Wichita.
And after she said she'd never set foot in Dodge again.
Welcome home, Mr. Turner!
- How do you do, Mr. Clemens?
- Hello, Joe.
Isn't that the sweetest bonnet she's got on? It's brown moiré.
Moiré. How do you spell "moiré"?
M- O-I-R-E?
Who in tarnation gives a hoot what Mrs. Turner's wearing?
Just about every blessed woman in town, that's all.
What happened in this fight between the Indian and Jim Kendall?
I went into that pretty thorough.
There wasn't no fight.
They called each other names, the Indian throwed a knife at Kendall.
Kendall sort of fired a couple of shots.
Nobody got hurt.
Nobody got... I see. It wasn't a real fight, it was just a sort of friendly argument.
- Hello, Tex.
- Hi, fellas.
Come on in and sit down.
What are you doing with that secondhand store around your neck?
Where've you been?
We ain't saw you for days.
Around. Been doing a lot of thinking lately.
Thinking?
I hope you're gonna take that job
I offered you.
We need another good deputy around here.
That's what I've been thinking about.
I've decided to go back to Texas.
- What for?
- I don't know.
This place is getting too big, and calm, and peaceful-like.
You mean,
Rusty and I have stopped all the fun?
It's all right for women and children, but I've decided to go back to Texas.
If you've made up your mind, that's that.
There's nothing we can do to keep you here?
- No.
- So long, Tex.
- So long, Wade.
- Give him back his gun. Number 27.
If you're ever around here, that job will still be waiting for you.
No, sir. I just don't fit in a sissy town like this.
I certainly hate to see you go.
I'll miss you fellas, too, a lot.
We had a lot of fun together.
So long, knot head.
If I hung around here much longer,
I'd be riding a side saddle.
Yes, I suppose so.
All right, Rusty. Arrest that man.
- Who? Me?
- What for?
He's carrying a gun, isn't he?
Give him back his old room.
- Morning, Joe.
- Hello, Wade. What's the news?
You ought to know.
Haven't you read your paper?
Got those tax notices ready?
- Hack's just running them off.
- Fine.
- Come on in.
- All right.
Have a chair.
You look as though you're pretty busy...
- Fred?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Would you set this in my copy, please?
- I will, ma'am.
- Joe...
- Good morning.
Did you want something?
I'd like to have my curiosity satisfied.
What are you doing here?
Obviously, I'm working.
Obviously. But at what and why?
The town is growing by leaps and bounds, and the paper needed somebody... who would write things that would interest its women readers.
I see. Tell me, what are the vital interests of your women readers?
What other women are wearing... how to make Lady Baltimore cake with two eggs... who invited the minister to tea... and whose baby is going to be born and when.
- Fascinating.
- Is there anything else you'd like to know?
What do the doctor and Mrs. Irving think about it?
They made the same stupid objections that you're making mentally now.
But when I decide on a thing,
I usually manage to carry it through.
Yes, I've noticed that.
You realize that people are inclined to think that a newspaper office... is an odd place for a charming lady like you to be working, don't you?
Are you the delegation sent to tell me that?
No.
I stop trouble around here. I don't start it.
- What's wrong with my working here?
- It's undignified. It's unladylike.
You ought to be home doing needlework.
Things like that.
Sewing buttons on for some man,
I suppose.
Buttons come off.
Someone's gotta sew them on.
That's a fine career for an intelligent woman.
- Here are your tax notices, Wade.
- Thanks.
There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth when these go out.
Abbie, I know this isn't in your line... but as long as you insisted on the job... will you stop calling them
"cows in the stockyard"?
They're steers. Steers.
I don't see any difference.
"A rise is expected this season in the price of longhorn cows. "
Never mind. I'll correct this copy myself.
"Longhorn cows. " I must be running along.
By the way, may I let you into a little secret?
What?
You've got a smudge of ink on your nose.
Goodbye. Goodbye, Joe.
Goodbye, Wade...
I'm sorry. Abbie.
Is this showing proper respect for the law?
I never saw the law fall on its face before.
I didn't fall on my face.
There's an old saying in the British Army:
"The law must always save its face in front of the natives. "
And what if the natives object to its face?
We just put them across our knee... and spank them soundly.
You're not suggesting that I'm a native?
No. The only real native of Kansas is the buffalo.
He's got a very hard head, a very uncertain temper... and a very lonely future.
Apart from that, there's hardly any comparison between you.
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, Wade.
Goodbye.
I like that fella.
"Cows in the stockyard. "
Of course, I ain't a man who believes in taxes.
But I can see they're a necessary evil.
Somebody's gotta pay for schools and churches and such things.
Especially now that the town's getting so darn big.
Yes, sir.
They do say there's nothing certain except taxes and death.
Get up, Hatton.
What for?
A couple of the boys are waiting outside to have a little talk with you.
I see.
You know, I'm really surprised at Surrett.
I thought he had more intelligence than to send you here on a silly deal like this.
- You haven't got a chance...
- Shut up and get out of that chair quick.
About 10 days for this customer.
Five to cool off and five to think it over.
You bet. I'll take care of it personally.
Come on, sonny boy.
I'll buy you some candy.
- What were you saying about taxes?
- What taxes?
I don't remember.
Shall I trim your mustache?
No, thanks. I think I can manage.
See that big herd of buffalo grazing away so peacefully down there?
The trouble with the buffalo is they had things too easy at the start.
It works the other way around, too.
Take us, for example.
We had such a bad beginning.
We'll have a wonderful future.
That's typical Irish logic: totally unconnected.
You think so?
It may be Irish, but it's not unconnected, and I can prove it.
Thirty years ago, my father met my mother at the Londonderry fair.
He'd come down to sell some prize pigs.
Big, fat, lovely pigs they were.
Mother was down there after winning the grand prize for her roses.
Roses of Sharon, enormous, big things, as big as your face and nearly as beautiful.
I don't suppose there were ever roses like that in the whole of Ireland.
What must happen?
The very last day of the fair...
Father's pigs get out and eat up every single one of Mother's prize roses.
Root, stem, flower and all.
Did any two people ever get off to a worse start than that?
Look at them now: six big lusty sons, a score or so of prize pigs... and the most beautiful rose garden in the whole of Antrim.
I envy you people who have kissed the Blarney Stone.
You do?
It's cold on the lips.
I think we'd better be getting back.
I'm afraid it'll be dark before we get there.
- Are you sure it's the dark you're afraid of?
- What do you mean?
- Maybe you're afraid I might kiss you.
- You wouldn't dare.
I wish I were as sure of that as you are.
May I?
Thank you.
You know, I was just thinking... the buffalo wouldn't be so badly off if the buffalo didn't have a one-track mind.
But then the buffalo wouldn't be a buffalo, would it?
I suppose not.
You wouldn't be you unless you thought you might like that kiss.
- You seem very sure of my reactions.
- Oh, no.
That's something you can never be sure about until you've tried it.
Can you?
Good morning, Abbie.
Good morning, Mrs. Cole. How are you?
So-so.
Won't you come in and sit down?
There. Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, I'd like to run this advertisement in your paper.
That is, if it doesn't cost too much money.
Our advertising rates are very low.
I'm sure we'll be able to.
You want to sell your house?
No, I don't want to. I have to, Abbie.
Let's get a new lead line on this church bazaar story.
How do, Mrs. Cole? How are you today?
- Good morning, Joe.
- How much will you charge on this?
One, two, three, four...
You're selling your house?
You're not leaving town, are you?
No, I just...
Joe, I can't afford to keep it up.
I can't even begin to meet the taxes on it these days.
I can't understand that.
Matt always made good money.
Just the day he died... he collected $15,000 from Surrett.
Didn't he?
That's what I thought, too, but I've never seen a penny of it.
Well, what have you done about it?
I've spoken to Jeff Surrett about it several times... but he'll never give me a straight answer.
It looks to me like Mrs. Cole needs help, and we might be able to help her.
Yeah, it does look that way.
Mrs. Cole, would you mind if we kind of looked into this?
Mind? I'd consider it a very great favor.
There are a lot of accounts in this town to be settled. Now, let's see.
How's the best way to tackle this?
There you are. The entry, the date, and the figures. $15,000.
What Matt Cole did with his money after that is his business, not mine.
He had $10 on his body when he was found. He never left the saloon.
I make it a point not to discuss the affairs of my customers.
But as long as you force my hand,
I'll give you the facts.
Matt Cole lost that $15,000 playing roulette.
Playing roulette?
I'd like you to remember that, Abbie.
Don't worry, I'll remember.
As a matter of fact, we'll all remember it.
He never went near those roulette tables.
He went straight to the bar and Yancey killed him there.
- According to who?
- You'll find that out in court.
If you've got such a clear case, why don't you arrest me now?
I think we'll wait a few days.
I want to talk to a few more people... before we start giving you board and room at the state's expense.
You're bluffing, Hatton.
You're holding a pair of deuces.
You're bluffing.
Am I?
Munger killed Orth because he spoiled a cattle deal for you.
Yancey killed Cole because he tried to collect $15,000 you owed him.
And more citizens in this town have been killed trying to do business with you.
That's what the three of us are going to prove in court.
We'll see if the jury thinks we're bluffing.
Take that book, Joe.
I want to look at it again.
I can hardly wait to start writing this story.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be the most important article...
that's ever appeared in the Dodge City Star.
There it is. We'll have it out by noon tomorrow.
How did you find out all these other things about Surrett?
Abbie, a good newspaperman has two jobs.
One is to write the news as it happens, day by day.
The other is to be ready for it, and write it first... all but the end.
This is Jeff Surrett's morgue.
I must be an optimist at heart.
I've been getting it ready for a long time.
You two, haven't you got any homes to go to? It's past midnight.
You'd better be running along, Abbie.
The Doc will skin me alive.
We've got Surrett by the scruff of the neck.
You have? Why not let it go tonight and resume your grip in the morning?
You two realize what kind of a target you'd make from out there?
I'm gonna take you home before your uncle gets after Joe with a shotgun.
Here's your cloak.
I'll come back and stay till you finish, Joe.
The story's all written.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm just gonna mark it for the printer, then call it a day. Italics.
Don't hang around, or Surrett might come in and mark it for you.
They wouldn't try anything at this stage of the game.
You think not? I hope you're right.
Good night, Abbie.
See you in the morning.
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Wade.
Lock this door after us when we go out.
Mr. Hatton, I am accustomed to being up after dark.
- Lock it.
- All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"The laws of Dodge City must be respected...
"not only by one group of citizens...
"but by all groups. " Paragraph. I like that.
What was that?
Whoever killed Joe Clemens ought to be strung up.
And, by golly, I'll furnish the rope.
If he's got enough neck left to put a rope on.
They sneaked up on him.
Never even gave him a chance.
The bullet went through his heart.
I can only blame myself for this.
But it's one thing they won't get away with.
Little fella sure was aces. It's too bad.
I can't understand it.
Everybody knows that Joe didn't have any enemies except Surrett and his gang.
Who else could have done it?
Isn't it sufficient proof that Joe's story is gone and the whole file on Surrett?
This door was locked.
I know that because I tried it myself.
It's an old lock. Any key will fit it.
- There's nothing here. You're sure?
- He always left his copy here on top... so we could set it up first thing in the morning.
I'm sorry, Sheriff, that's printer's ink.
You can't wash it. It has to wear off.
Did you ever read the contents of Joe's files on Surrett?
I certainly did, and there was enough in it to hang him.
Keep that to yourself.
I think you ought to go now.
You're looking tired. Good night.
See the doctor and Miss Irving home, will you?
Right.
- What's the next move, Wade?
- I suppose we're going to...
Are you sure he isn't in his office upstairs?
I tell you, Surrett left town on the 4:30 train this afternoon.
If you don't believe us, go ask the station agent.
Jeff was halfway to Wichita when the shooting occurred.
You're barking up the wrong tree, mister.
Thanks.
Your bet.
- Your bet.
I call.
Who's winning all the money?
Been playing long?
Ask the bartender. He's got a watch.
What do you know about Joe Clemens, Yancey?
No more than you, except that he's dead.
How did you know he was dead?
I heard some of the boys talking.
People keep dropping in and out of here all the time.
Bet you $5.
I call.
Three fives.
- You're under arrest, Yancey.
- For what?
For the murder of Joe Clemens.
Keep my stack, Bud.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I wouldn't count on that if I were you.
Take him along, Rusty.
What's the matter, Taylor?
Are you nervous?
Go ahead. Deal them.
Yancey seemed a little vague about this game.
Suppose you tell me what happened.
How should I know?
- Why don't you ask one of them?
- I'm asking you.
Did Yancey ever leave this table after the game started?
No. He never left the room.
I told you a hundred times, he never went out of the place.
Come on, you're wasting valuable time.
- Answer my question.
- No, he never left the table.
Stop lying. You're bad at it.
Yancey left that room between midnight and 1:00, didn't he?
- No.
- What time was it, then?
He didn't leave.
Let me work on him, Wade.
I can make him talk.
If you can't, I can.
Let him alone.
Listen, if you're too stupid to realize... you're facing a charge of murder, you deserve what's coming to you.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna have you indicted for murder as an accessory after the fact.
I had nothing to do with it.
You're gonna be dancing in thin air the same as Yancey.
Do you wanna swing, or you wanna tell me and save your neck?
All right. I'll tell you.
Come on.
He went out about 12:30.
Came back in about half an hour.
That's better.
I'll do you a favor, Taylor.
Lock him up.
- Good morning, Mrs. Irving.
- Good morning.
Morning. Did you get anything out of Taylor?
I did. Where's the doctor?
- In there. What's wrong?
- What'd he say?
Morning, Mr. Hatton. Won't you join us?
No, thanks. I came to tell you... it's imperative you get Miss Abbie out of town as soon as possible.
Why, for heaven's sake?
Because only two people beside myself heard Surrett tell that lie... that he saw Matt Cole lose his money playing roulette.
One of those people was Joe Clemens.
That's why Surrett killed him.
You're the only other person who can bear me out in court.
Without you, he can deny it and the jury might believe him.
That's all the more reason why I should stay.
I started this, and I'm going to see it through.
Will you not be a little idiot?
You're life isn't worth a nickel as long as Surrett stays out of jail.
You're the key to our case and he knows it.
We can't go to trial for two weeks.
Your life's gonna be in danger till then.
Even in this house, on the street, everywhere.
I know Surrett and I know what he'd do.
You know I'm right, Doctor.
I want you to get her out of town.
And stay out till I send for you.
- You're right.
- I see what you mean.
Abbie must take the next train for Wichita.
She can stay with the Merrills.
I'll pack a valise at once.
Come and help me get it down off the shelf.
I'd never forgive myself if anything happened to her.
- I won't go. You can't boss me around.
- Can I not, now?
I'm the law in this town and you'll do as I say.
I don't care what you are, I'm staying here.
Aunt Ellen, don't pack...
You are the most stubborn female
I ever met in my life.
Can't you understand I'm doing this because I love you?
All right, you two. Stop arguing.
Don't worry, Mrs. Irving. We've stopped.
What he needs is a rope.
He don't deserve a trial.
Hand him over to us. We'll give him a trial.
This is more like it.
The last time I saw a mob like that was in Texas... when they gave Curley Hawks a necktie party.
Mr. Grant, I want to talk to you.
There's your man. You got 10 minutes.
- Hello, Yancey.
- Hello.
What's going on here?
What's the mob doing...
Now, take it easy, Yancey.
You might as well know this now as later.
They wormed it out of Taylor that you left for a half hour.
They can't hang me on that.
I might have gone anywhere.
Maybe a jury wouldn't hang you... if you ever get to a jury.
What do you mean by that?
What're you trying to say?
Joe Clemens was a mighty well-liked man, Yancey.
He had a lot of friends.
Half the city is planning to break in here tonight... and take things in their own hands.
Where's Jeff?
He's gotta get me out of here.
I telegraphed him an hour ago.
He got off the train at Spearville.
He got off? For what?
Jeff's smart enough to know this town's gonna be warm for a few days.
So he's just laying low until the excitement blows over.
Too warm for him?
So I stay here and get hung for doing his job.
- If you think that I...
- Shut up, you fool!
- You want to tell the whole town?
- You bet I'll tell them.
I'll tell them who paid me to shoot Joe Clemens and Matt Cole.
Let them hang me, sure.
But if I go, Jeff's going with me.
You rustle him up and telegraph him that.
He has to get me out by tonight or I'm giving the whole story to Hatton.
But how can Jeff get you out of here?
I don't know. That's his problem.
Keep your shirt on, Yancey.
I got an idea how Jeff and I can handle this.
First I'll see Hatton.
You got the right man, Hatton.
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, what are we waiting for?
If you don't know what to do with Yancey, we do.
- You bet we do.
- Will you give us some action?
If he won't, we will give him some action.
What are you stalling for?
You know he killed him.
If you don't turn him over to us, we'll come get him tonight.
Listen, men, you fellas put me in this office to enforce the law.
And I'm going to enforce it.
That means a fair trial for any and all prisoners.
Including Yancey.
And understand this:
There is going to be no mob rule around this town as long as I am sheriff.
They're bringing up a pole for a battering ram.
You see? They're right at the door.
Listen to them.
You're in charge, Sheriff.
What are you gonna do?
Wade, what are we gonna do?
The whole town's set on getting him out.
You can't stop them, the five of you against the town.
They'd burn down the building to get in here.
We'd save a lot of trouble if we'd feed him to the mob.
You want to throw my client to that pack of hungry wolves?
Listen, no one's gonna get your client but a jury.
- I promise you that.
- There's only one way to protect him.
Yancey's gotta be taken out of Dodge City before night.
Fat chance we'd have of getting him to the station.
You can hire a closed carriage, drive him to Spearville... and catch the train for Wichita.
Keep him in jail there till he can be tried legally.
- Yes, that might work.
- It will work.
My client's entitled to a fair trial... and it's both our jobs to see that he gets it.
You want me to rustle a carriage, Wade?
Wait a minute. I got a better idea.
But you agree we got to get him out in a hurry?
Yes, but we'll do it my way.
- This is a sample of your future.
- Get in, Russ. Get in.
Hold them off as long as you can.
I'll send word from Wichita.
- Say, what the...
- Keep calm, it's official business. Come on.
I'm Sheriff Hatton of Dodge City.
I've got a prisoner here for Wichita.
- Is it all right if we ride with you?
- All right, Sheriff.
- Mind shutting and locking this door?
- Not a bit.
Get over there.
You can sit there and rest your face and hands.
How many stops do you make between here and Wichita?
- None.
- Good.
Keep going. I'll tell you what to do.
Put 'em up.
- But, gentlemen...
- Take him away, Joe.
Get in there.
Get your hands up.
Get them up, I said!
Now unlock those cuffs.
We've gotta stop. The train's on fire.
Don't slow down till the water tower.
Hold it, Jeff! We're all gonna burn.
Got a friend of yours here, Hatton.
Take a good look.
Throw me those guns!
Pick them up.
Unlock those handcuffs!
Come on! Hurry up!
Close that door.
Rusty, this end.
Look out!
Hurry up!
So the lamb killed the butcher.
Now, listen to that.
Singing hymns and it ain't even Sunday.
No one in sight even friendly drunk.
Doggone, if this place ain't getting so pure and noble it ain't fit to live in.
I'm sure enough going back to Texas now.
Imagine asking me to lead the Pure Prairie League.
Why not? You're one of the leading lights in it, I hear.
First thing you know, they'll be starting a chamber of commerce.
- Faith, it's not possible.
- What?
Look, Col. Dodge.
- Hello, Colonel.
- How're you, Colonel?
Hi, Colonel.
How are you, boys?
By golly, Wade, it's good to see you alive.
- It's good to be alive.
- Come on up.
- Hello, Colonel.
- Wade. By golly, son, it's good to see you.
Hello, Tex. How are you, Rusty?
I couldn't complain, Colonel.
Wouldn't do no good.
Sit down over there, sir.
I've come all the way from Virginia City,
Nevada, just to see you.
I'm building a railroad there from San Francisco.
It's the richest square mile on earth.
Gold, silver, copper.
We've got a solid mountain of the stuff.
But it's a bad town, Wade.
A wild, murderous town.
Worse than Dodge City ever was before you cleaned it up.
And that's saying a good deal.
- I want you to come back with me.
- I knowed our luck had changed.
We've got 4,000 people out there.
Decent men and women with families who are living in terror.
Think of them 4,000 poor people.
There might be more by the time we get there.
We need you, son.
The city is teeming with crime and corruption.
What law we've tried has failed... because the men behind it hadn't the brains and courage to back it up.
You can get plenty of men for that job out here, Colonel.
I'm getting married next week.
Got tickets for New York.
Shucks, you can get married anytime.
We'll even go on your honeymoon with you to Virginia City.
Thanks.
Getting married has ruined a lot of good men.
Doesn't it mean anything to you to know... that someplace there's terror and death that you could put a stop to?
Yes, it does, Colonel.
But the decision isn't as simple as that.
If I were free, it might be different.
I'll soon have a wife to take care of.
Abbie doesn't want to go pioneering anymore.
We're planning on coming back here from New York and settling down.
There's a wagon train leaving here the middle of next week for Nevada.
It'd be a great trip, wouldn't it?
Hello, darling. I was just telling the boys how we're going to settle down...
- Lemonade?
- Thank you.
- Lemonade?
- Thank you, ma'am.
Darling, I was just telling Col. Dodge about our honeymoon in New York.
How we're going to see all the shops, theatres, and Niagara Falls, and things.
Col. Dodge, when do we start for Virginia City?
Wade, it looks like you're marrying the right girl.
Virginia City!

To home Kinda tired, ain't you, Ma?
No, Mark.
Not very.
You can't fool this old horse trader.
I've been over these trails too many times not to know your first trip is a tough one.
But Mark, don't you think we better be stoppin' for supper?
Those youngsters back there are most likely starved.
Well, it won't take us so long to get out of the desert, Ma.
Before the yonder range we'll camp for the night.
John, this sure is lots of fun.
I wonder why Dad never took us on any of his other trips.
'Cause it ain't safe. It ain't safe for older folks, much less kids.
And anyhow, schoolin' was more important.
Aw, I don't like school none.
Anyway, I ain't seen an injun yet.
I'd like to see one. I'd shoot him right 'tween the eyes.
Put that gun down
'fore you get hurt.
I'd like to see some badmen. I'd show 'em how bad a fella could be.
I hope you like it out west, Ma.
It'll take us a little while to get settled, but, uh, we'll be gettin' in on the ground floor.
We'll make a go of it, Mark.
I'll be a heap happy to see you settling down to ranchin'... and give up this freight haulin' all over the west.
The boys are growing up, and they'll be needing you a lot more now, Mark.
I guess you're right, Ma.
I've been awful lucky. I'm gonna be glad to get out of it with a whole skin.
Ho.
Ballard, the Wyatt outfit's headed this way, across the Buckhorn trail.
- How much stock, Red?
- Oh, I'd say around 200 head.
Good beef stuff too.
Zeddie says he could use a few hundred head at a fair price.
How big an outfit with Wyatt?
Just a few hands. Oughta be easy.
Good. Get mounted. We'll hit them before they get across the desert.
Red, you and Chuck ride straight for the wagons a-shootin'.
Bronc, you and Sloppy ride out in front to head a getaway.
The rest o' ya, ride for the cattle.
We'll burn the wagons. Heel!
They're- They're trail jumpers.
Ma, take the line.
Hyah! Hyah-yah-yah-yah!
Unharness them horses.
We got every hand, Ballard. And the cattle's on their way to the camp.
Put up your hands or I'll dr-
Wait a minute, Red.
He's a spunky little critter.
Let's take him along.
- Fire them wagons.
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Let's get outa here.
Mother.
And as you gentlemen know, the discovery of gold in this state has encouraged... every outlaw and criminal west of the
Mississippi to move in here among you.
They're growing fast- stealing, destroying, murdering, and living by their guns at the expense of the decent and respectable citizens.
They outnumber law enforcement 20 to 1.
The honest people are so terrorized by them that they're leaving the country.
Unless something is done soon, the towns will be filled with nobodybutoutlaws.
Why are you so interested, my boy?
Since childhood, I've lived on the trail of bandits- hunting the men who murdered my parents, stole my brother.
If it takes the rest of my life,
I'll continue to hunt them down.
And at the same time, with the proper aid,
I can do a good service to this country.
Just what do you expect the state to do?
Only this:
I'm asking you to provide guns, ammunition, horses... and the men that I'll select.
And I promise you, I'll rid this state of every bandit that's in it... and make your trails safe to travel.
Young man, I speak for myself, but I voice the opinion of all.
Your plan is splendid, and we admire your courage, but it takes money to provide you the men and the necessary equipment you ask for.
The state treasury is without funds for such a purpose.
Our tax collections at this time are not enough to take care of our present obligations, much less added ones.
Therefore, we are powerless to accept your offer.
- I see.
- I only wish...
I could help you personally.
Thank you.
With money or no money...
I'll organize a band of men and drive every bandit gang out of this country.
Good night, gentlemen.
Howdy.
You Carter?
That's right.
And the answer, men, is... we must band together.
You, Carter, and you, Russell... and every man here has suffered from the injustice of these gangs.
And it's up to us to clean them out.
Now, my plan is this:
Every man here will ride a white horse, wear a black shirt and a white scarf, and this way we'll know each other in battle.
And I'm asking for single men only, and men who will stick.
Now, who will join me here? You can depend on me.
Me too. I'm with ya. You can count on me.
Good.
We'll call ourselves Vigilantes.
Looks like we're with you to the man, Cap'. I'm glad we are.
It's about time.

Captain looked kinda disappointed today... when he didn't locate the fellow he's after... after comin' all the way over here.
Yeah, but that won't stop him.
He'll rid the country of every outlaw gang till he finds his man.
You haven't been with us long.
Wait till you see how he works.
Who is it he's always lookin' for?
Don't know for sure.
Cap' ain't never said.
All kinds of stories, but that's a private affair with him.
When we were recruited, he said he wanted to make the west... a decent and safe place to live.
Oh, Carter.
Have the boys mount up.
We'll go into Red Bluff and spend the evening.
Maybe some of the boys would like a little sarsaparilla. Maybe they would. Me too.
I'll tell 'em.
Band of Vigilantes
Sons of pioneers
And we like to work up chasing bandits down
We are sons of tribulations to the outlaws of this nation
When we're ridin' down that rocky road to town
Seeing we're out like buckaroos
Let the outlaws hear the news
That the Vigilante men will ride them down
We are wicked to the bearer of a midnight dream of terror
When we're ridin' down that rocky road to town
Seeing we're out like buckaroos
Let the outlaws hear the news
That the Vigilante men will ride them down
We are wicked to the bearer of a midnight dream of terror
When we're ridin' down that rocky road to town
Get him to a doctor, men.
I'm goin' after them Singin' Riders.
They're camped just outside of town.
We'll get this gang.
Them fellas seem to be in a mighty big hurry.
Let's investigate.
Black Bart's gang has just robbed the express. That's them yonder.
We'll round the rocks, boys, and head 'em off.
Did you ever ride the
Buckhorn Trail? No. Never.
Did you ever hear of a gang that did ride it about 12 years ago?
No, never did.
Take these men in and turn 'em over to the townspeople, Carter, and see that that stolen money is returned to the express company.
What news? The Gordon herd is movin' up the Dalton Trail.
Crossed the Snake River yesterday.
Should be in Paiute Meadows in a few days. Well, good.
And I'll try and join up with 'em. I can use a herd like that for outlaw bait.
Now, you'll take the men and wait for me at the north end of Paiute Meadows.
We'll be pullin' out in the morning. Good enough.
We just trapped
Black Bart's gang.
All right, men.
Herd 'em into town.
Howdy.
You Lafe Gordon?
Yes, sir.
Who be you? Well, I might be some help to you.
I know this trail backwards. Heard you were trailin' shorthanded.
Thought I might tie up with you. Where y'all been workin'?
Well, the other side of the Snake, mostly. Rand and Richard's outfit.
Trail boss over there. Well,
I can use a good trail boss.
You know this country well, huh?
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
Uh, John Allen.
You're hired, Allen.
Thirty per and a bonus if there ain't no losses. Well, thanks, Lafe.
How's the herd holdin' up so far? Pretty good, considerin' the weather.
Well, I reckon I'll drop back and tell the boys we got a new hand.
Be seein' ya.
Hey, stupid!
Where do you think you're goin'?
Get back there with the herd, you muttonhead!
Just who do you think you're talking to? And who are you calling "muttonhead"?
Well, I, uh-
That is, uh-
- And just what are you doing here, if I may ask?
- Well, I'm the new trail boss.
Well, my name's Mary Gordon, and my father owns this outfit.
So from now on it's "Miss Gordon" to you, not "muttonhead," you- you dumbbell!
Where'd you get the new maverick, Dad?
Just dropped out of a clear sky.
He looks like a good hand to have around.
Good morning,
Miss Gordon.
Oh, good morning,
Mister... Muttonhead.
Can I saddle up for you?
Oh, I've been doing it for years.
I guess once more won't hurt me.
Well, that's right.
I agree with you. A girl that rides a trail herd... should be made to do her own work.
There we are.
All ready to go.
Any more orders? A good trail boss always rides at the head of his outfit.
Yes, Miss Gordon.
Well,
Plug Lewis just rode in. Said the
Gordon herd's movin' up the Dalton Trail.
That's what I've been waitin' to hear. Where's the kid? Outside.
Blackie, get Jim in here.
- Hey, Jim!
- Well, what is it?
Ballard wants to see ya.
What's up?
Don't know.
All right.
Well, what is it? The Gordon herd is out on the flat.
I've got 'em as good as sold. Bring 'em in. Do ya understand? Sure. Don't worry.
Say, I hear that Singin' Rider outfit is making it plenty hot for the boys down Sonora way.
Keep your eyes open.
I ain't worried none.
Don't be too sure o' yourself.
I hear they're tough- mighty tough.
Ah, forget 'em. I'll take the boys and figure things out.
Come on, men.
It's funny what a great outlaw that Wyatt kid turned out to be.
Shut up, you fool. Don't ever mention his real name again. I don't want him to remember it.
He doesn't know yet it was us that killed his folks.
Early start, Lafe. If it keeps cool, we oughta cover a lot o' ground.
Yeah, we did right well yesterday.
That's because of our new trail boss.
Allen!
Look yonder.
Come on.
Let's go.
Easy, pardner.
There.
What happened?
Held up. They stole my horse and left me to die.
Where'd they get ya?
About five miles backtrail.
I got this far, but couldn't get much further without a horse.
John, have the boys bring the chuck wagon. We'll fix him up.
Guess we'll go through Paiute Meadows sometime tomorrow, won't we, Allen?
About noon, I judge, if it's of any interest to you. Oh, no. Just wonderin'.
I thought you would be.
This Allen fella been with ya long? No. Why?
Oh, nothin'.
Thought I'd seen him someplace before.
No, he just joined up with us on this trip. He's all right. I know.
Don't be too sure, Miss Gordon.
Of course,
I ain't accusin' Allen.
But that's an old trick in trail jumpin'.
You put a man with an outfit so's he steers you right into the trap.
But John isn't that kind.
You can't tell, Mary. We don't know much about him.
Your father's right.
You don't know him.
We know him as well as we know you.
Yeah?
But I didn't come looking for a job, did I?
Say, maybe you're right.
I'm gonna keep my eye on him anyway.
Good.
You're the girl that I loved
Long ago
The girl that I held
In my dreams
When e'er castles high
I built in the sky
You were my queen
Of queens
You've the eyes?
The lips and the hair
Of my girl in my castles
Of air
Since they've faded away
I've been longing each day
For the girl that I loved
In my dreams
Oh, please sing it again.
All right, boss.
Anything you say, goes.
What's up, Jim?
Boys, we gotta change our plans.
I run into a stranger with the outfit, and I don't like his looks.
But I'll have that herd at Paiute Meadows by sunup.
Be ready to crack down on 'em.
Well, I've gotta get back so they don't get suspicious.
Well, if you'll excuse me, Mary,
I think I'll hit the hay.
I'm kinda tired.
Thanks so much.
I enjoyed your music.
Well, good night, muttonhead.
Good night, stupid.
Dad, I think you're wrong about John.
Don't worry, Mary.
We'll know better tomorrow.
Where's John Allen? Why, he's turned in for the night.
I thought so.
It's a trick.
Ain't he in camp?
I can't find him. And his horse ain't here neither.
Just as I figured. Gone to get his gang. I don't believe it.
Let's drive on tonight.
We can beat him to it.
Why, we can be in Paiute Meadows by sunup.
It's a good idea.
Tell the boys to roll the herd.
We're shoving out tonight. Right.
I think you're making a mistake, Dad.
Just the same, I'm not taking any chances.
All right, men, go get 'em!
I got the guy that plugged you, Lafe.
Good work, son.
Take care of 'em, boys!
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks to you.
You get 'em all?
Didn't miss a one.
Held this fellow for you and sweated him.
Admits he rode the Buckhorn Trail.
You used to ride the Buckhorn Trail, eh?
What of it? Do you know who trail-jumped the Wyatt family?
What's it worth to ya?
Plenty, if you know.
Just how much?
Your life.
I ain't tellin'.
Whit Ballard did it. Whit
Ballard? Well, where's he?
I don't know. Don't lie! Where is he?
You'll find him over in around Grass Valley.
All right, Carter.
You can let this man go.
Our bargain is that you clear out of the country and stay away from Grass Valley.
Now, get goin'.
Carter, you take the herd on into Grass Valley... and wait for us at the south end of town.
All right, Cap.
Why didn't you tell us who you were when you joined us?
I didn't see any reason to tell.
I thought there might be trouble and I'd lend you a hand.
Oh, I see.
Then you expected trouble.
Well, chasin' outlaws, a fella can always expect trouble.
Are you in the government service?
No. I- I organized these men for a personal reason.
Oh, I'm sorry, John. I didn't mean to be inquisitive.
Oh, that's all right. It's nothing you shouldn't know.
As a matter of fact, I'd like to have you know all about me.
For 12 years I've lived with but one thought in my mind: to get the men who killed my parents and stole my younger brother.
If he's still alive,
I'm gonna find him.
Come on, boy!
Dad, you're wounded!
Just a little nip in the shoulder.
But if it hadn't been for Jim here, they'd have got me sure. Oh, I did the best I could.
Those Singin' Riders really took care of things.
I'm sorry, Jim. I guess
I had you figured wrong.
That's all right. We all make mistakes.
And I sure was wrong about you.
It's lucky John's men got here in time to save us.
-Did you find out who jumped us?
-They've all been taken care of.
I told Carter to take the herd on into Grass Valley for you, and I think we'd better get you to a doctor.
Well, folks, if you don't mind,
I'll be pullin' stakes.
It's only 20 miles to Grass Valley, and
I'd like to get there as soon as possible.
That's all right, son. I want to thank you for the help you give us.
Just keep the horse you been usin'.
When you get to Grass Valley, leave him in the livery stable and we'll pick him up.
Well, folks, I'll be seein' you all later.
I told you to watch out for that Singing Riders crowd.
But you wouldn't listen to me.
You were too sure of yourself.
No, I wasn't.
We were outnumbered five to one.
You couldn't have done any better yourself.
They got all our boys except you and Red.
How'd he get away?
Outfigured 'em, he said.
Well, I'm tellin' you one thing.
You ain't gonna be able to do anything with those Singin' Riders outfit hangin' around.
They sure ruined that job.
Ah, forget it.
You can't cash on somethin' you ain't got.
Now, listen to this. There's over
$60,000 in gold in the Commercial Bank.
Brought in last night from that Big Creek strike.
I was waitin' for you and the boys to come back before I pulled the job, but I had to go get Dugan and his gang to help us out.
Well, you'd better strike quick and clear out. Those Singin' Riders are headed this way.
While the doctor's taking care of your father, I'll mosey on down the street.
There's someone I want to see. We'll wait here for you.
Is, uh, Ballard around?
No, he's not. He drops in every once in a while.
Thanks.
Ed.
Come in.
What's up, Hank?
There's a fellow downstairs lookin' for you.
Yeah? Who is he?
Hisrealname is Wyatt.
Wyatt?
You remember, Ballard.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothin' much.
Only when I was travelin' with the Cummings gang, it was Wyatt and his
Singin' Riders that broke us up.
He was lookin' for you then.
Seems that he's out to get you.
He's here now.
Jim, Hank says that Singin'
Rider fella's downstairs.
Where?
At the bar.
That's him all right.
Lucky thing I didn't go downstairs. He thinks I'm a friend.
Wait a minute, partner.
You've forgotten something, haven't you? What do you mean?
Our bargain was that you stay clear of Grass Valley.
Besides bein' a thief, you're a liar.
Listen, Hank. You go down and get the boys and handle him any way you can.
But handle him!
Don't shoot, Jim. There's too many townsmen there.
Besides, you might get one of our own men.
Why, he's just like a wildcat.
Look at him go!
He's in here, Ballard!
Break that door down!
He's got out the window! You better stop him before he gets to his men!
Come on!
He went that way!
Wait a minute, men.
Have you seen John?
Yes. Uh-
Why, he's upstairs. He's just been hurt in a fight.
Hurt?
I'll take you to him.
What's the idea?
Who's the girl?
Wait a minute. That's Gordon's daughter. I got a swell idea.
What's the girl got to do with it?
We'll never stop Allen from getting to his men now. But with her here, we can.
I'll show you.
Come on, boys!
This note will hold off Allen's riders and bring him right into our hands.
Send some of the boys to Blind Canyon.
When they finish with him, tell 'em to come back and meet us at Wild Horse Corral.
Get the rest of the boys ready to clean out the bank as soon as I get back.
Get the rest of the Dugan gang ready and the wagon quick.
Let's go.
Hurry up, man.
Get that wagon.
All right, boys.
Get mounted.
You're pretty smart, Ballard. You let him play right into your hand.
I get it.
Brother against brother.
Forget about that brother stuff.
You don't know about it, see?
Go out and get the boys.
We're movin' right away.
What about Jim? Well,
Jim's served his purpose.
When he's found out about his brother, it'll be just too bad.
The Singin' Riders will take care of him anyway.
Besides, it's one less cut on the gold.
Now, get goin'.
You men get ready to cover the town.
Rode out to get you, Allen. Just learned that Ballard's gang are holding Mary.
They sent this note.
"Allen, I'm holding Gordon's girl, and we've got a deal to make you.
"Leave your riders and come to Blind
Canyon alone if you want us to release her.
Ballard."
Carter, I'm goin' in there alone.
You keep the men here.
If I'm not back in a half an hour, come and get me.
It was the Ballard outfit.
They got all the gold.
We oughta hang every one of 'em. Have you sent out to the mine for help?
I'll go right now.
I'll go with you.
Let's get the gang together and we'll all go.
Where's Ballard? I don't know. They've gone.
And they've tricked you into double-crossing your own brother.
What do you mean?
John Allen is your brother.
John Allen's my brother?
Yes.
His real name is John Wyatt, and you're Jim Wyatt.
I overheard Ballard tell Red while I was in the closet.
John's been looking for you ever since they wiped out your family.
You've got to save him.
Look out, John!
They've trapped John in Blind Canyon.
Come on.
Thanks, Jim.
Where's Mary?
She's safe. She's gone to get your riders. What do you mean?
I framed you, John. I sent you in to this, and I'll get you out,
'cause... you're my brother. Brother?
Yes. Mary told me everything. She overheard Red and Ballard's conversation.
Ballard wanted you killed so that I'd never know.
Jim.
We've gotta get
Ballard, Jim.
Their horses are in back of us. I'll hold them off while you make a run for it.
It's your only chance.
What's your chance?
Oh, never mind me.
We'll both run for it.
That's Ballard in the wagon.
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah!
Jim!
Did you get Ballard, John?
Everything's squared.
Guess I ain't gonna make it, John.
You won't hold it against me, will ya?
No, Jim.
Funny. I always wanted to be a bad man, even when we were kids.
Do you remember?
I, I guess I'm gettin' what I deserve.
Over the prairies
To home?
Covered wagon
Rolling westward ho? I'm leaving tomorrow, disbanding the men.
Where are you going?
Back to my ranch in California.
It's gonna be lonesome out there.
Do you think you could ever care for a, a-
A muttonhead like you?
You guessed it, stupid.

Hello. Hello.
I wonder what's holding them up.
Don't worry about that, Father.
We'll be going soon.
John, did you feed them hounds?
Yes, Grandpa, yes.
All right.
Now tighten her up, Son.
She'll take us where we're going.
Yes, but where are we going?
Now, Ma, they're thrashin' that matter out over there now.
Pa, they made you the leader.
Why don't you say where to go?
I'm only leader of the Missourians, Daughter.
There are families here from every state in the Union, I reckon.
Can't be waitin' on
'em forever, Dad.
No, Son.
They're holding a powwow over there now.
I'll just step over and see what they got to say.
Well, bless our wild heart.
If it ain't Breck Coleman.
How are you, Zeke?
Where at you been hidin' yourself for the last year, boy?
Been down Santa Fe way, Zeke.
Just drifted in.
And here's Windy Bill.
Looks like you've wintered through in good shape.
Well, Coleman, most times I winter through in fair shape.
This year, when the first grass showed, I'd only put on 60 pounds.
Say, Bascom, he maybe could tell us of a likely stretch of country.
Breck, could you sight us to a second
Missouri anywheres out yonder?
Sure. But it's a long, tough pull from here.
2,500 mile the way you'd have to go.
No, it's too far off.
No place is too far if it's what we want.
This is a land beyond Oregon.
There ain't no land beyond Oregon, mister.
West of Oregon comes the ocean, way it's been told to me.
This stretch is north of Oregon.
How many people settled on it now?
It's Indian country.
Except for the trappers, never a white man has left his track there.
Only one trading post in that whole country.
Who owns it?
A Missouri trapper owns it.
Hey, mister, will you tell me this...
Hey, hey, there.
Since you all elected me the he-coon of this outfit, let me do the talking.
It's everything a Missourian's heart could crave.
There's two snow-capped mountain ranges with peaks lost in the sky.
And between them ranges, men, is a great valley.
Lakes and streams everywhere.
Fish, you ask, and game?
There's salmon swarmin' up them rivers thicker than blackbirds in a cane patch.
Friend, will you undertake to lead us to that valley?
I'd like nothin' better, men...
But our trails fork here.
I've got business that calls me back down the road Santa Fe way.
What business do you follow, friend?
I'm a trapper.
Well, surely there's fur aplenty out in that land beyond Oregon.
Plenty.
But I gotta kill me a pair of skunks, back apiece on the road to Santa Fe.
Hey, wait, wait. Friend, how do you find that valley?
Wellmore here is sending a bull train clear through to old Tom Williams's trading post.
First time it's ever been tried.
String along behind them and, if they make it through, you'll find your valley.
And tell that great white mountain hello for me.
Good-bye, Zeke.
Well, thanks, boy.
Hey!
Hey, maybe he fed us a fairy tale.
Now don't be a pig, you know.
Howdy, Mrs. Riggs.
Land's sakes!
Well, you sure look fine,
Mother Riggs.
It's a long time since I've seen you.
You know, you always was a great hand to wander.
Yeah, I ramble around.
And how are the little twins?
Little? My lands!
Them girls has grown since you seen 'em last.
No!
Mm-hmm.
They in the house?
Mildred is. Elise went down to watch the boat come in.
I reckon I'll saunter in and surprise Mildred.
Oh, you sure will surprise them.
Well, Breck, I sure am glad to see you.
Well, you certainly have doubled in size since last I set eyes on you, Mildred.
You just must see Elise.
I'll surely see her before I leave.
There's the
Peensie Bell whistling now.
Ooh, look at the crowd.
Oh, look.
Okay. I guess it is important to have everything ready.
I have everything ready.
Well, Miss Cameron, we be landin' in a few minutes.
Got all your outfit together?
Most everything's ready,
Captain Hollister.
Listen, why don't you give up this plan and turn back?
Why, there's no place to turn back to.
Why, there isn't a home in all the South that wouldn't welcome the daughter of Colonel Cameron.
True. But we can hardly become perpetual visitors.
It's a tough proposition, girl, this pioneer life in a savage wilderness.
We realize that,
Captain Hollister, but we must keep the family together.
Honey Girl wants to stay with her sister Ruth, doesn't she?
Yes, I do.
And our brother Dave's almost a man grown.
Ruth is right, Captain. The Cameron tribe must stick together.
Say, you're just the fella I want to see.
I want to play some more of that shell game.
Have you got any more money?
Oh, sure I got some money.
Where'd you get that?
From my mother-in-law.
She lend it to me, but she don't know it.
Here, I'll meet you below deck.
Get along.
Don't forget.
I wait there for you.
Are you still determined to be a sturdy pioneer?
Quite determined,
Mr. Thorpe.
I've told you about my plantation in Louisiana.
It must be wonderful.
Miss Cameron, those lands and servants are yours, if you'll take me with them.
Why, I do thank you. But as I've said before, it's quite impossible.
Good-bye, Mr. Thorpe.
Now, if I win,
I'm going to keep it.
But if I lose, I give my mother-in-law half.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Here we are again.
Hello, Thorpe.
Well, Gussie, you want to see the elusive little ball under the shells.
There you are. Now it's bound to be under one of them.
There's one, there's two, and there's three.
Now we'll shuffle them just a little bit, just to confuse you.
And take your choice.
Now wait, I show you.
Here, I bet you two dollars.
Two dollars. Covered.
I always do that for good luck.
Now wait. I show you.
Now watch.
Ah, you see, Gussie, the hand is faster than the eye.
Better luck next time.
Oh, here. Who wants to buy my mother-in-law's stocking?
Gus!
Oh, there you are. What do you mean by spending my money?
But, Mama, I'm going to give you half.
Give me my money.
Give it to her.
Hurry UP-
Give me the rest of it.
Why, madam, that's my own money.
That's my money.
No, no, Mama.
That's his money.
Captain, I demand that that man give me my money.
Hand it over.
See, Mama? Didn't I tell you we would win?
Why, you big loafer! Get out of here!
Spending my life's earnings!
Now, Thorpe, you get off of my boat.
If you set foot on it again,
I'll put you in irons and land you at St. Charles on my way back.
Davey, I think I better go find Mrs. Riggs, that lady Captain Hollister told us about.
Come on, Honey Girl.
No. I want to stay here with
Davey and watch them unload.
Well, you take good care of her, Davey.
I will.
I'll be right back,
Honey Girl.
It's a nice place, ain't it, Mama?
It's terrible!
Look at the mud!
Well, listen, Mama, I gonna go see if I can buy a horse.
Come on. Come on.
I carry you over there.
I don't want you to get your feet wet.
That's it. Here we go.
Now you stay there.
I bring Abbie over.
Come on, Abbie. I don't want you to get your shoes all muddy.
That's it.
Come on. Here we go.
Oh, stop laughing, will you, Abbie?
That's it. Now you wait here.
I bring Mama.
Come on, Mama.
I take you over, Mama.
Come on, Mama.
Come on, Mama. It's...
Here! What are you trying to do?
But, Mama,
I want to carry you across so you won't get your feet wet.
You? I'll cross my own mud.
All right then, Mama, but let me help you.
That's it, Mama. Come on now.
Okay, step on that board, Mama.
That's it, Mama.
Ohh!
Say, I come right back.
Ohh! Oh, Gus!
Uh, Mrs. Riggs?
Yes, miss. That's me.
Well, I'm Miss Cameron. Captain
Hollister told me to see you.
Friend of
Captain Hollister?
Yes, lam.
Come right on in.
Oh, thank you.
Now don't tear your pretty dress on them logs.
Oh, it's nice and cool in here out of the sun.
Now you sit down, make yourself easy, and I'll brew you a cup of tea.
Oh, that's awfully nice of you, Mrs. Riggs. Thank you.
No! Wha...
Why, what do you mean by...
Oh, I thought...
Oh! Oh!
It was thisaway, ma'am, I thought you were someone else.
Wait! It was thisaway. I thought you were Elise, ma'am.
Elise?
Yes. Just thought
I'd surprise her sort of.
Did you indeed?
Let me tell ya.
If you'll light someplace,
I'll tell ya.
Oh!
Oh.
What is it?
You're as pale as a ghost.
Oh, it's nothing,
Mr. Thorpe. Really. I...
But there must be something wrong.
Oh, nothing.
Just an unpleasant occurrence.
I'm gonna explain that play.
There's nothing to explain.
But I'm gonna tell you anyhow.
It seems to me you're forcing yourself on this lady.
Is that how it seems to you?
How else can I take it?
It's nothing to me how you take it.
But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand.
Perhaps not. But if it concerns Miss Cameron,
I'll demand an explanation.
You will?
Then speak your piece.
Mr. Thorpe, will... Will you please take me to my brother?
With pleasure. I'll be looking for you shortly.
Well, I won't be hard to locate.
Hello, Honey Girl.
Hello.
Thank you so much,
Mr. Thorpe.
It's a great pleasure.
Just think. This wagon will be your home for the next six months.
And after that, a cabin in the wilderness.
My mind is made up,
Mr. Thorpe.
We're going with the settlers.
You know my brother David.
Yes.
Hello, Dave.
How do you do?
Howdy, DOV!
Hello, Zeke.
Howdy, Bill.
Hey, Jack, I been tellin' you about this here boy Coleman.
He can heave a knife into a mark so big every time.
I'll bet you a buffalo hide he can't heave it into that post back of ya.
Call the bet! Now here.
Show him, boy.
Bless our wild heart!
Oh, I've seen him do it a hundred times, eh, Bill?
That's another buffalo hide you owe me, Jack.
You remember, Bill, that time up, uh, on the Snake River...
Oh, I sure do.
Say, boy, I want to know about old Ben Griswell.
I hear the
Indians downed him.
Only it wasn't
Injuns downed him.
No?
Renegade whites done it.
How come?
He'd been wolf in' all winter.
Yeah?
Must've had $2,000, $3,000 worth of wolf pelts.
Oh, easy that.
He was hacked up and stuck full of arrows.
Looked like Injun work, all right.
The wolf pelts was gone.
If ever I find them hellhounds,
I'll sure make 'em hunt their holes.
Come on.
Lopez, who's that young buck over there with no hair on his face?
That's, uh, Breck Coleman.
He very quick with his knife.
Oh, where's he come from?
He come from the plains, the mountains.
He live with the Indians.
He can throw a knife through the heart in 20 feet.
He's the best shot in all this country.
He knows everything.
He'll know too much for his own good someday.
Yes. All right.
If old Ben had lived, he'd be going on about 72 now, wouldn't he?
Injuns never done this.
It was renegade whites.
And they've left their mark.
Oh, I'd say I do.
Say, Zeke, who was that he-grizzly that just went by?
Why, that's Red Flack. He's bullwhackin' for Wellmore.
He's gonna whack Wellmore's train clear through to Oregon.
You reckon you'll ever find out who downed old Ben?
It's just possible that a certain low-down coyote left his sign there.
Well, hello, Coleman.
Howdy, Wellmore.
I've changed my mind. I'll scout for that bull train after all.
Well, that's a ray of sunshine.
Shake hands afore you change your mind again.
Got a good wagon boss for the trip?
Red Flack.
A burly ruffian, but he can maul the toughest traitor on the plains into a pulp without even working up a sweat.
He can do that, eh?
Flack? Ha!
Why, he likes to do it.
But he can run a bull train.
Here he comes now.
Well, Wellmore, all ready to start?
Likely you two have met before.
Nah.
I reckon not.
Coleman's gonna scout for the train.
You understand, Flack, that he's to have final say in all matters dealing with the Indians.
Yes? Well, who's got the final say about bossin' this bull train?
He understands that you're the wagon boss.
Yeah. Another thing, another thing...
Am I supposed to be wet nurse to them woodenhead pilgrims a-crossin' the plains?
The more that goes along, the better it is for them and you in case Indians jump ya.
Well, all right.
All right!
Make it clear to him that I'm wagon boss.
Oh, he understands that, Flack.
He seems to be a right pleasant cuss.
He's a ruffian, but he's a real wagon boss.
Likely he is.
Must've done a big trade in wolf pelts this year.
Yes, we had a big trade with the wolfers.
Flack sell you any of these?
Flack? No. He didn't do any wolfing last winter, I guess.
What outfit did you buy the biggest bunch from?
Fella name of Lopez come in about a month ago with close on to
5,000 dollars' worth.
Lopez,eh?
I guess I don't know him.
I signed him up as a bullwhacker on the train.
You did, eh?
I'll see you next year.
Bring your scalp along back whole.
All right. Good-bye.
Is that so?
It certainly is.
I don't know whether they're gonna get through or not...
Windy, I'm gonna scout for that bull train.
Good.
Oh, Mr. Cameron, this is Mr. Coleman.
Howdy, Mr. Coleman.
How do you do, sir?
Uh, he can tell you more about that country where you're going, and what kind of an outfit you need than any man around here.
Thanks.
Windy, throw my bags in with yours and Zeke's, will ya?
All right, I'll do.
Tell Zeke I'm going along.
All right, boy.
Mr. Coleman, would you mind looking over my outfit?
Certainly not. Uh, we'll go have a peek at it. Where is it?
Right over there, sir.
Honey Girl, it's time for your history lesson, dear.
Now, uh, how many stars in the flag?
Twenty-six.
How many stripes?
Thirty.
Now, you know better than that.
There's 13.
And what do they stand for?
The 13 original colonies.
Now remember that.
Now, who discovered the Columbia River?
Here's our outfit.
Mr. Coleman, this is my sister Ruth.
Robert Gray.
Honey Girl, it isn't safe to be sitting in a rocking chair, when there are certain persons present.
I think you'll find we have everything.
Plenty of guns?
A rifle and a fowling piece.
How about ammunition?
Plenty.
One thing...
I don't see any barrel.
A barrel?
Yeah, you'll need a water barrel.
There'll be long stretches without water.
I knew we'd forget something.
I'll go get one.
All right.
What I was aiming to tell you was this.
When I came in...
The folks right next there had an extra one.
Oh, quick work, son.
Say, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take two barrels.
Suppose you go rustle another one.
I'll do that.
When I came romping into the Riggses' cabin, ma'am...
How's this one?
Oh! Well, that's fine.
Looks like barrels grow on trees around here.
Mr. Cameron, you better tell your sister to change that pretty dress.
She won't get very far in that.
Yes, sir.
Put on some traveling clothes.
Let's have a peek around here.
We have a trailer, in case we needed...
I like him better than Mr. Thorpe.
Honey Girl, we'll finish your history lesson.
Ah, I know how that is.
Well, you won't...
Thorpe!
Thorpe, you get back on the Peensie
Bell and make yourself scarce.
If you're here when the boat pulls out, the boys will certainly lead your pony out from under you.
Why, I had no intention of staying.
I'll be on the Peensie Bell when she leaves.
You see that you are.
My goodness. I don't know what
I'm going to do with you.
Well, I try again. Come on.
Here. Up you go. Up.
Oh, you stubborn jackass. I give you a "yab" in the "yaw."
I bet you "yump." Come on.
Up.
Hello there, Gus. What do you call that thing you got there?
Oh, his name is Jack.
Jack? Oh, yes.
But that's only half of it.
Well, see, he's only a half a horse.
Well...What's the matter?
Can't you get him up?
I don't know. I pull and I pull, but he won't come up.
Wait. Wait. I got an idea.
Say, what did you say to him then?
Heh! I told him a joke about my mother-in-law.
Gus!
Wait. Shh. Here she comes.
Gus, what have you got there?
This is my new horse.
I just bought him.
You bought him?
Sure.
Say, ya...
That wasn't me, Mama.
No, it was the mule.
That rum's for you and me, eh?
Ah, gracias.
Ahh.
Well, if it ain't Bill Thorpe, eh?
I always thought you was hung and planted years back.
No, my time ain't arrived yet, Flack.
Yeah.
Though it looks as though it might be drawing close.
Ah, how come?
Well, I've been promised a hanging bee
if I don't get out on the Peensie Bell.
And the captain promised me a necktie party if I set foot on the boat.
It's a case of nowhere to go.
Yeah. It appears to me you do your shooting by daylight, with too many people looking on, eh?
Well, long as you can't go and you can't stay, just what do you figure to do about it, eh?
Well, I've always been able to wiggle out.
Yeah. Appears to me as if you was born to be drowned, eh?
Come on, Zeke.
Get rid of that moonshine, and let's get out in the sunshine.
All right, big boy.
Hold your head up.
Don't leave me.
Yeah, so long, folks.
See you next year.
Yeah.
Are you just as handy with a gun as you was?
I can drive a nail at 30 paces.
Yeah.
Well, as long as you can't go, and you can't stay...
Wouldn't be a bad idea if you was to go along with me.
Well, that sounds reasonable.
Yeah.
Where do you happen to be headed for?
Well, anyways, it's out there, where there ain't no noose awaitin' for you, eh?
Hello, Breck.
Well, Windy, I trapped him with his jug down at Joe's.
Hey, Windy, here's the last you'll see of civilization for a long time.
That's worth tryin'.
Hey! Back up here, will ya? Back up.
I gotta finish that with Windy.
Hey, that's what you get for not drinkin' with me.
I'll drink at your next wedding.
Yeah!
Windy, uh...
Do some of them musical things, will you, with your mouth?
Ah, that's old stuff.
Dab, no. Something new.
Oh, well.
A coyote.
That's no coyote.
There's the stuff! Hey!
Hey, did you ever kill a dead Indian?
No, I never killed a dead one.
Before they was dead, did ya?
No. You see, the Injuns are my friends.
They taught me all I know about the woods.
They taught me how to follow a trail by watching the leaves.
And how to cut your mark on a tree so you won't get lost in the forest.
And they taught me how to burry in in the snow, so you won't freeze to death in the storms.
And they taught me how to make a fire without even a flint.
How could you do that?
And they taught me how to make the best bow and arrows too.
Did they teach you how to make papooses?
No, that's one of their own secrets.
Well, boys, I guess we better get going.
O God, our Father, as you sit on high and look down on us poor mortals, forgive our frailties.
I am about to lead these people into a wild and dangerous country.
Give me strength and wisdom,
0 God, to lead them through.
Where's my steps?
Mama, I got everything packed up in the wagon.
But how can I get into the wagon, you idiot?
Well, look, I show you. Look,
Mama, put your feets up on there.
That's it. Now wait. I lift. That's...
Up you go, Mama. That's it.
Now one more foot up. Now up, Mama.
Up, Mama. That's it. Up.
Wait, Mama. You're sitting on my head, Mama.
Please... There you go.
Get in. Get in, folks.
We're goin'.
Mount up. We're goin' now.
Get in there.
We're on our way.
Pull out!
Give us a song!
All right.
We're off, boys.
Sam's got a wooden leg below the knee
Sam's got a wooden leg below the knee
Whoa, mule!
Never mind! I walk there, Useless. Come on.
You want these sacks, don't ya?
Trade cattle.
Hyah! Hyah!
About time we were movin' on.
Yeah.
Willy!
Come on, Willy. Forward!
Ah, giddyap!
Ah, giddyap!
Ah, giddyap!
Hyah! Hyah! Move out!
Yeah! Yee!
You make me so tired!
Get over there!
I'm tired of this!
Fi!
Get up here!
Get along here!
Get in there!
Get on! Go on!
Howdy, Dave.
Hello, Coleman.
Oh, Miss Cameron...
Glad to see you took my advice about saving that pretty dress.
You look so nice in it, it'd be a shame to spoil it.
Looking for anyone in particular?
Honey Girl, a gentleman never comes to a lady's home when he isn't wanted.
Out here, this wagon's our only home.
Pony, that means us.
Come on, Useless.
What's the matter?
Come here, Useless.
Hey, there.
Whoa! Wait. Wait.
Whoa.
Get in...
Get in there.
Get in there!
Giddyap!
Whoa.
Come on. Get in there!
Come on, Useless.
This way.
Git!
Whoa.
Wait a minute, Useless.
Come on, Useless.
Come on, Useless. Come on.
What do you think of this fella Thorpe?
Ah, I've seen that there squawker somewheres afore.
Can't recollect just where.
He, uh, shoots a kind of a nasty look at you once in a while, boy.
We had a run-in the first day.
Yeah?
You know, he ain't no settler.
Nah.
And he ain't no bullwhacker.
Uh-uh.
Wonder what he come along for.
Aha! He come along, uh, 'cause of that, uh, Cameron girl.
I'm still mystified,
Mr. Thorpe, why you came here instead of returning to your plantation.
I've told you why I came.
I induced Captain Hollister, an old friend of mine, to put back to shore, and I followed you.
Yes, I know that's what you told me.
But I'm afraid you're a flatterer.
Oh! On my honor, no.
You got a chew of tobacco?
Hey, Lopez! Tobacco's gonna be mighty scarce later on.
Boy, I'm goin' back to old Windy
Bill and get a slug of "come on."
Your name's Lopez, eh?
Uh, Lopez, that's me.
You and Flack good friends, he tells me.
Ah, Flack and me been friends 12, 15 years.
You were out wolfing together last winter, eh?
No, no, no. Wolfing, she not good business. No money.
Then you didn't get many?
No, not much.
Funny. Wellmore said you sold him more furs than any other half dozen outfits.
No. He must have been talking about someone else. Not me.
Well, no matter.
See you often.
Ah, you rascal.
Flack.
Got a good bunch of bullwhackers, Flack.
That, uh, Lopez strikes me as a good hand.
Ah, you bet.
Lopez can pound them along.
You and him old friends, eh?
Who? Lopez and me?
Nah. I never see'd him till he signed on this trip.
My mistake.
Ah, Lopez.
I don't like this man Coleman.
Yeah?
If he asks after me, you tell him you never see'd me, till you signed on this trip.
You're too late.
Why?
He just speak to me, and I tell him we was old friends.
What?
What do you use under your hat instead of brains?
You need no brains if you got this.
Ahh.
Now you're talking sense.
Come on, you.
Come on. Giddyap.
Pick your partner and a-promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the ca...
Prepare to promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the call.
Now right in circles.
Take your partner and a-promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the call.
Maybe she won't, uh, talk with him, but she'll dance with him, eh?
It's a lovely dance.
On with the next and follow the call.
And a lovely night.
And a lovely girl.
Now's your chance. Go in and snag her away from him.
I claim the favor.
With pleasure, Mr. Thorpe.
Well, Zeke.
Hello, boy.
Thorpe just stole my partner and left me dancing with myself.
Yeah?
Say, boy, it just come to me a minute ago, where I seen that there Thorpe before.
Where?
Camped on the Cimarron with
Flack and Lopez. They're old friends.
Are you sure of that?
Dead certain.
So keep your eye peeled on him, son.
Oh, I'm tired. I think
I'll go to my wagon.
Why, certainly.
Let me take you there.
And to think this same moon is shining on my old plantation in Louisiana.
All it needs is a lovely woman to preside there.
Someday you'll find her.
I have found her, Ruth.
Oh, please, Mr. Thorpe.
Look, I've told you before that there can be no happiness without love.
But love will come.
Ruth... I'm really tired, Mr. Thorpe.
Do you mind if I go to bed?
Good night.
Good night.
We're getting into dangerous country, Flack...
So I'll be riding to the Pawnee villages to pick up some Injun scouts.
Yes? Well, you're likely to lose your scalp out there.
I'll bet you a couple of wolf pelts I bring it back with me.
How long'll you be gone, Coleman?
Three or four days, a week maybe.
Oh, back so soon?
I thought maybe you wouldn't be coming back at all.
And just why did you think that?
Well, after I sort of took the dark-eyed beauty away from you,
I thought you might be decamping.
Listen, Thorpe. I never quit a job in the middle of the road.
Oh, quite so.
Quite so.
But after the girl quit you in the middle of the road...
Say that again, Mr. Thorpe!
I know who you are now, and I know why you quit the Cimarron country too.
Oh, well. No necessity to have quarrels among friends.
Friends?
You threw too wide a loop.
Remember this, the three of you...
I'm not your friend.
Yeah. Well, you let him scare you stiff.
Not at all.
Only an idiot, you know, presses a quarrel, when the other man has a knife pressed against his middle.
Yeah. Good excuse.
Wolf pelts, eh?
What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.
It doesn't to me, but it does to you.
Yeah? Where'd you get that notion?
When he mentioned wolf pelts, you looked as though he'd rammed a knife in you.
Not exactly what I'd call a poker face.
Yeah?
Well, what of it?
Oh, nothing.
Only I'm beginning to understand why you don't like Coleman.
Bye, Windy.
And, Zeke, I'll be seeing you in the happy hunting grounds if not before.
Good luck, boy.
Bye.
Well, Miss Ruth, I got some good news for you.
What?
I'm gonna be away for a while.
I'm going scoutin'.
Well, isn't that dangerous in the open country?
Lord, no. I love it...
Especially now that it's spring and everything's so happy.
Why, there's trees out there, big, tall pines...
Just a-reachin' and a-reachin'...
As if they wanted to climb right through the gates of heaven.
And there's brooks, too, with the water smiling all day long.
But the part I like best is the night...
Lying out there beneath a blanket of stars, with that old moon smiling down on you.
And every time you look up, there she is, sort of guarding over you, like a mother minding her young.
Sometimes it's so beautiful that
I just lie there, listening.
Birds singing, brooks laughing, and the wind sort of crooning through the forest.
Like some great organ.
Oh, I've always loved it.
But I reckon I'm gonna be lonely this time.
You know, you can get sort of used to having somebody not like you.
And when they're not around, you miss them not liking you.
That's why I reckon
I'm gonna be lonesome.
But I'll be thinking of you.
Good-bye.
And you just take care you don't lose your scalp!
Zeke, is he leaving the train?
Yes, miss. He's riding out to Pawnee villages.
Well, how far are they?
Oh, nigh on a hundred mile.
Well, isn't that dangerous?
Well, he's likely to lose his scalp afore he gets there.
But once in the villages, he's safe.
So don't you worry about him, miss.
What... Why should
I worry about him?
I don't know, miss.
I don't know.
But seemed like as if maybe you was.
Oh, not at all.
He means nothing to me.
No. No, in course not.
Good night.
Good night, Zeke.
Hey! You got back here at last, eh?
Yeah. There's plenty of buffalo sign out here, so I'll be riding out to pick up fresh meat.
Ah, well, who's keeping you?
I'll see you at the river crossing.
Lopez! Lopez! Thorpe!
Pull up here. Come here.
You two have been waiting for your chance. Here it is.
Go out on a buffalo hunt.
Me? Nah.
I kill hundreds of buffalo.
Why should I go?
Ah! Get them cobwebs out of your brain!
He means, Lopez, we might find better game.
Watch him till he leaves the Pawnees, and then give it to him in the back.
Go on.
Hey, you pilgrims!
Come here! Come here!
Bascom?
Yes!
Bascom!
Yes.
I'll shove the horses and the cattle right on through.
Leave only the wheelers hooked to the wagons.
Once you take to the water...
Well, it's every man and critter for hisself, eh?
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Go on!
Mr. Flack.
Mr. Flack, how can I get my mule Useless across?
Well, uh, get your mother-in-law to ride him, eh?
Mr. Bascom.
Yes?
Mr. Bascom, you know,
I don't like that fella.
No?
He's the kind who will pat you on your back to your face, and then laughs in your face behind your back.
Yeah.
And another thing.
Yes?
If he had a mother-in-law like mine, he would never laugh.
The hunt was a great success.
We bagged our buffalo.
Hey.
Did you get your meat, eh?
Ah, good. Good!
Well, we'd better shove on off then.
Boots off.
I see you took a bath.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Is there... ls there a slug of whiskey?
No, I left my jug... I hid it in the Camerons' wagon.
By the way, where is my little beauty?
Well, she's, uh...
She's somewheres around.
Well, now that you've got her all to yourself, what do you aim to do with her?
I think I'll take her back and settle on my plantation.
Your... Your plantation, eh?
Lopez, he's hollered so much about that there plantation of his, he believes it hisself, eh?
What? The Señor Thorpe, he have no plantation?
Plantation! Ha!
All you got in the world is a dirty deck of cards and a crooked one at that.
Zeke.
Yeah?
Coleman's been gone two days.
Yeah. I've been kinda worried about that myself.
Eagle Tail says last time he seen him, he was headed for the train.
Well, another thing, the
Camerons haven't crossed yet.
No. I better saunter on down there and see what's holdin' 'em, huh?
Yes. We'd better help 'em across.
Yeah. Go on.
Well, I think we can...
We were just wondering what had become of you.
Where's your horse?
He stepped in a prairie-dog hole and broke his neck.
Come near breakin' mine too.
Are you hurt?
No. I was knocked out for a spell.
Here, I'll put these in your wagon and help you across.
Flack said we could only use the wheelers.
Flack said? What does he know about water?
He never took a bath in his life.
Shortie!
There's the Cameron wagon.
I'll go greet the little filly.
Greet, eh?
Well, Lopez and me will go greet a jug.
Whoa!
You take 'em from here on in, Dave.
It's shallow water.
All right, Breck. I'll go back and get my saddle.
All right.
Giddyap!
Come on, Shortie!
Come on!
Come on, Shortie!
Come on! Get up there!
Whoa! Whoa!
I was just coming over to help you.
Thank you.
We had the best of help.
Help? Who?
What's the matter, Lopez?
Seein' a few ghosts?
Me? No, no.
Drive on into the corral, Dave.
All right.
Giddyap! Come on there!
Get up there!
Pull on up!
I'll be seeing you three later about matters and things.
Why, hello, boy.
Howdy, Zeke.
Why, what happened?
Pony stepped in a dog hole.
Yeah? I suppose a prairie dog shot that hole through your saddle and into your horse, eh?
Natchie!
Who was gone from camp, Zeke?
Thorpe and Lopez come in during the night, and early morning, sent a wagon out for the meat.
Well, a nice mess you made of things.
Not at all!
Two hundred yards running is considerable of a handicap.
Besides, other days are coming.
Well, don't you fool yourself.
Here he is, here he is, here he is.
Flack, the Injuns been sending up smoke signals for several days.
Yes, well, I seen 'em.
I'll skirmish around with the
Pawnees for a few miles.
Well, go on. There ain't no one keeping you!
No, but you'd better keep
Thorpe and Lopez here.
Why?
I got a feeling that if either one of 'em leaves camp, they'll never come back.
What do you mean by that?
Just the way it sounded.
Hey, look there.
Look there, eh?
Injuns?
Lopez, fire a long shot at 'em.
No fire!
They're Cheyennes.
They want to palaver.
Ah, they look to me as if they're out for harm.
They will be if we take a shot at 'em.
That'll mean war. I'll go out and palaver with them.
Go on. Go on. Maybe so you no come back, huh?
Look how queerly his horse is acting.
Yeah. He's riding zigzag.
That's Indian sign that he wants to palaver.
There's the chief riding out to meet him now for a powwow.
Zeke! Bascom!
How.
This is Black Elk, an old friend of mine.
Do they mean peace or war?
Peace, if as long as we march straight through the Cheyenne country without stopping to settle.
Now that we're gonna be friends, they'll probably bring their families over here to beg.
So feed 'em well and treat 'em right, and we'll have no trouble.
All right.
All right. Fine.
No more trouble now.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Zeke, what's he saying about me?
He says that Coleman wants you for his squaw.
Yes.
Yes. And he says Flack or Thorpe will get you.
Flack or Thorpe? Why?
Yeah.
Well, Flack's got a lot of horses.
Miss Ruth, you shouldn't be riding out here alone like this away from the train.
Why not?
Because this is dangerous country and anything might happen.
You wouldn't care.
Care? Me?
Why should you care?
Listen, girl, if anything happened to you, it'd be like throwing my heart to the wol...
Oh, what...
Don't worry. It's Black Elk and some of his braves.
Coleman squaw.
Coleman squaw.
Well, he's saying that I'm your squaw.
Seems like that's what he's driving at.
Well, you tell him that you don't want me for your squaw.
I've never told
Black Elk a lie yet.
He knows my tongue is straight.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, it wouldn't be true if I told him I didn't want you.
It happens I do.
And you've no better taste than to tell me that before all these savages?
I'd tell you that in front of the whole world.
This silly joke has gone far enough.
Hey! Well, there's one down anyway.
Well, there's some more out there.
Let's go get 'em.
All right, here we go.
Here she goes!
That's it.
That's it.
Another one.
Get over there. Hey.
Hey, there. Go on.
Yeah. Hope we land in no trouble up ahead.
Help those...
Help them take this stuff, the ones that are going down.
All right.
Hold tight.
All right.
Ah, you should be fine.
Hang on, boy.
You take Honey Girl from here on down, Dave.
It's a little easier going.
Hold on.
All right, Breck.
Careful of her, Davey.
Now, Miss Ruth, you cling on to me.
Put your arms around my neck, Honey Girl.
A little tighter.
Just a little tighter.
Let him down.
Come on, men.
Hurry up
Hang on.
Let's take some in pairs.
Are you all right, Honey Girl?
It was a pretty bad place, wasn't it, Breck?
Yeah, but I sort of liked it.
Davey, let's see if our wagon's down yet.
Come on, Honey Girl.
Thank you, Breck.
Well, well, well, well!
So I've seen that gal with her arms around your neck at last.
Yeah, but she sure unwrapped them when she got on safe footin'.
Yeah.
You know, she don't care nothin' about me, Zeke.
Well, you can never tell how a woman feels by the way she acts.
They's all riddles, all of 'em, and you just gotta guess 'em.
And no matter which way you guess, you're wrong.
Looks like as if the way they're puttin' some of them outfits over there, they're a-gonna lose 'em.
Hold it!
Ha-ha! What did I tell you?
Let's get out of here afore they get a bead on us.
Hold it!
Zeke, did you hear that terrible crash?
Hear it? I seen it.
You did?
That was your wagon!
Oh. Was my mother-in-law in it?
No, she wasn't.
Oh, that's too bad.
What'd you say?
I said, "I am glad."
Lucky for you that I wasn't, you loafing hound.
What you mean?
Because I was with your wife,
Sarah, and she gave birth to twins.
Twins? Are they both mine?
Both.
Oh, Mama, are they boys or girls?
One of each!
Oh, Zeke, I am a papa.
 Mama, I am a papa.
Papa, lam a mama.
Yeah.
I got two for one.
Yeah. Let's drink to the happy event.
Wait a minute. There was two events.
I have two drinks.
Here, give me that jug. I'll take a pull at that myself.
Three more.
Hyah! Giddyap!
Whoa!
Well, who'd have guessed it?
If it ain't Breck Coleman.
Howdy, Jim.
Where'd you blow in from, boy?
All the way from the big river.
Flack.
How long are we gonna camp here?
Well, just as long as it takes to fix up the outfit.
Bascom, you tell them pilgrims of yours, there's 500 miles of desert ahead of us and them that don't like what's comin' to them, now's the time for
'em to turn back.
Yes, sir, that pork is nearly done right now.
Shank me off a snack!
Get out of there.
Fine piece of beef.
Ah!
Fetch it on over here.
I hate to see you at menial tasks.
If we were only back at my old plantation in Louisiana, you'd have a dozen servants to wait on you.
Let's turn back.
Turn back, Mr. Thorpe?
Why... Oh. Why, I...
Oh, Honey Girl, didn't I tell you to stay away from the fire?
Yes. And you told me not to be sitting in a rocking chair when Breck Coleman was around.
Hello, Coleman.
Howdy, Dave.
You shot these turkeys. Won't you stay and help us eat them?
No. Uh, I just had supper with the Bascoms.
Sorry, Breck.
Think I'll go hunt up old Zeke.
How many's that for you, Windy?
Number 84.
Well, here comes 85.
Hello, Zeke. Windy.
Hello, boy.
I smell turkey a-cookin'.
That's all I got was a smell.
Deal me a hand of them flapjacks.
That's the way it's done, Gussie.
My old arm's giving out. Now you try it.
I'll get a pail of water.
That's easy.
I can do that.
See, I've saw Zeke do that till he broke his arm.
Yes. And you know, someday my mother-in-law's gonna talk so much, she's going to break her "yaw."
Say, boy, I wouldn't let my mother-in-law boss me around like that.
Stand up to her like a man.
Face her down, boy.
Huh. If it was me, I'd tell her what was on my chest.
You got nothing on your chest but wind!
You old polecat.
I've just been talking with some trappers who've come out of the Southwest.
They say the country they call California is wonderful.
Yes, so I've heard.
Why won't you come with me to a land like that?
Are you going there?
If you'll come with me.
Well, what about your plantation in Louisiana?
Oh. Well...
If we like
California better, we could sell my holdings and buy vast lands out there.
Well, it's...
It's a compliment to offer me all that, but it can't be.
I must join Davey.
Oh, Dave.
Dave, come over here.
Black Elk here says that you and your sister were so good to him, when he come in to visit that he wants to give you all them ponies.
Well, that's kind of him, Zeke, but we couldn't take their horses.
Oh, of course you could.
They got hundreds of ponies.
He wants you to show him where to put 'em.
You go and throw them ponies in with your herd.
Why, Zeke, you lyin' old coot.
That Injun's buying Cameron's sister for Coleman's squaw.
Well... Well...
Well, why not?
So Coleman's buying himself a squaw, eh?
Zeke, you old whiskered Cupid, you!
I loathe the very sight of you!
What have I done now?
You've made me the joke of the plains.
Me?
Who else tried to buy me like an Indian squaw?
You put me to shame before them all.
Why, girl, you're imagining things.
Oh... Ohh! Ohh!
Zeke always told me women were damned funny.
Mr. Thorpe,
I've changed my mind.
I'll go with you to California if you'll go at once.
At once?
Why, yes, yes.
Uh, I'll make preparations immediately.
This is a fine state of affairs.
This man Thorpe isn't all he claims to be.
My mind is made up, Davey, and we're going to California.
Where's Flack?
Hey!
I just came in to tell you good-bye.
Uh, good-bye?
Where are you going?
I'm going to take my outfit and leave you here.
Uh, your outfit? All you got is one horse and two guns.
No, the Cameron outfit's mine now.
Oh, it is, eh?
Yes, we're going to California, so I'll bid you a fond farewell.
No, you ain't!
No?
Nah!
Why do you suppose
I grubstaked you for, eh?
So far, you've been a fizzle.
One try, one miss.
Oh, he's no longer in my way.
Well, he's in mine.
Well, tear him down yourself.
Oh, I'd like to kick him into pulp.
Oh, I'd like to break him in two like a...
Well, why not?
I don't mind fists or feet, or even a gun.
It's the way he throws that knife.
But why should I risk it?
Because you're a dead shot.
You're a-going to stick.
You're a-going to prove how good you are, before you leave the fort.
And if I don't?
Well, if you don't...
I'll tell that little filly there's a wide-open noose waitin' for you in every river town.
Thorpe, you do your job before you leave the fort.
Howdy, Henry.
How's things, Coleman?
Just fine.
Say,
Black Elk was telling me that all the Injuns in the West was gathering to keep you all from passin' through.
So they tell me.
Black Elk and the Cheyennes are going west to hold a powwow with the Shoshones.
Yeah, Black Elk tells me that it's almost certain that the Cheyennes will declare war later.
Likely.
Old Pete Rubideaux was asking about you a while ago.
Pete? Where is he?
Camped at the spring yonder with his new squaw.
I think I'll ramble down and see him.
Sure.
Say, Henry, will you put a new cap nipple on this gun?
Sure will, boy.
And a new trigger spring in the pistol.
All right.
I'll leave 'em with you while I go see Pete.
Be ready when you come back.
We are about to unite this loving and devoted couple in the holy bonds of wedlock.
Hank Ginnis, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
Abigail Vance, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
She does!
Hey, Flack.
Yeah?
You recollect how Coleman done told you that if Lopez here, or Thorpe done strayed off into the brush, they weren't likely as how never come back?
Sure!
He made some kind of a bluff.
What of it?
Well, uh,
Thorpe strayed out and he ain't a-never comin' back.
Hey?
No.
He's done gone back to his old plantation.
Yeah.
Well, you won't go to
California with Thorpe now.
Why not?
He and Coleman just met in the brush, and Coleman shot him.
Are you sure?
I heard the shot.
And I saw Coleman standing there over him.
It suits me too.
So he'll even do murder.
And so I pronounce you man and wife.
And may peace and happiness be yours.
There's been a murder!
There's been a murder!
A murder? Where?
Where, girl? Who?
Coleman met Mr. Thorpe in the brush and shot him!
That's a serious accusation, my girl.
Are you sure?
My brother saw it.
Men, we can't have cold-blooded murderers among us.
There's the man that shot Bill Thorpe down like a dog.
Lopez, go and get a rope.
Get a rope.
Yeah, get the rope!
And just who accuses me of killing Thorpe?
It, uh...
It was Miss Cameron.
Huh.
You, eh?
So you'd like to see me hang.
Listen to me, you.
This boy, Coleman, here just couldn't have killed Thorpe.
Why not?
'Cause he didn't have no guns on him.
He left his'n with
Dutch Henry to be fixed.
Coleman and Thorpe were at odds with the Cameron girl.
If it wasn't Coleman, who was it who shot Thorpe?
Since you're aimin' to know,
I'll tell you who done it.
Who?
I shot that skunk myself!
Coleman's a friend of his, men.
He's lying to save his neck.
What could Zeke have against a man like Thorpe?
You want to know that too?
Yes, I want to know that too!
Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.
I was camped out pretty close to you, and I heared that powwow you had with Thorpe.
Yeah? What are you driving at?
Just this.
When a man begins to do a lot of talkin' about hangin', he'd better make pretty sure as to who's gonna decorate the end of the rope.
Get my meaning?
Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me.
It's no affair of mine.
That's just what
I was a-thinkin'.
Huh.
And Coleman ain't gonna do no scouting, while I'm boss of this train.
I'm leaving him behind.
Coleman would never...
Ah, now, we're taking on a new scout.
Guess again, Flack.
I started with this outfit, and
I'll be with it at the finish.
Who says so?
I'm just telling ya.
I got two reasons.
One is I told Wellmore
I'd scout the train through.
The other is a little personal business I aim to transact at the end of the trail.
See if you can figure out what that is, Flack.
Coleman, the settlers are willing to push on.
We'll follow you.
What's this talk about Injuns?
It's true.
The Injuns are gathering to the westward to stop us from going through.
Injuns have never yet prevented our breed of men from travelin' into the settin' sun.
Go on. Lead the way.
Well, get your outfits together.
We're going.
Never mind what you see or what you hear.
Red Flack is still boss of the train.
Get her going!
Go on.
Let's pull out and follow!
Giddyap!
Hup!
Ho!
Fall in!
Nag, giddyap!
Get in!
It's no use, men.
She's all dried up.
Hey, them settlers is dyin' off like rats.
We're for moving on.
Come on, Lopez.
Boy, they're scattered back all across the desert.
We gotta gather 'em up and shove 'em along.
Old Charlie died, Coleman.
We raised him from a colt.
Tough, boy.
But we gotta battle it through.
Hyah!
Giddyap!
Giddyap, Toby!
Giddyap, Toby! Giddyap!
Giddyap there!
Giddyap, Toby!
Come on!
Come on!
Work 'em on through!
Whoa!
What's all this?
Injun signs!
Pull up! Pull up!
Pull up!
Pull up there!
Pull over!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Here's your gun, boy!
All right.
Get up there.
Come on! Come on!
Get in here! Hurry up!
Don't panic!
Looks like
Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke.
Yeah.
Now let's throw it into 'em!
Stop shootin', everybody!
Stop shootin'!
They're ridin' off.
When they wheel back on us, reload it up and give it to 'em!
Yes, sir!
There they go, boy.
There they go.
Ha! I guess we was just a little too much for 'em.
Father, our good friends have perished here at the hands of the savages.
Open your arms to them and care for our loved ones until we meet again on the other shore.
Amen.
Well, Zeke...
Ol' Windy's gone on another trail.
Windy, you and me was...
Well, you and me was, uh...
Oh, my baby!
My baby! Oh, no!
My baby!
Well, Zeke, I'm gonna trail the Injuns and make sure they go back to their villages.
So you scout the train ahead, and I'll pick it up in a week or so.
Bye, Zeke.
Bye, boy.
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap!
Get over there!
Giddyap, there!
Come on, boys.
Get a hold of that wheel!
Tough time!
Lopez! Lopez, get 'em in line!
Hey, sí!
Put the whip to them!
Hey!
Pull the trailers!
Giddyap there!
Get on Up!
Work 'em over!
Go on!
Get outta there!
Come on, Bob!
Get 'em movin' to the right!
Get over there!
Hey! Get over there!
Giddyap, boy!
Come on. Come on.
Giddyap. Giddyap.
There we go!
I wonder how long we'll be bogged down here.
I don't know. I heard there was three wagons already turned back.
Ma, let's turn back to Missouri!
Me? Turn back because of a little mud?
Say, Uncle, when did
Bascom women ever turn back?
Grandma, don't you and Ma know that Pa is only jokin'?
Ha! All right now.
Be powerful on it now.
Hyah! Hyah!
Go on there, Fanny!
Go on, Meg!
Go on there, Jennie!
Jennie, go on! Go on, go on!
Oh, we're stuck.
Gus, you idiot!
You see what you've done?
You've got my wagon up to the hub in mud!
What are you kickin' about?
I am sitting on my mule.
Oh!
But don't worry, Mama.
I think it's gonna clear up.
There will be no more rain.
Get up! Get up!
Throw that idiot...
Throw that idiot a rope and help him out of there.
Keep in line!
Get up here!
Take the settlers to the right!
Get over here!
Get up in there!
Come over here and hold on.
Giddyap there!
Keep it in line!
Get over there!
Get over there!
Come on, boy!
Giddyap there!
Keep it going!
Come on there!
Keep it going!
Here, Abbie.
Here's the water.
Mama,
I got good news for you.
Ah, you're always bad news to me.
Get on your long underwear quick.
Why?
Well, you're going in the snow up to your... Up to your... Your...
Way up, Mama. And hand me out my bear overcoat.
Well, Useless...
You're going someplace you won't want to sit down.
It's so cold, it'll freeze your hooves off.
You wait and see.
Think I'll go say howdy to the Camerons.
This is my best overcoat.
Well, I'd hate to see your worst one.
Hello, Gus.
Oh, hello there, Breck.
I'm certainly glad to see you back again.
What are you wearing the heavy overcoat for?
I'm getting all ready for that snow.
No, we won't be there for days.
Well, anyway, I'm going to keep warm by the camp.
Where's the Cameron outfit?
Oh, we left them four or five days back.
Left 'em?
Yes. All their horses give out. They couldn't go on.
Fifteen, 20 wagons. They all went back to the fort.
I hated to tell ya, son.
Zeke, why did you let the Camerons go?
Ah, not my doin', son.
Flack knows
I savvy Injun sign, so he sends me on ahead to scout.
And when I come back, they'd all dropped out.
If Injuns chance on those wagons, they'll kill the lot of 'em.
I'm afeard so, Breck boy.
The Way's clear ahead, Zeke.
You scout 'em.
Yeah.
I'm going back for the Camerons.
Good luck, son!
Giddyap, Jennie!
Well, Useless...
Giddyap, Jennie!
I don't know who smells the worse, you or me.
Go ahead there!
Come on. Here we go again.
Pull, Fanny!
Hello! Hello!
Huh!
I felt someway that you'd come.
I'd have been here a heap sooner if I could've.
Say, Dave, you'd better out off that trailer and throw everything into one wagon.
All right.
I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody and we'll see if we can get out of here.
After you left, old Zeke told me the truth about some matters.
Thorpe and Flack and all.
He did, eh?
Sorry I was so stupid.
Oh, don't worry, Miss Ruth.
Things did look sort of queer.
I should have known better.
Well, we all get off on the wrong trail once in a while.
We'll make it through all right.
Well, that's fixed.
Can I do something, Breck?
No, I guess not.
We oughta overtake those settlers in a week or so.
Here you are, Ruthie.
Take it.
We're goin' again, Davey.
Heave-ho.
Pull 'er there. Come on.
Come on there, Shortie.
What did I tell you, huh?
You wouldn't listen to me.
You wouldn't listen to me!
We're lost!
There ain't a man here that knows the pass over them hills!
We're for turning back!
Wait! Wait!
Follow me and I'll lead you to that valley that Coleman told us about.
Coleman, huh? He's the only one that knows the way out, and he's deserted us!
Sure, he quit!
If he was here, I'd shoot him down in his tracks.
Well, Flack, just when you gonna start this shootin'?
You're just in time, Coleman.
Did you find the Camerons?
They're over yonder.
What's the trouble here?
They're all against me.
They're turning back.
No, you're not!
We can't turn back.
We're blazing a trail that started in England.
Not even storms of the sea could turn back those first settlers.
And they carried it on further.
They blazed it on through the wilderness of Kentucky.
Famine, hunger, not even massacres could stop them.
And now we've picked up the trail again, and nothing can stop us!
Not even the snows of winter nor the peaks of the highest mountains.
We're building a nation!
So we've got to suffer.
No great trail was ever blazed without hardship.
And you've gotta fight!
That's life.
And when you stop fightin', that's death.
What are you gonna do, lie down and die?
No!
No!
Not in a thousand years.
You're going on with me!
The word is said, and we'll follow you.
Be ready to start at sunup!
Well... Well, he's turned up again.
Yeah, well, he'll down the both of us.
You've got to get him tonight.
But they can hear a shot at night.
Well, they can't hear a knife.
They all know this knife of mine.
Well, here's a knife they don't know.
No, no, no, no.
I afraid of that knife.
I know where you got it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh!
It will get us in trouble sure.
How?
Because a dead man's knife is bad medicine!
Here, just stop that drivel.
No.
Take the knife and wait for tonight.
There he goes.
Wait until he's bedded down, and then...
Give me a drink.
God bless my sister Ruth and my brother Dave, and make me a good girl, and take care of us.
Aren't you going to ask God to take care of Breck Coleman?
Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself.
You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez!
Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife.
Well, where'd you find it, boy?
Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.
Their having it makes it certain that Flack and Lopez did it.
No question about it, boy.
What did they do, Coleman?
Killed my best friend.
I been on their trail ever since.
That's a serious charge.
If you're sure, we'll call a settlers' meeting in the morning to try 'em.
You can call a settlers' meeting to bury 'em.
What do you mean?
That I kill my own rats!
They've jumped camp,
Zeke, and I'm off on their trail.
Breck, you can't leave us here!
You got to see us through.
He's right, boy.
Maybe so, the way you all look at it.
But those two men killed a man in cold blood, and they've got to pay.
It's not that I've got hatred in my heart, but that I'm the law out here, that's all.
And the law is justice.
Well, Zeke, I'll see 'em to the end of the trail.
But then I'm picking up a new trail here.
Get over! Get over!
Get over here!
Hah! Get over! Hah!
Get over!
Whoa, hah! Whoa, hah!
Whoa, hah!
Get over! Pull!
Yonder stands the great white mountain.
And down below lies the valley I've told you about.
Coleman, you have fulfilled our hopes.
Neighbors!
Friends!
It is fitting that we give thanks to the Almighty.
Our Father, we thank thee for leading us to this land of promise, for guiding our footsteps safely through the dangers of our pilgrimage.
In this valley of our dreams, we'll build our homes and serve thee, O Father.
And our children's children shall praise thy name.
Amen.
The way is clear ahead.
All gentle slopes.
So drive down, my friends, and settle it.
Lead the way.
Zeke will lead the way down.
Our trails fork here.
You mean you are leaving us?
There's a trail I've followed for over 3,000 miles now, and I'm headin' back to pick it up again and follow it to the end.
Coleman, you're the breed of man that would follow a trail to the end.
Thanks, Bascom.
Friends, we'll go on.
Boy, there's two of 'em.
Bad ones.
Now, I'm going with you.
No, Zeke.
You stay here and look after
Ruth and her outfit.
Breck, you're not leaving.
Yes, Miss Ruth.
I'm pullin' out.
They say you're going to hunt down Flack and Lopez.
That's what I aim to do.
But you can't do this awful thing...
Take two lives!
It's frontier justice.
Don't go, Breck.
Don't go!
It's a job
I've got to finish.
But don't you see?
It doesn't matter about them.
I'm afraid for you.
They'll kill you!
You're everything in the world to me, Breck.
I can't let you go!
I can't!
The thing has to be done.
Someday...
Somewhere...
Our trails will cross again.
Now, now.
Come, come, miss.
You mustn't be a-carryin' on thataway.
He's gone.
He'll never come back.
Now, now, you just mustn't do this, miss.
You'll have me a-blubberin' here pretty soon.
I'm a-tellin' ya that everything is going to be all right.
When spring comes in that valley, he'll be tracking back again.
I know that boy.
I know him.
Now, come, come.
Come on, Ruth.
Come on.
My legs are froze to the knees.
I can't get up.
Yes, looks as if you're done for, Lopez.
But, Flack, don't go away and leave me, Flack.
What? Do you think
I'm staying here?
Well, then leave me a blanket!
I'm frozen.
Ah, won't do you no good.
You'll be froze to death in an hour.
Flack!
It may help me.
Now get away.
Flack! Flack!
Flack, don't let me die alone!
Stay with me! Flack!
Flack!
Well, Lopez.
It won't be long before you have company.
Flack!
Yeah, Milt.
I got a hankerin' to trail on down into Mexico.
Old Bill Gillie done told me that them there black-eyed gals is just full of fire.
Zeke?
Yeah?
Zeke, you're not really leaving us?
Yeah, gal, I'm a-pullin' out. You is all nice and settled now.
And this here valley is gettin' altogether too civilized for me.
Whenever I get more than three or four families within a hundred mile of me,
I begin to feel kind of crowded.
That's not why you're going, Zeke.
No? Why else, gal?
Breck has never come back. You're going out to look for him.
Now, wherever that boy
Breck Coleman is at, he's a-lookin' out for hisself.
Now don't you fret about him.
Did you give away all your little puppies?
Why are you looking at that dress?
This is the anniversary of the...
The day that the wagon train left from Missouri.
Last time I had this on,
I was sitting in the Riggses' cabin.
In a rocking chair?
Yes, Honey Girl.
In a rocking chair.
Zeke, I reckon that's a panther.
Yeah!
It's a two-legged panther.
The only kind whatever gimme that Comanche yell as a signal.
We might just as well start to unpack.
What, ain't you going?
No use of going now.
He's only a bit up in the timber there, and he's a-headed this way.
Zeke, won't you stay over for the anniversary?
Yes, gal, I'll stay.
Aw!
And I just recollected, I got a little present for you.
Oh, Zeke, what is it?
Well, a young fella named Breck
Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up.
Where is it, Zeke?
I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.
You'll find it there.
Thanks, Zeke.
I'll go get it.
English - US - SDH
These hills here are full of Apaches.
They've burnt every ranch building in sight.
He had a brush with 'em last night.
Says they're bein' stirred up by Geronimo.
Geronimo?
How do we know he isn't lying?
Ah, he's a Cheyenne.
They hate Apaches worse than we do.
Clear the wires to Lordsburg.
That's Lordsburg now, sir. They seem to have something very urgent to tell you, sir.
- Well? Well, what's wrong?
- The line went dead, sir.
- What do you got there?
- Only the first word, sir.
"Geronimo."
Whoa! Whoa! Steady, whoa!
- Well, so long, Buck!
- Nice trip, Buck?
- Oh, so-so.
- Got the payroll for the mining company?
- Yes, sir. Right here in this box here.
- Good. Give me a lift here, Jim, will ya?
Jim, I'll pay ya that two bits when I come through.
- Okay, partner.
- Hey, now, you kids get away from that wheel.
Well, sir, we run into a little snow up there.
'Tweren't bad, though, but you fellas better prepare for a good frost.
Passenger out for Tonto.
You'd better get out and stretch your leg -
I mean, your limbs, ma'am.
We're gonna change horses here.
- Is there a place here where I can have a cup of tea?
- Well, yes, ma'am.
You can get a cup of coffee at the hotel across the street there.
- Thank you, driver.
- Uh, you look a little peaked -
- I'll be all right, thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.
Why, Lucy Mallory.
Nancy.
- How are you, Captain Whitney?
- Fine, thanks, Mrs. Mallory.
Why, whatever are you doing in Arizona?
I'm joining Richard in Lordsburg.
He's there with his troops.
He's a lot nearer than that, Mrs. Mallory.
He's been ordered to Dry Fork.
That's the next stop for the stagecoach.
You'll be with your husband in a few hours.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you, Lucy.
Sit down, darling. We'll have a cup of coffee.
You must be tired from that long trip.
- Who is that gentleman?
- Hardly a gentleman, Mrs. Mallory.
I should think not.
He's a notorious gambler.
Hello, Mink! Hidee, Frank!
Well, Marshal, I'm looking for my shotgun guard. Is he here?
Out with the posse, Buck, trying to catch the Ringo Kid.
- Ringo? I thought Ringo was in the pen.
- He was.
Busted out?
Well, good for him.
My guess, the Kid's aimin' to get even with them Plummer boys.
It was their testimony sent him to the penitentiary.
Well, all I gotta say is that he'd better stay away from that there Luke Plummer.
Why, gosh, Luke's run all of Ringo's friends out of Lordsburg.
The last trip there, I seen him hit a rancher on the head with the barrel of his gun... and, well, he just laid it wide open like a butchered steer.
- You seen Luke Plummer in Lordsburg?
- Yes, sirree.
Hmm.
You boys take care of the office for a couple days.
I'm going to Lordsburg with Buck.
Gonna ride shotgun.
Oh, gosh, if I could learn to keep my big mouth shut -
Here's the payroll, Mr. Gatewood.
Ever since I opened this bank,
I've been trying to tell those people... to deposit their payroll six months in advance.
It's good, sound business.
Good business for you, Mr. Gatewood.
Well, there's your receipt - $50,000.
And remember this - what's good for the banks is good for the country.
Now, now, now, my dear lady -
Good riddance to bad rubbish!
Get out and stay out!
I'm keeping your trunk
'cause you ain't paid your rent.
"Is this the face...
"that wrecked a thousand ships... and burned the towerless tops of Ilium?"
Farewell, fair Helen.
Doc. Doc, can they make me leave town when I don't want to go? Do I have to go?
Dallas, don't you go makin' no fuss.
Do I have to go, Doc, just because they say so?
Dallas, I've got my orders.
Don't blame these ladies. It ain't them.
It is them!
Doc, haven't I any right to live?
What have I done?
We're the victims of a foul disease called social prejudice, my child.
These dear ladies of the Law and Order League are scouring out the dregs of the town.
Come on.
Be a proud, glorified dreg like me.
- You get going, Doc. You're drunk.
- Two of a kind.
- Just two of a kind.
- Take my arm, Madame la Comtesse.
The tumbril awaits!
To the guillotine!
Oh, wait till I get my badge, girls!
I'll join you!
If ever you go East, brother... come out to our house for dinner.
No one in all Kansas City, Kansas, sets a better table than my dear wife, Violet.
- Jerry.
- Yeah, Doc.
Jerry, I'll admit, as one man to another... that, economically,
I haven't been of much value to you.
But... suppose you could put one on credit?
If talk was money, Doc, you'd be the best customer I got.
I'm leaving town, Jerry.
- Honest?
- Yes, old friend.
And I thought you might, out of memory of our many happy -
All right, Doc. Just this one.
Thank you, Jerry.
Here's a man goin' on the stagecoach with you.
- He's an Easterner from Kansas City, Missouri.
- Kansas City, Kansas, brother.
To your health, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman.
My name is Peacock. I'm a -
He's a whiskey drummer.
A what?
Well, well!
How are you, Mr. Haycock?
- Peacock.
- Don't tell me, sir.
I know, I know.
A familiar name and an honored name.
I never forget a face or a friend.
Samples? Hmm!
Ahh! Rye.
Well, Brownie!
- Blackie! Belle! Bess!
- Giddap!
Well, lookee here.
Got a pretty good team there.
Whoa! Back up.
Come on in.
Yeah. Back it up.
Got my favorite team there, Slim!
Yeah, Buck, they're all good and fresh.
They'll take you right there.
I want five dollars, Henry!
Certainly, my dear. Certainly.
What is it to be this time, my dear?
A pair of shoes -
I want to pay the butcher.
Dinner's at 12:00.
Don't worry, my dear.
I'll be there.
I've invited the ladies of the Law and Order League.
All -
All aboard for Dry Fork...
All -
All aboard for Dry Fork...
Apache Wells, Lee's Ferry and Lordsburg!
- I'll take that, Dallas.
- Oh, thanks.
In you go, Dallas, and a pleasant voyage.
Leave your baggage, Doc?
Thank you.
Thank you, my friend.
Curley, my shingle.
Carry it with honor.
- I'll take it, Doctor.
- Oh, no. No trouble at all.
No trouble at all.
I'll carry it on my lap.
Here we go.
Here we go, Reverend.
Mrs. Whitney, you're not going to let your friend travel with that creature.
She's right, Lucy. And besides, you're not well enough to travel.
It's only a few hours, Nancy.
I'm quite all right.
But you shouldn't travel a step without a doctor.
There is a doctor, dear.
The driver told me.
Doctor? Doc Boone?
Why, he couldn't doctor a horse.
Lucy darling, you must be very careful.
Take good care of yourself.
- Watch that step now.
- Lady folks ride facing forward, please.
There you go.
- Pleasant journey, Mrs. Mallory.
- Thank you. Good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Bye!
Like an angel in a jungle.
A very wild jungle.
What are you doin', Hatfield - talkin' to yourself?
You wouldn't understand, cowboy.
You've never seen an angel... nor a gentlewoman... nor a great lady.
I raise, gentlemen.
Well, so long, Buck! So long, Curley!
Nice trip, boys!
- So long, kids!
- Wait a minute! Hold it there, Buck!
Cavalry comin'!
Steady, girls!
Captain Sickels asks if you'll deliver this dispatch in Lordsburg the moment you arrive.
- The telegraph line has been cut.
- Sure.
We're going with you as far as the noon station at Dry Fork.
There'll be a troop of cavalry there, and they'll take you on to Apache Wells.
From Apache Wells, you'll have another escort of soldiers into Lordsburg.
But you must warn your passengers that they travel at their own risk.
- At their own risk?
What's the trouble, Lieutenant?
- Geronimo.
- Geronimo? Well, then I ain't go -
- Will you sit down!
Of course, the army has no authority over you gentlemen.
- If you think it's unsafe to make the trip -
- This stage is goin' to Lordsburg.
If you think it ain't safe to ride along with us...
I figure we can get there without you soldier boys.
I have my orders, sir, and I always obey orders.
Did you all hear what the lieutenant said?
Yes, we heard.
Well, me and Buck are taking this coach through, passengers or not.
Whoever wants to get out can get out.
- It's -
- Courage. Courage, Reverend.
- Ladies first.
- Oh. Excuse me.
How about you, Dallas?
What are you tryin' to do, scare somebody?
They got me in here.
Now let 'em try to put me out.
There are worse things than Apaches.
If you'll take my advice, ma'am, you won't take this trip.
My husband is with his troops in Dry Fork.
If he's in danger, I want to be with him.
You see, brother,
I have a wife and five children in Kansas City.
Then you're a man. By all the powers that be, Reverend, you're a man.
- All right, folks.
- Marshal!
Make room for one more.
I'm offering my protection to this lady.
I can shoot fairly straight, if there's need for it.
That's been proved too many times, Hatfield.
All right, get in. We're late.
- May I trouble you to move over, sir?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
Close the door.
- Aw, Curley, we shouldn't -
- Get going, Buck!
Bessie! Brownie! Bill!
Farewell, ladies!
- Sweetheart! Come on now, girl!
- Good-bye!
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Room for another passenger?
- Sure is, Mr. Gatewood.
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- That's right. Just got a telegram.
Had to stop to pack this bag.
Oh, I got it in.
Hyah, hyah! Sassy! Blackie! Brownie! Bill!
Yow!
All right, Brownie.
Queenie, steady, girl.
Good boy. Get along.
If there's anything I don't like, it's drivin' a stagecoach through Apache country.
Funny catching Gatewood outside of town that way.
I just took this job 10 years ago so I could make enough money... to marry my Mexican girl, Julietta, and I been workin' hard at it ever since.
Bonnie, get over there! Ho!
- Marriage?
- Well, certainly.
My wife's got more relatives than anyone you ever did see.
I bet I'm feedin' half the state of Chihuahua.
Sweetheart! Ho!
That seem funny to you about Gatewood?
Yeah, and then what do I get to eat when I get home in Lordsburg?
Nothin' but frijole beans. That's all.
Nothin' but beans, beans, beans.
Bessie! Brownie! Blackie girl!
Yow! Get along!
Excuse me, ladies.
Close quarters.
Warm today.
Your wife made it warm for me, Gatewood.
She was chairman of our farewell committee.
Fine-looking bunch of soldier boys back there.
Always gives me great pride in my country... when I see such fine young men in the U.S. Army.
Anybody know where they're going?
Brother, aren't you aware of what's happened?
Happened?
I - I don't follow you, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman. I'm a -
My friend's a whiskey drummer.
We're all gonna be scalped, Gatewood.
Massacred in one fell swoop.
- That's why the soldiers are with us.
- He's joking, of course.
Oh, no, he's not.
Oh, dear, no. I wish he were.
It's that old Apache butcher, Geronimo.
Geronimo - nice name for a butcher.
He's jumped the reservation.
He's on the warpath.
Geronimo? Why weren't the passengers notified?
Why wasn't I told?
- We -
- We were told, Gatewood.
Yes.
Weren't you told when you got that message from Lordsburg?
Oh, yes, yes. Y-Yes, of course. I - I forgot.
Steady now! String out! Sweetheart!
Now, doggone it, they're bringing up her grandfather... all the way from Mexico to live with us.
I can't figure out how he got that message.
- Who? Her grandfather?
- No, Gatewood.
Sweetheart!
- Said he got a message.
- Sweetheart!
- Telegraph line ain't workin'.
- Sweetheart.
Hold it!
Whoa! Steady! Ho. Ho.
- Hey, look, it's Ringo.
- Yeah.
Hello, Kid.
Hello, Curley.
Hiya, Buck! How's your folks?
Oh, just fine, Ringo.
- Except my grandfather came up -
- Shut up.
Didn't expect to see you ridin' shotgun on this run, Marshal.
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- I figured you'd be there by this time.
No. Lame horse.
Well, it looks like you've got another passenger.
Yeah. I'll take the Winchester.
You may need me and this Winchester, Curley.
Saw a ranch house burnin' last night.
You don't understand, Kid.
You're under arrest.
Curley -
- Everything all right, Marshal?
- Everything's all right, Lieutenant.
- Hope I ain't crowdin' you folks none.
- The more, the merrier.
Bonnie! Brownie! Blackie! Hyah!
Hyah, Bessie!
Ain't Ringo a fine boy?
I think so.
You're just smarter than a trade rat.
You knew all the time he was goin' to Lordsburg.
Hey, reckon what he meant he saw ranch houses burnin'?
- Apaches.
- Oh, Apaches.
So, you're the notorious Ringo Kid.
My friends just call me Ringo.
Nickname I had as a kid.
Right name's Henry.
Seems to me I knew your family, Henry.
Didn't I fix your arm once when you were, oh - bucked off a horse?
- Are you Doc Boone?
- I certainly am.
Now, let's see.
I'd just been honorably discharged from the Union army... after the War of the Rebellion.
You mean the War for the Southern Confederacy, sir.
I mean nothing of the kind, sir.
That was my kid brother broke his arm.
You did a good job, Doc, even if you was drunk.
Thank you, son.
- Professional compliments are always pleasing.
- Yes, they are.
What happened to that boy whose arm I fixed?
He was murdered.
Put out that cigar.
You're annoying this lady.
Excuse me, madam.
Being so partial to the weed myself...
I sometimes forget that it disagrees with others.
A gentleman doesn't smoke in the presence of a lady.
Three weeks ago, I took a bullet out of a man who was shot by a gentleman.
The bullet was in his back.
- Do you mean to insinuate -
- Sit down, mister.
Doc don't mean no harm.
- Hiya, Pete! Hi, Joey!
- Hello!
Be careful of old Bessie up there now.
Take it easy.
Hold it steady, girl.
Prepare to dismount!
Take a look and see if there isn't a stone bruisin' that hock down there.
If it isn't my old friend,
Sergeant Billy Pickett!
- Well! How are ya, Billy?
- He's fine, Doc, and mighty glad to see ya!
Great heavens to Betsy! Didn't figure on no stagecoach comin' through... with them Apaches raisin' Cain.
I was just telling Billy to hitch up the buckboard so we could get the young ones in -
Wait a minute! You mean to say there are no troops at this station?
Ain't no soldiers here but what you see.
But my husband, Captain Mallory -
I was told he was here.
He was, dearie. Got orders night afore last to join the soldiers at Apache Wells.
- That means we gotta go back.
- I can't go back!
Driver, you started this coach for Lordsburg, and it's your duty to get us there.
And it's your duty, young man, to come along with us!
It's my duty, Mr. Gatewood, to obey orders.
I'm sorry, sir.
Well, if the soldiers go back, Lieutenant, that means we all have to go back?
My orders are to return from here immediately, and I can't disobey those orders.
I think we can get through all right, Curley.
Oh, now, don't egg him on, Kid.
I'm drivin' this here outfit, and, well, if the soldiers go back, so am I.
I call this a desertion of duty.
I'll report you to your superior officer.
If necessary,
I'll take the matter up with Washington!
That's your privilege, sir, but if you give us any trouble here...
I'll have to put you under restraint.
Now, don't lose your temper.
Don't lose your temper.
I'll tell you how we'll settle it. We'll take a vote.
Inside, everybody. Come on, Buck.
Oh, Curley, I don't wanna go to -
Now you girls set yourselves down.
I'll get you something to eat.
Now, folks, if we push on, we can be in Apache Wells by sundown.
Soldiers there will give us an escort as far as the ferry.
Then it's only a hoot and a holler into Lordsburg.
- Well, that old mare, I don't -
- We've got four men can handle firearms.
Five with you, Ringo.
Doc can shoot, if sober.
I can shoot?
I can shoot?
Now, Miss Mallory, I - I ain't gonna put a lady in danger without she votes for it.
I've traveled all the way here from Virginia.
I'm determined to get to my husband.
I won't be separated any longer.
- What's your vote, mister?
- Well -
Where's your manners, Curley?
Ain't you gonna ask the other lady first?
Well, what do you say?
What difference does it make?
Doesn't matter.
I vote that we go on. I demand it.
I'm standing on my legal rights.
What do you say, Hatfield?
Lordsburg.
Four. You, Doc?
I'm not only a philosopher, sir.
I'm a fatalist.
Somewhere, sometime, there may be the right bullet or the wrong bottle... waiting for Josiah Boone.
- Why worry when or where?
- Yes or no?
Having that philosophy, sir,
I've always courted danger.
During the late war, when I had the honor to serve the Union... under our great president,
Abraham Lincoln... ah, and General Phil Sheridan... well, sir, I fought 'midst shot and shell and cannon roar!
- Do you want to go back or not?
- No!
I want another drink.
That's five.
How about you, Mr. Hancock?
It's Peacock.
I'd like to go on, brother.
I want to reach the bosom of my dear family in Kansas City, Kansas, as quickly as possible... but I may never reach that bosom if we go on.
So, under the circumstances -
You understand, brother -
I think it best we go back with the bosoms -
I mean, the soldiers.
One against. Well, Buck?
- I want -
- Buck says aye. That's six.
I'm voting your proxy, Kid.
You go with me.
Ain't nothin' keeping me out of Lordsburg, Curley.
There sure ain't.
Well, folks, that settles it.
We're going through.
Sit down, folks, and eat your grub.
Come on, Buck. We'll change them horses.
- But, Curley, ain't we gonna eat? Ohh!
- You can eat later!
Here you are, folks.
Here you are, folks.
Food's on the table. Help yourselves.
You got a long ride ahead of ya.
You ain't drinkin', Billy.
Sit down here, ma'am.
Thanks.
May I find you another place, Mrs. Mallory?
It's cooler by the window.
Thank you.
Looks like I got the plague, don't it?
No. No, it's not you.
Well, I guess you can't break out of prison and into society in the same week.
Please! Please.
You're ill, Mrs. Mallory.
No, it's just that I -
I'll be all right.
You've been very kind. Why?
In the world I live in, one doesn't often meet a lady, Mrs. Mallory.
Have you ever been in Virginia?
I was in your father's regiment.
I should remember your name.
You're Mr. Hatfield.
That's what I'm called, yes.
- Why do you look at me like that?
- I'm just tryin' to remember.
Ain't I seen you someplace before, ma'am?
- No. No, you haven't.
- Hmm.
I wish I had though.
I know you.
I mean, I know who you are.
I guess everybody in the territory does.
Yep.
Well, I used to be a good cowhand, but... things happened.
Yeah, that's it.
Things happened.
And now they'll take you back to prison.
Not till I finish a job in Lordsburg.
But you can't.
You're going there as a prisoner.
All aboard for Apache Wells, Lee's Fer -
All righty, folks, the horses are changed.
We'd better get going.
- And Lordsburg, maybe.
- All right, get going, Ringo.
Mrs. Pickett, tell Billy the buckboard is all ready. Let's get going.
All right, Marshal, we're ready.
- Come on, folks, let's move.
- My compliments to your husband.
Thank you.
I still feel that we ought to go back with the soldiers.
We've got to hurry if we wanna be there by sundown.
Bridesmaid! Baby! Yow!
- What'd you say?
- Nothin'.
Well, why don't ya say somethin'?
A fella gets nervous, sittin' here like a dummy, nothin' to think about but the Indians.
You say something! You've been sitting there all day talking without making any sense!
All right, I'll say somethin' that makes sense.
If I was you, I'd let 'em shoot it out.
- Let who?
- Luke Plummer and the Kid.
There'd be a lot more peace in this territory... if that Luke Plummer was so full of lead he couldn't hold his liquor.
I ain't sayin' I don't share your sentiments, Buck.
- But you're a born fool.
- Well, I know that.
In the first place,
Luke would kill the Kid in a gunfight.
In the second place, if Luke did get shot, he's got two brothers just as ornery as he is.
Nah, the only safe place for Ringo is in the pen, and I aim to get him there all in one piece!
Well, I'll be doggoned if I didn't do you an injury, Curley.
- I figured you were after the reward.
- Reward?
Why, the Kid's old man and me was friends.
We used to punch cattle together.
Besides, I could use that 500 in gold.
- Bridesmaid!
- Uh-uh! Steady!
Steady, girl!
Bridesmaid! In line!
I can't get over the impertinence of that young lieutenant.
I'll make it warm for that shavetail!
I'll report him to Washington!
We pay taxes to the government, and what do we get?
- Not even protection from the army.
- No.
I don't know what the government is coming to.
Instead of protecting businessmen, it pokes its nose into business.
Hmph!
Why, they're even talking now about having bank examiners.
As if we bankers don't know how to run our own banks!
Why, Boone, I actually had a letter from a popinjay official... saying they were going to inspect my books!
I have a slogan that should be blazoned on every newspaper in the country -
America for Americans!
The government must not interfere with business!
Reduce taxes!
Our national debt is something shocking!
Over $1 billion a year!
What this country needs is a businessman for president!
What this country needs is more fuddle.
- What?
- Fuddle!
You're drunk, sir!
I'm happy, Gatewood.
Boo!
How come you're taking this road?
It's gonna be cold up there.
I'm usin' my head.
Those breech-clad Apaches don't like snow.
Maybe you'd like to - to sit next to me.
I - You could put your head on my shoulder.
No, thank you.
How are you feeling, Mrs. Mallory?
Is there any water?
Driver! Canteen, please!
Just a minute, Mrs. Mallory.
Haven't I seen this crest before?
Isn't this from Greenfield Manor?
I wouldn't know, Mrs. Mallory. I -
I won this cup on a wager.
- Oh.
- How about the other lady?
Thanks.
Sorry. No silver cups.
This is fine.
No.
Please, Doctor.
Yow, girls!
Whoa, steady. Ho.
Howdy, Chris. Seven hours from Dry Fork.
Pretty fast drivin', amigo!
Get the folks a bite to eat, Chris, while we change horses. We're pushing on to Lordsburg.
You come without soldiers?
Oh, we weren't a-scared.
We didn't see one Apache, did we, Curley?
- Where's the cavalry, Chris?
- Uh-huh. Where's the soldiers?
There ain't no soldiers.
- Huh?
- Soldiers have gone.
Where's Captain Mallory?
Where's my husband?
Where is he?
You're his wife, I think?
Yes. Where is he?
Did he go with his men?
Si, señora.
Little what you call it - scrimmage with the Apaches last night.
Soldiers take Captain Mallory to Lordsburg.
I think he get hurt maybe.
Badly?
Si, señora.
I think so.
Mrs. Mallory, I'm awfully sorry.
If there's anything I can -
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Marshal! Come here! Quickly!
Come on, Doc.
Let's go, Doc.
- Poor woman.
- A sick woman on our hands!
- That's all we needed!
- I feel kinda sick myself.
We're in a fine fix, my friends.
It's a fine country we're living in.
The army has no right to leave a public place like this undefended.
Looks to me like the army's got its hands pretty full, mister.
- Have you a wife?
- Si, señora, I think.
- Call her.
- Yakima! ¿Dónde estás?
Ringo, go in the kitchen and get some hot water, lots of hot water, please.
Yes, ma'am. Hey, Chris!
¿Dónde la cocina?
Aqui está, Kid.
A fine member of the medical profession.
Drunken beast.
Coffee.
Give me coffee.
Black coffee.
Lots of it.
- More! More! More!
- Ain't it enough, Doc? That's four.
- Blacker! Stronger! Keep it comin', Curley!
- You'll have it coming out your ears in a minute.
Drink it down, Doc. Go on.
Drink it down.
- Get it down.
- That'll make you feel better.
All right, Doc.
Isn't that drunken swine sober yet?
- He's doing the best he can!
- Well, hurry!
- Shh! Está malo.
- Tinhorn.
- How you feeling?
- Fine.
Thanks. Again.
Sit down here, Doc.
Keep the fire going, Chris.
- Plenty of hot water.
- Si, señor. Si.
Savages!
That's my wife, Yakima. My squaw.
Yes, but she's - she's savage!
Si, señor.
She a little bit savage, I think.
Ándale pronto. A calentar agua.
A la enferma, pronto.
Something funny about this.
That woman's an Apache.
Sure, she's one of
Geronimo's people, I think.
Maybe not so bad to have Apache wife, eh?
Apache don't bother me, I think.
- All right, Doc?
- All right.
All right, Dallas.

Ringo!
It's them vaqueros!
They've run away!
Yeah, with the spare horses.
Them coyotes give me the creeps.
It sounds li -
Well, it sounds just like a baby.
Black eight.
It's a baby.
It's a little girl.
It's a little girl.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Why didn't somebody tell me?
How's Mrs. Mallory?
She's going to be all right.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
- Did-Did you know?
- Why -
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Don't do that.
Dr. Boone.
Come on, boys.
Three cheers for ol' Doc Boone.
- Hip, hip -
- Quiet.
- Well, we oughta be -
- Quiet.
Mrs. Mallory.
Oh.
Kid, I know why you want to go to Lordsburg.
I like you. I know your pop.
He was good friend of mine.
If you know who in Lordsburg, you stay away, I think.
You mean Luke Plummer?
Luke, Ike and Hank - all there together.
I saw them.
- Are you sure of that, Chris?
- Sure. I can tell you the truth.
- I know.
- Thanks.
- That's all I wanted to know.
- You crazy if you go.
I think you stay away, Kid.
Three against one is no good.
You oughtn't to go too far, Miss Dallas.
Apaches like to sneak up and pick off strays.
You, uh, visitin' in Lordsburg?
No. No, I have friends there.
And maybe I can find work.
Say, look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
- Why don't you get away?
- I aim to - in Lordsburg.
Why Lordsburg?
Why don't you make for the border now?
My father and brother were shot down by the Plummer boys.
Guess you don't know how it feels to lose your own folks that way.
I lost mine when I was a kid.
There was a massacre on Superstition Mountain.
That's tough, especially on a girl.
Well, you gotta live no matter what happens.
Yeah. That's it.
Look, Miss Dallas, you got no folks.
And neither have I, and, well... maybe I'm taking a lot for granted, but -
I watched you with that baby... that other woman's baby.
You looked, well -
Well, I still got a ranch across the border.
And it's a nice place, a real nice place.
Trees and grass, water.
There's a cabin half built.
A man could live there... and a woman.
Will you go?
But you don't know me.
You don't know who I am.
I know all I want to know.
Will you go?
Oh, don't talk like that.
What are you doing out here, Kid?
Stick close to the reservation.
Curley! Oh, Curley!
Oh! Curley! Curley!
- What's wrong, Chris?
- My wife, Yakima - she run away.
- When I wake up, she was gone.
- The way you come busting in here, you'd think -
- Whoa.
- Excuse me, Kid.
Come busting in here, you'd think we were being attacked.
- You can find another wife.
- Sure I can find another wife.
But she take my rifle and my horse.
Oh, I never sell her.
I love her so much.
I beat her with the whip, and she never get tired.
- Your wife?
- No. My horse.
Oh.
I can find another wife easy, yes, but not a horse like that.
Mala Yakima.
I knew that woman was a thief, by -
What's the matter with you, Gatewood?
My valise! Where's my valise?
Which one of you have got it?
Here it is. I was usin' it for a pillow.
I didn't think you'd mind.
I thought I told you to keep your hands off my things!
Yes, sir.
That squaw of yours will find some Apaches and bring 'em back here.
My wife's people don't bother me, I think.
Well, they bother me, I think.
Chris, is this bar open?
Sure, all the time, señor. Si.
Good.
Here you are, Doc.
Well, what are we wasting time for?
Let's make a break for it.
- We've got a sick woman to think of.
- Do you want her to stay here and be butchered with the rest of us?
- Why don't you think of somebody else for once?
- Do you realize who you're talking to?
Easy, easy! Quiet, boys. Quiet.
We ain't been butchered yet.
But you're right.
We'd better get going for Lordsburg as soon as we can.
Might be a good idea, Curley, if, uh,
Doc took a look at the patient.
Yeah, and Little Coyote.
You'll join me, Doctor?
No, thanks.
Morning.
Well, you're looking pretty chipper.
Hmm. You're up early, Dallas.
She didn't go to bed, Doctor.
I'm afraid she sat up all night while I slept.
Oh, I slept a lot in the chair.
Well, anyway, it was nice to stay awake and hold the baby.
Hmm. Well, we've got to get you to Lordsburg, Little Coyote.
That's what the boys christened her last night when she squalled - Little Coyote.
- How do you feel?
- Fine, thanks. A little tired.
- Doctor, do you think my husband -
- Never mind him.
The best medicine he can have is to see you two safe and sound.
You just make up your mind you're gonna get there.
- I have made up my mind.
- That's the stuff.
- I am going to get there.
- You need strength, so get all the rest you can.
Dallas, do you suppose you can fix up a little broth?
- She has already.
- Good.
How about making some coffee for the boys?
Now you get some sleep, Mrs. Mallory.
And don't look so proud.
I've brought hundreds of those little fellas into the world... once upon a time.
And the new one was always the prettiest.
Doc.
Ringo asked me to marry him.
Is that wrong for a girl like me?
If a man and woman love each other, it's all right, ain't it, Doc?
You're going to be hurt, child.
Worse than you've ever been hurt.
Don't you know that boy's headed back for prison?
Besides, if you two go into Lordsburg together... he's going to know all about you.
He's not goin' into Lordsburg.
All I want is for you to tell me it's all right.
Gosh, child, who am I to tell you what's right or wrong?
All right. Go ahead.
Do it if you can.
Good luck.
Thanks, Doc.
- Ringo -
- Well, Doc?
Oh, both doing nicely.
She's a real soldier's wife, that young lady.
Good, good.
Then we can leave immediately.
Well, not for a day or so if you want my professional advice.
What do you mean a day?
Stay another day? Why?
Where were you when the stork came last night, Gatewood?
I refuse to allow Mrs. Mallory to travel until she and the child are out of danger.
What do you mean danger?
Aren't we in worse danger here?
I don't wish to intrude.
But I've had five children.
I mean, my dear wife has.
And much as I dislike discussing it, in this hour of our trial...
I - I believe the doctor's right.
Spoken like a man, Reverend.
I say we ought to leave here before the
Apaches find us. That's common sense.
I wish you were 10 years younger,
Gatewood.
- Don't let my white hairs stop you -
- Now just a minute!
Quiet! Quiet!
- Now, Curley, I haven't said a word!
- Will you shut up!
Now, if we argue this thing out right, we can get somewhere.
Let's all sit down and talk sensible.
Come on, Buck. Sit down.
There's a young woman in the kitchen making coffee.
She needs help.
Thanks, Doc.
Say, Kid.
How old were you when you went to the pen?
Oh, I was... goin' on 17.
Mornin', ma'am.
Morning.
I, uh, laid awake most of the night... wondering what you'd have said if Curley hadn't busted in.
Guess you was up kind of late too.
I could hear you moving around.
You didn't answer what I asked you last night.
Look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
There's a horse out there in the corral.
Curley won't go after you because he can't leave the passengers in a fix like this.
I gotta go to Lordsburg.
Why don't you go to my ranch and wait for me?
Wait for a dead man.
You haven't got a chance.
It was three against one when the Plummers swore that you killed their foreman, got you sent up.
It'll be three against one in Lordsburg.
Well, there's some things a man just can't run away from.
How can you talk about your life and my life when you're throwing them away?
Yeah. Mine too.
That's what you're throwing away if you go to Lordsburg.
What do you want me to do?
Would it make us any happier if Luke Plummer was dead?
One of his brothers would be after you with a gun.
We'd never be safe.
I don't want that kind of life, Ringo.
Well, I don't see what else I can do.
Go now. Get away.
Forget Lordsburg. Forget the Plummers.
Make for the border, and I'll come to you.
- Do you mean that?
- Yes, I do.
Will you go with me, Dallas?
Oh, I can't leave Mrs. Mallory and the baby.
I'll come to you from Lordsburg.
I swear it.
Well, I oughta have a rifle and -
I've got one. Right here.
- I got it last night when they were all asleep.
- You mean you thought of this last night?
Yeah. Don't ask any more questions.
Not now.
Aw, gosh, Curley, there ain't no Apaches behind us.
Aw, gosh, Curley, there ain't no Apaches behind us.
We can still go back to Tonto.
- No! I insist we go on to Lordsburg.
- What do you think, Chris?
Geronimo between here and Lordsburg - with my horse, I think.
- ♪ My horse has gone ♪
- No, Doctor. Oh!
♪ She has gone astray with the sun - ♪♪
Quiet, Doc.
This is a serious matter, ain't it?
My dear Buck... if I have only one hour to live,
I'm going to enjoy myself.
Doctor, I don't begrudge you my samples, but I think -
Now you hush! I've stood enough of you.
Now this is a serious problem, and I'm the only one that's talkin' sense.
- Now, Curley, if -
- If we can get across that ferry, we'll be all right.
Question is, what are we gonna do about the lady and her baby?
Dr. Boone has settled that for us, sir... and I demand respect for his professional opinion.
Hatfield.
Ringo.
Ringo!
Ringo!
Hurry, Ringo.
- Ringo!
- Hurry!
- Bye, Dallas.
- Good-bye!
Ringo! Don't stop! Go on! Go on!
Keep riding!
Ringo, go on! Go on!
Curley! No! Let him go! Stop it!
You don't need them, Curley.
- I ain't gonna run away.
- I'll say you ain't.
Look at them hills.
- Apaches.
- War signals.
Hurry up, Marshal!
What's - Why don't we start?
Come on, Bridesmaid! Yow! Yow!
Nice girls! Yow! Go!
Hey, Curley, why don't you take the cuffs off the Kid?
- He's mighty handy with a gun.
- You drive them horses.
- I'll take care of the Kid.
- Oh!
Can't you drive any faster?
You thick-headed lout!
We've got to make that ferry.
A man works all his life to get ahold of some money so that he can enjoy life... and has to run into a trap like this.
A trap, brother? You mean the Apaches?
There's been no sign of them.
You don't see any signs of them.
They strike like rattlesnakes.
If you hadn't insisted on waiting for her, we'd have been across the ferry by this time.
You talk too much, Gatewood.
Your threats don't faze me, Hatfield.
You're nothing but a tinhorn gambler.
How would you like to get out and walk?
You can't put me out of a public conveyance.
Now, now, gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Take it easy, Gatewood.
We may need that fight before we get to the ferry.
You wouldn't be much good in a fight, you jailbird!
Oh, leave the Kid alone. He's handcuffed.
Gentlemen, please.
Let's not forget the ladies, bless them.
Let's have a little Christian charity one for the other.
Well, folks, we're coming in to Lee's Ferry now.
Lordsburg - next stop!
Nice girls! Get along! Get along!
Curley, look. Look at the ferry.
It's burnt too.
Hatfield, stand guard over there.
Where's the army?
What are the soldiers doing?
Curley, what can I do?
- Are they going to let Geronimo burn and pillage the whole country?
Ringo, I need you. Will you give me your word you won't try to escape again?
I'll give you my word - till Lordsburg.
- Get in the coach with them women.
- I gave you my word.
- Ringo, don't!
- Dallas.
Buck, drive into the river up to the hubs.
Brownie! Bessie! Bridesmaid!
Come on, girls! Hah! Get down!
Move out! Ho!
Whoa, Duchess! Come on, baby!
Come on, girls. Steady now.
Look out, Curley.
Kid, take your suspenders and cross-tie them wheelers.
Sorry about the saddle, Kid.
- Ready, Kid?
- All set.
- Ready, Buck?
- All ready, Curley.
Here we go! Here we go, Buck!
Hyah! Hyah!
Just sit quiet, folks.
You'll be all right.
Come on, girl. Ho, Bridesmaid!
Come on, baby! Good girl!
Ho! Steady, Duchess! Steady there!
Attagirl!
Honey child!
Easy now. Ho!
Good girl. That's a girl!
Whoa!
Ho, girl! Take it!
♪ All aboard for Lordsburg, Lordsburg ♪
- Hey, Curley.
- Yeah. What?
You think I ought to charge
Mrs. Mallory's baby half fare?
Sweetheart!
Well, we'll soon be in Lordsburg.
Uh, sorry I flew off the handle, Hatfield.
My apologies, Doctor.
No hard feelings, I hope.
All in all, it's been an exciting, very interesting trip.
Has it not?
Well, now that the danger's passed, Mr. -
Peacock.
Ladies and gentlemen, since it's most unlikely... that we'll ever have the pleasure of meeting again socially...
I'd like to propose a toast.

I warned you about this - this danger!
But you wouldn't listen to me!
Gatewood, will you shut up!
I've got a patient here!
No, you can't stop me.
Let me out of here, I tell you!
- Will you shut up!

Do you hear it?
Do you hear it?
It's a bugle!
They're blowing the charge!
If you see Judge Greenfield... tell him his son -
- Thank heaven you're safe, Lucy.
- Where's Richard? Is he all right?
Oh, he's all right.
Don't you worry.
- It isn't a bad wound.
- We'll take you to him immediately.
Where's the baby, dear?
I'll take the baby.
Dallas.
If there's ever anything I can do for -
I know.
Orderly.
It's the Ringo Kid!
Yeah!
Hey, Curley! How are you?
Aces and eights.
Dead man's hand, Luke.
Ringo Kid's in town.
Yeah. Drivin' the stage.
- Mis hermanos.
- Si, patrón. Un momento.
Cash in.
Easy now. Easy. That's right.
Good-bye, Miss Dallas.
If you ever come to Kansas City, Kansas,
I want you to come out to see us.
- Oh, thanks, Mr., uh -
- Peacock.
- Hello, Buck.
- They got here all right.
- You got through all right.
- All right, folks, you're here.
All right, folks. You're all right. Unload.
Here you are, Doctor.
Will you sign this?
Well, Lordsburg.
Thank you. And you, Doctor.
There you are. Thank you.
Well, Kid.
Curley, how long will they give me for breakin' out?
Oh, about another year.
- You know where my ranch is?
- Yeah.
Will you see that she gets there all right?
Dallas.
Yeah.
This is no town for a girl like her.
Will you do it?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
How are ya, Marshal?
Get my man through all right?
I don't need them.
If you don't want to lose your prisoner, Sheriff, you'd better take care of him yourself.
- What's your name, mister?
- My name is Gatewood. Ellsworth H. Gatewood.
Oh. Gatewood. You didn't think they'd have the telegraph wires fixed, did you?
You thought you escaped.
We got our banker!
Can I meet you back here in 10 minutes?
I gave you my word, Curley.
I ain't goin' back on it now.
No ammunition.
I lied to you, Curley.
Got three left.
Come on.
Good night, Kid.
- Is this where you live?
- No.
I gotta know where you live, don't I?
No. Don't come any further.
It's all been a crazy dream.
I've been out of my mind just hopin'.
Say good-bye here, Kid.
We ain't never gonna say good-bye.
Could I have that?
Give me the shotgun.
Shotgun!
Luke! Luke, please don't!
Well, Kid, I -
I told you not to follow me.
Dallas.
I asked you to marry me, didn't I?
I'll never forget you asked me, Kid.
That's something.
Wait here.
Uh -
Ringo said he'll be passing this way in... six or seven minutes.
Come on.
I'll take that shotgun, Luke.
You'll take it in the belly if you don't get out of my way.
I'll have you indicted for murder if you step outside with that shotgun.
We'll attend to you later.
Don't ever let me do that again.
Luke.
Luke.
Hey, Billy! Billy, kill that story about the Republican convention in Chicago and take this down!
"The Ringo Kid was killed on Main Street in Lordsburg tonight!
And among the additional dead was" -
Leave that blank for a spell.
- I didn't hear any shootin', Ed.
- You will, Billy. You will.
Hank missed him - at four feet.
Ringo. Ringo.
Ringo.
Ready, Kid?
Thanks, Curley.
Curley's gonna see that you get to my place across the border.
Well, good-bye, Dallas.
Good-bye.
Maybe you'd like to ride a ways with the Kid.
Please.
- Yea! Yea!
- Yea!
Well, they're saved from the blessings of civilization.
Yeah.
Doc?
I'll, uh, buy you a drink.
Just one.
Blackfeet.
Smoke.
Do you smell it, sir?
They certainly made a thorough job of it.
Aye, they did that, sir.
- You'll probably find shovels in one of the wagons.
- Yes, sir.
What-
No! Don't touch me!
Go away!
Please! Please go away!
- We're not going to hurt you.
- Leave me alone!
- The Indians will come back and kill me too!
- There, lassie.
- Let me go!
- There, there.
You're perfectly safe now.
We won't let anyone harm you.
They'll come back!
I know they will!
They killed my grandfather.
He's over there under that wagon.
- Shh! Shh! Come on.
- No.
- Come on now. That's it.
- Please! Please!
Everything's going to be all right.
Everything's going to be all right.
There now, now.
Shh. Everything's all right.
I'm afraid.
Now, listen, Sue.
You and I are going to have a little talk.
You know, there never was anything to be afraid of... that couldn't be cured by one little word.
Do you know what that word is?
" Courage.'' It can beat the toughest situation that ever happened.
You see, when you're afraid of things... the more you think of'em, the bigger they get.
But if you just throw your head back and say...
" I won't be scared of anything anymore,'' then you're not.
Aren't you ever afraid of anything?
Well, uh, let's put it this way:
When I meet up with something
I'm not quite sure of...
I decide first of all that everything's going to come out all right.
Whatever it is,
I'm going to lick it.
And usually it does come out all right.
- You know what does it?
- Courage?
Courage.
Now, let's forget everything that made us unhappy.
Let's learn to smile again, because we know everybody's... gonna do all they can to help us, so we'll help too.
- What do you say?
- I'll try, Mr. Monty.
That's the girl.
Now, back to sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Easy.
Dismissed, Mac.
- Welcome home! Praise be you're safe and-
- Shh!
- What have you got there?
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Where in heaven's name did you get her?
- You'll hear about that later.
- Is the superintendent still up?
- He is.
- And if I told you the half of it-
- I can't escape it.
Give me a quick brush.
I want to report in.
Beggin' your pardon, sir.
You can't go in them clothes.
- I've your other uniform all laid out.
- Why should I change uniforms...
- at this time of night?
- The others, sir.
Every one of'em is dressed up like a widow at a wake. If you knew who was there-
- I wouldn't dandy up tonight to meet Lily Langtry.
- But it's the O.C. 's daughter.
- Will you stop thatjabbering and brush me off?
- I'll do it!
- I'll do it. Please let me.
- Now look what you've done with your shouting.
You're the worst old fishwife ever came out of County Kildare.
He's otherwise known as
Patrick O'Hannegan.
- This is Miss Susannah Sheldon.
-Just call me Sue.
Now, young lady, we'll have to arrange sleeping quarters for you.
- Where will that be, sir?
- Your room.
- My-
- Do I sleep in with him?
No. Pat can sleep out here on the couch.
But I wouldn't wanna take
Mr. Pat's room.
That's all right. He'll be very comfortable out here, won't you?
- Oh, yes, sir. Very.
- Give this a lick.
Let's see.
What about sleeping things?
Use one of my nightshirts.
You might have to cut it down.
- Now, young lady, off to bed with you.
- Oh, wait.
There's a hair on your shoulder the brush didn't get.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Monty.
Come on.
I'll fix the bed for ya.
I'll help you. dd dd
- Excuse me, sir.
- That's quite all right, Monty.
- Glad to see you're back.
- I didn't mean to intrude, sir.
- I've come to make my report.
- Come in, won't you?
I want you to meet my daughter.
She's come out from Toronto for a visit.
Well, I'm-
I'm hardly presentable, sir.
Perfectly all right.
Come along.
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Monty.
- Hello, fellas.
- Hi, old boy.
Vicky, this is
Inspector Montague.
- I'm very happy to know you, Mr. Montague.
- It's a pleasure, Miss Standing.
Won't you join us?
Perhaps you'd like a glass of sherry.
- Not a thing, thanks.
- You'll need something to fortify you.
- We'll probably have more singing.
- If I know Monty...
- he'll be right along with us.
- He's just the baritone we've been looking for.
- We really are having a little baritone trouble.
- I say, now,just a moment.
I'll be glad to as soon as I make my report.
- That won't take long.
- Excuse me?
Certainly.
- Doctor, do you mind getting my hat for me?
- Certainly.
- You're not going?
- What's left for me?
- It's baritone or nothing.
- Good night, old boy.
It's nothing.
Pat, you old pirate, why didn't you tell me to change uniforms?
- Why, she's a beauty!
- Tell you? I did tell you.
You didn't tell me anything of the kind.
Those are the things you should tell me.
But you said you wouldn't dandy up for Lily Langtry.
Lily Langtry couldn't hold a candle to her. Get off these boots...
- and get me a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.
When did she get here?
You didn't even tell me she was young.
- Two days ago, sir.
- And I had to be away on patrol.
Why, she's beautiful.
She's as pretty as a picture.
What the-
Why aren't you in bed?
I'm helping, sir.
Here's your shirt.
00, and regulations for enlisted men are lights-out at 10:00?
- Get.
- Yes, sir.
Good night.
Good night. Run along now.
Here, unbutton that shirt.
You let me go over there looking like a hayseed to meet the most beaut-
Not that I care how I look, but out of respect for her.
I'm sure she'll understand, sir.
You didn't even tell me she had blue eyes. And deep blue eyes at that.!
- dd
- You know, Dad didn't think
I should come, even for a visit.
- But I'm here.
- You might find it a little rugged.
- You know, I've been wondering.
- What?
Well, whatever made a man like you take a job like this?
There are times when it's rather humdrum.
But right now, you're here.
And I'm going to change things.
Inspector Montague, we're going to give a dance on Wednesday night.
- A real one. Dress uniform and frills.
- A dance?
- Well, you do dance, don't you?
- Well, I- Oh, yes. Yes, of course, thank you.
Splendid. And being the only woman in the vicinity, I'm bound to be popular.
Whoa!
- Hello, Chambers.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Inspector.
- What's the trouble? Anything wrong?
Indian raid. Four of my workmen wounded.
And they've stolen 20 head of horses.
If we hadn't caught them in time, they'd have cleaned out the whole corral.
- Inspector, turn out 10 men.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Randall, you'll take out the patrol.
- Sir.
- Go to the construction camp and track down the raiders.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll need your doctor too.
- Then come inside. We'll get him.
- Call the doctor.
- Harlan.!
Why, Vicky, what on earth are you doing here?
- Came out for a visit.
- Well, why didn't you let me know you were coming?
I didn't even let Dad know I was coming, did I?
No. As a matter of fact, she didn't. Oh, Doctor.
- Yes, sir.
- Go back to camp with Mr. Chambers.
- You're needed there.
- I'll get my kit, sir.
- Mr. Churchill, check the guard.
Prepare for any emergency.
- Yes, sir.
- You may be able to assist him, Mr. Williams?
- Yes, sir.
- Good night, Miss Standing.
- Good night. Anything serious, Dad?
- Good night.
-Just a little Indian trouble at my camp.
- Nothing for you to worry about.
- It's hardly the best time... for you to have come out here, but I can't tell you how pleased I am to see you.
Don't tell me I leave you speechless, Harlan.
You always did. Superintendent, why didn't you give me notice?
I'd have met her at Winnipeg and brought her out here on a special.
You didn't give the Canadian Pacific a chance.
We'll see what can be done about that in the future.
- You bet we will.
- The patrol's ready, Mr. Chambers.
Thank you. I'll be back for a real visit as soon we've settled with these horse thieves.
- Good night.
- Good night and good luck.
Thanks. We need it.
Thank you, Superintendent.
- Not at all. Good night.
- Good night.
Probably the same band that attacked the wagon train, sir.
This will give the railroad people another opportunity to clamor for government troops.
I hope not, sir.
We'll try a direct hit.
I wanna get Big Eagle in here for a talk.
It's only a three-hour ride to his camp.
- If you like, I'll have him here in the morning.
- Good.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night. dd dd
Good mornin'.
You're up mighty early.
- Mr. Monty hasn't come home yet, has he?
- He has not.
- Where did he go?
- On duty.
- Where else would he be goin'?
- When will he get back?
I not be knowin' that.
- What are you making?
- Never mind now. Never mind.
Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
You shouldn't be sewing.
That's a woman's work.
Not in the army, darlin'.
That's where I learned it.
You men on the fort should have wives to do things for you.
Wives, is it?
Heaven pity the poor girl that'd marry a man in this outfit.
- Why?
- 'Tis a no-good lot of heartbreakers, they are.
- Are you a heartbreaker?
- Well, I've had me day.
Of course, I did have certain disadvantages in the way of a face, but-
Hold your hush now.
Stop your questions till I get this last button sewed on.
- Is Mr. Monty a heartbreaker too?
- Isn't he, though?
You oughta seen him at Regina when he was there.
Who was he talking about last night when he said she was so beautiful?
- And who'd be askin'?
- Oh, I was just wondering.
You know very well who he was talking about.
But don't you bother.
She'll be goin' home soon.
We'll have Mr. Monty all to ourselves.
There.
It's finished.
- And I hope it fits ya.
- Is it for me?
And who else would I be sewin' for all this night?
And there's these to go with it.
- I be makin' ya other things when I get around to it.
- Oh!
Now I'm goin' to the mess hall to get you some breakfast.
Thank you, Mr. Pat!
Thank you!
That's all right, darlin'.
That's all right.
What are those Indians coming here for?
Don't worry. They won't hurt you while you're with us.
- Mr. Monty's bringin' 'em in for a powwow.
- Oh.
Come along now.
He looks all right though, doesn't he?
Of course he's all right.
Come on. Inside with ya.
"The sun has shone on us many days in peace, my brothers.
Now a cloud passes over the sun.
Two days ago, a wagon train was destroyed.
Last night, the Iron Horse camp was attacked and many horses stolen.''
Indians who kill wagon train steal horses... not from camp of Big Eagle.
They were Blackfeet.
But if you mean, Wolf Pelt... that they were from some other part of your tribe... that does not lessen the responsibility of your chief.
If Blackfeet Indian make trouble... we'll send guilty ones to white chief.
- I'll hold you to that.
- Give word.
I believe that, Big Eagle.
And I'm willing to admit that these raids may have occurred without your knowledge.
But so that we shall have a clear understanding in the future...
I have prepared a paper, a fair and honorable bond... between the white and the red man.
We'll speak in council with my chiefs.
And I'll expect your answer within five days.
In the meantime,
I'll need some guarantee... that you'll keep your warriors in check.
Huh?
The white chief means he has great responsibility to the queen mother.
He must have some token- the guns of your young braves or your running horses- to prove that you'll keep your promise.
Huh.
If white chief think Big Eagle speak with forked tongue... will give something more close to heart.
Little Chief stay here.
Token Big Eagle's word is straight.
That's more than I'd ask for... but it will do no harm for your son to learn the ways of the white man.
And you may be sure he'll have the best treatment that we can offer.
Go now.
Send word soon.
- The Indians are coming out.
- Oh?
What do you suppose they were doing in there?
Probably gettin' blue blazes from the O.C. for the devilry they've been up to.
There's something
I'd like to tell them too.
Where ya goin'?
Come back here. Come back here!
Are you the chief Indian?
Hmm.
Me Big Eagle.
Well, I certainly hope Mr. Standing is going to make you Indians behave from now on.
And if you got what you deserved, he'd send you all to jail.
That's where you belong for what you've been doing. What right have you-
Here,just a minute, Sue.
You must forgive her, Big Eagle.
This little girl was the only survivor of the wagon train.
Golden Hawk, little spirit of the sun.
Big Eagle sorry you have trouble.
Will not happen again.
I don't see why you want to fight the white people anrway.
They haven't done anything to hurt you.
Will send present to little Golden Hawk.
We be good friend now.
- Do you really think he's sorry?
- Yes, I'm sure he is.
But where did you get all this? Mmm!
That's quite an outfit.
You're a regular cowboy.
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Mmm.
- Mr. Pat made it.
- Monty?
- Yes, sir.
- I'll turn Little Chief over to you.
- Arrange for his care, will you?
- Very good, sir.
Well, so, this is the little girl you spoke of.
Yes, sir.
This is our other guest, Sue Sheldon.
- This is Superintendent Standing, Sue.
- How do you do, sir?
How do you do, Sue? I hope you'll enjoy your stay here with us... until we can find a home for you.
Now, you go with Inspector Montague,
Little Chief. That's right.
Mr. Monty, is he gonna send me away?
Oh, we won't worry about that now.
We'll need you to help entertain Little Chief.
I'll go see about quarters for you, son, while you two get acquainted.
It's very nice weather we're having, isn't it?
Uh.
" Uh''?
Is that your pony?
I guess Indians learn to ride when they're babies, don't they?
I suppose you don't understand English... so there's no use my talking to you.
You're wonderful.
I mean, you're a wonderful rider.
- Squaw ride?
- Well, I, um-
Oh, you think I'm a freak, do you?
Come on.
Help me on.
Well, aren't you going to help me?
Brave never help squaw.
You're not very polite, are you?
All right.
I'll get on by myself.
Oh!
Well, I could get on if I had enough time.
You never ride horse.
You just papoose.
Papoose?
Don't you ever call me that again!
Stop grunting at me!
And you apologize too!
- Papoose.
- Ooh!
Ooh!
Where's Little Chief?
Didn't he wanna play?
Mr. Monty, do you know what he called me?
A papoose!
That's Indian for " baby,'' isn't it?
- I'm afraid it is.
- I thought so.
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute, Sue. Come here.
Come on. Sit down.
Let's talk this thing over.
I'm sure Little Chief didn't mean to be rude.
Indians always treat their women with a superior air.
- The women seem to like it.
- Well, I don't.
You know, even if he liked you a lot, he'd act just the same.
You see, we're supposed to be much more grown-up than they are.
There are some things you just can't put up with.
Papoose!
But, uh, it's our job to understand them and make allowances.
Would you like me to make allowances for him?
He's our guest.
So, if you two had a little spat...
I think you oughta make a treaty and smoke the pipe of peace.
All right.
I'll try.
I'll give him one more chance.
- But only for your sake.
- That's right. For my sake.
I doubt if I can do much with him though.
I've come to make allowances.
I didn't ever expect to speak to you again.
But Mr. Monty says
I'm much more grown-up than you are... and I should try to understand you.
- So we'll smoke the pipe of peace.
- White squaw smoke?
Well, I, uh-
I never have.
But we're going to make a peace treaty, and you have to smoke on that, don't you?
I guess that means yes.
So how do we start?
Thank you.
I only hope I've got enough allowances to hold out.
Now, the first part of our treaty is that you're to stop pushing me.
You're not to be rude anymore.
- I mean, uh, any ruder than an Indian can't help being.
And the second is that you teach me to ride as well as you do.
- Much work.
- There you go.
- Are you going to make a treaty, or aren't you?
- Make treaty.
And the third part is that you're not to call me " papoose'' again.
Do you hear?
Does that mean yes?
Can't you stop grunting? Say yes when you mean yes, and no when you mean no!
Now, do you understand that?
What's the use?
I guess you mean yes.
Well, I can't think of anything else just now, so we'd better smoke on it.
I expect you'd better light it.
Here.
Now squaw smoke.
It isn't bad!
Anybody can make a treaty like this.
Oh, dear.
Must find Indians who raid wagon train... and steal from
Iron Horse camp... so redcoat chief know we speak with straight tongue.
Think ones who make war on white man... are from camp of Lone Buffalo.
Huh? Why you think that?
Know they make medicine to sun god for war two moons ago.
I go find out if they ones who do it.
All right.
You go.
If find guilty ones, take to redcoat chief... so he know Big Eagle keep word and speak truth.
Mmm. dd
- Get me a handkerchief.
- Yes, sir. dd
You look, uh, very nice.
Thank you, Sue.
- How do you think I look?
- You look very nice t-
Mm-mm! Where did you get that dress?
- Mr. Pat bought it for me.
- Well, well. Good for Pat.
Thank you, sir.
It would be a nice dress to go to a party in, wouldn't it?
-You'd be the belle of the ball.
-If I was invited to a party.
Glory be. Where in heaven's name are they?
- Now what's the matter?
- Your handkerchiefs, sir.
I put 'em in the top drawer here where they're always put, but there's never a one of'em.
Oh, the handkerchiefs!
You had them in with Mr. Monty's shaving thing, so I changed them.
I put the shirts in where the socks used to be, and I put the socks in with the underwear... where the nightshirts used to be, and I put the nightshirts in with the sheets.
- But where did you put the handkerchiefs?
- In with the socks.
And it's taken me two years to educate himself where to put his hands on things.
- I was only trying to help.
- Ohh!
What are you doing?
Give me that!
It's only a piece of old buffalo skin I've been using to rub up Mr. Monty's boots.
- Ohh!
- Why, Sue, that's Pat's pride and joy.
- It's his toupee.
- Toupee?
- Sure. Show her, Pat.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, no. Put it on.
Oh, it's your hair.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't know.
It makes you look so handsome.
You oughta wear it all the time.
Oh, yes.
He's a lady-killer with that on.
He wears it on leave, and uses it to fool the redskins too, don't you?
Yes, sir.
If any of them comes after me... it's the toupee he'll get and not me scalp, I hope.
- Your handkerchief, sir.
- You'd better get another one.
- You'll need two for dancing.
- Two? Why?
An extra one to hold against the lady's back.
Faith and help. She's right, sir.
I'll get you another one.
You seem to know a lot about dancing, Sue.
I do. My grandfather was a wonderful fiddler.
- I learned how to dance from him.
- Here you are, sir.
Sue, come here.
Sue, uh, between you and me,
I'm in an awful hole tonight.
- I don't know the first thing about dancing.
- Oh, I can teach you.
I'll go with you to the party, and you can dance with me until you learn.
Mm-mmm. That wouldn't be so good, because they might catch on.
Besides, it'd keep you up too late.
Couldn't you show me right here?
Yes. But it would be better if I went with you so we'd have music.
- I can whistle.
- Well, what dance will we start with?
Well, uh-
Why, is there more than one?
Of course. The waltz, the schottische, the two-step, the polka-
Whoa. We'll just concentrate on one.
That, uh-That waltz sounds familiar.
How does it go?
Come on.
I'll show you.
Now, put your arm around me, like this.
- Wait a minute. I want my handkerchief.
- That's very important.
- Now, give me your other hand.
- Like this?
- Yes. You start with your left foot.
- Left foot. All right.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
-Just glide on easy. One-
- One, two, three. Oh!
- The main thing is to dance very smoothly.
- Uh-huh.
Here. Try this.
Now, stoop down.
Don't let it fall. That's the way they teach you in dancing school.
I don't know.
I hope I can keep it up there.
You can.
Now, let's try it again.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
You're doing much better.
One, two, three. That's fine.
Just glide along like you were rippling over water. Oh!
Oh! We sort of went overboard, didn't we?
You're getting a little mixed up with your feet.
Maybe I'd better show you how it goes first, and then we can dance together.
- Maybe that would be better.
- Now watch me. dd dd
Now with me. dd dd dd
- dd
- dd dd
You must be very fond of that piece.
They've played it every time we've danced.
Well, uh, the boys know it's my favorite.
That's the music
I learned to waltz to.
- I see.
- I can remember it just as though it were tonight. dd
Time Little Squaw go sleep.
I guess if everybody else can stay up dancing, I can stay up and watch them.
- Redcoat make her his squaw?
- He will not!
Funny. Dance like that and not make her his squaw.
He's only doing that to be nice to her.
Indian dance better.
Use feathers.
- Oh, let me try it on!
- No. Only brave wear feathers.
- Well, I've got one anrway.
- Mmm.
- Where did you get all these things?
- Warrior bring.
Bring teepee too.
Little Chief no sleep white man house.
You could sleep anrwhere if you were tired enough.
Mmm. Forgot.
My father sent pony. Present for you.
A pony for me?
Where is it? Show me!
- Aren't you coming?
- Brave always go first.
Squaw walk behind.
Walk behind?
I will not!
Then brave not go.
If we hadn't made a peace treaty-
Well, all right.
But this is just about the last of my allowances.
Mmm.
All I can say is that if Indian women put up... with being treated like this, they must be-
Squaw keep quiet and walk behind brave. dd
- Make mine a two-step, boys.
- Give me a minute, Harlan.
- I'd like a glass of water.
- I'll get it.
Thank you.
- Now we'll have him back on our hands.
- Why not?
- Making three a crowd, aren't you?
- Everyone's my crowd tonight.
You know, with all this attention,
I'm beginning to appreciate... the advantages of being a pioneer woman.
That's great while the fun lasts, Vicky.
But you won't feel that way when the going gets rough.
That's bound to happen out here, you know.
And you think I couldn't stand up to it if it did?
I know you couldn't.
Look, will you tell me why everybody wants to rush me back to Toronto?
Well, I was really thinking of myself.
You see, we'll be stopping construction soon because of the snow.
And, naturally, I'd like you there when I go back home for the holidays.
But suppose I have other plans?
I might decide to become a pioneer woman at that.
- Don't you think I could, Mr. Montague?
- Beg pardon, Miss Vicky?
Don't you think I could become a pioneer woman?
I'm sure you could... if you set your mind to it.
There you are.
That's one vote for me. dd
Isn't that a tom-tom? It's getting closer.
You stay here, Vicky. dd
- What was it?
- Sue and Little Chief are on the warpath. dd
No more dance. Squaw laugh.
I'm awfully sorry. Honest.
I won't do it anymore.
Please don't stop dancing.
We're enjoying it.
Maybe one day you'll teach me an Indian dance.
Isn't he rude?
These Indians certainly are a problem.
You don't seem to have much difficulty handling Little Chief.
It took time for me to understand him.
But it was worth it, because I expect to be here for a long time.
- Really?
- Yes. But it wouldn't be worthwhile... for you to go to all that trouble, because you're going home soon.
- Am I?
- Aren't you?
Mr. Pat said you were.
And I'm sure you wouldn't...
- like it out here anrway, because it's full of-
- Sue.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'll wait up for you. You'll need someone to put your clothes away.
And if someone is up when I get there, they'll be off to bed with a slipper.
Come on.
Kiss me good night.
- Now what do you say?
- See you first thing in the morning.
- Good night, Sue.
- Good night, Mr. Monty.
I hope you're not offended.
She's a very strange child.
Strange?
I don't think so.
- She adores you.
- Hmm?
It's just that you're slow to notice things like that.
- Perhaps.
- I say, are we men supposed to dance with each other?
Come on.
What's the matter now?
You have a face as long as the old woman that kissed the cow.
- He's in love with her.
- Me darlin'.
'Tis one of the delightful misfortunes that overtakes the male of the species.
'Tis me that knows.
I wish she'd go back where she came from.
Oh-ho.
'Tis jealous, you are.
I am not. But she couldn't take care of him the way we do.
I'll bet she couldn't even make his bed.
- And you're not doing it right either.
- I'm not, ain't I?
You haven't the covers up close enough around his neck.
- Oh. Huh.
- And you should unfold his nightshirt... and have it all laid out for him.
What are you tryin' to do, spoil him?
Here, me bucko, I'll take that.
Oh, Mr. Pat! And I taught him how to dance with her.
Heaven help us.
I know, I know.
'Tis a terrible thing to be a woman in love.
- Oh, Mr. Pat!
- Ah, yes, I understand.
Never you mind.
Never you mind now.
And it's a heartbreaking ruffian he is.
He is not a ruffian.
I won't let you say that.
Oh, well, have it your own way, me darlin'.
Have it your own way.
Close them pretty eyes now. dd
Good night, Miss Standing.
It's the jolliest night we've ever had.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Certainly a lovely party.
- What's this?
Chief Big Eagle say here bad Indians who make trouble for covered wagon... and steal horses from Iron Horse camp.
He send to you.
Show redcoat he keep word.
Take them to the guardroom.
- This fellow's dead, sir. He's been stabbed.
- They're all dead, sir.
Order out a detail to bury them.
Well, this looks as if Big Eagle is showing his defiance.
He knows the dispensing of justice belongs to the Mounted Police.
I'll take that up with him when he comes to sign the treaty.
If it's ever signed.
Chambers, if I should decide to send Vicky home... could you do anything for me in the way of transportation?
I certainly could, sir. There's a supply train up on Sunday morning... that'll take her as far as Winnipeg.
From there, she can connect with the Eastern Limited.
I agree with you. It'd be wise to get her away from here.
- I'll let you know.
- No, thanks. I won't come in now.
I better get back to the camp to see that everything's all right then.
- Good night.
- Good night, Chambers.
Won't you eat your eggs, sir?
They're that fresh...
I just saw the cook take them from under the hen with his own hands.
Oh, no, thanks.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here's your baked apple and milk.
All ready for you.
- I'm not hungry this morning, thank you.
- Heaven help us.
There's more than one sufferin' from the same complaint this morning, I'm thinking.
Well, I'll get a bit of work done. Sir?
Hmm? Oh, yes.
Go ahead.
Was it a nice party?
Yes, very nice.
Is she a good dancer?
Very good.
- Better than I am?
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Are you going to marry her?
- Marry her?
Well, I was watching you dance together last night.
And the way she looked at you, and the way you looked at her, I thought maybe-
Don't you think you ought to have your breakfast?
Yes, sir. But I supposed that when people were in love, they always got married.
She's going home tomorrow.
Even Little Chief-
- She is? She's really going home?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, isn't that a shame? Won't you sit over here in the rocking chair?
- It's much more comfortable.
- No, thanks.
I'll get you your pipe.
Would you like your pipe?
Here's-
Here's some matches too.
I guess you smoke more matches than you do tobacco. Can I get you anything else?
No, thanks. You'd better run along and play with Little Chief.
- If you need me for anything,just send Mr. Pat.
- I will.
Hello, Mr. Pat!
Hello, Mr. Pat! Hello!
- Hello!
- Hello, Susannah.
- Hi, Carruthers.
- Good morning.
Oh, good morning, Miss Vicky.
I was hoping I'd see you before you left.
I'm sorry we have to say good-bye, but Dad isn't in favor of my becoming a pioneer woman.
He's right, Miss Vicky.
This really isn't the place for you.
Are you going to keep it a man's country forever?
It's apt to be that way for quite a while yet.
Well, I suppose if we're ever to see each other again, you'll have to come to Toronto.
I'm afraid there's not much chance of that.
- Why?
- We'll be pushing farther west every year... and by the time I get back to Toronto, you'll probably be married...
- and have a family of grown-up children.
- And what about you?
Oh, I guess I'll just end up being the old man of the mountain.
Well, good-bye.
I'll always remember the fun we've had... and I'll probably find myself wishing I could hear you sing that little waltz song again.
And I'll find myself wishing it wasn't so far to Toronto.
Good-bye, Vicky.
Squaw ride faster!
I'm coming as fast as I can!
- Squaw ride like-
- Don't you dare say it!
- White man buy?
- Take your time.
If they're sound, we'll make a deal.
What are they doing over there?
Wolf Pelt sell horses to railroad.
Let's go watch.
Come on.
Oh, all right!
Go ahead.
I'm getting used to being a squaw.
Aah! No have to look.
How much pay?
- We'll settle that later.
- You'll buy now. All good horses.
Sure. Three of them's very good horses.
They oughta be.
They're three that were stolen in the raid and wasn't brought back with the others.
White man lie.
Indian ponies.
Yeah? Well, there's Bully Boy... that's LadyJane, and there's Steamboat.
And I'll prove it.
They didn't even make a good job of dyeing it!
More of your thieving tricks.
I wouldn't do business with your breed if I had to go without horses!
You leave those animals here and clear out.
- White man pay.
- I'll give you nothing.
If you got what you deserve,
I'd take it out of your hide.!
- Let us handle him, boss.
- We'll take care of him.
- Wait a minute.!
- You've been babied by the redcoats long enough... but you're at the end of the rope with me.
I'm going to have the railroad bring out government troops to deal with you.
Iron Horse bring soldiers?
Yes, plenty of them.
They'll keep you in order... with bullets.
All right.
White chief has spoken.
Don't let 'em get away!
Hold him up.! Get him.!
- Hang him.!
- Hang him.!
- Hang him.!
You kids better clear out.
This is no place for you.
- White man no right beat Indian.
- Run along before you get hurt.
Come on, Little Chief.
Natosi, sun god, not answer.
Three suns pass since talk to redcoat chief.
He wait for our answer.
Natosi turn face away from our medicine.
My fathers, see what white men have done to your children.
This is what they do when go their camp in friendship.
- Take them to squaw.
- White man's words are sweet, but heart bitter.
- Who has done this, my son?
- Men who make trail for Iron Horse.
And now their chief has spoken. Iron Horse soon bring soldiers, kill our people!
Will we wait while white warriors come like locusts?
Drive off people from land like buffalo?
I say not listen redcoat chief who talk peace and give us lies on paper... who take your son and call himself your brother.!
I say make war while able!
- Destroy trail of Iron Horse.!
-dd
Drive out white men!
All white men!
Medicine answered.
Natosi angered. Natosi say war. dd dd dd dd
It looks like war on a big scale.
The signal fires are burning... and the tribes are gathering from every part of the west.
Mr. Monty! Mr. Monty, I'm so glad you're back! I was so worried.
- You shouldn't be up this late, Sue.
- But I had to tell you.
Little Chief said the Indians are going to kill all the white men in redcoats... because of what happened at the railroad camp.
- At the railroad camp?
- What happened, Sue?
The Indians tried to sell Mr. Chambers his own horses back.
He got so mad, because they were trying to cheat him... he said he was gonna bring soldiers out to make them behave.
The Indians didn't like that.
When they tried to leave... the workmen pulled them off their horses and started hitting them.
I can try to reach Big Eagle and explain that he has nothing to fear from Chambers's threats.
I'm afraid it's too late for talk now.
- What is it, Father? More trouble?
- Yes, Vicky. Plenty.
And our friend Chambers started it.
Let's take a look from the tower. dd
- Now squaw put out finger.
- And let you cut it? I will not.
- Squaw afraid?
- Well, no.
Oh, you did!
It's bleeding!
Now put together.
Make Golden Hawk and Little Chief blood brothers.
You mean this will make me an Indian?
Mm. Indian now.
- Will my face turn red?
- No. You stay paleface.
I'm glad of that.
Oh, but if I'm a member of your tribe... they'll all be my relations, won't they?
Not Wolf Pelt.
He bad Indian.
- Him steal horses from white man camp.
- He did?
Then why didn't your father send him to Mr. Standing, like he did the others?
Father not know.
Wolf Pelt lie.
Say he not one of them.
Other Indians not tell.
- Well, I'm going to tell.
- You belong to tribe now. Must keep secret.
- But he should be punished.
- We catch him Wolf Pelt right time.
Not tell now.
We put in treaty.
Oh, dear.
Come on! Get ready!
They're coming this way! Hurry up!
Come on!
- Superintendent in?
- Yes, sir.
- What's happened?
- Our camp was raided.
We had to fight our way out.
I told you weeks ago that you couldn't keep order in this territory without troops.
Now we're trapped. The tracks are torn up behind us, and the bridge is burned.
The telegraph lines are down. They probably killed half the men in my camp by now.
Mount a detachment to go to their aid.
Bring the workmen here if the situation warrants and have Churchill take charge.
- Yes, sir.
- The few men you send won't stop
2,000 bloodthirsty savages.
We wouldn't be facing this situation,
Mr. Chambers... if it weren't for your unreasonable conduct.
- My unreasonable conduct?
- Your presuming on our authority... threatening to bring the militia here to make war on the Indians.
Well, I- Perhaps
I was a little hasty.
You were more than that.
Your stupidity is responsible... for endangering lives and property in my charge.
In the future, keep to the building of your railroad... but leave dealing with the Indians to the mounted police.
Inspector Montague?
Have the gates closed and see that the men are prepared for any emergency.
Yes, sir.
Redcoats go to Iron Horse camp.
Now we get Little Chief.
Sound the alarm! dd
Keep Sue in there, and you stay with her.
All right. Come on.
Vicky, quick!
Inside!
- Here's some more ammunition, Mr. Pat.
- Thank you, darlin'.
Get down. Get down.
Get down.
Get behind me.
Get behind me. That's it.
I got it! I got it!
Here it is.
Thank you.
That's it.
Mr. Pat, I've looked everywhere, and nobody seems to know what's become of Mr. Monty.
Never you mind now.
You've had no rest all night.
Sit down there, and as soon as I finish this, I'll get ya a bit of breakfast.
I couldn't eat. I'd better go back out and keep on looking.
Oh, well-
Sergeant MacGregor, are you all right, sir?
Aye, lassie.
Just a wee nip in the hand.
- Have you seen Mr. Monty?
- Well, no. I can't say that I have.
He isn't in the hospital with the wounded men, the guardroom or the stables.
- I've looked almost every place.
- D'n' worry your head, lassie.
Mr. Monty can take care of himself under any circumstances.
Thank you, sir.
Take him to the stables.
Inspector Randall?
Inspector Randall!
- Yes, Inspector?
- I was taken prisoner while on patrol, sir... and held at Big Eagle's camp.
Just before dawn this morning,
Inspector Montague was brought in.
- I was released to bring you a message.
- Go on.
Big Eagle demands that the railroad leave his territory within two days... or Inspector Montague will not be returned and hostilities will be reopened.
What will you do, Father?
You must send some word.
There's only one answer refusal.
Thank you, Randall.
Mr. Standing, aren't you going to try to save him?
- Of course, Sue.
- Well, there must be some way to rescue him.
There aren't many of us. If we tried and failed, they'd put him to death immediately.
We'll need help. I'll get a message out to the nearest post.
They may get here in time.
Iron Horse still go on.
If don't go away, you die.
Iron Horse won't go away,
Little Chief, not for me or anyone else.
Chief redcoat big fool.
All white men be killed.
If they do, many more will come... and it'll be very bad medicine for the Indians.
Big talk.
Indian kill them too.
- I get cold water for sick head.
- Thanks. That would be a help.
Do it for Golden Hawk.
She your friend.
Too bad you die.
Make her feel sorry.
You know I'm not a very good rider, but you go as fast as you can.
I'll stick on some way.
Hold still.
You oughta know which way the Indian camp is. You used to live there.
Maybe you're thirsty.
Have a drink.
Hurry up.
Oh. Oh, hello.
- Would you please tell me the way to Mr. Big Eagle's camp?
I've gotta go there.
It's terribly, terribly important.
- It's all right for me to go there,
'cause he's a friend.
He gave me this pony.
We know each other very, very well.
Won't you take me to him, please?
Thank you very much.
May I see Mr. Big Eagle now?
- Not now. You stay here.
- But-
Why, Sue!
Oh, Mr. Monty, have they hurt you?
I'm all right, dear.
How did you get here?
I came to see Mr. Big Eagle, but they won't let me talk to him.
- You shouldn't have come.
- I had to.
Mr. Standing sent to another post for help... but they can't get here in time, so after dark tonight... he's coming with a few men to try to rescue you.
But he's afraid that if the Indians see him coming, they'll-
- I have to see Mr. Big Eagle somehow, before it gets dark.
- It won't do any good, Sue.
It will.
I know it will.
- Please, Mr. Indian, won't you let me talk to-
- You go back.
Come over here, dear.
Stay near me.
Oh, Mr. Monty... if they do anything to you, they'll have to kill me too. dd
Redcoats on way!
They are coming!
Signal say redcoat leave post.
On way here.
Make ready now. dd
You come now.
- Please! What are you going to do?
- Stop it, Wolf Pelt.
- But they can't take you!
- Sue, remember? You promised.
- I'm not crying. Please. Let me go too.
- You'll stay.
Then bring Mr. Big Eagle here so I can talk to him.
Sure. He come.
But not now.
Oh, Mr. Monty-
We're not giving up, you know.
I'll talk to Big Eagle. But now... let's pretend this is just like any other night.
Kiss me good night.
Now, what do you say?
See you first thing... in the morning.
I can't! I can't!
No!
No! Wait! Please! No! No! dd
Mr. Monty. Mr. Monty. I won't let them hurt you.
- Now, Sue.
- No! Don't! Don't! Please!
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Mr. Big Eagle, please.
Don't let them hurt Mr. Monty.
- No listen to white devil child.
- You have to listen to me. Please!
Don't touch Golden Hawk!
She my friend.
I'm your friend too, Mr. Big Eagle, and so are the redcoats.
- That's what I came here to tell you.
- Redcoat no friend now.
Let Iron Horse chief bring soldier to kill all Indians.
No, they won't.
Mr. Standing won't let them.
And you shouldn't hurt Mr. Monty because of what Mr. Chambers said.
I won't let you.
White child lie to save redcoat.
All tribe know soldiers come.
The redcoats are the only ones who can speak for the great queen mother.
- The soldiers will not come to your lands.
- Redcoat lie!
White men beat Indians!
Sun god say kill all white men!
No, you won't! It was all your fault anrway!
You deserve to be whipped! If you hadn't tried to cheat Mr. Chambers when you-
Right time now.
You tell.
The only reason Mr. Chambers said he'd bring out the soldiers... was because Wolf Pelt tried to sell him back the horses he had stolen from the railroad.
Not true. No listen.
Devil child have forked tongue.
Golden Hawk speaks straight.
You one who lead braves who steal horses and let others take blame.
Little Chief lie too. Since live with white man, he have forked tongue.
Stop!
Why you not tell redcoat about Wolf Pelt?
Because Little Chief and I made a treaty to keep it a secret... so I couldn't break my word, could I?
You make treaty with Golden Hawk?
Yes.
Make her blood brother too.
No make treaty now.
Too much talk.
- All lies.!
- Wait!
I've told you the truth,
Mr. Big Eagle.
Honest, I have.
On my word of honor.
Little Chief give word too.
They try to fool you till redcoats get here.
No wait.
Wolf Pelt tell truth!
Bring medicine. dd
Who lying?
You one who lie.
Take him away!
No! No lie. No.
Devil child lie!
Set free!
Little Golden Hawk show white man and Indian... how to live as brothers.
She smoke too.
Oh, here I go again.
{1892}{1933}Does it look familiar, son?
{1975}{2012}I remember that ridge over there.
{2030}{2110}Yeah. Cowhands ride over there in that big gap.
{2140}{2220}You know, it was right around here where|I picked you up, twelve years ago.
{2252}{2290}You was more dead than alive.
{2348}{2395}I'll never forget that night, Dusty.
{2410}{2495}Flash o' guns, shouts o' murdering men...
{2530}{2562}And the courage of my dad.
{2590}{2668}Shielding me and fighting a hopeless fight.
{2695}{2765}Riddled with bullets, he fell across me, whispering...
{2782}{2868}'Lay still, Ted boy. They'll think you're dead.'
{2925}{2980}He didn't know I had a slug through my lung.
{3020}{3098}Well, when they rode up, somebody lit a match.
{3125}{3158}And I laid still.
{3185}{3268}And I heard somebody say, 'They got 'em both.'
{3292}{3332}And the match died out.
{3372}{3410}And then somebody laughed.
{3428}{3503}I'll never forget that laugh, Dusty.|The laugh of a crazy man.
{3538}{3555}A killer.
{3638}{3690}Well, the next thing I knew, it was morning.
{3725}{3760}I was in your arms.
{3795}{3878}Yep, and I carried you all the way to Big Bend.
{3905}{3980}For two years, I didn't know whether you was|gonna live or die.
{4000}{4040}But you sure pulled through alright.
{4060}{4125}If we could just find some trace of my|kid brother...
{4142}{4182}Well, it's doubtful.
{4202}{4288}We did learn, however, that your dad|had a hired man and his wife.
{4290}{4390}I remember... a woman did the|cooking and took care of Jim.
{4415}{4515}you see, Dusty, my mother died when Jim was born.
{4542}{4592}And he's the only relative I have.
{4605}{4630}If he's alive.
{4635}{4690}That hired man and his wife disappeared.
{4705}{4770}We couldn't find hide nor hair of 'em.
{4792}{4892}Finally, there was a feller that moved on|the ranch by the name of...
{4910}{4945}Let's see... What was his name?
{4985}{5032}Gentry, that's it! Gentry.
{5042}{5070}But he didn't know nothing.
{5100}{5185}Anyway, it ain't gonna do you no good living|this all over again.
{5198}{5260}We'll be in town tomorrow and we'll start|our investigating.
{5472}{5502}Hey, Dusty.
{5895}{5942}Poison!
{5950}{5985}Water hole.
{6028}{6058}I didn't know.
{6910}{6945}I wonder who he is.
{6960}{6988}We better open it.
{7228}{7255}'Hello, Gentry.
{7307}{7348}This'll introduce Gat Ganns.
{7362}{7422}He's just the man for the job you mentioned.
{7445}{7535}Sorry I can't do it, but I got a couple of|star trackers on my tail.
{7555}{7643}Gat's plenty tough, as this enclosed poster will prove.
{7665}{7700}Good luck, Bill.'
{7745}{7770}Gentry.
{7815}{7838}Gentry!
{7845}{7882}He's evidently planning to kill him.
{7893}{7948}Well, that's the fella that's got your dad's ranch!
{8350}{8435}Certainly is funny, but you sure do resemble|this bozo.
{8528}{8602}Maybe fate's kinda taken a hand in this deal, Dusty.
{8612}{8635}Maybe so.
{8658}{8718}We don't know what this Gentry's up to, but...
{8728}{8755}We're gonna find out.
{8762}{8785}What do you mean?
{8798}{8912}I mean that from now on, I'm Gat Ganns.
{8930}{8952}Murderer.
{9062}{9152}Gentry, my daughter and I have considered|your offer for the ranch.
{9162}{9200}And have decided not to sell.
{9215}{9275}We've developed the best spring in the country.
{9288}{9342}And someday I hope to make this a fine ranch.
{9418}{9510}I'll admit it's dry wire, Mr. Winters,|and I don't blame you for holding onto it.
{9522}{9612}However, this country is still wild, and rustlers are pretty numerous.
{9628}{9680}That's why I have sold half the herd.
{9690}{9735}And we're going to sell the other half next week.
{10068}{10138}- Excuse me just a moment, Mr. Gentry.|- Go ahead.
{10318}{10372}- Everything check up alright, Mr. Hornsby?|- Everything's right.
{10385}{10412}They're on their way.
{10562}{10618}I think you'll find that's right, Ms. Winters.
{10750}{10805}That's quite right. Thank you so much,|Mr. Hornsby.
{10835}{10915}Too late for the bank now, Dad. I'll have|to deposit this first thing in the morning.
{10928}{10982}I've got some two-year-olds I'd like|to have you take a look at.
{10995}{11020}Alright!
{11128}{11202}- How do you do, Mr. Gentry?|- Fine. Very happy to see you, Ms. Winters.
{11225}{11290}Your father told me that you decided not to sell.
{11295}{11418}That's right. We're quite happy here, and|it's the kind of a ranch that Dad's always wanted.
{11425}{11455}So why shouldn't we keep it?
{11462}{11528}Well, if you're happy here, that's all that matters.
{11630}{11695}As your neighbor, may I be permitted|to call sometime?
{11708}{11772}Why, of course. Dad and I will be delighted|to have you.
{11782}{11820}- Thank you. Goodbye.|- Goodbye.
{12620}{12652}- Good morning.|- Hello, chief.
{12672}{12700}- Hello.|- Hi, boys.
{12710}{12765}Well, Winters refuses to sell.
{12775}{12832}- Oh, yeah?|- Yeah, but I'm going to force him.
{12840}{12877}I'll ruin him.
{12888}{12960}The Winters girl's leaving the ranch|in the morning with a large sum of money.
{12977}{13060}Now, Joe and Hank, I want you to get it.
{13070}{13125}But remember, no harm must come to her.
{13138}{13198}I'll own that ranch no matter what it costs!
{13325}{13415}- There you are, honey.|- Alright, Dad. Now, I'll be right back.
{13455}{13480}Be careful!
{15408}{15448}If you hadn't have missed her, I'd have got her.
{15455}{15488}Well, it ain't too late yet.
{17520}{17605}- Can't get her now.|- Why didn't you keep her when you had her?
{17620}{17692}We never had her, you lassoed fool!
{18080}{18120}Drop that gun! Are you going crazy?
{18668}{18760}Cool down, now, before I go try it,|you pink-eyed weasel.
{18795}{18852}Come on, get in your saddle. We gotta go tell|the chief.
{19365}{19405}Them fellers is sure in a hurry.
{20005}{20040}Well, I reckon it's deserted.
{20080}{20125}We can camp here temporarily.
{20622}{20660}Dusty, come here.
{20850}{20872}Blood.
{21030}{21078}Hey, son. Get up here, quick!
{21405}{21445}Hey, son.
{21465}{21488}Bullet holes.
{21675}{21765}Fay Winters. It's mighty curious, Dusty.
{21778}{21825}We've gotta hurry and get her to town.
{21835}{21865}Let's take it easy now, son.
{21985}{22010}Got her here just in time.
{22032}{22070}A small artery's been severed.
{22080}{22118}However, I don't think it's very serious.
{22138}{22162}How did this happen?
{22175}{22240}Don't know. We found her just outside of town.
{22260}{22292}A horse must have thrown her.
{22330}{22368}We left our pack running loose.
{22385}{22425}I reckon we better get going.
{22440}{22518}- Yeah, we may be back later.|- Alright, boys.
{22525}{22572}I know the young lady'll be very grateful.
{22580}{22612}You've probably saved her life.
{22795}{22905}Now, listen, I hadn't better be seen around here,|so you take this money down and deposit it for her.
{22910}{22960}- And I'll meet you at the shack.|- Alright.
{23018}{23060}I'll tell you, boss, we couldn't catch her.
{23068}{23110}She just outrode us, that's all.
{23145}{23190}Well, I got another plan.
{23190}{23235}Get back to the hideout. I'll see you tonight.
{23378}{23455}Hello, Winters? This is Dr. Silsby.
{23470}{23550}Your daughter wanted me to tell you|she may be late getting home.
{23560}{23600}She's met with a slight accident.
{23618}{23715}No, not serious. I'll bring her out to the ranch a little later.
{23725}{23745}Thank you.
{23895}{23955}Who were the men that brought me in, Dr. Silsby?
{23968}{24005}They said they were prospectors.
{24020}{24052}It's lucky they found you.
{24065}{24105}A small artery has been severed.
{24118}{24165}And eventually, you may have bled to death.
{24180}{24268}As it is, the way you are, nobody'll ever|know that you have a scratch.
{24292}{24405}I certainly am grateful, but did they say anything about money?
{24410}{24438}Not a word.
{24460}{24525}I had three thousand dollars on me to deposit.
{24535}{24558}And it's gone.
{24572}{24602}Three thousand!
{24805}{24830}Your name Gentry?
{24842}{24870}Yeah, I'm Gentry.
{24878}{24930}We're from the border. Bill said to give you this.
{24968}{25045}He'd have come himself but he had a couple of|star packers on his trail.
{25402}{25450}So, you're Gat Ganns, eh?
{25460}{25490}That's what they call me.
{25512}{25570}- And this is my friend, Dusty.|- Hi.
{25582}{25620}- Howdy.|- We always work together.
{25650}{25685}Bill tell you what I wanted?
{25692}{25750}No, he just said there was gonna be some|gun-throwing.
{25792}{25830}How much do you want for the job?
{25850}{25880}What's the job?
{25905}{25960}There's a fella I wanna have disappear.
{25975}{26052}Well, whatever you're gonna give Bill'll be okay|with us.
{26065}{26102}- Eh, Dusty?|- Yeah.
{26133}{26178}Alright.
{26190}{26235}I'll take you over to meet the boys.
{26970}{27025}- Hello, Mr. Gentry!|- Hello, Spuds.
{27030}{27083}- Where's your dad?|- He's gettin' himself ready for dinner.
{27100}{27165}- Where are the boys?|- They're over at the corral.
{27172}{27255}Hey! Spuds! Spuds, get in here and get to work!
{27270}{27308}Hey, Spuds!
{27338}{27380}Oh, hello, boss.
{27455}{27545}Hey, Butch. I want you to meet Gat Ganns,|and his friend Dusty.
{27567}{27610}- Hiya, boys.|- Hi.
{27620}{27665}These boys have joined up with us for a while.
{27890}{27938}Come on, I want you to meet the rest of the boys.
{28115}{28165}Get in there! Get in there and get to work!
{28275}{28308}Hey, boys.
{28320}{28372}This is Gat Ganns, and his friend Dusty.
{28417}{28455}They're gonna be with us for a while.
{28467}{28510}I've got a little job to do tomorrow night.
{28515}{28565}You boys are taking all of Winters' cattle.
{28575}{28635}Taking 'em through the passe into Round Valley.
{28650}{28725}There's plenty of feed there. We'll dispose o' them later.
{28770}{28815}You boys can watch the house.
{28828}{28883}Winters'll be sure to come out when he hears|the racket.
{28902}{28985}Now, he's the man you want and you know|what to do.
{29002}{29040}Be sure it isn't the girl.
{29070}{29105}We're leaving about midnight.
{29133}{29198}Hank, show the boys to the sleeping quarters.
{29645}{29675}We're out of provisions, chief.
{29680}{29733}Yeah, well, here's fifty bucks.
{29740}{29840}And by the way, Butch. We're taking Winters' cattle|tomorrow night. You better get in on the drive.
{29845}{29885}- I'll be there, chief.|- Okay.
{29945}{30025}- I'm riding back with you, Gentry, to get my pack.|- Okay.
{30302}{30338}Hey, Spuds!
{30370}{30395}Come out here.
{30410}{30478}Tell the boys to hitch up the horses.|You're driving to town for provisions.
{30767}{30828}- Thanks.|- Is that Winters a tough hombre?
{30842}{30945}Just stubborn. I've tried to buy the ranch for|two years. Now I'm taking it.
{30972}{31000}Hasn't he any relatives?
{31010}{31028}A daughter.
{31035}{31067}I'm taking her along with the ranch.
{31080}{31140}Oh, I see! Like a dime novel.
{31150}{31252}We eliminate the old gent. You marry the gal and|get the ranch. Is that it?
{31252}{31285}You guessed it.
{31385}{31485}Go the way you always go. Don't ask any|questions and don't answer any.
{31492}{31550}And if you ain't back by dark, I'll tan you good.
{31558}{31598}- Get going!|- Giddyup!
{32195}{32235}Won't you come in, Dr. Silsby?
{32242}{32295}No, thank you. I got to be getting back.
{32305}{32365}- Well, thanks for the lift.|- Oh, that's alright.
{32455}{32492}Oh, Dad!
{32520}{32552}I lost the money!
{32562}{32633}Nevermind the money, dear. It's you I was worried|about.
{32645}{32720}We've got the rest of the herd to sell. That'll carry|you through til spring.
{32735}{32792}But tell me, Fay. What in the world happened?
{32812}{32865}Well, you see, there was two men that followed |me out of town.
{32902}{32952}And that's the last thing I remember.
{33022}{33085}I don't know. Doc said they were a couple of prospectors.
{36145}{36208}Well, fella, we sure had some ride, didn't we?
{36480}{36548}Come on, son. Let's go sit down and kinda pull|ourselves together.
{36795}{36852}I knowed you was gonna get me when|I passed you.
{36882}{36945}Oh, don't worry, Spuds. We're alright.
{36955}{36998}You're safe.
{37005}{37062}I know. But that's not what I'm thinkin' about.
{37082}{37142}I'm thinkin' o' what's gonna happen to me when I get back.
{37155}{37178}Butch'll beat me.
{37185}{37225}Oh, I'll have something to say about that.
{37240}{37322}You can't stop him. No one can. They have tried it.
{37330}{37405}Well, I'll get your provisions and then go back|with you and explain things.
{37422}{37478}Don't worry. Your dad isn't gonna whip you.
{38040}{38128}Now, I was beginning to think I'd have to come in|after you.
{38235}{38280}Where are the buckboards? What happened?
{38290}{38378}The horses got scared. I managed to stop them,|but the buckboards got wrecked.
{38385}{38418}What about the provisions?
{38425}{38448}They're in my pack.
{38495}{38522}Here's your change.
{38552}{38572}Get in the house.
{38670}{38728}I told 'em that kid couldn't hold them horses.
{38750}{38815}I've seen that fella someplace before, Dusty.
{38845}{38895}But I can't think where.
{38982}{39055}I couldn't help it, I swear! I tell you, I couldn't!
{39185}{39235}- I'll tan you good --|- I couldn't help it! No, please! Stop!
{39252}{39285}- I'll take care of --|- Stop, please!
{39500}{39532}I've'd licked the rest of 'em.
{39560}{39595}Now I reckon it's just --
{40058}{40092}Come on, Ted!
{41035}{41100}You ever whip that kid again,|I'll break every bone in your carcass.
{41112}{41162}Oh. Alright, then. Let me go.
{41378}{41425}He won't whip you again, Spuds.
{41435}{41470}You're the only friend I've got.
{41480}{41508}Gee, you can fight!
{41520}{41560}I'm gonna bet you busted his gizzards!
{41700}{41765}Gentry sent word that no one was to leave|the ranch.
{41778}{41818}And tonight's the night we're supposed|to get Winters.
{41835}{41862}How we gonna warn him?
{41870}{41935}Well, the only chance we got's when we get there.
{42025}{42040}Move over to the house from here.
{42062}{42122}But, remember. Don't mistake the girl for the man.
{42135}{42175}I'll get the boys started on the drive.
{42380}{42410}Gimme your knife, Dusty.
{45145}{45190}- What's wrong, Fay?|- Come here, Dad.
{45285}{45305}Look!
{45330}{45358}This just came through the window.
{45438}{45490}Why, it's our bank book!
{45510}{45545}The lost money has been deposited!
{45720}{45780}'Don't come... Don't strike a light.
{45788}{45830}They're waiting to shoot you down.
{45838}{45885}Your life's worth more than your cattle.
{45892}{45935}Let them take them. A Friend.'
{45978}{46010}They're stealing our cattle.
{46022}{46045}- I can't let --|- Dad!
{46055}{46080}Don't you understand?
{46092}{46152}They're waiting out there for you.|You wouldn't have a chance.
{47652}{47680}I saw the flash of a light.
{47705}{47740}I'm sure they got the note.
{47980}{48020}I don't think there's anybody home!
{48055}{48175}Well, that's mighty strange.|Well, I've got the cattle anyway. Let's go.
{48280}{48308}They're gone.
{48318}{48350}And our cattle with them.
{48395}{48515}Don't worry, Dad. Thanks to someone|we've got enough in the bank to carry us through.
{48635}{48685}Go over to Winters and ask him for a job.
{48695}{48780}He'll tell you about the cattle being stolen.|Tell him you'll help trail them.
{48798}{48835}I'm sure he'll take you up.
{48860}{48945}When you get out of town, well...
{48955}{48982}Accidents happen.
{49010}{49060}That's a mighty smart idea, Gentry.
{49080}{49122}You sure know how to work things out.
{49145}{49198}Now, come on, Dusty. Let's get this over with.
{50015}{50045}Oh, how are you?
{50055}{50085}I reckon you're the owner here.
{50092}{50162}- Yes, I am.|- Could you use a couple of good cowhands?
{50188}{50225}Well, I could've used you last night.
{50238}{50278}Rustlers run off all my cattle.
{50345}{50380}Well, they couldn't have gone far.
{50400}{50428}Cattle has to eat, you know.
{50445}{50470}Why don't you trail him?
{50480}{50552}I've phoned the sheriff, but he won't be back|til this afternoon.
{50578}{50620}Well, we'll make you a little proposition.
{50638}{50730}If we bring your herd back, will you give us|our jobs taking care of it?
{50748}{50770}I sure will.
{50782}{50865}Well, that's fair enough. You better go with us|til we sight 'em.
{50880}{50920}Then you can come back and get the sheriff.
{50935}{51015}We may lose your rustlers, but we'll sure|get your cattle.
{51022}{51065}Alright, I'll saddle up right away.
{51190}{51212}Oh, Ms. Winters...
{51240}{51278}- Oh, good morning, Mr. Gentry.|- Good morning.
{51285}{51308}Is your dad around?
{51315}{51365}Why, yes. I think he's over at the barn.
{51378}{51420}- I'd like to see him.|- Alright.
{51653}{51703}- Good morning, Gentry.|- Good morning, Mr. Winters.
{51715}{51820}Rustlers run off my cattle last night, and I've|just hired these two boys to help trail him.
{51915}{51950}We'll take care of him, Ms. Winters.
{51975}{52040}When we sight the cattle, he's coming back|after the sheriff.
{52075}{52122}Oh! Oh, I see!
{52442}{52528}Don't worry, dear. I may be late getting back,|but I'll be here.
{52608}{52635}Good luck.
{52792}{52840}Oh, I do hope they find our cattle!
{52860}{52982}In case your dad is late getting back, I'd be very happy|to keep you company this evening until his return.
{53000}{53085}Thank you, but I'm not afraid.|And I wouldn't like to inconvenience you.
{53092}{53155}Oh, that wouldn't be an inconvenience,|Ms. Winters.
{53168}{53218}In fact, it's going to be a real pleasure.
{53295}{53345}And here's the letter we got from Ganns.
{53438}{53520}'Hello, Gentry. This will introduce Gat Ganns.
{53530}{53578}He's just the man for the job you mentioned.
{53588}{53662}Sorry I can't do it, but I got a couple of|star packers on my trail.
{53680}{53765}Gat's plenty tough, as the enclosed poster|will prove.
{53770}{53792}Good luck. Bill.'
{53830}{53860}Gentry!
{53880}{53918}That dirty smick!
{53938}{53988}I don't know how I can ever repay you boys.
{53997}{54068}I hate to think what would've happened if you|hadn't taken a hand in this.
{54068}{54115}Oh, gosh, Mr. Winters. We're glad to help you.
{54128}{54170}The question is what to do next.
{54215}{54240}I got it!
{54250}{54322}You go tell Gentry that we've disposed|of Mr. Winters here.
{54342}{54415}If he wants proof, take him and show him Ganns.
{54500}{54530}And then...
{54568}{54625}Alright, get outta here before I shoot|the pants offa you.
{57032}{57112}- Well, Dusty's taken the shovel, but I guess|I can...|- Nevermind that.
{57125}{57147}Where is your partner?
{57155}{57240}He beat it for the border. We figure that the|sooner we get outta here, the better.
{57255}{57285}And I suppose you want your dough.
{57297}{57338}That's all I'm waiting for.
{57355}{57445}Well, the bank's closed, but I'll have it for you|at the hideout first thing in the morning.
{57455}{57518}Fair enough. I'll stay at the Winters' place tonight.
{57530}{57570}Got a few things I wanna pick up.
{57580}{57625}Alright, but don't let the girl see you.
{57632}{57668}I won't let anyone see me.
{57688}{57708}Okay.
{58328}{58365}- Hello, boys.|- Hi, boss. Hi, chief.
{58375}{58412}Well, I got some good news for you.
{58468}{58515}The Winters' ranch'll soon be mine.
{58540}{58597}Ol' man Winters is dead.
{58622}{58710}- Well, that is good news, I'd say.|- I'll say it is, boys.
{58720}{58770}Wonder what happened to him.
{58915}{58982}And now we're gonna collect five thousand dollars|reward.
{58990}{59022}- Five thousand?|- How?
{59032}{59118}Gat Ganns is at the Winters' ranch,|but he'll be over here in the morning.
{59128}{59210}There's a price on his head of|five thousand dollars, dead or alive.
{59235}{59330}- Dead men tell no tales.|- That's my job.
{59340}{59408}I don't care who does the job, just so it's done.
{59575}{59635}Peewee, you're gonna fly your tail outta here!
{59650}{59718}They're laying plots and it's up to us to tell 'em!
{60997}{61050}Why, Spuds! What're you doin' over here?
{61055}{61125}I come to tell you, they're gonna shoot you,|soon's you come to the hideout!
{61135}{61195}Gentry says there's a reward for you and he's|gonna get it.
{61218}{61247}Double-crossed, eh?
{61278}{61385}Oh, you don't have to worry, Spuds. There's no|reward out for me, and they're not gonna get me.
{61418}{61428}What's that?
{61445}{61470}That was Aunt Marthy's.
{61503}{61542}She gave it to me when she died.
{61565}{61575}Marthy?
{61603}{61715}Yeah, she was Butch's wife. She was the only|friend I had until you come.
{61725}{61750}Marthy, Butch...
{61772}{61847}Now I know where I've seen 'em. He and his|wife worked for my dad!
{61875}{61965}Say, Spuds. Did Aunt Martha ever tell you|about your father?
{61982}{62040}She said he was dead and that Butch wasn't|my real dad.
{62055}{62130}She left me a letter and told me not to open|it until I was grown up.
{62140}{62160}Well, where is it?
{62172}{62275}I brought this with me, 'cause Butch said he was|gonna shoot me and I ain't never going back there.
{62375}{62392}Here it is.
{62432}{62525}I'm gonna open this, Spuds. It may mean a lot|to both of us.
{62735}{62805}'Dear boy, your real name is Jim Hayden.
{62842}{62940}Your dad and his brother were killed by Gentry|and his gang when you were a babe.
{62958}{63025}Don't think hard of me, son. I've had no hand|in this.
{63038}{63055}Aunt Martha.'
{63147}{63215}Jim!
{63225}{63258}Jim, do you know what that means?
{63292}{63325}It means you're my brother.
{63375}{63400}My own little brother.
{63420}{63465}Gee, ain't that swell!
{63615}{63703}You know, boys, in a way this isn't any great|surprise to me.
{63732}{63790}I've suspicioned Gentry for a long time.
{63805}{63850}But I've never been able to get anything on him.
{63885}{63942}Years ago, right after Hayden was killed...
{63970}{64055}We suspected him of being the secret leader|of a band of rustlers.
{64072}{64108}But we were never able to prove it.
{64140}{64220}After reading that letter, there isn't a doubt|in my mind...
{64232}{64290}... but that he was guilty of Hayden's death.
{64332}{64375}We've got enough on Gentry now!
{64385}{64408}Why should we wait?
{64415}{64465}Well, give Ted a chance to play his hand, Sheriff.
{64485}{64530}He'll get word to us when he needs us.
{64660}{64695}There's Gentry now.
{65135}{65220}No matter what happens, son, stay right here.
{65368}{65395}Mrs. Winters?
{65512}{65612}I hardly know how to tell you, but...|this poster will speak for itself.
{65788}{65860}Why! That's the man that went with Dad!
{65875}{65935}- And he's a killer!|- That isn't the worst of it.
{65945}{66015}Word just came to town that they found|your father --
{66025}{66042}No!
{66060}{66092}Don't say it!
{66112}{66210}Don't cry, Fay. I want you to know that I'll take|care of you.
{66220}{66295}Why, I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
{66318}{66400}- Please, Mr. Gentry --|- Don't you understand, Fay? I'm crazy about you!
{66410}{66432}I'll give you everything you want!
{66445}{66485}Please don't talk like that!
{66495}{66562}Listen. I want you to be my wife.
{66570}{66602}Oh, take your hands off me!
{66612}{66650}Take your hands off, Gentry.
{66688}{66758}- You!|- What have you done with my father?
{66778}{66815}Your father's safe, Ms. Winters.
{66825}{66908}Call the sheriff. I'm holding this man for murder.
{66925}{66955}Murder?
{66975}{67025}My name's Hayden. Ted Hayden.
{67045}{67122}Son of the man you and your gang murdered|twelve years ago.
{67130}{67188}You left me for dead, too, Gentry.
{67198}{67222}But I lived.
{67235}{67275}Lived to even up the score.
{67295}{67335}Why, he's crazy!
{67345}{67375}That poster proves who he is.
{67388}{67435}Then call the sheriff, Ms. Winters.
{67795}{67812}Hello?
{67820}{67845}No, give me the sheriff's office.
{68008}{68060}You're mighty brave behind a gun, aren't you?
{68078}{68162}Why, hangin' or shootin's too good for you,|Gentry.
{68452}{68480}Hello, is this the sheriff's office?
{68505}{68600}- This is Ms. Winters. Is my fath --?|- Yes, your father's here.
{68618}{68642}He's alright.
{68690}{68708}What's that?
{68760}{68778}We'll be right over.
{68808}{68855}It's your daughter, Winters. We'll have to hurry.
{72360}{72418}- When Dusty comes, lead 'em right|to the hideout.|- Alright, Ted!
{73248}{73295}I'll be alright, dear. Don't you worry.
{73390}{73442}Hey, Dusty! Ted said to follow me!
{73450}{73478}Come on, Winters!
{75300}{75350}It's Ganns. He's got himself in a trap.
{75360}{75378}Gimme that gun.
{75600}{75692}Listen, Gentry. Twelve years ago,|you killed my father.
{75705}{75795}Separated me from my brother and took|everything outta my life that a kid could have.
{75810}{75865}You know, I oughtta give you what|you gave my dad.
{75888}{75940}But I'm keeping my hands clean, Gentry.
{75958}{75992}I'm taking you to the law.
{76058}{76110}Alright, boys. Let's riddle him with bullets.
{76338}{76362}Why, it's Gentry!
{76770}{76790}Up in the air, men!
{76820}{76865}Where's the man called Ganns?
{76880}{76898}He's in there.
{77045}{77160}Well, boys! I've been tryin' to meet up with you|for sometime!
{77310}{77385}I reckon you got here just in time, brother.
{77598}{77630}What're you thinking about, Jim?
{77655}{77685}You know, Ted meant that.
{77698}{77795}And he said when you married 'em,|it was gonna be twice as big.
{77812}{77865}Oh! He has it all worked out, has he?
{77875}{77932}Sure, and you better accept his proposition.
{77948}{77988}'Cause it'll be the only one you'll ever get.
{78008}{78040}Well!
{78075}{78122}What's my little brother been tellin' you?
{78182}{78260}Well, I was tellin' her what you said you didn't|have the nerve to.
{78362}{78392}Is my face red!
{78400}{78502}Well, it oughtn't to be! 'Cause Fay said she'd|accept your proposition.
{78532}{78565}Why, I --
{78575}{78618}Gosh, now you're both burnin' up.
{78645}{78700}I think your brother needs a good lecture.
{78708}{78770}Lecture? He needs a good spanking!
Martial...I was just gonna apply for a job.
Its all right son. My deputy just gone down there with all the men we need.
What's all the trouble, Martial ?
Who is he ?
Boys, get that man. I want him.
Wait a minute. I will get him.
Watch this fella.
Well Martial, I guess you got me ... but I was not mixed up with that gang
...I was trying to help you.
-You darn fool.. I noted.
I just wanted to talk to you when you lead out.
I got a job for you and it ain't fighting fire with others.
Say, I been looking for a fellow that can shoot, ride like you for months.
Think I am going to let you get away ?
No Sire...
Take a look at this.
-What's wrong with that ?
-Nothing maybe .. it might be funny to me that every time this gang organizes Rodeo
...their own men win all the first prizes.
Once it begins to look like an outsider was going to win, he gets sick.. two or three has even died from it.
-cannot arrest them for that, Martial.
-no, maybe not.
... but its mighty peculiar ... that when all these outsiders fall fall off from them tough horses suffering from snakebites. I tell you it ain't natural. what do you want me to do, get snake bit ?
No, my idea is for you to trail over there and sign up for the Rodeo.
I will come along after and do some private investigating.
...while you work in on the gang. cause you don't have to know me when we get there.
-what do you say to that son ?
-sounds great to me.
-when do we start ?
-right away. this game is getting pretty hot for us.
If we are tiring the law to figure out something crooked with this whole Rodeo business they will start investigating.
Now I will decide when we make our next clean up right here in Dalton. head for the border... before something happens we will stick up the next stage of the mine grab the rodeo receipt, and clear out. you are right spike. they acted mighty suspicious when that fella died over the boulder
-when do we start ?
-Tomorrow.
Dolores will board the stage, down at sagebrush and give you boys a high sign when the money is aboard women passengers as a stage crew ain't liable to fight much anyhow
.well, well Cramer. meet my new deputy John Weston.
I want you to paddle west with the shortcut trail the one that leads to Dalton. save him a whole days journey, if he had to go on the way over the desert. give him a horse. I will see that another is sent to you.
-sure thing.
-you better get going then, right now. the trail starts outside the corral, cant get off of it. then you go 14 miles straight through the mountain that will drop you right out of the timber on the main stage road that leads to Dalton.
Howdy Miss Carter, going home for the big round up ?
-Oh yes! I promised Dad that I will be there.
-I bet, he will be mighty glad to see you.
I will be glad to see him too.
-Pardon me. Do you mind if I sit on this side?
-Well, certainly not. Its quiet alright. looks like we are getting some help from back there. you sure got us out of the jam, that time stranger. nice riding. you don't happen to be going to the Dalton Rodeo... do you ?
-Yes I am.
- Well tie your horse on behind and ride in with us. thanks, I will do that. that was very fine of you to come to our rescue.. Mr.. ....
Weston Mam.
John Weston from Utah.
I came over for the rodeo ...
...I saw your distress signal from the top of the ridge.. when I saw all those men riding behind,
I thought I better come down and investigate.
-My distress signal ?
-it was mine.
I saw the men coming and waved for help. that was kind of an unusual place to expect help, wasn't it ?
-I saw you on the ridge.
-Oh, I see.
-Are you going to Dalton mam ?
-Yes, I am Margaret Carter.
...my father is Judge Carter. president of the county news bank of Dalton...
I want you to meet him when we get there. he will want to thank you too.
You see the bank had a large shipment of money on this stage.
Yeah. there were about 50 of them. but this fella from Utah comes along single-handed and knocks them all off the horses.
I have never seen such riding. can you tell me where I can find Weston ?
-Just went in the bank there, Mr. Carter.
-Thank You.
Hello Miss. Carter.
This is Mr. Weston.. the man who saved us from the bandits.
Mr. Weston. my father ...Judge Carter. mighty fine piece of work, young man.
I hope you are staying in Dalton.
-Yes. I am going to enter the rodeo.
-that's fine.
Drop into my office after you get settled.
I like to have a talk with you. thank you, I will be glad to.
-you cant blame me if your men cant take care of him. she is right. just out-smarted you that's all.
I don't like the looks of it. he came up behind us and took the boys off there horses. he said he will enter the rodeo.
-we are going to have to take care of him. he is liable to spoil our plans.
-hey, young man.
-hello Judge.
-come in.
- thank you.
Miss Carter !
- How do you do ? as justice of the peace of this township,
I have been doing a little investigating. and it appears to me that this rodeo gang ain't just not exactly on the level. if it ain't, we are going to need all the good men we can get on the side of law and order. it would be mighty disastrous son, if anything happens to this rodeo. nearly all the money in this valley is tied up in it.
... so we just got to keep it honest. you mean to say that these people have tied up all the money in the valley on a proposition put on by outsiders ? yes, every cent. they think that it will bring people and prosperity to Dalton. and they are all mighty proud of this little valley. that's why I am offering you the job of Deputy Sheriff.
I figure, that with a man like you representing us they wont dare to pull any of their tricks. well, I appreciate your confidence in me Judge, but I couldn't accept. it will interfere with my plans.
- plans ! what plans ?
My plans to enter the rodeo, tomorrow.
- Oh ! I see. Well I am sorry young man... so am I judge.
Good day Miss Carter.
- I am afraid I was talking to the wrong man.
- I think he is nice.
Ladies and Gentlemen ! it gives me great pleasure to announce the first annual Dalton rally roundup. two days of Bronc riding
... consisting of riding, roping and horsemanship featuring Dynamite, the only unridden horse in the play better be careful son. many of them have lost their lives making up with this thing.
Oh, I don't think they will try anything today. by tomorrow, I may have this thing figured out for you
I hope so, but I still say you ought to be careful. next on the program, ladies and gentlemen .. will be the trick roping contest. featuring Jack Hollister. the next event ladies and gentlemen will be the roman standing race. next ladies and gentlemen we introduce the world-renowned holder of all championships
...Cheyenne Kent and the cub roping contest. let her go ! new record in this contest, ladies and gentlemen..
Kent's time was 15 seconds flat. its a brave try but Kent's record still stands. however we have a dark horse with us today.
A man from Utah will try his luck. let him loose ! a new world record, ladies and gentlemen! the man from Utah rode and tied his cub in 14 seconds flat. that one got away!
...better luck next time... that's 3 events taken in a day, the one from Utah ! he looks like holding to me. yeah! we got to do something about it.
I don't want to pull anything too rough unless we have to.
Kent, you take the boys up into the cabin and Dolores will get him up there. just work over him gently. leave that for us.
-are you ready ?
-let her loose.
Dolores, the young girl that you met on the stage was in the gang from the beginning. play up to her and see what you can find out.
I will meet you in the saloon tonight. that concludes today's event, ladies and gentlemen.
Don't forget, tomorrow is the big day.
-Oh, you were wonderful.
-thanks Miss. that means lot coming from you.
I like you to come to the house for dinner tonight.
I told father that maybe you can get you to reconsider the offer. we need somebody like you.
Oh, Mr. Weston. It was wonderful the way you win today. my brother is a big Rodeo star also. and he would like to meet you.
..wont you come now ?
- well .... I ....
Yes. goodbye Miss. Carter!
I will see you tomorrow.
-here they come Kent !
-you boys get out at the back. this is my brother, Cheyenne Kent.
-how do you do Kent.
-pleased that you have accepted our hospitality.
-sit down, Dolores will fix us a drink.
-thanks.
I must say that I watched your show today and thought you were great. well you did some mighty fine work yourself.
-full on !
-no thanks. I don't drink well, here's looking at you ! well Weston, tomorrow is the big day now that you would ride in with us. he got away ! we have to go tell Boss about this. and he will be plenty sore. hey sheriff, the gang just jumped me up at the Spanish woman's house.
I got a hunch that if you go up there, you can pick up some of the gang that were mixed up at the stage coach hold up yesterday. yeah ? well you don't get look to me like that you have been in any fight you don't get me out of here on no wild goose chase either.
I am staying right here to guard this money.
-suit yourself.
-oh Utah! I got some prize money for you..
-that's a lot of money there judge ?
-yeah. we are doing pretty well. taken in 8.000 dollars today, and expecting more tomorrow. we will have close to 30.000 dollars in this bank, by tomorrow night.
30.000 dollars,
- you are taking an awful chance, aren't you ?
I am still guarding this bank, young fellow. pardon me Sheriff ! thanks judge. hello Miss Carter !
Hey Buddy ! ain't you the whooper snapper that won most of the events out there today ?
-I wont appraise it that way.
-sit down. hey, you look like the young fellow that won the belt at Cheyenne, last summer. no that was my grand dad.
I have been nosing around. seems to me that we will have to give this fellow Burton. after what you have done today, he will probably be glad knowing you. get on the bar and make a bet on yourself you lookie up. well alright! if you cant fix him off, then I have to buy him off. if you are wrong with your work
I will use my brain. that boy put it over on you twice. fine bunch you are. guess who is just talk out there. he just came in.
-fine, I will take care of him right now.
-what it will be ?
-wanna place a bet? a 1000 dollars, on Weston to win. he is on 1:2. favor. that's right but its an easy 500.
Beg pardon ! you are Weston aren't you ? my name is Burton ...
...I am head of the rodeo committee.
-I would like to talk to you privately.
-certainly Burton.
I want to apologize for the little over incident that my boys had with you. they thought you were somebody else. they found out their mistake and they are sure sorry.
...I would like to have you meet them. fact is I like to have you join up with us Weston. you will never get into the big money in this game unless you play with a gang.
I guess you know what I mean.
- well it sounds good to me.
I have always heard that you have to be on the inside
...to be anything. what's your proposition? just this, right now you are 1 to 2 in favor. that means you are going to win on a 1000 dollars bet, 500 dollars. seems for you to do is to let me place 2000 for you on Kent's 2:1. and if you should be off form tomorrow and Kent wins, you stand to make 4.000 dollars. now that's a lot better than 500 dollars isn't it ?
- I am glad that you are right. that's fine, I am glad that you can see it our way. come into the back room.
I want you to meet some of the boys. boys, Weston here is going to join up with us.
I want you all to treat him right.
- Weston meet Cheyenne Kent.
- I think we have met before.
-signore Weston, we will see a lot of each other, now that we are friends.
I am kind of agreeing at this racket,
I suppose there are a lot of things over this rodeo business that you can tell me.
-well Boys, see you later. so long Burton. -so long.
-well just make that 2.000 on Weston. see boys, it just takes a bit of brains to handle a guy like that. yeah.. how do you know that he wont cross yourselves ? well, if he does then we can still get him with the needle. we are cleaning up all this after this one anyhow.
-what did you make out son?
-you had the right hunch Martial.
Burton is the brains in the gang alright.
I placed the bet like you told me ... he made me a proposition to join them outfit.
-did you accept ?
-sure, I accepted. he took me right in to introduce me to the rest of the gang. I met them all.
Burton told me that he place 2.000 dollar bet on Cheyenne Kent for me. and if I should lose the event that
I was entered in, I stand to win 4000 dollars. so I don't think that we have much to worry about them, till I start to winning. and then it may be too late for them to get organized.
I don't know son. strikes me, you better be mighty careful. remember what happened to them the other fellas. this gang tough bunch when somebody crosses them.
I don't want to see you take down with snakebite. you get anything out of the Spanish woman ?
-no, she wouldn't talk much. she took me up to that shack on the hill and introduced me to Cheyenne Kent. she said, he was her brother. and before I can get into some understanding.. the whole gang jumped me and I had to curve myself up fast and walking.
I didn't get you into this job to get yourself killed.
-you got any ideas how they work the snakebite proposition ? not yet, but figuring from their past performances
I  cant do much till the bronc riding. that's one of the last events tomorrow. so I will have till the end to figure it out. and besides its going to take them sometime to get wise that I am not gonna lose this rodeo.
- never forgive myself if anything happens to you.
- nothings gonna happen
-come on lets turn in.
-tomorrow is the big day.
I want to announce in time that the high man from yesterday's events was the man from Utah.
...Cheyenne Kent is the runner up. and it looks like a close race. in the events for today, the contestants will contest riding, roping and bull dogging, ending in a thrilling demonstration of horsemanship. and both the man from Utah and 
Cheyenne Kent will try their luck on Dynamite. may the best man win ! and for the first time ladies and gentlemen..
...you will see the Indians from the Daltons reservation... Zaenìte let her go. they are sure going to give it to you today. do you think you got it doped out..
I don't know for certain, but I gotta good hunch
- you better not take any chances.
- its the only way to get the dope on them say, you got that snakebite medicine.
- sure, plenty of them.
- that's what I will try here take this out there with the needle. what are you thinking about son ? on my mind, I think I got this thing figured out. come on I am on the next event. next is the bull dogging ladies and gentlemen watch closely, this is going to be good
Cheyenne Kent will try to keep bulldogging record. let her go. his time was 13 second, the best so far.
John Weston, the man from Utah is next up.
I got to leave Mergeree. the receipts are in by now.
I have got to take them over and put it in the vault. that was another one from the man from Utah folks. he beat the best time by 2 seconds. or 11 seconds flat. we got to stop that guy right now. if he wins the bronc riding we are licked. when that double crosser comes up for the bronc, you boys get the needle. and make it strong .. and now get going. ladies and gentlemen Cheyenne Kent will attempt to ride Dynamite. unridden for 3 years. let her go.
- everything all fixed up for me boys ?
-its all yours ! maybe I better sit into one saddle myself to make sure. you will find everything alright. ladies and gentlemen, the man from Utah will try his luck on Dynamite. ride him cowboy ! just a minute. let him loose. man from Utah on Dynamite ! that guy is wise. he found out about the needle and now he is riding the bronc. we better get moving. we clear out the bank and get over the line.
-what about me ?
-that's for you to figure out. he rode him ladies and gentlemen. he rode him ! what a ride.
-Senor Weston !
-what's the matter ?
Barton and his boys are holding up the bank and they have left us behind.
-put up your hands !
- well sheriff.. I ... robbery and murder eh ? well you didn't get away with it.
I thought you acted kind of suspicious last night when you were looking over that money 
...and tried to get me out of there.
-but.. Sheriff ! save your breath young fellow. just a minute sheriff...
...I am United States martial that young fella was working for me. we were after a gang of rodeo crooks and you almost let the biggest one getaway. now I gotta organize a posse and go after him. nice work son, come on boys take him out. boy you got them red handed. that's not all, here's enough evidence that can send that gang up for murder. whenever anyone interfered with their rodeo plans they stuck one of these needles. dipped in snake venom in the saddle. that's how the men died and why we couldn't prove any of them....
...I knew there was a mystery about this bunch. by jolly, it took you to figure it out. well you see Miss Margaret, its like this, he had to play up to that gal
...so he can get in with the gang. well, in that case I will have to forgive him. say young fella, how about the deputy sheriff job ? sorry judge, but I cant accept.
-it will interfere with my plans
-plans .. what are you planning now ? well dad, he promised to stay away from these beautiful seneoritas...
...and we got to plan our honeymoon. so long judge.
I received your letter and got here as quickly as I could.
Now I am going to tell you why I sent for you.
20 years ago my brother and I quarreled over a woman he married her. They relocated near
Kennegamy house, northern Canada.
A child was born, a girl.
Wife died
I heard that my brother had strangely disappeared.
Lately I have had a desire to see that niece of mine.
And find out just what happened to my brother.
That's why I sent for you.
I am afraid I couldn't stand a drift.
I will be glad to do everything I can.
You know, I haven't forgotten that you were dad's best friend.
You see my brother's name was John Ball... wife's name was, Marie.
More likely, that will be the girls name too.
Its my hope that she will spend the remaining years of my life, here with me.
You know son?
Some day she is going to inherit this here, the ranch of the pines.
I understand and I will do my best to find her.
Couldn't ask no more than that.
- When can you leave?
- On the morning train..
Good!
Rod Drew!
What are you doing here?
Well hello Bobby?
Where are you heading for?
I am going home.
I just graduated.
That's nice!
Say, how is the old Alma Mater?
Oh, kind a quiet now... they haven't found any cows or goats in the dormitory since you left.
Don't tell me the place has deteriorated into a school of learning.
Sit down.
Oh, I cant now!
My mind is in the middle of a poker game.
But I have a lot to tell you,
I will be back later.
Okay.
- Don't loose your shirt!
- No!
I saw from where that one came from.
What are you doing, getting sore when you start to loose?
You tin horn...
I didn't do it, Rod.
They framed me.
I caught him cheating and he pulled a gun on me.
Its murder.
Come on.
Nice way to have a bath.
You shouldn't have done that Rod.
Now you are in it, as much as I am.
Don't worry about that, Bobby.
The main thing is to get out of here before they pick us up.
We are about a mile from Fort Minnetaki.
We should be able to buy a change of clothes there.
Lets get started.
Here you are, Mister.
Come on, Bobby.
Telegram for you Martial.
It must be that fellow who drifted down in this morning.
Well, there they are now.
We are going to have a talk with them.
Hey you fellas, wait a minute.
Wait a minute there.
Come on, Bobby.
That's them alright!
Come on lets run them down.
We got to jump for it.
It's our only chance.
They got away.
Notify the Mountain police.
From Minetaki they have headed north.
One of them is half-breed, but we do not have any description of the other.
- You better start at Fort Minnetaki.
- Yes Sir!
We can take a shortcut through Wabinosh
House, its on the bend of the river.
Once we make there, we will be safe for a while.
The cabin looks deserted.
We can camp there for the night.
Gold!
It's a map.
They must have fought for it.
Shows the location of their mine.
We, John Ball and Peter Plante... having discovered gold at this point do hereby agree to joint partnership in it and do pledge ourselves... to forgot our past differences and work in mutual goodwill and honesty
'so help us God' signed John Ball and Peter Plante.
So this is what happened to John Ball.
John Ball?
Why are you interested in him?
He is one of the reasons I am up here.
And the other?
His daughter.
Bobby, when we get to Wabinosh House... we will make a search for this mine.
Well, Bobby!
- Bobby!
- Felice!
Gee .. I am glad to see you.
I am glad to see you, Bobby.
Felice, this is Rod Drew.
My best friend in college.
Miss Newsome.
How do you do Miss Newsome?
How do you do Mister Drew.
Well how are you Bobby?
Glad to see you back.
I am glad to be back Mister Newsome.
Mister Newsome, this is Rod Drew.
How do you do Mister Newsome!
Howdy!
Are you going to be with us for some time?
No, I am afraid not. We are only going to stay long enough to get supplies.
Oh!
Where are you going?
Well! You see ..
We were thinking of hunting wolves.. and we want to get our trap plans plotted early.
Oh!
In the mean time I have some things here I would like to leave with you for safekeeping.
- Would you please keep this safe?
- Well, certainly!
- Benoit! Place this in the safe.
- Oui, monsieur.
Felice will get you what supplies you need.
We can put you up right here at the post.
Thanks Mister Newsome, that will be fine.
You boys come along with me now and I will show you to your room.
- Bonjour LaRocque.
- Bonjour. Eh! What have you got?
You wait I show you.
- More bullets, eh?
- Oui!
When the winter catches in we will attack Wabinosh House... and bring them to knees with their our own ammunition, eh?
Oui, and she is coming in pretty quick now.
And the ammunition is very low.
But Newsome, he don't know that.
I emptied his box and put them back on the shelves.
Good.
And now, I have the grand news for you.
Two strangers have arrived at the post with a map full of gold.
- A map of gold?
- Oui.
- Where is it?
- Je ne sais pas.
I have only seen the word 'Gold' marked on the map.
Newsome had me put it into the safe.
- You can open that safe?
- Do not know if I can do that.
- You try?
- Oui.
I will give you two men.
You will go there tonight.
Oui.
It is of no use,
I cannot get it.
But she can.
She knows the combination.
Ah!
- Benoit!
- Get her.
Ah, ah!
Felice, Felice!
She is gone!
Eh!
Who is this?
Its Abonga.
What are you doing here?
We found him wounded in Felice's room.
And she is gone.
Felice gone?
Ah!
LaRocque, eh?
I have seen him before must have taken her to his place.
Who is LaRocque?
Renegade trader stationed up in the river here been giving us plenty of trouble, what were they after?
There is nothing up here of value.
Not even in the safe.
- Maybe its the map.
- We got to find Felice!
- We better head for LaRocque.
- We can go by canoe.
No, you cannot go that way.
There's not enough water.
We might make it.
One thing for certain.
It sure would give them surprise if you did get through.
Come on, lets try it.
I couldn't open the safe, but Felice she knows the combination.
Get her and bring her here.
Jules LaRocque!
So you are behind all this?
You will tell us the combination of that safe and we will set you free.
I will tell you nothing.
Lets see maybe you will.
Take one of their guns and start something.
Meet me at the back door.
Bobby!
Get him!
My gosh, she is getting away.
Eh, Bobby!
I have been thinking, maybe Felice can help me with my quest.
So you are up here on a quest?
I didn't come here, just to hunt wolves.
I will be very careful, if I were you.
Man-hunters are not exactly welcomed by most people around here.
Its not a man I am looking for, its a woman.
A young woman.
She is just about your age.
That sounds interesting, tell me about it.
Don't you think we better inform your father that you are safe?
Perhaps you are right, Bobby.
You make big mistake when you bring that girl here.
I had too!
She has seen me.
And now I cannot go back.
We will send Marie!
She is not known there.
Oui, that's a good idea.
She can tell them she escaped from
Kennegamy House.
He will need someone for my place.
That stranger have a map of gold that you must get.
But you must not tell him anything.
- Leave it to me. I will get it.
- I know.
Excuse me, monsieur.
Are you Mr. Newsome?
Yes.
I am Marie LaFleur from Kennegamy House.
I was a clerk there, and also took care of the accounts.
I am looking for work.
- Can you keep books?
- Oui monsieur.
Well you have got a job right now as far as I am concerned.
If you can help me out of this mess.
That will be simple, monsieur.
I will go and have a room prepare for you right away.
Thank you.
Did you say your name was Marie?
Oui monsieur.
I heard you say that you are from
Kennegamy House.
Have you lived along there long?
You are very inquisitive, monsieur.
I don't mean to be, but I am very interested.
I would like to have a talk with you.
If you wish.
What's the matter Felice?
I don't see why he should be so interested in that girl.
What do you care?
Are you beginning to like him?
Why no.
Things haven't been the same between you and me Felice.
Not since you met him,
I owe him my life.
But I am not going to let him come between us.
Why Bobby!
I never realized that you felt that way about me.
Do you have your map, young man?
Better not take any chances.
That LaRocque crowd is not giving up that easily.
We will be watching for them.
I am keeping my eye on them too.
Getting too many of them to be comfortable.
I have to keep watch on them..
Good-bye Mr. Newsome.
Take care of yourself. Well good luck!
Thank you.
Bobby, its not same without you.
Good-bye.
Goodbye, Felice.
Goodbye, Rod.
Goodbye Bobby.
Goodbye, Felice.
Well, what you find out?
Oh, he don't answer any questions.
I cant find out nothing from him about the map.
And this morning they start down the river.
It is too late.
No, I do not think it is yet too late.
I have another idea.
Well?
They leave this morning.
Yeah, I know. But what you found out at the mountain police post?
I found out plenty.
They are wanted men.
A mountain patrol left fort Minekati this morning to find them.
That is bad. If the police get them, we loose the map.
We must beat the police.
A mounty!
Get away from that gun.
You are under arrest.
Hit the trail, you two.
We are heading for Kennegamy House.
Not that way, this way.
I thought the Kennegamy House was south west of here.
I said we are heading this way.
So it is your little game, is it?
Pretty clever, eh!
Almost as clever, the way you got Felice.
I should kill you for that.
Get the map!
Tie them up, put them in there.
Line up against that wall.
So you are the real Mounty!
I thought that other guy was a fake.
See we go up the Way Sugar to the Big Mackey.
Come... we go!
We got to get out of here.
LaRouque must be way ahead of us.
- Yeah! With our map.
- That's where you are wrong.
I left the real one on my boot.
You are not turning him loose, are you?
He is the law!
I am not going to live him here to die.
You can do what you want. But if you turn me loose I will make arrest.
Don't be crazy Rod.
You turn him loose and we don't have a chance.
He will have every man on the fort trailing us.
Listen, we may be your prisoners, but you are coming along with us.
Till we find out what this map leads us into.
That's white peak al right, and according to the map, it is right below us.
Here it is.
There must be a small fortune in there.
What's this?
By Jove it looks like Felice!
Why Bobby, is Felice John Bali's daughter?
You knew it all the time, why didn't you tell me?
I knew, if you find out, you will take here with you and I loose her.
I know now, that she doesn't care for me.
Well, we better get started.
LaRocque will know by now that he has been send into a wild goose chase.
And nothing will stop him.
It is not here.
We have been tricked.
We go back to the cabin.
Hey look!
Maybe we will find them in the creek.
Look, there they go.
Keep rowing, Bobby!
Oh, look!
We got to stop it, the fall is just below there.
Not good Bobby.
We have got to get him back to Wabinosh House.
Three time they fooled us.
But no more.
You will bring all the men here.
This time we will fool them.
We will attack Wabinosh House for the gold and the furs.
And they will find the ammunitions all gone.
Ah, Mecogui!
What did you find out?
20, 30 men hold big pow wow with LaRocque.
Him come here quick.
They probably intend to attack.
Thanks Mecogui,
I will get guns and ammunition ready.
Come on Bobby!
Wait!
There is a mounted police force at fort Mippigon... and I am deputizing you to and get there.
I will get them Ryan.
Mr. Newsome, these are empty!
Empty?
Benoit, to blame for this.
We cannot hold them forever.
Bryan intended that we get help from Fort Mippigon.
Going after them.
Hold up them as long as you can.
LaRocque gang is attacking Wabinosh House.
I have only three men here, but we are deputizing every men in the settlement.
Call assembly.
Everyone is ready?
We go!
Someone must have tipped them off.
No matter, but they cannot hold for long.
You lead them to attack while I go for Marie.
Oui, beau.
- Good! Everything there!
- Yes, most of it.
Wait I will get the rest.
Not so fast, Marie!
Here they come!
Take cover, quick!
Well, Ryan, we are ready to go back anytime you are.
That wont be necessary.
The sergeant told me, the guy that Bobby had the fight, didn't die after all.
When he recovered consciousness he exonerated Bobby from shooting.
And you boys are free.
- There they are. Plenty of room for them.
- Cut that out, Kid, and get out.
Hey, isn't that young Mr. Cravat, there?
By golly, it is.
Over here. What do you say?
I know what will fetch him.
Watch his ears perk up when he hears the old Travelers.
Let's give it to him.
High rickety! Well, you old...
Hello, buddy. Old Buck.
Well, hate to be making it into a firefight.
If it ain't the old honker, himself.
Got yourself hitched?
Yeah, I've got a wife and son, four years old now.
Aye, this is like a Fourth of July celebration on Judgment Day.
- Beats all Creation.
- Say, where are you heading for, Yancey?
- I'm cutting dirt for the Little Bear Creek.
- That's the spot, believe me.
Yes, indeed.
You're Yancey Cravat, aren't you?
- And you?
- Lee, Dixie Lee.
- Indeed.
- Going for a town site?
No, I'm going for a quarter-section ranch out at the Little Bear Creek.
That's funny,
I'm heading for Little Bear, too.
Well, I know just the piece of land I want.
It's deep in the gully and a lot of scrub over.
Ready, aim...
- You near flummoxed. Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.
But his legs are broken.
I heard them crack.
Please shoot him.
And in no time, no time, mind you... they'd snapped up every piece of land that was worth having... and by nightfall...
By nightfall there wasn't an acre.
Think of it, Louis, not an acre left out of that two million.
The only spot I wanted was the ground we stood on, and...
Well, the girl got that quarter section.
Yancey Cravat... you let that hussy in black tights have your claim... after having been gone a whole month, away from your wife and child.
- Now, Mama...
- Don't you "Mama" me.
Isaiah, go on with your fanning.
Yes, Mrs. Venable.
- Well?
- The land was hers by right of claim.
I don't believe a word of it.
Why did you let her keep your land?
Lt'd been a man, I could have shot him.
You can't shoot a woman.
- Why not?
- Oh, Felice.
I don't suppose you'd recognize the lady without her black tights.
"Let there be no strife between thee and me."
That's from the Old Testament, Dabney.
You may not recognize that.
It's all tommyrot.
Perhaps now, Yancey, you'll stop this ranting up and down... and be content to settle down here in Wichita... run that newspaper of yours, and conduct your law practice, such as it is... with no more talk of Oklahoma.
Don't you realize that this is a new empire?
Why, folks, there's never been anything like it since Creation.
Creation? That took six days, this was done in one.
History made in an hour. Why, it's like a miracle out of the Old Testament.
- Don't be blasphemous, Yancey.
- Like a miracle out of the Old Testament.
Cities of ten thousands, springing up overnight.
Well, I'm going back.
I'm going back and help build a new state out of the last frontier of the nation... and it'll be a state someday, mark my words.
Yancey, you're not leaving me again?
Leaving you, my beauty?
Not by a long shot, sugar.
This time you and Cim are coming with me.
Louis Venable, can you sit there and see your daughter dragged off... to be scalped among savages?
- But I want to go, Mama.
- You don't know what you want.
We start Monday week, fresh and fair, with two freighters.
One with a printing outfit and the other with the household goods.
- Why, we can make it in nine days.
- I forbid it.
You're going to stay here with your father and mother in decent civilization.
- I've heard enough.
- I'm going with him, Mother.
That's it, honey.
Why, we've had enough of this Wichita.
We're going out to a brand new two-fisted, rip snorting country... full of Indians, rattlesnakes, gun- toters, and desperados.
- Isaiah, I declare.
- Miserable brat, you Boon boy.
Master Yancey.
Take me with you to Oklahomy.
Please take me, Master Yancey.
You ain't going to no Oklahomy.
You're going to take a bath.
- Mammy, I want to...
- Get out. Get out.
Well, I'll go see about those freighters, huh?
Come on here, Cim. Atta boy.
My son, you're going to see more Indians then you ever thought of.
I never heard of such a thing.
What do you mean, Sabra?
You're not going.
Why a Venable should ever marry such a man, a buffalo hunter.
- Quite right.
- Annie.
A quart of whiskey a day, living in that dreadful Cimarron country.
- What is Cimarron?
- Savage, Cousin Hewitt.
It means wild, unruly.
Yancey's idea of a name for the boy, Cim.
You don't like anything Yancey does.
You never have.
And that newspaper of his,
Wichita Wigwam.
Editorials about Indian's rights.
You might think Yancey was an Indian himself.
Who knows?
Some half-breeds are no darker.
- Don't you dare say that.
- I heard he killed a man.
I won't listen to you any longer.
I don't care about Yancey's past.
I married him because I loved him, and I'm going with him.
- Sabra.
- I never heard of such a thing.
Yancey, where's that iron skillet?
I can't find it anywhere.
- Right here, sugar, with the stove.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Cim, honey, get up off the ground.
It's too damp.
You know, I think we ought to get out that old rag rug... and put it down here for supper.
Right you are, honey.
I think Aunt Cassandra must have put the andirons in here, sugar.
- High rickety!
- Isaiah!
Please let me stay,
Master Yancey, Miss Sabra.
I'll help, I'll work, I'll do everything.
I'll help you in Oklahomy.
Please let me stay.
Well, you're here,
I reckon you can stay, Isaiah.
I hope you go to heaven when you die.
Let me do that cooking, Miss Sabra.
I'll fix them.
Yeah, you start right in by getting some wood.
- Now, scoot.
- I'm scooting.
There's loyalty, Sabra, that money can't buy.
We're going into new things, pet.
A new empire... and I want to help build it for you.
And we'll have just the prettiest little house we can find, too.
- With flowers and things.
- With flowers and trees... and morning glories growing all over.
It'll be our first real home, alone... and I want you to be happy all the way, sugar.
Our first real home... alone.
Hold that iron. Don't move.
I ain't aiming to check you through.
All I want is your ready money. Come on.
This is the first time I ever fronted your iron, Kid.
- Well, if it ain't Yancey. Howdy.
- Howdy.
- I'm sorry I disturbed you folks.
- This is my wife.
- Howdy, ma'am.
- My son's inside, asleep.
I'm heading for Osage, aiming to make it my home.
Osage, huh?
- Gonna start your newspaper there?
- Yeah.
Good.
- Got to be loping.
- Need you hurry away like this, Kid?
I got overdrawn at the bank at Red Fork and they're looking for me.
Luck to you.
- Stay away from Osage, will you, Kid?
- Sure thing.
Unless you send me an invite. Cut dirt!
It's a poser, honey. All this in six weeks right up from the raw prairie.
Next time you come here, Chief, you go through the roof.
He shot him.
Esteban Miro, a half-breed and a bad one.
I didn't think he had the brash.
Must have some friends around town.
Don't you worry, honey.
Look, sugar, they've named the streets already.
Pawhuska Avenue, that's an Indian name, son.
Paw-hu means hair and ska means white.
White hair.
Pawhuska was an old Osage chief.
- I'm an Indian, old White Hair.
- Cim.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Lots of watermelons there, Isaiah.
- Yes, sir. I sure glad I came to Oklahomy.
- Just a minute.
- I'll appeal to the highest court.
- You're a sooner.
- Don't you call me...
- Gentlemen.
Step right inside.
We'll determine the status of this case.
I don't let anybody call me a sooner.
- By the way, have you each $10 with you?
- Yes, we have.
Step right inside, men, and tell us all about it.
All right. I want to know who...
Plenty of law practice.
Three or four claimers for some of these lots.
Look, honey. Look, folks working late.
Plenty of good water...
Here you are. That's right.
Now, lady, what can I do for you?
There's Louis Hefner's emporium.
I saw old Louis stake that claim.
Furniture in an undertaking parlor?
They have plenty of combination stores out here until the town gets larger.
If you've a mind, you can fly out of there, Elmer.
Hold it there, partner.
Hold her, don't let her buck you down.
Get away from that weeping thing.
- Why don't you do something?
- I'm doing all I can, honey.
Old Elmer's been uncorking the red eye, I see.
Yancey, do get out of here so we can find a place to sleep.
I'm nearly dead and so is Cim.
I'm sorry, honey. I...
Say, where's the Bixby Hotel?
Left turn.
You just passed it on the other corner.
Honey, we passed right by it. Get along.
See you later, folks.
Giddyup. Come on here, boy.
I won't bring up my boy in a town like this.
I'm going back home.
Well, don't you think you better wait
until morning, honey?
You know, a good night's sleep... and things are gonna look entirely different.
I'll be back soon.
Louis Hefner, one of the town's leading merchants now, I gather.
- Hello, Yance. I'm glad to see you here.
- I'm glad to be here.
I trust the furniture end of the business is doing better than the other.
Yeah. Only been three killings so far... but we'll have to start a full jail pretty soon, I guess.
- You're gambling?
- No.
Just watching where the money goes.
Yancey! Yancey Cravat!
- Old Grat!
- Yes. Come this way.
Yancey Cravat.
Why, you old letch monger.
You are still wearing that white hat.
And you're still making lightning calculations.
- You know the boys.
- Most of them.
Esteban Miro.
So, you're Cravat, huh?
Yeah, and you?
Yountis, Lon Yountis.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Gents, what are you going to have?
This is on the house.
Brandy.
I'll have brandy.
- Are you going to start the newspaper?
- Yeah, Grat.
Yeah.
I understand the former editor here, a man named Paigler, died.
Was shot in the back, huh?
What are you aiming at?
Here you are, gents.
Have another one.
All right.
Mr. Cravat, I'd like to talk to you a minute, if you have time.
You see, I'm a printer and a darn good one.
And you see, I heard you were gonna open up a newspaper office called...
The Oklahoma Wigwam, see.
And I'd like to have...
Well, I'd like to go to work.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, Yance.
- Howdy, Bull.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Morning.
"...saffron-robed, arose from the ocean...
- "to bring light to gods and men."
- Ocean?
Yarns and laces, celluloid collars... knotting yarn, drawstrings, shoestrings, suspenders.
- Have you any fancy braids?
- Yes, ma'am, I have some fancy braids.
That's Sol Levy, a walking notion counter.
...suspenders, darning yarn, celluloid collars...
Howdy, Sol.
Howdy, Mr. Cravat. Howdy, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am, here's some drawstrings...
...fancy braid and I'll give you a real good bargain.
I never saw anything like it in my life.
I'm afraid they think my dress is a little too elaborate.
Why, Milton would have no words for such beauty.
Howdy, Cim.
He called you Cim.
- The boys are up to something.
- Who are they?
I can't say for sure, but I think they're the ones that did Paigler dirt.
Paigler? Who's that?
Isn't that the editor?
The one who was found shot dead?
- You mean they did it?
- I don't say they did it, exactly.
They know more than is comfortable.
Still wearing that white hat, huh?
Who's that?
That's Lon Yountis.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Don't be frightened, honey.
Stand right where you are.
The dirty scum.
Inside. Get out of here.
Half-circle cut.
You'll find that's the Cravat brand.
- Can't you take a joke, Yancey?
- Joke, nothing.
- Lf your missus wasn't with you.
- Don't you "missus" me... you dirty scum.
You're a lot of good for nothing louses, that's what you are.
Shooting at people in the street.
You leave my husband alone.
- I declare, I've a notion to...
- Honey. Sabra.
Why, it'll be all over the Southwest... that Yancey Cravat was hiding behind a woman's petticoat.
But you didn't. They can't say so.
You shot him very nicely in the ear, darling.
Well, you shouldn't interfere when men are having a little friendly shooting.
Friendly?
A bullet within an inch of your head?
He knew where it was going.
Well, come on, sugar.
I think we better find that house we're gonna live in, don't you?
Come on.
Down a little. A little more.
Now a little more. Hold!
Just nail it.
I'll bushwhack her.
- Well, honey, we're here.
- Yes, we're here.
We're getting started, too.
You know, when I think of those five years in Wichita...
- I thought you liked it in Wichita.
- A prison cell, my pet.
Five years in one place, that's the longest stretch I've ever done.
Five years.
Back and forth like a trail horse.
House, office, Venables, vegetables.
A little while, I'd have turned into either a Venable or a vegetable, one or the other.
Well.
We better get this office and print shop settled... if you're ever gonna get out an issue of that newspaper.
I guess Rickey can attend to it.
He's a printer and a darn good one.
I gotta see about these real-estate transfers... and write up some editorials and news... and we got a clue to the Paigler killer last night.
- I wanna follow it up.
- I wish you wouldn't.
If I can find out who killed Paigler...
I'm gonna print it in the first edition of the Oklahoma Wigwam.
Well, did you see the...
Well, we got the shingle hung out all right,
Mrs. Cravat.
- Look fine, Miss Sabra.
- Come on, now, colored boy.
We'd better pitch in and unsnarl things.
Never mind, Rickey.
I'll straighten this room.
- You go on into the print shop with Isaiah.
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, we'll unmantle the printing press... and dust off the adjectives.
Thank you.
Look, Mama, see what an Indian just gave me.
Cim, how many times have I told you not to talk to those dirty, filthy Indians?
Here, take this into the kitchen.
Be careful, now.
Don't drop it, and come back and help Mother.
All right, Mama.
Safety pins, collar buttons... needles, thread, thimbles, crochet cotton... celluloid collars, safety pins, crochet cotton, needles.
Here comes that little shrimp again.
Let's see how he feels today.
Hey, Sol! Come here!
I wanna buy a little fancy lace!
Come on over here. Come on.
...cotton, needles, thread...
Come on, Sol,
I wanna buy my gal a bustle.
- How much for a bustle cover?
- Bring me a pair of tights.
Safety pins, cotton gloves, needles.
Please, don't start, please.
Please don't, mister. Please don't.
Please, mister. Please, don't.
- Bring him here.
- Please. Please. Please don't.
- Well, howdy, Mr. Levy.
- Please don't do it, mister.
- Please, mister, don't...
- That's all right. That's all right.
- Let's you and me have a drink.
- No, thank you. No.
Please don't do it, mister.
I don't want any. Thanks.
- What? You don't want it?
- No.
Be a real pal and have a drink. Come on.
No.
- What do you think about...
- Where you going, there?
Where you going, there?
Come here, you little runt, and have a...
Come up here.
Please, mister.
Take a drink.
Please don't, mister. Please.
When I tell them to take a drink, they drink, don't they?
Well, they better.
You're a rough, eh, Yountis?
Just whip your weight on wildcats, huh?
Who asked you?
Come on, Sol. You're all right, huh? Sure.
That's their idea of a joke.
You go ahead about your business.
- They won't be bothering you none, now.
- Thanks, Mr. Cravat.
Thank you.
Threatening to make Osage the terror of the Southwest... as in the old days of the Cimarron, huh?
- Now, you as the editor...
- Yeah, me as editor...
I'm interviewing citizens of note regarding their sentiments.
- What's yours?
- Stick to your lawn.
Come on, Yountis. You know what I'm aiming at. Who killed Paigler?
I'm advising you to keep your mouth shut.
Or the next time, it won't be your sombrero.
Thanks for the sentiment. Mine is...
Cherokee death cry. Means, you or him.
The second button on his coat is about the spot for his wishbone... maybe a couple of inches higher.
Get your real-estate papers filed all right?
Yancey, dear.
You're not going to bother anymore about that Paigler man, are you?
Don't you be worrying your pretty head about that.
Oh, please. What does it matter?
He's dead.
Maybe he did shoot himself.
Besides, you've got Cim and me to think of.
Paigler was shot in the back trying to do what I want to do:
Make a model empire out of this new Oklahoma country.
No, sir, I'll show them first crack.
The Oklahoma Wigwam prints all the news, all the time... knowing no law except the law of God... and the government of these United States.
Say, that's a pretty good slogan.
Top of the page, just ahead of the editorial column.
Yancey, let them alone.
I don't want you to be killed.
- I don't.
- Honey...
I'm gonna clean up the Paigler killing, or I won't be alive myself.
You don't wanna lose me just yet, do you?
No, dearest.
There he is.
- Howdy.
- Howdy, ma'am.
Yancey, our womenfolk think it's about time... that some contact be established between the town and Providence.
There ain't a minister here, and we've come to ask you... to conduct divine service next Sunday.
Divine service?
- Why, sure. I'll be pleased to.
- Then that's settled.
- Fine.
- We'll have to arrange a place.
Well, let's see, there's Grat Gotch's.
- The gambling tent?
- It's the only place in town big enough.
That's right.
Yeah, I know Grat well. I'll speak to him.
Come along.
Back soon, honey.
Good morning, Mr. Cravat.
Do you feel nervous about your sermon, dear?
I'd rather plead to a Texas jury than preach to this gang of...
What's everybody laughing at?
How can you laugh?
- Isaiah.
- Can't you understand?
I didn't go to fret nobody.
You all dress up fine for a church's meeting... so I pleased to dress myself up
Sunday style.
That's right, Isaiah.
We take it as a personal compliment.
- Why, you look finer than any of us.
- I just fixed my twily like you all.
Say, Isaiah, would you like to have a real suit of Sunday clothes?
A Sunday suit for me to wear? For true?
I don't want you to go to that church meeting.
Oh, now, now. You don't understand.
Now, listen close.
I want you to do something important for me.
Now, the house is all alone, see.
I want you to go down there and keep watch... till we come home from that church meeting.
Patrol duty. That's what.
Patrol duty? Yes, sir, Master Yancey.
Now you take this and if anyone tries to break in, shoot.
- I'll kill them dead.
- Fine.
And then you get a new suit and boots, besides. Now, scoot.
Yes, sir. I'm scooting.
Do you think... Yancey, let's not go.
Tell them you're sick or I'm sick.
Tell them anything...
We're late, honey.
Hi, Yance. Hiya, preacher man.
Now, Preacher, where's your Bible?
Right here, boys.
Now no loafing in the entrance.
Either come in or stay out.
Did you see that man, Yountis?
He looked at you so...
That's fine, honey.
I always like to have the members of my flock right under my eye.
Quite a shindig, ain't it?
Some of these folks look as queer in church as a mule does in the front... parlor.
How do, Mrs. Cravat?
I'm Mrs. Tracy Wyatt.
How do you do?
It was so nice of your husband to conduct this service this morning.
About time the intellectual life of this community was stirred up a bit.
Yes.
I was a schoolteacher back East, that is in Cairo, Illinois.
- Indeed?
- Yes, indeed.
I can trace my ancestry right back to William Whipple... one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
Lands, yes.
Some pumpkins.
I'll say. Hey, Annie.
Come along, girls.
- Dixie Lee, just arrived in town.
- Dixie Lee?
Why, I thought you'd heard of her.
Why, she's a...
Right here, sister. Take my pew.
Get up, webfoot, and give the gals a seat.
Rest the velvet, lady.
Look out for them splinters.
Sit down. Take off your hat.
- Ain't she a huckleberry?
- Lollapalooza, field up, pert and chipper.
Those girls. Red Fork.
Excuse me, please.
Is it all right if I'm here?
You can stay here just as long as I do.
Thanks.
Fellow citizens...
I have been called upon to conduct this opening meeting... of the Osage first Methodist...
Episcopalian, Lutheran, Presbyterian,
Congregational, Baptist, Catholic...
Unitarian, Hebrew church.
During the course of my career as lawyer and editor...
I've been required to speak on various occasions on many subjects.
I've spoken in defense of my country and in criticism of it.
I've been called upon to defend and convict... horse thieves, harlots, and murderers.
And while I know my bible from cover to cover... and many of its passages are graven on my heart... this, fellow citizens, is the very first time... that I have ever been required to speak the word of God in His temple.
For any shelter, however humble or however sordid... no offense, Grat... becomes, when His word is spoken in it...
His temple.
Therefore, let us open this auspicious occasion by singing...
What do you know, boys, anyway, huh?
How about...
Who Are You At Home, for a starter?
Thanks, Rickey.
It's a good song, though a bit secular.
But you all know it. That's the main thing.
Here, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
While we are singing, we'll take up a collection.
What for?
Because, Pete, you infidel... part of a church service is in taking up a collection... and your donations, fellow citizens, ladies and gentlemen... and you, too, Pete... will be for the new church organ.
Great guns, Yancey.
We ain't even got a church.
Now, that's all right, Pete.
Once we buy an organ, it stands to reason we'd have to build a church to put it in... and, members of the congregation... anybody contributing less than two bits... will be thrown out of this tent by me.
Indians not included.
All right, Jesse, will you please favor us with a pitch?
Will the ladies please join in with their sweet soprano voices?
Now, once again, please.
Fellow citizens... the sum of the collection for the organ for the first Osage church... whose denomination shall be nameless, is a gratifying total... of $133 and 55 cents.
Wait a minute, Grat, did you say 55 cents? 55?
That's right, Yancey.
Some miserable, tightfisted, skinflint of a...
Well, maybe it is an Osage by mistake.
How about a Cherokee, Yancey?
Not a Cherokee, Sid.
I recognized your voice by the squeak.
If you knew anything at all, you and Yountis and the rest of your outfit... you'd realize that a Cherokee is too smart... to put anything in the contribution box of a race that's robbed him of his birthright.
Friends, we've come to the sermon.
Anyone wishing to leave, kindly do so now.
Please make way for all departing worshippers.
My text is from Proverbs.
"A lion is in the way.
There's a lion in the streets."
Friends, there's a lion in the streets of Osage.
I have a confession to make.
I have gone about seeking information of this lion.
I might say this jackal or dirty skunk... if it wouldn't be sacrilegious.
But this jackal in a lion's skin... who by threatening sudden death... has held this little town abjectly terrorized.
I intended to announce from this pulpit... this platform... that I would publish this knowledge... in the first issue of the Oklahoma Wigwam... coming off the press next Thursday, thereby starting my paper off with a bang.
Friends, and fellow citizens...
I repent of my greed... and my desire for self-advancement at the expense of this community.
I no longer intend to withhold the name of that yellow, skunking murderer... who shot down Jack Paigler when his back was turned.
I will tell you all now the name of that...
Was Lon Yountis.
Stay where you are.
Louis Hefner... as coroner, do your official duty and remove the body.
Okay, Yance.
It's self-defense and justifiable homicide.
This town needs a boot hill, and I'll start it with this burial.
Come on, boys.
Fellow citizens...
under the circumstances... we will forego this sermon... and conclude this service with a brief word of prayer.
Bless this community, O Lord.
Amen.
I swan... that's the most surprising church meeting
I ever attended.
But I must say, your husband did the proper thing.
The cleaning out of that gang is one of the first moves... to make this town fit to live in.
Thanks to you, Yancey.
- Horrible, he might've...
- But he didn't, honey.
Everything's all right.
- Did you have to kill him like that?
- No, I could've let him kill me.
Congratulations, Mr. Cravat.
Haven't seen you since the run.
Well, how do you do Miss...
Lee?
No wonder.
- I heard you were in town.
- You've known.
Yes, I'm here.
Thought you'd settle down on that quarter section that I didn't get.
Well, I tried to be a farmer, but I had to give up the land.
The neighbors' wives formed a vigilance committee, and I left by request.
A vigilance committee would.
You haven't said a word all the way home, pet.
What's stirring you?
That woman, smirking and smiling.
And you stood there actually talking to her, holding her hand... after she'd stolen your land in the run, too.
She wanted that land because she was trying to give up her way of living...
- was desperate.
- Well, what's she doing here, then?
Driven out by the neighbors... she heard the railroad was coming through and came down here.
You talk as though you know a lot about her.
A little. Comes from a good family, victim of circumstances.
Well, in a way, she's a good girl.
A good girl?
I know a lot of people scattered over Oklahoma... that shouldn't cast a stone at her.
Don't you quote your Bibles and Magdalenes at me, Yancey Cravat!
- Hello, Bill.
- Well, well, well.
First anniversary numbers.
Say, you've been meaning to pull some blood for a year. Why don't you subscribe?
Well, it cost $1.
Cravat could use that dollar to buy the new baby a rattle.
And a pair of rubber boots till the streets get paved.
You sure need rubber boots here, or go barefoot.
I got to get a pair of new boots...
Darling, she's awake.
Hello, baby Donna. Hello, sweetheart.
Look, this is Daddy.
This is Mama, much more important to you just now.
Yancey, darling, I'm so happy.
I'm highfaluting myself, sugar, smiling as a basket of chips.
I'm gonna do so many things.
Build a porch for Donna.
Start a woman's club, a real one.
Make this town better for Donna to live in.
No saloons. No women like Dixie Lee.
And I'm gonna have a hired girl as soon as the newspaper...
Yeah, all those things, sugar, but you mustn't try too much.
The garden looks fine, Miss Sabra, and them morning glories sure is climbing.
Thank you, Isaiah.
Hi, there.
Look, she know me.
Who you rolling your eyes at and making faces?
Just wait until you get a little more bigger.
I've got a lot of things
I is gonna teach you.
May I come in? I brought you some of the nicest chicken broth, made it myself.
"Here we are, born to be kings"
"We're the princes of the universe"
"I am immortal"
"I have inside me blood of kings"
"I have no rival, no man can be my equal"

Hey General, want a ride?
Suck jerk naïve!
That's a breach of contract,
A breach of visual contract, moron!
They've no respect for their Country or their flag, or medals or anybody!
I'm gonna put you on report, that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna put you on report with the Department of Transportation.
Hello! Hello!
Department of Transportation? Hello!
Sunspots!
Is there anything more beautiful?
I'm sitting next to her.
I love you.
- A little music?
- Fine.
- That's terrible.
- You've no taste.
This wing... I'll look like a mess.
- You look fine.
- No!
- Will you leave that alone?
- No, leave it!
- Oh, come on.
- Ah!
Wow.
It's nice to be in the Country.
City streets got bums on every corner, pushin', shovin', hustlin'...
There's no competition out there.
We should do this more often.
- Get lost?
- We're not lost.
Why is it a man will never admit he's lost?
We passed half a dozen stations and you wouldn't pull to one of them for directions.
But what does the map say?
The map isn't saying anything.
Wait a minute.
The cabin's a mile south of Steepston?
Yeah, that's what Lucas said.
You won't believe this.
We're almost there!
- The cabin should be over...
- Just around the corner, yeah, I know.
Go on.
Let's walk.
It's beautiful.
How long has your friend lived here?
Lucas? About... no long.
Well, which for you could mean half a century.
It’s more like 12 years.
After all that time, why does he suddenly want to see you?
I don't know... he...
He said something was worrying him.
Mac!
Mac!
He's dead.
Your friend?
How can you be so sure?
I just know.
What would we have here?
What you do, boy?
Oh no...
I didn't have nothing to do with this.
Body on floor...
You standing over him with a sword in hand...
Looks like your guilty as hell to me, boy.
You all right, son?
- What's your name?
- Leo.
Leo Atkins.
I have never seen you before.
You from around here?
No. I'm from...
I'm from nowhere in particular.
I'm real pleased to meet you, Leo.
Let me tell you where you're going.
You're gonna ride the lightning.
You killed a man.
And you're gonna fry.
- Sorry Mac.
- Are we bored?
No, we're not bored.
Actually, I was looking at this book of drawings, Da Vinci.
This dude was making flying machines when you were in diapers.
The thing is, if he can design gliders and stuff, why didn't he get our butts airborne back then?
'Cause he was hired to make gunpowder, instead.
- You finished those invoices yet?
- Ah... no.
No? Why not?
- I've been busy.
- Yeah, you being busy?
Yeah! I've been busy!
You know, I thing you got a little bit too much time on your hands.
- You need to spend a little time in jail.
- Jail! Why? For... assault with a paper airplane?
For littering your office? What!
- I'll tell you on the way to Steepston.
- Steepston?
That's a place that doesn't even have crosswalks.
- Why would we want to go to Steepston?
- What's this about Steepston?
- Because you're driving.
- The T-Bird?
- Bring it around the front, would you?
- Good, I'll get my jacket.
I need to talk to the guy they're holding for murdering Lucas.
Ok, I'll close up the shop and I'll come with you.
No, I need to do this on my own.
But you are taking Richie...
Well, I need him for something.
I know why you don't want me there.
You're afraid that what happened to Lucas could happen to you.
That never crossed my mind.
- Then, stay here!
- Tessa... they may have the wrong man.
I can't let him just... stew in jail.
I'll be back.
Smile!
- Promise?
- Scout's honor. Here.
The police blotter mentioned a report of a... just tell me if I got this all wrong... a sword fight on these premises?
This is Chinese.
You got it wrong.
So, what did happen?
We caught a young burglar.
The boy, who has a vivid imagination... was trying to steal a sword.
- No sword fight.
- No.
You've heard about the headless body they found up North?
Of course, who hasn't?
I just thought there might be a connection.
Why?
Because the victim had a big sword next to his body when they found him.
Sounds like a great story.
Good luck with it.
Yeah, well, thanks.
I guess you know a lot about swords.
You're so good at fencing.
I might have to come back for your expert opinion.
My expert's opinion is that you're wasting your time.
Yeah? Well, thanks.
I'm sure with your help, this will be a dynamite story.
I'm Sergeant Powell.
I talked to you this morning.
Sergeant Powell,
I'm Howard Crowley.
Come on in.
So, our little horror story brought you here.
Coffee?
Yeah, we got one of those ourselves:
We got a headless body on a city bridge a while back.
I know that, Sergeant.
We do get TV reception, even way up here.
Sorry.
I was going to call you anyway to compare notes.
We got no suspects, no witnesses.
Ours was done with a very sharp instrument.
So it probably wasn't an ax, or a chainsaw or...
What it was, probably, was a sword, right?
You're guessing or you've got something?
We've got a sword.
I'd run it into our lab to check the theory... if we had a lab.
Planned to send it to the county seat this afternoon.
I'd be happy to help with the interrogation if you're interested.
I think that can be arranged.
I suppose you like to see the crime scene first.
If I could.
Who was the victim?
A man named Desiree,
Lucas Desiree.
- He kept pretty much to himself.
- French?
Old southern stock.
Funny, him coming all the way up here to live.
His kinfolk probably owned a lot of your kinfolk... once upon a time.
So we like go to cabin sift through the place for clues the police missed?
No, they probably didn't miss anything.
I still don't get what would posses Lucas to move out in the middle of nowhere.
He just wanted get away, be on his own.
Like you did?
Out in the country, you can't take your mistress into the woods... for a quickie without twenty people knowing about it.
Lucas was very careful.
He didn't advertise his whereabouts.
And you don't think it's this bum that the papers are talking about, who did it?
Maybe. Maybe not.
I need to get close enough to be sure.
Wait a minute, Sherlock... are you trying to tell me there is a loose Immortal cruising around here... chopping off people's heads... in this vicinity, where you and I are going?
Possibly. We'll find out.
Oh, man!
You're trying my patience, Leo.
You talk but you don't say anything.
- I'm trying.
- Tell me again.
I don't know nothing I didn't know five minutes ago.
You do that pretty well, Leo.
"Crazy old Leo, wouldn't harm a flea"
That's what that man in the cabin thought.
Then you took off his head!
I never took no heads!
Oh, I knew a guy who took heads.
He put it on the end of his bayonet.
Yeah, you knew our guy.
And I bet you knew him real well.
Old habits die hard, don't they Leo?
You think you're back in Nam, collecting trophies off the VC!?
Is that what we got going here?
It's okay, Leo.
You can tell me.
See, I was there too.
I understand.
- You were there?
- Bet your ass.
- Two tours. Airborne. What about you?
- Dog soldier.
I hate the jungle. Snakes.
I hate snakes.
And tunnels, I hate tunnels.
What about cabins, Leo. You like cabins?
Cabins?
You were there, Leo.
In the cabin, with the sword.
Oh, yeah, I was.
- I remember that.
- Yeah, but not everything!
You see, that's why we're here, Leo.
We're trying to help you remember!
Oh yeah, 'cause you were there: in Nam.
Yes, and that's what you thought too, didn't you?
You were out there on patrol, weren't you, Leo?
- That's right.
- And you came to the cabin.
- Cabin?
- And you went inside with the sword.
- I don't remember no swords in Nam.
- But you just said you did!
Hey look, you got to keep it straight, Leo!
I'm trying to help you here!
You're out there on patrol.
You had your sword.
And all of the sudden he was there.
Charlie, the VC.
Yeah, I could smell him.
He was that close.
And you were scared.
Peeing in my pants.
He was so close, I could reach out and touch him in the darkness!
And you were so scared, you took your sword and you swung away.
You killed him.
It was "him or you".
I know how it is, Leo.
That's right. Him or me!
Him or me.
Him or me.
Him or me.
Him or me!
That's right. Him or me.
Yeah, him or me!
Yeah!
I don't see a stop light.
I don't even see a stop sign.
Maybe that's why Lucas came here.
To do what?
Play bingo and pitch horse shoes?
To live.
To not turn every corner expecting to meet out destiny.
Sounds like a simple thing to do.
To love, hate, drink and dream... about going someplace else.
Someplace better.
We are a little philosophical today, Mac?
Lucas just wanted to get away, try to retire for the Game.
Like you, before the Gathering.
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
One of your guys is out head-hunting. He finds Lucas...
So you come out here hoping this same guy comes looking for you, am I right?
Maybe.
- Why do you owe good old Lucas, anyway?
- It's a long story.
Now you know what to do, go and do it.
I could smell him.
I could hear him breathing.
And the sergeant said:
"Leo, take the point!"
And I took it.
Down on my belly like a damn snake... until I ran right into Charlie!
I couldn't see him in the dark!
But I tried to tell him...
"Don't do this. Slip away, man!"
"We're both gonna die today!"
But he shot me!
He shot me here on my face!
Leo, come back, man.
Come back!
¡And then everybody was there!
¡Sergeant, Jerry and Al!
They were firing tracers, like the fourth of July, like a fountain of fire, like a helo!
And then... then... and then the chopter came, and it lifted me out.
I saw it all.
I though I was asleep.
Later... later... they told me that a bullet went in my brain and made me crazy.
But that ain't so.
I saw it all.
I know what happened.
I so do you. Cause you were there.
- Take it easy...
- You told me you were there!
Take it easy now, soldier.
Take it slow.
Yes, sir.
Like a...
Like a fiery fountain on the Fourth of July, you know?
Ok, Leo. Sit here.
It's not him.
Come on, I could've been in New Mexico in fact by now.
Are you doin' what I think you're doing?
Hi Officer... doing what?
Give me that.
Down here.
This man needs water!
- Hush up, spy!
- He's dying of thirst!
He'll die of more than that if you don't hush up.
Soldier! At ease!
What seems to be the problem here, corporal?
This'n there Captain, nobody but a troublemaker and low down abolitionist.
Came in and stole folks niggers right off the plantations.
They caught him without a uniform behind our lines.
They's gonna hang him today.
He's wearing a uniform now.
And he will be treated with respect.
Give these men water, and rations.
- But the colonel, he said...
- Now, soldier!
Yes, sir!
By whose orders, sir?
Captain Lucas Desiree.
- I've been here for an hour.
- Reflecting on your sins?
Right, give me out here!
Come on Ryan, I'll process you out.
Leo.
You are my lawyer?
You don't look like no damn lawyer.
I'm a friend of the man they say you murdered.
I have murdered nobody.
When I came upon him on the cabin he was already hacked to pieces!
Like a broken toy soldier.
- Did you see anyone else?
- No.
Only the lightning.
The lightning of his terrible...!
Shut up!
Anything else?
The sword.
Looked like something from "Gone with the Wind".
- I'm gonna get you out of here, Leo.
- You and what Army?
Just trust me.
You're a hoot, friend.
Last person said that to me stole my shoes while I was asleep.
- Time before that...
- Hey, you!
- I'll be seeing you, Leo.
- I won't bet on that.
You are a reporter, right?
That "stolen car bull" was just so you could talk to our prisoner.
No, I'm a friend of Lucas Desiree's.
Was anyone else in town asking about him before his death?
I think we would have noticed.
Would have been hard not to.
Or maybe a stranger passing through.
Only stranger passing through was the one we caught.
You caught him?
Nope. Sheriff Crowley.
Aha.
How?
What do you mean, how?
- He didn't just passed by Lucas' place?
- Never said he did.
Fact is, half a dozen folks who live up in the Valley... saw some kind of lightning or electrical explosion or something about the same time.
- And that brought the Sheriff?
- Yeah.
Around these parts we don't get too much lightning in a clear blue sky.
What do they think caused it?
Electrical Company can't say for sure.
Some kind of surge in a transformer, maybe.
Anyway, like you said that's probably what brought the sheriff.
You weren't with him.
You are a reporter.
Why don't you just say so, like everyone else?
- Somebody else was asking questions?
- Yes.
But she was a lot prettier than you.
SAVE THE LOGGERS.
SHOOT AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.
So you found out for sure that old Leo isn't an Immortal.
What do you guys got, anyway?
A secret handshake?
- A tattoo.
- Really? Where?
We know how to handle some psycho killer up here.
- How's that, Bob?
- Well, I'll tell you what we wouldn't do.
We wouldn't like some environmentalist sensitive public defender... get him off on an insanity plea because he had too much sugar in his diet.
Could I get an orange juice and a Coke, please?
- Yeah.
- Isn’t that right, friend?
You look like you would know.
You look like you've got too much time on your hands.
You know what I bet we got here...
I bet we got another bird watcher.
Another Spotted Owl lover come up here to save the environment.
Put a lot of good men outta work.
Give it a rest.
I'll tell you something: You know, one of us will be happy to hire out as a guide.
We'll take you right back into the forest right to them damned spotted owls,
Won't be boys?
Yeah.
Somebody starts playing a banjo,
I'm outta here.
What's that?
It's a... nice hat.
My favorite team.
What do you want, tourist?
Just something to eat.
I'm sorry if the mill closed, or the wells dried up, or the grasshoppers ate your crop or your life isn't what you hoped it to be.
But I'm a friend of Lucas Desiree's and we're just here to find out how he died.
Now, don't you feel even more stupid than usual, Bob?
What the hell are you lookin' at?
See you, Bob.
We're all real sorry about what happened, honey.
Doesn't make a bit of sense.
Everybody liked him.
He kept to himself and was polite to a fault.
You knew him?
Oh no, nobody really knew him.
He came in here for food and supplies.
He was a real gentleman.
Yes, he was.
Don't you ever get hungry?
Thanks. What's the special?
Nothing's ever special here.
Try the meat loaf.
No, I'll try number four.
And I would like the... cheeseburger, but with processed cheese and sweet pickles on the side.
Tomato, lettuce, onion, ketchup, mustard...
Look, how many ways can I say "No Comment" before I bore you, Ms. McFarland?
Look, no microphone, no hidden camera.
Just on background, sergeant.
Look, this is the early stage of our investigation and we...
Aha! So you're investigating the beheading in the city a while back.
I mean, why else would you come clear up to the boonies?
Steepston isn't the boonies,
Ms. McFarland.
It's the sticks... right before the boonies.
- Any leads on the suspect?
- No...
...comment, I know. And I understand and
I appreciate your need for discretion.
So, if everything I've just suggested is true just say "no comment". I'll understand.
Look, I may be taking a suspect back with me for a psychiatric evaluation.
Check back then,
I'll give you whatever I can.
You're on my Christmas list, Powell.
Isn't that nice?
...extra mayo and not that light stuff.
Only the real stuff. I you got only the light stuff, forget about it.
And I would like that well-done with... onions rings and French fries on the side.
You know something? I'm gonna spurt, actually. Make that a double.
Salad and cheeseburger.
- He'd just know that's what I want, right?
- Oh, yeah.
Did he have any friends here in Steepston?
He got along with the old sheriff real good.
Used to play chess every...
Friday night right over that table.
Really?
With Sheriff Crowley?
Oh no, old Nate Perkins.
He retired and moved to Florida a few years back.
Since then, Lucas kept pretty much to himself. Hardly ever saw him.
I guess Sheriff Crowley wasn't much for chess.
Who knows. There's another one who keeps to himself.
Get's along well enough with the likes of LeMoyne, but he's a loner.
Well respected though.
Nobody messes with the sheriff.
Not even Lucas?
Lucas? I don't think I ever saw the two of them together in the same room.
I got the feeling they wanted it that way.
I still don't understand why you changed your mind. I though you wanted help.
I naturally assumed that a big city force... would do a better job conducting an interrogation.
You fell for his "crazy Leo" act like a catfish to a stinkbait.
Let's let a psychiatrist decide that.
In my professional opinion,
Leo didn't behead anybody.
And our lab found no trace of the victim's blood, not even microscopic particles on the sword you recovered from the cabin.
Maybe there was another weapon.
You said you showed up on the scene moments later.
What'd Leo do with the other sword, swallow it?
Now look, he is what he says he is:
A guy who staggered into the wrong place at the wrong time.
I'm afraid that won't wash with the good people of Steepston County.
I've got a valid psychiatric warrant for him.
You tell the good people of Steepston it's out of your jurisdiction.
Not until you're over the County line.
You know what route to take, ah?
Look, I don't need his help.
He's gonna show you a back way out of the county.
I don't need any trouble on my watch.
- Okay, let's go.
- You're not taking your car?
Not, I think I'll ride with Leo.
See, I'm such a city fella, I might just get lost on these back roads.
I'll send somebody back for my car.
You do that.
No bother at all.
Diner? Speak up.
Who?
Tommy Riley, it's for you.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
He mumbled so bad
I couldn't understand him.
Hello?
- So, you ok?
- Yup, thanks.
Tommy, you intend to pay for these?
Put it on my tab.
Yeah, yeah.
Put it on the tab.
By the way, they're taking the guy they say killed your friend... down south for a psychiatric evaluation.
Sounds fair, Gwenn.
Yeah, if somebody doesn't hang him first.
I'm Duncan MacLeod, of the clan MacLeod.
Thanks.
Good thing they buried you way out here.
Not too crowded.
If I hadn't happened by today, you could have stayed under there for quite a spell.
Some would think this was a good time to take my head, Lucas.
Some would, I expect.
It was hard hanging you, even knowing what I knew.
- The others seemed to enjoy it.
- You stole their slaves.
You're destroying their way of life.
Revenge is all they have left.
You follow that road North to your lines.
I just might follow it myself, one day.
You're on the wrong side, you know that, Lucas.
Oh, we just get attached to the people, don't we?
Lot of good folks down here.
Friends.
Loyalty is a real funny thing.
Probably causes as much harm as does good.
Yes sir...
I think I'll up and follow that road North one day.
I'll look forward to that.
Be dark soon.
You'd best be going now.
So, he says: shut up, they're coming closer!
Easy boys.
- I don't believe we've met.
- I know who you are.
If you're here for the hunting, the season's just opened.
He claims to be a friend of Lucas Desiree, Sheriff.
- Is that a fact?
- That's a fact.
We heard that big city detective is taking the bum back with him.
Wish I could tell you different, Bob.
City folks just don't see things as clear as you and I.
Makes a man lose hope.
To an outsider it might seem like you want these men to do something about it.
Do? Have I asked you boys to do anything?
I'm just informing the most concern citizens.
We do appreciate that, Sheriff.
We just might voice our concern.
That's very civic minded of you.
Let's go, boys.
Well, got to run.
I suppose I'll be seeing you again.
Your friend Lucas died on his knees begging for his life.
We'll see how you do.
- Looks like we missed them.
- What do we do now?
I though we were jamming.
Nobody's told them Leo is gone.
So they got a bad tip.
Is she your type?
- Definitely.
- Good.
- Can I help you with something?
- No, no, no.
Just thought you might be here to interview that bum, Leo Atkins.
- Yes, so...
- I don't know...
He might not make it out of Steepston County.
You got a police scanner, right?
- Let's go find 'em.
- Let's go.
What's this?
Looks like somebody broke down.
Hey, don't go out there.
Hey, around these parts we like try and help out.
Struthers, get back in here!
That's enough!
We don't want to hurt you, officer. Just give us the psycho and we'll be on our way.
That's not going to happen.
Get back in your trucks and go.
Now!
You're not in the big city now, detective.
What're you gonna do, call for backup?
Now, this is the last time
I'm gonna ask nice.
You did your job. Now give him up.
Come on, all we want is the guy.
We'll let you go.
Just give him to us, right?
Is this a breaking story, or what?
- Roll tape, Frank.
- You looking to die, friend.
Put that camera down!
I said put it down!
Macleod.
Go ahead, shoot him.
Shoot her, shoot the boy, the officer or me. That's your idea of justice, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Go home!
All of you!
Crawl back under the rocks you came from.
It's over!
Let's go, boys.
And take this disgrace to the badge with you!
What in the hell are you doing here?
I think some people want to talk to you.
...here with Sergeant Powell, who has just stood off a mob... of masked men intent on taking the law into their own hands.
You've a statement,
Sergeant Powell?
Later.
Hey, hey. Hey. You owe me, Powell.
Or didn't you notice?
I suspect collusion by the local authorities... in the attempted abduction of Leo Atkins.
They clearly made an attempt to violate due process... and the suspects civil rights.
I'll be asking the FBI to look into this.
Thank you, Sergeant Powell.
You really were there.
You were there.
Going home, Leo.
The other hero of this amazing encounter... is a mysterious man...
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know.
You couldn't let him live in peace.
That's all he wanted.
Wasn't very ambitious, was he?
Why Leo?
People in a small town like to talk.
If they don't get a fix on who did what, they keep picking at it like a scab.
Eventually, they would have figured it out.
People aren't as dumb as we wish they were.
I was starting to like it here.
Now I'll have to move on.
But you're staying here.
I guess one of us is.
In the future...
I'll remember to leave your friends in peace.
What future?
I guess I've got all I need for now.
- You might get called as a witness.
- I'm sure.
Did they ever find that sheriff?
Disappeared off the face of the Earth.
- The FBI will find him.
- What about Leo?
He's out in the car.
I'm taking him to the Bus station.
Excuse me,
I don't mean to bother you folks, but I seen the sign out front,
I was wondering if you bought old medals and such.
I'm a little short.
- That's yours?
- That's right.
I figure I can sell it if I want to.
Well, I don't think
I can buy it from you, Leo.
But I might be able to... lend you something against it until you come back this way.
Deal.
This antique business is a going concern.
I should've got rid of that long time ago.
Don't do not good to hang on to the past.
More that one day in a man's lifetime.
Well, I got a bus to catch.
I'll give you a ride to the Station.
- Take care, Leo
- Bye.
Bye, Leo.
Thank you.
You think they're going to find the sheriff?
Eventually.
What about Lucas?
I took care of him.

Once upon a time in Storybook Land
Old King Cole sent out
a royal command
Calling his subjects
to the castle hall
Everyone's invited to the royal ball
The storybook opens
Hear the trumpets call
Here's the piper man from Hamelin
Play your pipe, play your pipe
And bring the storybook folk tonight
Call them all to join the party
Little Boy Blue will be there too
And toot a wicked horn
He rehearses every day
Here's the crooked house
The crooked man
The crooked cat, the crooked mouse
They go together
Here's Old Mother Hubbard
Dancing from her cupboard
Everyone's invited
The kids are all excited
The kids are all excited
They're on their way to laugh and play
At King Cole's court
Oh, welcome, dear little friends
To my annual jamboree
We'll sing and we'll eat
And jiggle our feet
To the tunes of our fiddlers three
But when the hour of midnight comes
Home to your books you must go
So strike up the music
And on with the show
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Silverbells, cockleshells
Cutest little chorus girls
In King Cole's show
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater
Had a wife and couldn't keep her
Old Jack Sprat's
little wife, so chubby
Dances with her skinny hubby
Goosey Gander shakes a leg
Humpty Dumpty, what an egg
Simple Simon on a spree
He's as simple as can be
Three little kittens, ooh
Here with their mittens, ooh
They never hurry, they never worry
Dancing together, light as a feather
Three blind mice
Sniffing around
Three blind mice
See what they found
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
One little, two little,
three little Indians
Four little, five little,
six little Indians
Seven little, eight little,
nine little Indians
Ten little Indian boys
We're Hickory, Dickory, Dock
It's midnight, 12:00
Your fun is done, you better run
Hickory, Dickory, Dock
Good night, my friends of Story Land
Goodbye, good luck, good night
The storybook closes
One and all
We hail this jolly soul
Long live His Merry Majesty
Old King Cole
Old King Cole
Whoa!
Mush!
Now beat it!
All right, I'll leave, if that's the way you feel about it.
But I'll leave like a gentleman.
Quiet, everybody! Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
You're about to take your last look at
Mr. Thornton's handsome, smiling face.
So make the most of it, you weasels!
But, as a last insane gesture...
Mr. Thornton wants you all to step up to the bar and have a drink with him!
Quiet!
Are you ready? Let's go!
To the bar, everybody!
There you are!
Hiya, Tex.
Hiya, dude. The boys're telling me you're going home.
Yep. Catching tomorrow's boat.
Well, there's no use in wishing you luck. I guess you've had plenty.
Give me Michigan Avenue on a hot afternoon... and you can have all the yellow dust this side of Seattle.
I guess we all feel the same way, kid.
It seems that all the homesick guys in the world came up here.
- Put this away for me. It's wearing me down.
- Sure thing.
- Ah, they been kinda running against you. - Yeah- Oh, thanks.
Give us a couple more stacks. Here's where
I'm apt to earn my fare back to Seattle.
There you are.
Did I say Seattle?
You'd better quit while you still have the price of a pick and shovel, dude.
What's the matter? You want your grave dug? Give us some action! I'm buying!
Well, the hot seat went cold, eh?
Better luck next time, dude.
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
Well, so long, fellas.
- So long.
- So long, dude.
Russ, my stomach wants to know how my credit is.
Well, if your stomach's as good as your credit, you'll live to be 100.
Thanks. Did I ever tell you about my grandpa? Died when he was 106.
- What interrupted his youth?
- He quit drinking.
So they cleaned you out, eh?
- That's tough.
- Ah, there's a lot more where that came from.
What's the matter, Mr. Thornton? Ain't you speakin' to your pals since you got rich?
Well, hello, Shorty! How are ya?
- Have a stimulant.
- Thanks.
- When'd you get out?
- This afternoon.
These bastilles up here ain't as cozy as them stirs down in little ol' New York.
The finest jailhouse I ever seen was the Coney Island precinct.
- They sent you up for opening the mails, didn't they?
- Shh! Shh!
That was a miscarriage of justice.
Listen-Ah!
All I did on that mail route was peek in a couple of those bill o' dues.
It gets darned lonesome on the trail there.
I was as innocent-like as if I was sittin' in the New York Public Library.
Letters are supposed to be private, even up here.
Well, if I wasn't honest trying to seal it up, I wouldn't have got caught.
- That's too bad.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- That letter I opened was very interesting.
- Yeah?
Yeah. If you'd have saved a bit of your bankroll, I'd have cut you in on somethin'.
- Oh. More mail?
- Yes and no.
That letter I opened was worth about a million bucks.
Thanks very much for the snort-ola.
Ah! See ya around sometime.
Hey, Shorty! Shorty! Wait a minute.
Let me hear a little more about that pipe dream of yours.
Pipe dream is right.
I been dreamin' about this for six months up in that cold Arctic can.
- Yeah? What do you need a bankroll for? - Well, I-
Hey, youse guys! Get outta here!
23 skiddoo!
Boo!
I need a bankroll to grubstake us as far as Dawson City... and then a long way beyond that.
- Yeah? That sounds interesting.
- You know somethin'?
When they caught me opening those letters... and the judge presented me with six months- or, as the English jockeys say, a dozen fortnights- well, that judge asked me a lot of silly questions, like how many letters I'd jimmied... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
- But there's one question he didn't ask me.
- Yeah?
He didn't ask me what was in that letter.
- Say, is your credit still good in there?
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- Come on. Let's go and exhaust it.
- Okay.
His name was Blake. Martin Blake.
He had red whiskers and, well, he was a little blind.
Oh, yeah, I remember. He was cracked.
- Told everybody he'd found a rich lode.
- That's the guy.
Well, he got sick on the trail. He was coming to Dawson City to file his claim.
He wrote a letter to his son,
John Blake, in San Francisco.
He had a note on the envelope
- said if anything happened to him... the letter should be mailed.
Well, his number was up, so the letter was mailed.
And you looked inside to be sure everything was neat and in order.
Mmm. But there wasn't much of a letter.
It was mostly a map.
You made a copy?
As I'm coming to the backstretch with a pencil,
I feel the long arm of John Law on my shoulder.
- Did they take the copy away from you?
- No.
- Then you still have it?
- No again.
Well, what'd you do with it?
I et it.
When that map started to digest though, see, it sorta went to my head.
Went to my brain.
So, while I'm sitting up there in the booby hatch...
I made a copy of it from memory.
Take off my boot.
Well, I'll show you. I got a good memory too.
Course, there's a couple of things here I don't quite figure out.
Now, you see...
I don't know if this is a mountain or a river.
And I think they said there was rapids here.
But I don't see how that could be, because I don't remember no river up there.
Hey, listen, little man, the graveyards up here is full of gold hopheads... guys that smoked a pipeful of hope... had glittering yellow dreams and ended up under a pile of rocks in frozen ground.
Me, I'll take bourbon.
Kills you slower, but a lot more pleasant-like.
Now, wait a minute, Mr. Thornton.
Something mighty strange happened today.
- Something mighty strange.
- Yeah?
Sit down.
I'm standin' out in front of the Palace Hotel, see.
Not doin' nothin', because, well, you know, a fella just out of the can and broke... just lookin' and standin' is about the limit of your activities.
- Yeah.
- Well, it was a good idea, see.
- 'Cause things started happenin'.
- Yeah?
Out of this hotel comes the most beautiful skirt that you ever put your peepers on.
And following her is a dignified-lookin' guy-
I'd say 46 autumns.
And him and her get in the sled and they go off, headed for Dawson City.
- Thanks for the society note.
- Yeah, but wait.
I get excited, see, I run into the hotel and take a look at the ledger.
You know the names of these two interesting people?
Mr. and Mrs. John
Blake of San Francisco.
Old man Blake's son?
I hope, in my subtle way,
I've made myself clear.
You have.
Look, if I get the money for an outfit, how do we split?
Even-steven.
Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Listen, they got a day's lead on us.
- It's only a gamble.
- That's what I like about it.
Hot-
What's the matter with this fido?
Sorry, Jack, but that one's taken.
Belongs to a team I sold yesterday.
I'll tell you what. I got a big fella
I'll give you for practically nothin'.
Fifty bucks!
What's the matter with him?
- He ain't broke yet, and I don't think he's gonna be.
- Oh. Tough, huh?
St. Bernard. He's all animal, Joe.
- He's on a hunger strike.
- Won't eat anything?
Nothin' but your hand or your foot, or points north.
- He looks like he was stolen from some joint in the States.
I never ask a dog no questions.
- Blue ribbons don't mean nothin' to a pooch up here.
- How'd you like to see me make this guy eat?
- All right by me.
- I ain't got nothin' to do all winter.
- Get some grub.
- Frank, dinner for one!
- Unharness Little Boy Blue. Put him right there.
- Dinner for one.
- Okay. Let him out.
- I hope you know what you're doin'.
- I hope so too!
All right, let go of him.
All right, pull your dog out!
Don't let your dog get this piece.
He'll eat regular from now on.
I wish I had time to break him. He'd make a great dog.
- All right, Frank, put him back.
- I'll do it. Here.
Which one of you is Mr. Groggins?
Well, speak up. Is Mr. Groggins here?
My name is Smith.
Are the outfit and provisions ready that were ordered in my name?
Well, why don't you answer me,
Groggins? You speak English, don't you?
Uh, y-yes, sir. H-
Here's your whole outfit.
- Tenderfoot, huh?
- Not as tender as he looks.
If I'm not too inquisitive, will six dogs be enough?
- They'll pull the load, all right.
- With me on it?
Well, I don't know about that.
You don't look like a man who knows much about anything, Mr. Groggins.
Well, I do know... that people come up here don't usually make a buggy ride out of it.
They walk or run with the dogs, sometimes break trail.
You sure will need more dogs if you're gonna ride that sled.
And more dog food.
And a needle and thread.
What for, my intelligent friend?
To sew up the guys that's gonna split their sides laughin' at ya!
Once in a while people do laugh at me.
But very briefly.
Well, sir, dogs! Dogs!
Uh, bring Flip and Frowsy.
Say, Joe, why don't you show the honorable Mr. Smith this beautiful animal?
I don't think so. He's too savage.
Is that so? Well, just let him out.
- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith.
- Let him out, I said.
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.
I don't like to take the responsibility, Mr. Smith.
That's why you'll never amount to much.
What are you asking for him?
Uh, 250 bucks.
Sold. Let him out.
So your name's Buck, eh?
You're tough, huh?
Hey, wait a minute. That dog cost me a lot of money.
- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins.
- Wait a minute.
That dog belongs to me.
I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot.
That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself.
That's all right. I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
Just as you say, my good man.
Just as you say.
Well, what others have you?
- Uh, here. Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle. Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on. Out.
Come on. Come on. Come on, Harmon.
Here ya are, Mr. Smith.
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting. Mush!
Been a great pleasure, gentlemen.
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
Well, I don't like to see a dog killed either.
But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks.
All right, I told you
I'm buying him, and I am.
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
- Quiet, quiet.
Whose money is this?
Listen, you, you're my dog, and I'm your boss.
The sooner you learn that, the easier it's going to be for both of us.
Come on.! Mush.! Mush.!
Ho! Ho!
Right there!
Hey!
Go on! Get back there! What'd you bring this baboon along for?
- That big guy don't like him.!
- That's just too bad! He'll learn to like him!
- Come on! Let's go! Mush! Mush!
- Get your teeth out of him.!
Come on! Get up there!
Come on, gray boy!
Come on, Buck.
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.
Come on, big boy.
We don't mean you any harm.
We're trying to be friendly with you.
Buck, come here!
Buck, come here.!
Come on, boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Come on, now, be-
Buck! Hey, Buck! Buck, come here!
Well, you can kiss that 250 bucks good-bye.
Yep. It's too bad too.
He'd have made a great dog.
Now he'll either freeze to death, or wolves'll get him. Poor fella.
Make yourself at home, Buck.
Hey! Look, boss! Wolves!
Is he dead?
No, he isn't dead. And he isn't a he.
Hey, you know who that is? That's Blake's woman!
Oh, John! Oh, John darling! I'm so glad!
Oh.
Oh- Oh,
I thought-
Is my husband with you? Have you found him?
You're the only one we've found so far.
What about your husband?
I don't know.
We ran into trouble... and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river.
The ice broke, and
- and then some of our dogs died.
Two days ago my husband went out to look for food... and he hasn't come back.
Do you think he's dead?
That's a pretty good guess.
What are we gonna do with her?
What can you do? Take her to Dawson and leave her.
You're forgetting one thing, pal.
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.
And they had the map
- the original one.
You'll find my husband for me, won't you?
There's nothing we can do. We're a thousand miles from nowhere.
Either the cold got him, or the wolves.
- Get on the sled. We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.
He isn't dead. I
- I don't believe that.
Hey, listen, lady, in this country when a guy is gone for two days, he's gone.
I refuse to go until I definitely know about my husband.
If you don't wanna stay and look for him, you can go without me.
No! No! Put me down!
Put me down! I can't go!
I've got to stay! Put me down!
Stop! Stop this sled!
Whoa! What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
- Oh, no, no. You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own good. Later on you'll thank me.
I hate you, you beast!
Let me out of here!
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me!
Whoops! Ha!
- Let's go! Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share.
You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty.
Can you cook?
Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook.
Huh. Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents?
I'll do nothing to help you.
I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me.
Want you? We just had an attack of insanity and decided to keep you from committing suicide.
Very bad idea, come to think of it.
Hey! You're forgettin' our guest of honor.
Thank you, Mr. Hoolihan.
- Hey. Gimme. Come on, gimme.
- Hmm?
Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if
I ain't too inquisitive... what was you and your old man gonna do up here?
Work.
Oh. Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?
Probably.
Can't understand it, a guy taking his wife way out in the wilderness.
Stupid, if you ask me.
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.
Yeah?
Yeah. He loved me and I loved him.
Well, I wouldn't let him go alone.
Undoubtedly, that will still impress you as being a very stupid reason.
We thought it an excellent one.
I still think it's stupid.
Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.
Well, tell me somethin'.
Uh, didn't he have some object?
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?
What I mean is, did he have a hunch, or did somebody give him a tip?
- I'm very tired, Mr. Hoolihan, and I know you must be.
- Me, tired? Heck no!
Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Boss, she's a woman in a million.
- You think so?
- Yeah. She don't talk.
Oh!
All right, get on with the dogs.
No, thank you. I'll cross the way you men do.
Hold on! Hold on!
Stick with it.!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!
Say! Nice, modest little prices they have here.
They practically give things away.
Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave?
Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do. Come on.
- Come on, Buck.
- Come on, Buck.
Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye.
There's an officer of the
Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you've been very nice, Mr. Thornton.
I
- I suppose I was a little difficult, but...
- well, losing someone you've grown to love isn't- - Yes, I know.
I'm sorry I was so rough.
Well, I
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.
Mmm. I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states.
No. My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?
We know what brought you up here. We've known all along.
I mean, old man Blake's claim.
But how? How could you possibly know?
Give me that map, Shorty.
Yeah.
Did you ever see this?
Or, uh, something like it?
Yes. Yes, I've seen the original.
This won't do you any good. It isn't correct.
I know it. That's why I was going to suggest that-
My husband had to borrow and beg to make this trip.
He went through all sorts of horrible difficulties and-
I know. Well, now he
- he's gone.
That's why I was going to suggest that-
And you were gonna take it away from him, steal it.
Oh, now, please be reasonable. Why don't you come in with me and Shorty on this thing?
Where our map is incorrect, give us the right route. We'll be partners.
And, well, while you're about it...
I suppose you may as well consider all angles.
We need your information about this.
We could probably find the mine ourselves without your help. It would take longer.
Of course, you don't know us very well... except that we're a little rough on women.
We might play you dirty.
We might take your information and then tell you to, well, go jump in the river.
We might do that.
On the other hand, we might be on the up-and-up with you.
Let me see your map.
This river here
- it isn't a river, it's a dry creek.
- And that mountain peak, that's down here.
- Criminy! That's it!
Ha!
All the other mistakes are minor ones.
All right, Mr. Thornton, now you can tell me-
How did you express it?
To go jump in the river?
We've gotta do a lot of jumping ourselves to get the 700 bucks for the outfit.
- Seven hundred dollars is hard to get.
- My, oh, my, oh, my.
But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife, stick somebody and take it away from 'em.
- Yeah!
- Come on, Shorty. Mush!
- Come on. Let's go.
- All set.
Keep your fingers crossed till we get back.
We've gotta make a touch, Shorty.
Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine.
Yeah, I been noticing that.
You're the doctor. You know what's good for ya.
The way I figures it, hunting for gold's a full-time job.
Anything that interferes with it, interferes with it.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Mind keeping that fat snoot of yours out of my affairs?
All right, all right. No offense, boss. No offense whatsoever.
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?
Come on!
My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?
That's the second time he's attacked me!
Yeah, he's crazy about you!
Can't you see?
Wait a minute, partner. I'll give you a chance to make some money.
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.
- Ha.!
- Five hundred.
Nope. Not interested.
I'll give you $1,000!
That's a fabulous price to pay for a dog. I could get a team of six for that.
What do you expect you'd do with him if I let you have him?
Give myself the exquisite pleasure of putting a bullet through his head.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
No, thanks. I'm sorry I can't contribute to your fun, mister.
Boo!
What'll you have to drink, gentlemen?
Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?
Hello, Sam! How are you? Glad to see you. Sam, this is Shorty.
- Hello.
- Ah, yes!
Just seen the argument you had with that fellow back there.
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
- No, no.
The dog doesn't like him either.
Look, Sam, how you fixed?
Uh, pretty nearly flat.
But anyhow, I got enough to ask you gentlemens to join me in a drink.
- Bourbon, straight!
- Ditto!
Likewise! Come on, boy! Come on!
Schnapps?
Well, Sam, here's to your very good health.
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog.
Yeah? That's a lot of dog too.
Ja!
- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?
- No, no, no, not yet.
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole! Ha-ha! How are you?
I got lots trouble.
Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap.
What matter, huh?
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
Two of my dogs, they die.
It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull.
Quiet, now!
Yo! That's one fine dog, mister!
You want to sell, maybe?
- No, I don't.
- I'll say he don't!
You know, that fellow back there...
just offered him 1,000 bucks.
- One thousand bucks? - Mm-hmm.
What the dog do? Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of yours without any help at all.
- Sure! I'll bet you he could.
- Well, he could.
How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner?
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome... he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds. It's impossible.
Well, then it's impossible. Let's drop it.
Is it all right to look at him, mister?
It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
Come on, boss. Let's get outta here.
What's the matter, gentlemen?
If I overheard correctly... the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet. Says he's broke.
I don't want money from you, my friend.
If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000.
- If he can't- - Well?
Why, then, I'll take the dog.
No.
Say, that sounds fair to me.
Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds.
- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!
First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.
Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem to think I'm giving you the best of it.
Don't do it, boss.
Let's go outta here.
A thousand dollars.
It's a bet!
It's a bet!
I think you make one big mistake, mister.
But, well, we go outside.
- Thornton's crazy!
- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!
- Ten-to-one he can't! - It's a bet!
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!
- Gee, boss, he can't do it. He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.
You're not only doing this for money.
You're afraid of getting stuck here and losing that Blake woman.
Oh, all right.
Your dog is to pull the sled a hundred yards from the standstill.
That's the bet.
A hundred yards.!
All right, all right!
One, two, three, four...
All right, get back.
Nobody touch that dog. five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, one, two-
Dog is gonna draw a sled. Just stand there.
The dog will do it!
It's plenty load for one dog to pull.
The dog will do it!
Five, six, seven, eight, nine-
Keep your hands off that dog, now! You understand?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Seven, eight, nine, a hundred.
Go on, mister. We're waiting.
Buck.
Buck.!
Buck! Come on, boy!
Come on, Buck! Mush!
Come on, boy! Mush, Buck!
Come on, come on, Buck!
- Come on, boy.
- Stay away from that dog!
Buck, come on!
Buck! Come on, boy!
Come on, whitey! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hooray! That dog done it.
- He all right?
- Hope so.
Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but haven't you forgotten about the money?
The gelt? Please.
Mmm! Thank you, sir.
- Oh, say. You know something?
- Well?
You'd make a good dog biscuit.
- What's that, a halter?
- Yeah.
Hmm. Being as I'm working like a horse, I just as well look like one.
There you are. Now hang on to this.
Is that all?
Did you remember nails?
Nails. Hammers and saw. Look.
You bought 'em yourself. What's the matter with you this morning?
- Nothing. Get out.
- Mmm.
Oh, hey, listen-
There's something we did forget
- a medicine kit.
We need some iodine and quinine, just in case.
Yeah, all right. I'll get 'em.
Hmm. I hope it won't be too heavy for you to carry.
- See youse later.
- All right.
Say, uh, what do we need the nails and hammers for?
Well, the snow's disappearing fast.
We'll have to cache the sled later on and build a boat.
Oh?
Say, uh, look-
Yeah?
What is it?
I, uh-
I got something to tell you. Maybe you better take it sitting down.
You know how I feel about women in this country.
Where we're going is ten times as tough and rugged...
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?
Well, just this.
I paid your room rent here at the hotel... and I'll leave you enough money for expenses until we get back.
You mean I'm supposed to wait here while you and Shorty go-
That's it.
I've been wondering whether you'd try something like this.
Well, if you're going, I'm going too.
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.
All right, Shorty and I will stay here. You go find the mine.
- Oh, don't be smart.
- Well, you're not going.
Wouldn't be fair to you, or to us either.
Slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions.
Besides, it's more of a risk than I want to see you take.
Believe me, that's my only reason for making this decision.
If you don't like my way of doing it, do it yourself.
- You can have my share.
- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?
Well, thank you very much. You'll not leave this town without me.
We'll leave without you.
You'll wait here and like it.
All right, come on. Let's get going.
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.
If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along, smack her down.
Wonder what's happened now.
Oh, well. You know, I know a couple of people used to fool around like that... and they got children now.
You, uh
- You still want to go along?
Not only do I still want to go, I am going.
All right, come on. Let's get going.
Come on.!
Mush! Mush!
Come on.!
Hey! Hey! Come on!
Mush! Mush!
Mush!
- What's up, Sergeant?
- They just brought a fellow in.
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?
It seems like he left his sled to go hunting for food... then couldn't find his way back.
He was almost a corpse when they found him.
- What's his name?
- Well, we found these on him.
Name seems to be Blake
- John Blake, San Francisco.
Here it comes.
Say, it even looks like a raft.
Thanks. I always wanted to join the navy.
- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?
- I'm afraid not, matey.
- They'll have to run along the bank.
- Very well, sir.
Be careful of that varnish on the deck, you two gobs.
Step right in, commodore.
All set? Shove off, cabin boy.
Ca-
Toot, toot!
Hard aport!
Come on, Buck. Come on.
The way I figure it, we go 100 miles upstream... then we follow a creek that runs into it north.
Huh!
Never fails.
Oh, you pretty things.
That's right
- north for about 40 miles.
And then all we gotta do is-
Oh, if you could only cook.
Then all we have to do is find the knoll... upon which stands a tree, half-shattered by lightning.
And the cabin.
Near that knoll.
Gee, I wonder what it's gonna be like... having things instead of wishing for 'em.
Hmm.
Not nearly so much fun.
You're wrong, Claire.
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.
It's owning something that counts.
Taking it when you can't get it any other way
- that's all right too.
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.
When there's something you need, grab it.
Take it away from the other guy.
It's a good law.
It works.
Nope. It only works when you deserve to have what you take.
Otherwise it's stealing.
Perhaps that particular commandment isn't respected up here.
They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.
Well, Noah... that boat manipulating's a little too tough for my delicate constitution... so if you don't mind, sir, I shall go below.
Good night.
- Night, Shorty.
- Night.
Good night, dice.
Summer's just around the corner.
I can smell it.
You know, somehow
Dawson and Skagway and... even California seem like places I've just heard of.
Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places... never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember... and that's a very kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
What are you thinking of, Buck?
Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking.
Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law- the law we were just talking about.
It's getting late, Jack.
Think I'll say good night.
Not guilty, Your Honor.
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
Oh, boy!
Hey, somebody pinch me.
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.
Hey! Hey, boss!
Boss! Come here, quick.
Hmm. Look at this.
Oh, my. Oh.
Lookit, lookit! Tell me if I'm dreamin'. Lookit.
Holy mackerel.
It's gold, Claire. More gold than
I've ever seen in my whole life.
Oh!
Oh, be careful!
Hey, if we panned this much in an afternoon... think what we'll get in a month.
Gee, I wish I could stick around here a couple of days longer.
You know, I been dreamin' of this moment all my life.
I'm sorry, Shorty, but you got to file a claim.
As long as the trails are open, some prospector is apt to discover this creek.
First to register gets discovery rights.
You're the boss, boss.
- When I get to Dawson, first thing I'm gonna do- - Don't.
- Don't what?
- Get drunk.
Not a chance. I'm gonna catch up on my meals.
I like coffee, and my stomach's been getting weaker every day.
Well, so long, kid.
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- So long.
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake.
Good-bye, Shorty.
Come on, dogs.
- Hey.! Hey, Shorty.!
- What?
You forgot your meal ticket.
Oh! Oh, yeah. Come to papa.
Snake eyes.
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.
Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
What's the matter, boy?
Buck!
Buck.!
- What's biting him?
- I don't know.
- What's that, Jack?
- Wolves.
That's funny. They don't usually come so close to camp.
Buck! Come here!
Buck, come back here!
If that's a pack, they'll kill him. Buck, come here!
Buck.!
He's been changing lately.
Haven't you noticed?
Seems as though he remembers things up here.
Buck, come back here! Buck!
Buck! Buck, come here!
Well, well. Welcome, stranger.
How are ya? Huh?
Well, seems we still mean more to him than- than that old memory.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
You better come inside before you change your mind.
Come on, tough guy. Come on.
All right, kid, shake it up.
Shake it up.
Oh, that's grand music.
Yes.
That's grand music.
Aw, that's grand music.
Yeah. That's grand music.
That's lovely. Come on.
Shake it up.
All right. You tired? Hmm?
All right, come on now.
Let's pull. Together.
One, two...
- three-
- Oh!
Well, we weren't together.
- Oh, I wish you hadn't.
- Why not?
I haven't let myself think about us.
- I didn't dare.
- Why?
Oh, I don't know. I-
I've had sort of a strange premonition.
I don't know exactly how to explain it, but-
Explanations belong 5,000 miles away.
I only have one question... and I only want one answer.
You know the answer.
I don't want to know the answer.
I want to have the answer.
It just struck me, Mr. Blake.
Now my back please, Kali.
I say, Mr. Blake, it's just struck me that so far...
I've taken this entire matter on trust.
I believed your story and put up the money for this outfit.
I still believe your story, but I think it's time... you gave me a little more positive proof.
You should show us the map, Mr. Blake.
When I asked you in Dawson
City to help finance me...
I told you I knew the location of a very rich mine.
I still know where that mine is.
I'm taking you there.
But the map, Mr. Blake-
Why do you continually refuse to show us the map?
I see.
Well, what's to prevent our taking it away from you?
The possibility that such a map may not exist- except in my memory.
Violence will do you no good.
You've come this far... and now there's nothing you can do but go all the way.
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.
Now, now. Who talked of killing?
We're not pirates, my dear man.
We are gentleman adventurers on the road to great riches, eh?
Come, come, Kali. My towel.
Say, Jack.
- Buck's gone again.
- Yes, I know.
- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?
Well, that's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company.
Mmm!
Wait a minute.
According to all you told us, and to all calculations... we should have located the mine two days ago.
I'm afraid you're bringing out my worst side, Mr. Blake.
- Yes, I-I know, but- - If you're trying to hoodwink us... we are certain to find it out sooner or later... and if such is the case... there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you.
I swear I'm doing the best I can.
I followed the compass directions exactly.
The burnt tree.!
- The cabin! That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake... how can you ever forgive me for doubting your integrity?
You've placed me in a most embarrassing position.
I scarcely know what to say.
One for the master.
And one for the dame.
And one for the little boy who's filing the claim.
Why, Jack, I never suspected.
The world doesn't understand me.
At heart I'm an artist.
Oh, I want to write poetry. I want to compose.
I want to sing, paint.
- Barns?
- Yes, yes. Those too.
I want to starve in a garret.
Wear me hair long. Get egg on a flowing tie.
In other words, be a genius. Ah
- But no.
No, the world sneers at me talent... and instead it gives me... gold.
Oh, my poor boy.
You seem to have all the comforts of home, Mr. Thornton-
A comfortable cabin, golden evidence of more comforts to come... and a beautiful lady.
You will oblige me greatly if you will assist... in making this incident as painless as possible.
Come on, get it over with.
What are you going to do?
Do? My dear man, nothing at all.
The important thing is-
We're going back by water,
Kali, using Mr. Thornton's canoe.
You may destroy our burros.
As I was saying, the important thing is to prevent you people... from filing claim on this charming site before we do.
And how do you expect to do that?
Oh, very easily- by leaving you here and destroying all means of transportation.
- If you can't get back to
Dawson to file, why, then...
- you can't get back to
Dawson to file, now can you?
So we'll file instead.
If you want to work the mine while we're gone... you're very welcome to do so, of course.
We'll be glad to recompense you for your trouble when we get back.
Meanwhile we'll take with us your gun and ammunition, axes, et cetera.
It would be a grave error to leave behind... the implements for building another canoe, wouldn't it?
Kali!
Francois.! Kali.!
Come here.!
Look here, Smith. Why can't we do business?
I'm always open to an honest proposition, Mr. Thornton.
We'll give you the claim, all of it.
You can have what gold we've got.
But leave us some way of getting out of here. The winter snows are coming on.
My dear man, you call that a business proposition?
We already have the mine, and the gold is ours by right of-
How shall I put it?
By right of conquest.
Do you mind if we don't argue the point anymore?
Let's help ourselves.
Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold.
I must commend your sense of humor, Mr. Thornton.
Very few people would be able to smile on an occasion like this.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
I remember watching a magician once.
From an apparently empty hat, he shortly produced a rabbit.
He smiled very much as you're smiling now...
because, I imagine, he knew all the while...
that he had that rabbit up his sleeve.
You've something up your sleeve, perhaps.
Perhaps.
Roll up your sleeve, Mr.
Thornton. There's no rabbit there.
Come, come. Don't let's strain our friendship.
Madam.
Careful, you idiot. You might have split the bottom.
We'll be back, my friends.
For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye.
Look out!
Well, they wanted gold. Now they got it.
Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water.
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah. He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
Some prospector, I guess.
Go away, Buck. Get out of the way.
John! John!
Oh, John.
John, darling.!
Claire, dearest...
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
All right, dear.
I thought I'd... lost you.
Try to rest, please.
He's feeling much better this morning.
He remembers everything, thank heaven.
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
He wants to see you, Jack.
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
Well, I'm keeping you.
Jack.
You know I love you, don't you?
You couldn't doubt that, could you?
Well, he needs me.
You have your law and...
I have mine.
Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can.
You need medical attention. Take the canoe.
It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on.
Will you come with us?
No, I'll stay here and work the mine.
When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found.
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that.
Would you, Buck?
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it tougher on everybody.
Oh, Jack, put your arms around me.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of rapids. After that it's clear sailing.
Good-bye, Thornton.
And God bless you.
Good-bye, Blake.
Good-bye, Jack.
Good-bye, Claire.
It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, Buck?
It's all right, boy. Go ahead.
Shorty?
- Yeah!
- Shorty!
- Hello, boss!
- Why, you old son of a gun.
You came just in time.
You saved my life.
Well, look at you.
You're all dressed up.
Yeah. We're in the money. I filed the claim.
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!
No trouble at all. I went right in and signed the names.
- Oh, and the claim was- - Shorty.
What's that?
That's our new cook.
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Let us pray for His Most Excellent Majesty,
Henry VIII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, defender of the faith, now lying at the point of death.
Almighty and most merciful Father...
- How is the King?
- Three quarters dead, milord.
I doubt he will speak again soon.
Passing of a tyrant.
Before he came each man fought for himself under the white rose or the red.
When he goes...
...there will be many struggling to grasp the threads of power...
...that fall from those hands.
- And among them Milord Warrick.
- You should know me better, Gates.
I don't struggle.
- Well, brother?
- The Prince is still at Hertford.
We start for Hertford as soon as...
- Are the horses saddled?
- Waiting.
They'll not wait long.
Seymour's in the lands.
Edifying but unusual.
And Lord Edward prays...
...for the King's end, the next move, and his own hopes.
Let him pray.
What are those in the shadows?
Ghosts? Headless ghosts?
No, sire, your Council.
Oh, my Counselors.
With heads. Nothing in them.
Fetch them to me.
Milords!
Nearer! Nearer!
It grows dark.
The sound of my own voice is strange.
A last command for you...
Edward, the Prince, my son, succeeds me.
After him, his heirs.
Failing them, my daughter,
Mary Tudor and her heirs.
Failing them, my daughter Elizabeth and her heirs.
Failing them, my sister's grandchild,
Jane Grey.
Jane Grey on the throne?
And the bar behind them.
Who speaks?
Warrick.
No conscience and no fear.
And Edward Seymour.
So great a hypocrite you deceive me when yourself.
And brother Thomas, of some little wit but no judgment.
Thomas, go where your wit will serve you...
...and your lack of judgment not bring you to disaster.
I know you.
All of you!
And I know for what you wage.
But you heard my will!
Edward, Mary, Elizabeth, Jane.
And I lay my curse...
...on any that shall abuse their power over these children... and intrigue against the successors
I have named.
May everything he holds dear betray him!
May his soul perish in the everlasting fires!
May he die a traitor's death!
His head rot on London Bridge, the crows pick out his out his eyes!
Milords, the King is dead.
Why let them get to the start?
As a soldier, Gates,
I've won several campaigns...
...always by waiting till the enemy made a mistake.
There will be many mistakes made in this realm in the next few years.
And much profit to be gained by them.
That is why we wait.
For the moment.
For Edward the Fox and Thomas the Peacock.
They've hated each other from the cradle with nothing in common but their parents.
They'll fall out.
With a little help at the right time.
- They're children. I'm sorry for them.
- Spare your pity.
Their heads may wear the crown of England.
- If they have heads to put it on.
- A delicate point.
We must be behind the head that wears the crown.
- Aren't you afraid?
- You heard what he said.
- A man without fear.
- I heard more, his dying curse.
His curse?
What is a curse but words?
And what a word but breath...
...can be at his last breath?
What, man?
No, I am not afraid.
Your Highness.
Anyhow, the Captain of the Guard says that bows and arrows are done for.
Soon everybody will fight with these new guns.
As if anyone would ever fight with their guns instead of a bow and arrow.
But I want a gun.
Hello, uncle.
Why won't Father let me have a gun?
- Your father would know best.
- That's what he always says.
I'll get round him.
I can accept him when he has doubts.
Edward my boy,
I have news for you.
Sad news, Your Majesty.
Majesty?
Why do you call me that?
- Because you are the King.
- King?
My father's King.
God rest his soul.
- My f...
- Edward, my boy...
We must all die.
Your noble, gracious, and most pious father, in his dying breath entrusted you to my care.
- Indeed his last words...
- His last words were...
...that you should in all things obey me.
For your own good and for the good of the Kingdom over which you now rule.
- Uncle...
- Yes?
- If I am King...
- Well?
I can have a gun.
My Lords, it gives me great happiness...
...to name my beloved uncle,
Edward Seymour,
Lord Treasurer, Earl Marshall, and Duke of Somerset, and I do take him, as Lord Protector of this realm,
...to follow his advice in all things.
Duke of Somerset, Lord Treasurer,
Earl Marshall and Lord Protector.
How much we must indeed be proud of such a brother.
- My lord, you read my very thoughts.
- But your looks belie them.
Your many friends are disappointed in you, Thomas.
Have I so many?
All your brother's enemies.
- I'm fortunate.
- Then make the poise of it.
You lack ambition.
I thought better of you, Thomas.
A drop of poison.
It works.
Eduardus Rex.
That means Edward the King.
And what's the use of making you Protector if you won't let me do anything I want?
You keep me here in the country, you don't let me have any money.
And you won't even let me have that gun.
- One day you will thank me.
- What for?
For teaching you to have no wishes of your own.
No desires but to do your duty.
I'll not sign it!
I've written Eduardus Rex in hundreds and hundreds of papers and my hand aches.
And I don't know what they're about anyway.
And I've sat here for hours.
I don't want to sit here any longer.
And I'll not!
If I could get a new Protector, I would!
After all, I am the King.
What do you want?
Your Majesty.
A gun!
For me?
What's the use of being a king if you can't have everything you want?
And more and have it, and then one more and have that too.
And so helter-skelter to the top of the ladder till there's nothing more to want.
How do you load it?
For truth to tell I mistrust these new fangled things myself.
He'll return soon enough, chastened and obedient.
The voice of his own conscience will speak louder than anything we can say.
I hit it! Oh, look,
I hit it, I hit it!
Look, look!
- Edward, what is it?
- Nothing.
Only sometimes everything goes black. I can't get my breath...
...and my heart goes like horses galloping.
I'm hot and cold, and I'm wet through.
It's as if I'd fallen into the moat.
- Have you told your uncle Edward about this?
- No, I'd never tell him.
Let's shoot this again.
What is this?
It's a new gun Uncle Thomas has given me.
Thomas, I have to speak with you.
Barnaby!
Oh!
You heard my orders not to come here.
- Orders? But my dear brother,
I am also the King's uncle...
- Why have you come?
- To bring my nephew something he wanted.
Understand this!
While the King is in my care...
- Your loving and disinterested care?
- I intend to do my duty!
A most painful duty, Duke of Somerset,
Lord Treasurer,
Earl Marshall, Lord Protector, and anything else you can make yourself!
My lords!
Oh!
Edward, what ails you?
Nothing, uncle, nothing.
I must have bruised myself with the gun.
I'll not have you fire it again.
Barnaby! Barnaby, help His Majesty within.
Thomas, I give you warning.
Brother or no brother, a solemn warning.
Leave here at once, and you show yourself again at your peril.
Brother, the King is yours.
I'll not seek to see him.
So great is my concern for you and for him.
- This means a journey north.
- Milord, why so?
My brother looks so far ahead he fails to see what's under his very nose.
Edward VI will be dead within the year.
- Dead?
- I'll stake my future on it.
- Then it's Mary Tudor.
- A Papist, a Catholic?
- No, they'll not have her.
- Then Elizabeth.
The Commons have declared her illegitimate.
- It's Jane Grey.
- Jane Grey?
That poor child seems likely to be overlooked.
So, we ride north.
So you want to take my daughter back with you to London. May I ask why?
- Don't be a fool, Henry.
- I beg your pardon, my dear?
Don't beg my pardon, beg your daughter's.
For not realizing what Thomas is offering her.
He's offering to take her to London,
I realize that.
- But surely I'm entitled to ask why.
- Lord, give me patience.
You see, milord, I feel a lady so charming, so accomplished, so highly born as your daughter, should not spend all her youth away in the country, however charming her home.
Now, if she were to come to London, under my rule, bringing with her, of course, anyone you may choose to care for her, she might make a more than advantageous match.
- So you'd marry her to someone?
- In good time.
Anyone particular in view?
We can look as high as we will and need look no lower.
- So...
- I wish you wouldn't talk in riddles.
- I have the answer, my dear.
- Oh, you've no lack of answers.
May I remind you that my mother was a sister of Henry VIII?
- You do frequently.
- Blessed Mary!
My mind is naturally more attuned to Lord Thomas' than yours.
There is one other person who might perhaps be consulted.
- And who is that, my lord?
- Lady Jane herself.
What she thinks might be of some matter.
You mistake, my lord. What my daughter thinks is of no matter.
Caeser, De Bello Gallico.
Construe.
Caesar Upon the Gallic Wars.
Why the plural? Bello, Gallico, singular.
Caesar Upon the Gallic War.
Read.
I wonder who it is with Mother and Father.
I wonder who... what?
They're talking in there now.
Whatever they talk of can have no possible concern for a child like you.
That's all very well, but if Jane is to go to court, she'll want a lot of new dresses...
...money to spend. I'm not a rich man.
Milord, I wouldn't dream that you should be the loser.
If I'm granted so great a privilege,
Shall we say two thousand pounds?
Two thousand pounds?
Well, of course I...
No, I don't like it.
You're not asked to like it. Lord Thomas isn't offering to take you to town.
Confound it, she is my daughter.
I happen to know that's true but I often marvel at it.
- Well, the whole thing wants talking over.
- Shall I withdraw?
Leave him to me, my lord.
I have no doubt of the outcome.
- Construe.
- I mean, in our tongue, the Gauls.
They've been there for hours.
Ellen says it's a high personage.
May I enter?
And who may you be?
The high personage.
This is my tutor, Dr. Elmer.
Thomas Seymour, at your service.
I make a rule a lesson must not be interrupted.
I will not break your rule, Dr. Elmer.
I wish to examine her ladyship on her works of the great Cicero.
- Caesar.
- Caesar.
- I think her parents would not approve.
- I think I may answer for them.
If your lordship so desires.
Why did you do that?
Well, I thought perhaps you might like a holiday.
Ovid, Aristotle, Plato, Euclid.
Is that all you learn?
Oh, no!
But besides Latin and Greek,
Dr. Elmer teaches me French,
Italian, Spanish, and a little Hebrew.
And I have master heading for knowledge of divinity and gravity of manners.
Lord preserve us, I should be dead within a week.
Oh, no, you'd get used to it.
But I doubt you'd be good at gravity of manners.
Jane...
Would you like to take a holiday from gravity of manners?
- Most gladly.
- And come to London?
London!
Oh, no.
- No, my parents would never allow me.
- You see that door?
At any moment now it will open, and your father will come in, and he'll say...
'Jane, you are to go to London.
I've been talking it over with your mother and I've made up my mind.'
Oh, there you are, milord.
I, er...
I've been talking to my wife and...
I've made up my mind.
A night of ill omen, this.
You mark my words.
London's a place of sin.
Ellen, aren't you longing to be there?
If it wasn't to look after you, the whole
King's army wouldn't drag me there.
The devil's playground.
Mother!
Yes, I've come to say good night, but tomorrow's a great day for you.
Ellen says its day of ill omen and London's the devil's playground.
Ellen, how dare you put such ideas in the child's head!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
There's shame in me, but not for myself.
I forbid you to meddle with things you don't understand.
There are things I understand too well.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night, mother.
We're giving you a great chance, your father and I.
There's no knowing what may come of it.
Look. That's his barge.
And that's her.
- London Bridge.
- With hundreds of houses on it.
Ellen and I shall be happy here.
I know I shall.
Two hours without a bite.
- And when they do bite...
- They're not more than fish themselves.
My humble dwelling.
And you are very welcome.
I'll not hear it again.
The devil with it all.
...to be a thing repugnant to nature.
I mean not only that the Lord hath spoiled women of authority and dominion, but also that man hath seen, proved and pronounced... just cause is why that should be sought.
Men, I say, in many cases blind, tough in this behalf, see very clearly,
...for the causes be so manifest that they cannot be hidden.
For who can deny that it is repugnant to nature...
...that the blind shall be appointed to lead and conduct such as you see?
That the foolish, weak, and impotent persons...
...shall nourish and keep the full and strong.
And finally, that the foolish, mad, and fanatic... shall govern the discrete... and give counsel to such as the sovereign of my kingdom.
And such be all women, compared with men.
For their sight is of such blindness...
- Milord.
- We listen to godly words.
I have news for you.
No news can have such importance as godly news.
News of your brother.
- Jane Grey? He must be daft.
- Thomas is ambitious.
Not a word of this.
For the peace of the realm, keep silent.
- I know my duty.
- The godly words.
Listen yourself awhile.
You may derive much profit from them.

- Well?
- The Lord Protector is here.
Shall I bring him to you?
No, I'll come to him.
- You know this air?
- Very well, my lord.
Then take my part.
It is a soothing sound.
# Youth wyll have nedes dalyaunce #
# Of gude or yll #
Edward!
Cheer, good brother.
An Italian design. I find it pleasing.
Jane Grey is with you.
Entrusted to me by her parents.
I warned you that I should stop at nothing if you dared interference.
Interference?
But you desired, if my memory serves, sole control of the King.
- And to that you're welcome.
- It is too near the throne.
It is a direct threat to the government.
Treason!
- Edward, how you jump to conclusions.
- Jump to conclusions? You drive me to them.
# So God be pleeyd #
# thus lyfe wyll I #
This is beyond forgiveness.
I've been long suffering beyond measure.
My patience is at an end.
And mine?
Edward, I'm tired.
You have a very pleasant home of your won.
- One last word.
- Let it be the last.
Last and very truthful.
And by your bearing, Thomas,
I think you have a little knowledge of what it is.
Clearly, say it and go!
You fool.
Many a thrashing have I given you as a boy.
And all to no purpose.
But this new folly will cost you more than a thrashing.
It will cost you...
...your head.
The last word has been said.
And this is the last time that we shall ever speak together alone.
My lady!
The guilt of this and the blood are upon your own head.
Guilty of what?
Whose blood?
No matter, my dear.
Nothing to worry your head about.
He seemed so strange.
Yes, a strange man.
He surprises me sometimes.
- I'm frightened.
- Frightened?
Is he going to do something dreadful to you?
Why should he?
After all, he is your brother.
A most loving brother.
Halt!
Thomas Seymour, I arrest you in the King's name.
So loving a brother that he sent his friends to fetch me.
- What does this mean?
- Jane, I believe your Ellen's right.
This place is indeed the devil's playground.
And the devil has some ugly tricks.
- But, My Lord, I...
- Now listen!
I may not return to this house... for some little time.
And if I do not, you must go back to the country.
- Don't you want me here?
- I think you'd be better in the country.
I want your solemn promise you'll go back.
If you'll come and see me.
- As often as I can.
- You sound so serious!
Serious? My dear child, there's nothing in life worth being serious about.
Or in death either, for that matter.
Captain, at your service.
The end of my master.
- The end?
- Tower Hill and the ax.
Milady, there's but one person in the whole world can save him, yourself.
- Me?
- You're the King's cousin, his own age.
Will you go to the King and beg mercy for my Lord Thomas?
- Oh, I will, I will!
- Your Ladyship!
He has shown me nothing but such goodness and kindness.
And now... now he's in danger of his life.
Oh, forgive me if I presume too much.
But you are the King.
You are my cousin.
I beg of you not to allow anything so unjust, so cruel, so wicked.
Have no fear, cousin Jane.
Lord Thomas shall be set free.
We give our royal word.
Send the Lord Protector to me.
And when he comes,
I'll be alone with him.
Hurry!
You sent for me?
I have been informed, my Lord Protector, that you have placed my uncle Thomas under arrest...
...and that you intend his execution.
Well, you mustn't do it.
You must let him go.
It is our royal command.
Edward.
- Do you know what Thomas has done?
- No, Uncle.
Do you suppose that I should stain my hands, perhaps my soul, with a brother's blood without good reason?
- But Uncle...
- Edward, my boy, in high politics...
...we have to set aside all thought of self.
And this you must learn from my example.
But what has he done?
That which in the eyes of men and of the angels cries out for death.
And now, before you weaken me in my resolve to do my duty, out of my sight.
Go to your room, to your bed!
Whereas Thomas Seymour,
Baron Seymour of Sudeley, is in stand of the tainted, convicted and condemned of high treason...
...and other high crimes.
The Court condemns that he be taken this day to the base of execution...
...upon Tower Hill to be put to death by the severing of his head from his body.
And that in the evening...
...his head be placed upon the gate of London Bridge.
This is not justice!
It must be stopped!
Pray, good friends, listen to me!
The King himself has pronounced against this wickedness.
- The King?
- The King.
If it goes forward it is because the tyrant
Edward Seymour overrules the King!
- Down with the Protector!
- Down!
High stakes already, Gates.
In a few minutes one Seymour will have lost his head the other his popularity.
As I foretold, we win by waiting.
Put that down! Do you hear me?
Put that down!
That's the property of milord
Thomas Seymour.
The property of Thomas Seymour traitor is forfeit to the Lord Protector.
Drunk wolves, vultures, ghouls!
Can you not even wait till the deed of shame is done?
But he's there, on the scaffold.
You'll hear the cannon any moment now.
- Cannon?
- They fire a cannon when the ax falls.
No, no, this can't happen. It won't!
The King said he would never allow it.
The King?
A message, milady.
- From the King?
- From milord Thomas.
I left him on the scaffold.
He reminds you of your promise and asks your forgiveness.
But the King said he wouldn't allow it.
He gave me his royal word.
The King my cousin gave me his royal word.
Even now, even this last moment he will stop it, he will. I know he will.
He'll send my lord to return to his home.
Why do you stand there staring at me like that?
Why don't you say something?
He'll set him free!
He'll come back to us! I know!
And it came to pass, when there was a gather in the fields, that Cain rose up against his brother...
...and slew him.
And the Lord said unto Cain, where is Abel thy brother?
He said, I know not.
I am nigh my brother's keeper.
And he said,
What hast thou done?
The voice of thy brother's blood cries onto me from the ground.
Get the King.
We start for Windsor.
I am in the place where I am demanded of my conscience that I speak truth.
So I ask of ye.
Is there no man who will turn the wrath of heaven and avenge a brother's blood?
Milord, Master Knox hurls his thunderbolts, and with shrewd aim.
He looks to you, milord, as do we all.
To me?
Seymour has gone to work, to Windsor with the King.
A strong man to lead us, and we'd hunt him to the death.
Milord, you take me off my guard.
I am no politician.
Nor do I wish to meddle with one.
A plain soldier.
The country bleeds under his toe nails.
You persuade me, Arundel, against myself.
So for the love that I bear you and this land of ours, make what use of me you can.
To your posts, all of you!
Captain, will you hand the castle over to Warrick?
Order your men to their posts.
Mutiny?
Place this officer under arrest.
You will assume his command.
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
- What's the matter?
There's going to be a fight.
Warrick and the Protector.
Come on, Look!
He's coming with his army.
Look!
Edward! Edward, you must come and speak to your soldiers.
- Me, why me? You're the Protector.
- Their King must speak to them.
They never heard me talking, now you do it yourself. You told me to keep quiet.
Listen, my boy, there's not a moment to be lost. Exact your royal authority.
There's mutiny in the castle but for you they'll defend it.
If they don't want to,
I don't see why they should.
- But we shall be in Warrick's hands.
- I'm not afraid.
Yes, but my boy, you don't understand.
It's on me that he'll have no mercy.
You showed no mercy for Uncle Thomas.
I shall lose everything.
In politics, Uncle, you set aside all thoughts of self.
- That I learned from your example.
- Your Majesty, my lead, my royal master, out of your great mercy, out of the gratitude that you owe me,
I implore you, come before it's too late.
It is too late.
A poor run you gave us,
Edward the Fox.
Take him away.
Your Majesty.
- Are you afraid?
- Not very.
I'm here to offer myself as your Protector.
I pray you, Edward the King, name me so.
Will there be any more sermons?
No, Your Majesty.
- May I shoot with my gun?
- You may, Your Majesty.
And may I ask cousin Jane to the palace?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
My Lord Warrick, you are a Protector after my own heart.
- That's good!
- Could you do that?
- Well, I've never tried.
- You could do it as well as they do.
They do it all the time where they come from.
My Captain's brought them from Hindustan.
I am glad you could come.
I wish you weren't going home tomorrow. Must you?
- Yes.
- Why?
I gave my promise.
I must keep it.
I like Warrick.
He's the best Protector I've had.
He lets me do everything I want.
He let me ask you here.
And you know, they wanted to cut off
Edward Seymour's head.
But I said no. Cutting off one uncle's head off is bad enough.
What are you looking like that for?
- Something I heard.
- What?
That something is going to happen.
And this banquet was arranged just to keep you out of the way.
No, no. Warrick would never do that.
I'm really King now.
I get my own way.
I even drink wine at banquets.
I don't like it but I'll get used to it.
You watch.
My Lord Warrick.
I drink to my Lord Warrick.
My Lord Warrick!
Here! I want you here!
Your Majesty.
What was that cannon?
An execution, Your Majesty.
Edward Seymour?
Your Majesty would be more correct to speak of the late Edward Seymour.
You said you wouldn't kill him.
You promised you wouldn't.
I told you not to!
I commanded you not to! I...
Well?
- Milord, the King's state is grave.
- How mean you grave?
There is a certain lymphatic humor in the blood.
- A certain...
- Enough! Will he die?
Assuredly, milords, as we all shall.
Oh, vanity words with me, you dolts, you...
You are one of the most learned physicians in the land.
Use all your skill, devise your most potent remedies.
The King must be restored and speedering.
See that I am obeyed.
Milord, we would obey you in all things.
But in all humility, the poor boy is beyond our physics.
You pack of senseless fools!
You dolts, you knaves!
Out of my sight!
I command you!
Your thoughts, Gates.
Well man, have you lost your tongue?
May his head rot on London Bridge.
May the crows pick up his eyes.
A man with no conscience...
...and no fear.
I should be well equipped to fight both the living and the dead.
This boy shall not cheat me by his death.
We shift our ground.
That's all.
I'm going now.
I came to see how you were.
Was it that I ate too much?
I could eat twice as much.
And I often faint.
I'll be well in the morning.
You were right about Warrick and wanting to go back to the country.
Wish only I could come with you.
- Couldn't you? Just for a while?
- He wouldn't let me.
Oh, cousin Jane, they use me for their own advantage.
I no longer know truth from lies.
But it'll be easier being King when you're older.
You go away from this place as soon as you may.
Nothing could keep me here.
Good night, cousin Edward.
Good night, cousin Jane.
Where do you go?
- Home, my Lord.
- I'll have you stay here awhile.
But my Lord...
Apartments will be prepared for you here in the palace.
- But, my Lord, I must go home.
- That is not possible.
- By what right do you speak?
- In the King's name.
- The King has just said I may go.
- The King is a sick boy.
I can have but one concern, his well-being.
My physicians tell me that your presence here in the palace will speed his recovery.
So... you will stay.
And so, milord, I ask for your consent to the betrothal of your daughter to my son.
My Lord, you do us great honor.
And your son, milord, is he of the same mind with yourself?
My son has not been told.
But when he is told, he will do as he is told.
Well, Arundel, horse-riding and here I am.
- And welcome.
- My father sent for me.
- He did?
- For what?
For what? Milord Warrick will tell you that himself.
Whenever my father sends for me
I have no pit to my stomach...
- ...and my blood runs cold.
- What mischief have you been about?
I?
It's what he's about.
- An intriguer from his birth.
- Milord!
Indeed I have little doubt that he selected his own parents...
...and arranged to be born in the best bed chamber.
- Where's Jane Grey?
- About the palace. Our men watch her.
- Why do you watch me?
- Watch you?
- Why should I watch you?
- You're one of Warrick's spies.
Most certainly I'm not.
Do you hate him too?
Well, er... He's not always easy to get on with.
- I ask your pardon, sir.
- Oh, don't go.
Tell me.
Why do you hate this Warrick with such violence?
He said it was for the King's sake
I should stay here.
Yet I have not seen the King, not once.
- And now everywhere I'm followed.
- Followed?
I reach a door my way is barred,
I know not why.
I'm afraid.
I wake up at night with the sound of his name in my ears.
My Lord Warrick, my Lord Warrick, my Lord Warrick!
My Lord Warrick will speak with you, milady.
- Arundel.
- Milord?
- Who is that girl?
- Jane Grey.
- Jane Grey? What do they want with her?
- Milord Warrick will acquaint you.
- When?
- In his own good time.
Mother, all my life till now
I've availed you in everything.
But I'll not avail you in this.
Jane, I'm amazed that you should be so willful, so headstrong, so undutiful!
- Father!
- My dear, you must be guided by us.
But I'm not being guided by you.
My Lord Warrick has arranged this for some purpose of his own.
- You will obey your parents in this.
- I will not!
- You will marry my son...
- I will not!
- ...the betrothal will take place tomorrow.
- I will not!
- At noon.
- I'll not!
- All arrangements have been made.
- I'll not, I'll not!
I'll not, I'll not, I'll not!
I'll not.
Guard!
Guard!
This way!
Who is it? Halt!
- Why do you follow me?
- Your pardon, my lord.
Thank you for saying it was you.
Well... it was me.
But, er...
What were you doing?
I was running away.
Warrick again?
They want me to marry his son.
I'll never marry him.
But... why haven't they told...
Warrick's son.
Haven't they?
No.
How did you know that?
Well... I know him.
My Lord, who are you?
Ask me more of Warrick's son.
Don't mention his name again.
I hate him as I hate his father.
I'll not marry him.
If you'll not marry him, he'll not marry you.
I know this Guildford Dudley better than anyone in the world. I'll vouch for him.
So... your word you'll not try and escape tonight.
Your word, I pray you!
You have it.
And I'll keep it.
As I know you will.
The solemn deed of covenant and betrothment... between, on the first part, the Lord Guildford Dudley, son to Sir John Dudley,
Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warrick and Duke of Northumberland,
Knight to the most noble
Order of the Garter, and in the second part,
Lady Jane Grey, daughter to Sir Henry Grey,
Baron of Ashley, Bonneville and Harrington.
Marquess of Dorset, and Duke of Suffolk,
Knight of the most noble
Order of the Garter, and of his wife, the Lady Frances Brandon. daughter to Mary, Queen Dowager of France, and sister to His Late Excellent
Majesty Henry VIII,
King of England and Lord of Ireland.
How is it with Your Majesty?
Sleepy, Warrick, I couldn't sleep.
You must rouse yourself to sign your name.
What is it?
A deed naming as your successor,
Jane Grey.
I'll not sign it!
I'll not sign it.
She should never be Queen, never!
She wants to live in the country where she's left alone and she's happy.
And she shall!
I won't make her Queen!
To be treated as I have by people like you!
Who care nothing for us, nothing for England, nothing for the people!
Only your own power.
I'll not sign it!
I'll not sign it!
You can't make me!
I'll die first!
Die!
I'll beat you that way!
Paste the King's signature on this.
You shan't do it!
Come back!
Come back! You shan't do it!
I'll tell them what you've done.
I'll tell everyone in England.
I'll tell them all what you are!
I'll tell them...
How lovely it is. How peaceful.
And most blessed of all, how far away from London.
I feel I never want to see
London again.
You're happy, aren't you?
It's lovely to be able to look into the future.
It can be so full of joiety one wants to laugh.
I'll race you back to breakfast.
What means this?
It means His Majesty Edward VI is dead...
...and that your wife is Queen.
Queen Jane of England.
Queen?
No... it can't be.
It can't be.
Your Majesty, your cousin before his death made his last will...
...naming you as his heir.
But I don't wish to be Queen.
In the name of all here present, we swear ourselves as your loyal and faithful subjects, ready to serve you in all things.
My lords and gentlemen, I thank you, all of you.
But I refuse.
A refusal is impossible.
There is no escape from this.
My Lord, I'm no longer still a child.
- No longer in your palace.
- Your Majesty, hitherto we have met only, I fear, as enemies.
But today there is a vital need that we should act in complete accord.
I have no wish to act in accord with you.
Your Majesty, you must think of your country, not of yourself.
Today you are acclaimed Queen in London.
The bells are ringing, the streets are full with people shouting your name.
If you refuse, though Mary Tudor is hated by the people, there are those that will raise an army on her behalf.
It would mean... civil war.
Will you bear the responsibility for that?
Your Majesty, it is not only your right, it is your sacred duty to take your place on the throne.
If so be, it is my duty.
I will rule over my people...
...as well as I'm able.
And as gently...
This I can promise you.
There will be no more of revenge, and cruelty, and bloodshed.
Amen to that.
God bless Your Majesty.
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Who comes?
- Whose men are you?
- Mary Tudor's.
- Lead me to her.
My Lord.
You must go no further down the road, madam.
Warrick's men wait for you in ambush.
It is my duty. My brother has sent letters desiring to see me.
Your brother is dead.
Dead?
- But the letters?
- Forged by the milord Warrick.
He has put the child Jane on the throne and seeks to entrap you while he may.
Those forged letters were the bait, so I beseech you go not a step further.
Back now to safety. Then you can raise the eastern counties to your cause.
- This will mean blood.
- Peace, Father.
Have I not courage to shed blood if it be my duty?
In God's sight I am Queen.
And in His name will I raise my standards.
You have earned our thanks.
Let the torches be put out.
We ride back.
Tomorrow we hold Council... and shall be proclaimed Queen.
Whereas our most mighty sovereign and ruler
Jane, Queen of England and of Ireland, does this day intend and purpose to enter into her capital city of London, and proceed to her palace of the Tower,
- The Queen's most excellent...
- God bless Queen Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the...
Your Majesty's keys.
I'll tell you, milord, what it will be like if not.
Last night bonfires burnt in every street...
...and the people danced around them shouting Mary.
- Mary the Queen.
- And take over an English fool?
Mary Queen might be a danger.
I have sent Gates to put her under arrest.
- Even now she is his prisoner.
- Milord!
She had tidings of my approach and fled to Suffolk.
The eastern counties have flocked to her support. We are as good as lost!
- Unless we act at once!
- How would milord Arundel act?
Take course for Mary's camp.
Throw ourselves on her mercy.
That from the man who's the first to kneel to my daughter.
Our decision was a wrong one, we have yet time to undo it!
Quiet, milords!
You are losing your heads now in such a way...
...as to make sure of losing them later on the scaffolds.
If by your pleasure in deceit you stray to Mary, which one of you will be able to wipe your hands clean...
...of what you have already done?
So...
If there is any one of you that will feel more safe with Mary, let him go now.
Good.
I ride this this hour to meet the rebel army.
If you remain united behind me,
I have no doubt of the result.
I leave the Queen's majesty here in your keep.
Why did this have to happen?
When will we run our horses now...
...galloping back to breakfast?
We were looking into the future then.
How little we knew.
But the future's still ours.
Have your horses saddled and be prepared to ride full-armed within the hour.
My Lord!
The rebel Mary has dared to raise an army against your men.
But must you take my husband?
Jane... he is my son.
And I believe my love for him is as great as yours.
I take him with me because that's where his duty lies.
Say your goodbyes and come.
Must you go?
If I did not go, I should be a coward.
Jane, we're both doing what we must.
Our duty.
And we must help each other, without flinching.
Fair you well.
Your Majesty.
- No news, no sign? Nothing?
- Nothing, Your Majesty.
But there's no need for you to fret.
Milord Warrick never yet lost a battle.
Thank you.
Warrick is taken!
Mary's army marches on London!
Milords!
The bells! That means he's back.
My husband's back!
I pray so. Nine days a queen and little but trouble to show for it.
- My Council's sitting. I must ask them.
- My dear, best stay where you are.
A queen doesn't go ask for news, it is brought to her.
No, I can't wait.
You can come down from there, my dear.
You're no longer Queen.
Warrick is defeated, Mary is proclaimed, and all your counselors have deserted you.
- And my husband?
- Alive and unhurt.
Then... we can go home.
Jane Dudley, I arrest you in the name of Her Majesty Queen Mary.
- A pretty end, milord.
- Not quite the end.
- Ellen!
- My dear, you must be patient.
Now that Mary is crowned Queen, she will be merciful.
I'm not patient.
I fear for my own courage.
Her Majesty, Queen Mary.
Cousin, you have done that for which I as Queen can have but one answer.
There must be no shadow of doubt in the mind of any...
...that for high treason there can be but one punishment.
- You wish my death?
- I do not wish it.
You are young and I think less guilty than those around you.
Though I may feel pity,
I can show no mercy.
Your Majesty, myself I admit my fault.
I have done a great wrong against you.
But my husband, what has he done?
- He is your husband.
- It's his father's business.
- Which makes his case the poorer.
- He had no choice.
I have no choice. Security of my kingdom demands that he shall die.
Why must you all build your greatness on the graves of others?
Why cannot there be triumph without...
...suffering?
Child, you speak out of your ignorance.
You forget the verities of government.
If I should spare your husband and yourself, there are those who would lead an army on your behalf...
...and then two thousand would die in the place of two.
Now you understand.
You and your husband must die.
Then...
...he will meet his end bravely.
As I hope I shall.
Cousin Mary.
Bare me no malice.
In what I did I meant you no harm.
I was Queen...
...for so short a while.
We're ready... milady.
Is it cold today?
It is, milady. Bitter cold.
My cloak.
I mustn't seem to shiver...
...lest they think I'm afraid.
Will your ladyship forgive me?
Most willingly.
Jane, would you like to take a holiday from gravity of manners and come to London?
We're giving you a great chance, your father and I.
There's no knowing what may come of it.
The devil's playground.
I think you'd be better in the country.
I want your solemn promise that you'll go.
You were right about Warrick and wanting to go back to the country tomorrow.
So, you will stay.
You will obey your parents in this.
You will marry my son.
So, your word you will not try and escape tonight.
We're only doing what we must.
Our duty.
Long live the Queen!
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills...
...from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved, and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord Himself is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy defense upon thy right hand
The sun shall not smite thee by day...
...neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil.
Yea, It is even he that shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in...
...from this time forth.

He'll be back soon
Sit down. You're acting like a bunch of half-baked kids
He'll show up pretty soon.
Get going, Isobel.
We're surrounded, boss.
Well, what's this?
Boss, let's go back to the ranch.
The Sally Ann Mine. you ain't figuring on goin' to any haunted mine?
We's followin' that horse. and I've got a hunch somebody's trying to cut in on it.
Why, it's Ed's horse.
Or they wouldn't be so anxious to keep us away.
Shh.
He used to be superintendent of the mine.
We're gonna find out something right now.
Just a minute!
And who invited you into this game?
You boys better get movin' before I loses control.
Nice neighborly bunch of boys you have here.
Sure, why not?
Oh, well, we-
We have so few visitors.
And he ain't here for nothing, either.
Mack, trail him and see what he's up to.
Hm? that I haven't given it much thought for years.
Oh, uh
Go on, Clarence, hit the hay.
Aw, go get some sleep.
This must have been quite a mansion in its day
Thanks.
Well, you see, I... that everything's gonna turn out all right is all around here.
No, sir.
All right, you wait out here in the hall but the best cook we ever had at the ranch.
A black figure just went up those stairs.
You couldn't have missed him. but I swear no one's come up here.
Where have you been?
He's deaf and dumb. d-don't you think we oug hta go on back to the ranch?
But- But, boss, boss...
Come on, boys.
Look.
Mack, you stay with the horses.
Hold on there, pardner.
Stick'em up.
What are you doing up here?
What are you doing up here on my property?
Well, we'll find a way to make you both talk.
Dead men can't tell us anything.
Come on, let's get him.
Mack, go over and saddle up my horse.
I know nothing
I can't understand it myself.
Oh.
Well, I'm beginning to understand. but I simply have to find out what this is all about.
Help, help!
Help, help!
Help!
You'll be all right now.
And you come along, and you spoil it all.
Ryan's father stole my share of the mine.
Come on, I'll tell you while we're riding. but what is there to be afraid of now? but my nervousness just lingers on. in a town like this, where he can't spend a nickel.
I don't know what he'd want a thousand dollars in this town.
Must be up to something.
Well, he'll find us on the job all right.
All right.
I don't understand that, boys.
Isobel, get going.
Put'em up.
They is up.
Come on, give us that money.
Now, beat it.
Duke. Duke! catchin' up with my money. to tackle almost anything to earn an honest dollar.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Come on, get movin' there, Clarence.
Throw'em in.
And that's where the thousand dollars comes in.
Now, make up your mind.
Looks like he's got us, boss.
Make out the transfer in the name of Janet Carter.
I may not be so generous.
Clarence?
Ye- Ye- Yes, sir!
Get out!
Tie him up.
Get that lantern and bring that darky.
Bring him along.
Hurry up.
Move on, smokey.
Quit stallin'
Get back there.
That's only an old shovel.
Cut out making that noise.
Well, that water sure didn't do these guns any good
Get goin'.
Come on, get goin'.
Maybe that's the angel Gabriel callin' us.
Let's see what's up this ladder.
Shh.
Hold it there.
You?
Then why does that tun nel lead to this room? or it'll be too bad for both of ya.
Get goin'
Come on, come on.
Cut out the gabbin' and shove on.
You're pretty tricky, ain't ya?
Move on.
Put'em up.
Tie'em up,
Benedict.
Let'em loose, Tom.
Get me outta this.
And who are you anyway?
Bill Carter.
The man your father framed and sent to prison.
Yes, dear, he's your father.
Where is it? and you're gonna tell us where it is.
Don't you know me?
It's just me, Clarence.
Duke, I's gonna show'em a phantom what is a phantom.
Look out-!
What's happened?
What?
When Ryan comes in and grabs her, I ups and left.
Come on.
I is the phantom.
He ain't no phantom with that watermelon accent.
I is the phantom.
Sure as you all's born,
I is the phantom.
I hopes to die if I ain't the phantom.
Well, let's ride to the shack above the mine.
I guess they didn't believe me. for his daughter and for you.
Here's the panel. the other in the mill.
Keep to your right in the tunnels!
Get- Get away from me
Giddap!
Giddap!
Duke!
Duke, come here boy!
To the ranch, Duke, and get the boys. how'bout exploring that secret passage?
All right.
My father-
They've been torturing him
Not so fast.
Tie him up, Ed
Turn him loose, Tom. or none of ya are gonna see daylight again.
Oh, Father, if there is any gold, show them where it is.
All right, Ryan.
Tell me what's next.
Snake eyes.
Bye-bye, blackbird
Clarence.
Can you get outta there?
I don't know, but I'm trying.
Well?
There it is.
Guess I knew what I was talkin' about. help me lug this out.
Lord, my head's spinnin'... like a top.
Look.
Why, that's the boss's horse.
If he's in trouble, we'll get him out of it.
That's up this shaft.
They're desperate.
Well, make it snappy.
Look.
Let's get outta here.
Up!
Giddap!
Hyah!
Giddap!
Come on, boy, giddap!
Uncover. Uncover.
Uncover.
Uncover.
-Captain Swanson of His Majesty's forces.
-Lieutenant Fouchier.
Fifteen English prisoners for 15 French prisoners.
Sergeant, deliver the prisoners to Lieutenant Fouchier.
Yes, sir. This way, sir.
One of these days, l'm gonna push the open end of a musket down your throat.
Step back into line there.
My apologies, Lieutenant. lt is customary for His Majesty's soldiers, if l may call you that without maligning my sense of proportion, to observe the rules of civilized warfare.
-Yes, sir.
-Tripe.
-Who said that?
-l did.
Did you ever see a white man teach an lndian to walk up under a flag of truce and blast a soldier from a gun hidden under a blanket?
-What's your name?
-His name is James Smith.
What do you mean by talking for him?
Professor sometimes talks for me.
Corporal, hold these men for court-martial.
They'll pluck those cocky rooster feathers out of your tail
-for court-martialing civilians.
-Civilians indeed.
-Deserters, more likely.
-We're civilians!
Born in Pennsylvania, taken three years ago by Caughnawaga lndians.
We're initiated to the tribe.
You can tell your story to a court-martial. lf you're not a fool, l reckon you'll listen to it here!
We escaped while the tribe visited Quebec.
The French caught us and here we are.
Shackle these men with the rest of the deserters.
We're civilians!
You've no right to hold us here!
Colonel Clapp, Captain Swanson. l'd like to get you behind a barn, back home in Pennsylvania !
Jim !
And the Professor.
-Where have you been?
-We were taken by the Caughnawagas.
-You still got your scalps.
-They made us blood brothers.
-Are these friends of yours?
-Aye. Let me introduce you.
There's Jim Smith and the Professor.
From Pennsylvania. l thought they were dead.
They've been missing these three years.
The best lndian fighters in the colonies.
All right, Corporal, you may release them.
You'd better read your dispatch, Captain.
Gentlemen, Quebec is English.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Quebec is British.
That closes the frontier.
There's no more stirring up the lndians against us.
No more massacres.
Thank God.
General Wolfe said he'd do it and he's done it.
General Wolfe is dead, sir.
He died with his face to the enemy. l guess we can go home now, Mac.
Maybe our stomachs found a friend.
All right, come on, boys.
You've had your hot meal.
Now back to work.
Break stone, Teagle, help Spode with that axle.
-MacDougall.
-Hiya, laddie. l heard you was up in Canada with
General Wolfe, fighting the French. l was just showing the General how to fight lndians. l killed 30 Onondagas in one day. Aye.
-No.
-Aye.
How dead lndians do multiply!
Well, maybe it was 20 Onondagas, but that's not to be saying that a MacDougall like myself couldn't have killed 30 if he had a mind to.
They're bosom cronies of mine.
-This is Jim Smith and the Professor.
-How are you?
-Strangers around here, ain't you?
-We've been away a little while.
This is Gary Smith's laddie.
-Oh, yeah.
-Could you spare a mite of that grub?
Oh, fall to, lads. We've had ours, but there's plenty hanging. l suppose you wouldn't be having a snifter of whiskey, just a wee drop?
You know, my appetite's not so good without a bit of a tonic just to wet my whistle.
No, Mac, we don't traffic in firewater.
We only carry trade goods for the lndians.
-Trade goods?
-l thought the border was closed.
Don't have to be, now that the French have surrendered Quebec.
Colonel Brady's out in Ohio making treaties with the lnjuns now.
They're real friendly-like, the lnjuns.
The only friendly lndians are dead lndians, l say. lf we don't trade with them, the French will.
You know how they stir them up against us, with firewater. lt's a patriotic duty we're doing.
Did you ask Tom Lowther about this patriotism?
The lndians beat in his boy's head with a musket and left it sticking in his skull.
Rum !
So you don't carry any spirits.
Stop! Where are my spoons?
Stop, thief! Stop!
Five pewter spoons missing and a tankard.
Blast them for the thieves that they are and blast me for the trusting woman l am !
Now, Janie, that'll do, l'll have no swearing from a daughter of mine.
So, you're back.
Now, now, lassie, it was no fault of mine. l was coming home, sober as a judge, when, bang, without even a word of apology, a patrol got hold of me and pressed me into the army.
Against my will.
Even when l told them what a beautiful and dutiful daughter l had.
Who'd tend the tavern while you're away, swilling army rum?
What, me?
Why, l've got the best here in the cellar at home.
That you can't get at.
Oh, Mac, don't go away and leave me again.
Take me with you like you used to.
Oh, you contrary female MacDougall!
No.
Hello, Janie.
Put me down, Mac.
And the Professor, they're back from the very mouth of the grave.
They'd all say,
''He's dead, you'd better forget him.''
And l'd say ''Sure, he's dead, he's forgotten,'' but l knew it wasn't so. l didn't let myself know anything else, l knew you'd come back.
And just where were you, and what were you doing?
-Well, a...
-Oh, no, no, l don't care.
You're here now.
Blast it, Mac, do you have to stand around and watch a girl make a fool of herself?
Get in and get your rum.
And you, too, Professor. lt is a wee bit chilly.
You've grown up, Janie. lsn't that much nicer, for both of us?
Still the same shameless wench.
Am l supposed to be ashamed? l will be if you want me to, but l don't feel ashamed,
-not before the man l'm going to marry.
-Marry?
Yes, you gave me your word, you promised, don't you remember?
There's another girl!
Somewhere you've hitched yourself to another girl!
Blast you for a bigamist scoundrel!
-Your temper is no better.
-l'll have the law on you! l'll have you put in stocks for breaking your promise!
-l promised a half-grown girl.
-Half-grown? Half-grown?
Stop whimpering about marriage.
We're very hungry and tired men.
Come inside, Jim.
Half-grown, am l?
Well, l'm full-grown, now. l killed 40 Onondagas in one day.
The barrel of my gun, it got so hot, l used it to warm up the rum toddies. lt got so hot, l...
The war is over, Mac. Come on, get behind the bar and work for your keep.
Woe is me. l'm a victim of the skirling blood of the MacDougalls.
Janie, are you happy?
Oh, mind your pig.
What am l to do?
The whole town knows we were going to be married.
Now you've changed your mind.
Why don't you put a rein to your nimble imagination, girl?
Let him do his own talking.
The Professor always talks for me.
You only thought he promised.
They'll point me out as a girl who was left.
Well, then, marry and fool them.
Who'll have me after you've tossed me aside?
Well, l don't know.
You're not bad to look at. l think so, too.
But maybe it's because we've lived with lndians so long.
You're an lndian, cruel and merciless!
Janie, l'm no man for you.
-He's going over the far hills too much.
-l wouldn't care! l wouldn't ask for anything except to go with you.
You can't die once, and then come alive and go away again. lt's like making me see you die twice, l couldn't stand it.
Jed, Tom... lndians. lndians. They're all around Fort Pitt.
Shawnee and Delaware.
They've burned the town and they've scalped the kids in school at McDowell's Mill.
Let's be on the way, boys.
McDowell's Mill is 20 miles from here.
-Any more guns in the house?
-Two long rifles.
Well, l know where we can get some more.
You're not going again, Jim, you're not!
Mac, Mac, tell him not to go!
Don't be a fool, lassie, you know what we have to do.
All dead, Jim. Horrible.
Dirty, murdering heathens. l'm taking my family and leaving while we're still alive.
Aye. l'm fair sick of it.
A remarkably fine season and what good is it?
You can't harvest for fear of bloodthirsty barbarians.
Men, if the Conococheague settlements stand firm the country will have some little sort of safety.
Safe for the blasted tradesmen.
For the fields of corn you planted.
For the plenty we've taken and will take from this land. l will water it with my blood before l give it up.
-And l.
-And l.
Everybody accounted for?
All except Jacob Miller's two kids.
They must have taken them alive.
Mrs. Lewis, do you know if Jacob Miller's kids got taken?
Mrs. Lewis? l picked up the tracks.
About 20 of them. Delawares, l think. l'm not sure, but they seem to have a couple of youngsters with them.
-Any missing?
-Yes. l want about 10 men with me.
Stewart, Calhoon, M'Cammon, Professor.
You got plenty of charcoal over there,
M'Cammon?
Yes, and plenty of bear grease.
Now, we're traveling light, so are the Delawares but they'll be held back because they're carrying the kids along.
Twenty of them. lt's just the odds l like. l'll kill them myself like l did them Onondagas in one day. l wanna see your guns.
Trade musket. They're no good.
They misfire too often.
Sorry, M'Cammon, we can't take you with us. lf it misfires, Jim, l'll use my knife. l'm only taking men with long rifles, M'Cammon.
-Mac! Mac!
-Janie, lassie. What brought you here?
With lndians loose, you might have been scalped from your eyebrows to your shoulder blades.
Here, l'll get somebody to take you back. l'm not going back. l've seen what the lndians did and l'm going with you.
-l forbid it.
-What?
Positively.
You forbid it?
How much is this valley your home?
Did you see those bullet holes in the walls of the tavern?
Who fought off the lndians? Not you.
You were always busy somewhere else fighting somebody else's fight.
And now you're forbidding me to fight my own.
-Get back to the tavern, girl.
-Let her come along.
Oh, Jim.
Jim, you're a fine and generous man.
All right, off with your shirts.
Smear your bodies.
We're lndians, you know.
Well, off with your shirt. lf you travel with us you travel like the rest of us.
How sly. How very sly.
We'll need your long rifle.
-Here's your weapon, M'Cammon.
-Thanks.
Some of you boys see that Janie gets home.
They didn't come out here.
We'll have to split up, Jim.
Delawares. They've gone upstream.
Mac, you take the right bank, l'll take the left. l want him alive.
Jim, 20 lndians a day has always been my minimum.
Don't leave me at 19. l'll never be able to hold me head up again.
Come on, we'll get the water out of him.
Oh, darn, Jim, laddie.
They trade muskets and trade tomahawks.
-Everybody all right?
-All right.
All here.
Gather up the rifles and the powder horns.
English cartouche box.
What regiment is it, Tom?
Why, that's Colonel Brady's regiment.
He's supposed to be out on the Ohio making treaties.
He said they wiped out Brady and the men.
We teach them everything, don't we, Tom?
His Excellency, Governor Penn, will see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
What is the meaning of this intrusion? l sent word l'd see you tomorrow.
What we've got to say can't wait till tomorrow.
-Why, how dare...
-Our apologies, Your Excellency,
-we're Conococheague Valley men.
-l see.
Frightful tragedy, frightful.
This is General Gage, in command of His Majesty's forces.
We've come to request Your Excellency to forbid trade with the lndians, and to ask military protection for the valley. l understand and sympathize with you, but l have judged it consistent with the good of His Majesty's service to order all available troops westward to meet the lndians on their own grounds.
While they murder us on our grounds.
We're carrying out a military policy designed to guarantee the permanent security of the frontier.
Haven't you eyes enough to see that?
We've eyes enough to see only our own dead.
Colonel Brady has received the lndian chieftains...
Colonel Brady will receive no more chieftains...
What's that? What's that?
Dead men make no peace treaties.
-What are you saying?
-Colonel Brady and his men are dead.
Dead?
Their heads split open with tomahawks made by white men.
''A proclamation. From this day all persons whosoever they may be,
''are forbidden to trade with lndians.
''Anyone failing to heed this warning, does so at his own peril.
''The Valley of the Conococheague is forthwith taxed £1 per capita
''for the erection of Fort Loudoun, and the maintenance of His Majesty's troop
''to be permanently stationed there for the protection of said valley.
''John Penn. God save the King.''
This is the reward of aiding the mother country with her trade.
Warehouses filled with goods.
Goods that cost us hard cash, fetched 3,000 miles from England.
Must we endure it?
What's the army for, if not to protect business?
And what's government for, if not to protect business?
Certainly not to interfere with it.
Gentlemen, you still do business with the army, don't you? lt will take 20 years for the army to buy up the supplies we have on hand, and furthermore, there's no profit in it. l wasn't thinking of that.
You'll have a military permit to take goods through to the outlying forts, won't you?
Yes.
Now, if a shipping clerk made a mistake, and sent a few wagonloads of trade goods through with the military supplies, they'd be traveling under the protection of a military pass, wouldn't they?
-Barmaid, barmaid!
-Yes, sir.
Another for each of us.
All right, boys. Get out the musket balls.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt. Right.
Put the musket balls aside.
We load them on the top. l'll kill the man that drops a keg of that rum.
-This is it, sir.
-Give the order to halt, Sergeant.
-Company, halt!
-Company, halt!
A tavern?
Their magistrates and commissioners meet in a tavern?
Yes, sir.
Most every place in the outlying sections, the tavern's sort of community public house,
-government quarters, newspaper...
-Accompany me inside, Sergeant.
Yes, sir. l'm Captain Swanson.
Who's in charge here?
Magistrate Duncan and Magistrate Morris, they're in charge.
Glad to meet you, gentlemen. l'm sure we shall get on.
May l say how grateful we are to have you and your men, Captain?
Your gratitude belongs to the Crown,
Mr. Magistrate.
We're all servants of His Majesty.
Now, as to provisions,
Sergeant McGlashan will weekly requisition our needs.
You'll be given army certificates redeemable in cash.
-That ought to be satisfactory.
-We'll be happy to accommodate you, sir.
All provisions delivered to the fort are to be in prime condition.
Any attempts to supply provisions of inferior quality will be met by severe rebuke.
Severe rebuke.
Do l make myself clear, gentlemen?
You don't know us, sir, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.
You will notify me each week when the provisions arrive.
-Yes, sir.
-l will make the inspections myself.
That's all, gentlemen.
Why, the uppish gamecock.
-l demand that man's arrest.
-On what charge?
The man was in contempt of court.
You're not sitting in a military session, exchanging prisoners now,
Captain Swanson.
For which l'm grateful. l rather resent the army gambling on exchange and losing.
This is a civil court.
And l advise you to keep that kind of a tongue in your head.
Jim, Captain Jim !
Them blackguards has took up the trade again.
They come through Shippensburg this morning, three wagons.
-You mean with trade goods?
-Yes.
They wouldn't dare, they wouldn't dare.
With the King's proclamation on the door of every inn and every magistrate's house.
-lt must be army goods.
-lt ain't. l seen them. lt's paint, knives and hatchets and powder.
You'll turn them back, of course.
Are you sure of your information?
Sure of it? l tried to reason with them.
They said, ''Get the devil out of the valley if you're scared of lndians.''
-Why weren't they stopped at Carlisle?
-Stop them?
They've got a military permit signed by the Commanding Officer in Philadelphia.
You must be mistaken. lf the goods are under permit, they're military supplies. l ain't mistaken.
Are you implying that my commanding officer is corrupt?
You'd best mind your tongue.
He's implying nothing, but for us to let those goods go through would be committing suicide. l'll arrest any man that interferes with a military permit.
Then you're going to let the goods go through?
My orders were to protect the frontier, and to teach a wholesome respect for the
Sovereign law and His Majesty's forces.
Those orders will be carried out, even if l have to declare martial law.
And to think we asked for them.
The swine, the crooked swine.
We'll stop them ourselves. lf it's force you're thinking of using, you'd best forget it.
-You'll end in hanging.
-Then we'll hang.
At least we'll die with our scalps intact.
Calhoon, l think you could do with a drink,
-as can Mac...
-Aye.
...and the Professor.
M'Cammon and a few of you other boys, come to my room.
Janie, bring some hot toddies.
Looks like it's going to be a cold night out.
We've work to do.
-Ready?
-Aye.
Aye.
Blankets off.
Each man 10 feet apart.
Shoot over their heads.
Get rid of that blanket.
What's the matter with you?
-Are you drunk?
-You're choking me.
Janie, what kind of a joke is this? lt's not a joke, Jim. lf you're going to hang, l'll hang with you.
That's the least you can let me do.
Ah, the female MacDougalls were all famed for their tenderness.
The lass is fair daft about you, Jimmy.
All right, men.
Hold it!
Steady down these horses!
Listen to me!
Take these loads out in the clearing and pile them all in one place.
And be fast about it.
Take whatever government property you may be carrying and clear out. Get out!
All right, boys.
Pile the rest of this stuff up, boys.
We're going to light a little fire of our own.
Get all the stuff out of all those wagons. l don't think the government is going to like very much this destruction of their property.
Come in.
-Sorry to disturb you, sir, but...
-l'm Callendar. l pack train for Poole and Simmons,
Philadelphia.
-Charmed.
-We contract army supplies.
Go on, get on with it, get on with it.
A pack of blasted settlers, dressed like lndians, attacked my train and burned the army goods.
Army goods?
There's a cartouche box.
That's all that's left.
The shot's melted down, the powder is...
-McGlashan, call out the squad.
-Yes, sir.
-Nearly murdered me and my men.
-Rabble, cutthroats, criminals!
Destroy His Majesty's goods, will they? l'll teach them the meaning of the King's name, if l have to write it across their backs with a lash!
Look alive, men.
-Quick, get him.
-Aye, he's one of them. l'll brook no escape.
You can still see the black paint behind his ears.
That's dirt. l never wash behind the ears.
Let go! lt's a girl!
Hold her.
The man that loosens her receives 30 days' bread and water.
Who were the others with you?
What were their names?
Just like that.
You'll wear the seat out of those silk britches before l talk.
Janie!
What did you take her for?
-For destroying King's property.
-She's destroyed no King's property.
McGlashan, clear this rabble.
You'll not take the lass to Fort Loudoun without a warrant.
By the living Jehoshaphat, l'll blow out your heart.
You'll do what, you treasonable dog?
Disarm them.
Now, shall we get on to the fort, McGlashan?
Yes, sir.
Company, halt!
What do you mean by halting the King's men with an armed mob?
We want those prisoners, Captain.
You took them without warrant.
-There's still English law in the valley.
-They're British and freeborn. lf they're to stand trial, it will be before 12 of their peers, not before the likes of you. l've an idea they'd be court-martialed for treason, is that true?
And suppose it is?
Suppose l send them to Carlisle for court-martial, what will you do about it?
We'll do this.
We'll be forced to fire on you.
No, Jim, Mac, we'll go with them.
Move the prisoners to the rear and fix bayonets.
No.
Perhaps you'll understand we mean to have those prisoners. l'll release them only to your magistrate under the condition they stand trial for treason. l'll see that they stand trial.
Release the prisoners.
Release the prisoners.
Will you promise to stop the traders?
You have this promise, that any man who interferes with a military permit will make the acquaintance of the hangman.
Shoulder your firelocks, quick step, march.
We'll sew up this valley so tight, a cricket can't get in or out without our say-so.
No. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
-Stop. The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
-The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
Turn back. The valley is closed. Turn back.
''Men of the Conococheague,
''you are to come to MacDougall's Tavern
''and fill yourselves with liquor and swearing.
''There is a large bounty for everyone, military goods.
''We'll have Captain Swanson whipped or hanged.''
Don't you think this is a little obvious?
You gotta make it plain.
Them people are thick-headed.
''We may do as we please for we have the law and government in our hands.
''Any bounty captured must be spent in our town,
''the only town tolerating drinking, swearing, Sabbath-breaking,
''and any outrage we have a mind to do.
''Signed, James Smith and his
Black Boys of the Conococheague.''
Well, it should convince the Governor he's dealing with rioters and rebels.
They've blockaded the valley.
No word can get through except what they choose.
They wouldn't dare treat
His Majesty's troops with such indignity.
They've no respect for law.
Their magistrates are with them, leading them.
Have Magistrate Duncan come in. l've called their magistrate to Philadelphia.
Magistrate Duncan.
This gentleman informs me that you've encouraged and protected rioters in the Conococheague Valley in their illegal and disorderly proceedings.
There have been no illegal nor disorderly proceedings.
Burned my goods. They burned my goods.
The pack train was illegal,
Your Excellency, contrary to your proclamation.
There's what's left of the military supplies.
Does that look like trade goods?
This gentleman has been misinformed.
They were not government goods.
Were government troops fired upon?
Not one shot has been fired against the royal garrison, Your Excellency. l swear those goods were lndian trade goods.
More than that l cannot say.
More than that l will say.
My pack leader managed to evade the blockade.
Callendar.
Where's that advertisement?
These were found nailed to the trees all through the Conococheague Valley.
The one you have in your hand was taken from the wall of MacDougall's Tavern.
Sound reason for everything they've done, indeed.
Bloody-minded cutthroats!
May l see it, sir?
There's something queer about this advertisement, mighty queer.
No Conococheague man ever did this. l find it disagreeably necessary to apply to General Gage for the assistance of His Majesty's troops.
Reinforcements will be ready to march in a week. l demand military escort for my supply train.
You shall have it.
You will issue a warrant for the apprehension of James Smith.
You will lend your assistance in discovering and apprehending all persons who may be concerned. l issue no warrants against Jim Smith or any of the valley men.
-Jim? Where's Jim?
-There he is.
Jim, they're issuing a warrant for your arrest. You've got to leave.
Governor Penn himself is issuing it.
And General Gage is sending reinforcements in a few days to put down the insurrection.
-You must go, Jim.
-No.
Those traders will do anything to hang you.
And Gage has promised them military escort for their pack trains.
Callendar will probably rush through a train before the reinforcements arrive.
He'll be afraid to wait with too many soldiers about.
He will that, if he's carrying lndian trade goods.
-Well, we'll let the train through.
-Let it through?
Jim, are you crazy?
What is it, Jim?
What are you thinking about?
We'll use him as bait for a trap. lf Fort Loudoun becomes a warehouse for illegal goods, its commandant is done for. lt'll be proof that he's unlawfully conniving with traders.
We'll prove we're not rebels.
We have him now. He's taken the bait.
Tell the valley men to come to MacDougall's.
Jim Smith wants you to come to MacDougall's!
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's.''
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-MacDougall's.
Come to MacDougall's.
James, there's your search warrant, and it's all in order.
You'd better come along to serve it.
Just a minute, men.
M'Cammon, Calhoon, Stewart,
Lewis and Janie here are out on bail.
We promised the Captain they'd be tried for treason.
Now it isn't beholden for men out on bail to be appearing before a fort making demands. lf you think it'll be hurting you, then l'll stay.
That won't be necessary, Tom.
We'll try you immediately.
Jim, you can appear for the defense. l'll choose a jury, and if it isn't to your liking you can object.
The prisoners over there before the bar and the jurymen down here on this side of the table, as l call off your names.
Burke, Callahan, Brown, Reynolds,
Allison, Bouquet, Forbes, Spears,
Josephs, Owens, Grant, Pierry.
-Jim, have you any objections?
-No objections.
Gentlemen, what is your verdict on Tom Calhoon?
Not guilty.
-John M'Cammon?
-Not guilty.
-Stewart?
-Not guilty.
-Lewis?
-Not guilty.
-Janie McDougall?
-Guilty.
-What?
-Guilty as charged.
MacDougall, the court charges you to lock your daughter in the wine cellar until the court has time to pass sentence.
-You...
-Come along, lassie.
The moment you began whispering, l knew it was some filthy lndian trick! l think you'd best forget him.
He's bad medicine for lasses.
Mac, what, what's the matter with me?
Why does he treat me like this?
Janie-wanie, you called him right, lndian.
To him a squaw belongs at home. l hate him.
Aye, and if you're like your mother, you'll break your heart with your hate.
Go on with ye, you MacDougall, you.
Something must be amiss. They let me by.
They've no stomach for firing on troops.
They had the look of cats that had just swallowed a flock of birds.
They're all about the fort, sir, close to 300 of them, armed.
-Shut and bolt the gates.
-l've already done that, sir.
Order full garrison on the wall.
What do you mean by coming here with that rabble? ln the name of public safety, we want permission to inspect the trader's goods stored in your fort.
You've a rare appreciation of public order with an armed mob at your back. l have a search warrant to inspect the goods.
The goods are under my protection. l've orders from General Gage.
Here, do you see this?
That's General Gage's own order.
What more do you want?
Here, do you see this? lt's the King's proclamation.
We want to see the goods.
Nothing short of that will satisfy the people around here.
You'll inspect no goods in my care. l've my orders. lt might be as well to remember, this road is not a military road.
And while we're talking, you might get it through your head.
We built your fort.
We'll not have it used against us.
Now, will you let us in? l will not.
You're using our fort as a storehouse for illegal goods.
According to the King's proclamation, you're a criminal.
And we'll deal with you as a criminal.
Back, boys.
Be back, boys.
We'll kill every mother's son of them, the dirty rattlesnakes!
Come on, let's get him out of the road.
McGlashan, those men were under a flag of truce.
-Arrest the man who fired that shot.
-Yes, sir.
Don't jiggle him so much, lads. l'll put a torch to that fort myself, if l die doing it.
That was no army musket, Tom. lt was a long rifle.
That's right, it couldn't have been a soldier. lt was one of Callendar's men. l never even shot an lndian in the back.
Jim, we'd better ride you back to the doctor.
No, we gotta take that fort before reinforcements get here.
We must have the proof.
Then let's charge them.
That's what they expect.
Their muskets won't carry this far, our long rifles will.
So we'll fire on the fort, and keep firing. ln shifts.
One shift will rest while the other keeps firing.
They won't dare go to sleep waiting for us to charge.
But we won't.
We'll just keep firing.
Jim, could we no kill two or three of them maybe?
There'll be no killings, Mac.
Don't you think you'd better get back to the surgeon, Jim?
Give the order to fire.
-Full garrison on the wall, sir.
-Keep your men ready, Sergeant.
Tell them to hold their fire and watch for the assault.
Yes, sir.
Hold your fire, and watch for the assault!
Sergeant McGlashan.
Yes, sir.
Tell the men to get to the bottom of the barricade where the logs are the thickest.
Yes, sir.
And tell them that the first man that falls asleep
-gets 20 lashes to keep him awake.
-Yes, sir.
Stay awake, men. Stay awake.
They'll attack the moment you fall asleep.
Stay awake. Come along there. Wake up.
Wake up there. Wake up.
Sorry, sir.
-That's all right, lad, just stay awake.
-Yes, sir.
Two hour shifts today.
-How's Jim?
-He's all right. Let's keep going.
Come on. Two hour shifts today.
We need more powder and ball. l've got 50 kegs at the tavern.
-Take 20 horses, men, and go get them.
-Aye.
Good morning, lass.
Did you have a good night last night?
You men do it well, tormenting a girl.
-You must be born with the gift.
-Now, now, lassie.
Jim Smith and the magistrate's put you here for your own safety.
The powder is through there, lads.
-Mac, is a fight on?
-Aye, a grand fight. l killed 20 of 'em me self.
A great pity you can't scalp them. lt's no civilized to scalp white men.
Put some vigor in it, lads.
Jim Smith's waiting.
Jim Smith.
Put those kegs down.
Are ye crazy?
We're running short of ammunition.
Tell Jim Smith to get it somewhere else.
This is my powder and it stays here.
Now, put them down.
Just as things were going our way.
You'll be run out of the valley.
Well, maybe l will, but l'll be here long enough to see that, that white lndian hanging from a gallows.
Now, now, lassie, that's no way to be talking of a man who's half dead from a soldier's bullet.
-Oh, no, Mac, no.
-Aye, Janie, aye. lt'll be a miracle if he lasts out the day. lf you've let him be killed, l'll shoot the lot of you, every last man of you.
Heave ho, me lads, heave ho.
Jim !
-Where's Jim?
-Right there, by the fire.
Jim !
Darling, darling, darling.
How did you get out?
Do you think anything would keep me?
Do you think l'd let you die alone?
Die? Who said l was going to die?
Mac said so.
Oh, it's only in the shoulder, but if you're really set, l might die...
You wouldn't be doing that if l wasn't just a little bit helpless.
Now, what kind of a fool would l be, if l didn't take advantage of my opportunities?
Let's look at that.
Go away. lf he's a bit warm, it's that kissing business, not the bullet.
A white flag! Hold your fire. A white flag!
Jim, Jim. The white flag.
First we want the trade goods.
Second, he and his men are to get out of the valley.
We asked for them here, now we don't want them. They're to git.
Yes, sir.
And they may keep their weapons.
They agreed, Jim.
Heads up, lads. Heads up.
Show this rabble our heads are up.
Open the gates.
-Give the order to march, Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.
Squads right, march!
Forward, march!
Captain Swanson.
Company, halt.
Jim Smith would like words with you.
The goods are in the fort.
There's one thing we want you to understand.
We're law-abiding men.
There is one thing l do understand.
You're a lot of blasted traitors.
We whipped him !
We whipped the saucy peacock. l claim his scalp. ln the name of the law, l'll lift his scalp from his eyebrows to his shoulder blades!
Mac!
Let me at him.
He's worse than the black lndian devil. ln the name of the law.
Law-abiding men, loyal subjects.
Drunken rabble you are, but l'll be back! l'll be back and you'll pay for this!
Forward march.
-Forward...
-Forward.
...march!
Stop where you are, Callendar.
We're free to go with Swanson.
You'll go with Swanson later.
Get back to the fort.
Listen, men, wait a minute. l'm just a driver. l didn't have anything to do with the goods.
Thank you.
Jim better this morning?
He thinks he is, but he's not. l say we stay and fight.
We've whipped them once, and we'll whip them again.
Fight 200 regulars?
They'll probably come with cannon.
Magistrate Morris, load a wagon full of the trade goods.
Take it to General Gage in Philadelphia.
M'Cammon knows the south hills.
You'll avoid the troops that way.
But that might take several weeks.
The rest of us can hide in Martin's Rock.
They're 10 miles away, Jim.
That cock-sparrow Swanson is with them.
We'd better get started.
Then we'll have to tie you on your horse, Jim.
He can't hide in a cave. He'll die. l won't let him go.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke.
Back to the tavern, girl.
Back to the tavern.
Let men go about the work they've got to do.
Easy, lad, let us do most of the work.
When you get to Philadelphia, speak to no one but General Gage or Governor Penn.
And God go with you.
Come on, men, put some backbone into it.
Give me your foot. Put your arm around my shoulders. Careful!
-Put him in the cart, men.
-Janie.
-Put that gun down.
-l won't. l'm not going to be a widow before l'm even a wife. l forbid you to use such talk before all these men. lt's no becoming to a female McDougall.
Do you think l care what's becoming and what's not?
He'll die and just because he wants to be a big, brave, loyal chief.
He won't leave his men.
Well, his men can go hang for all of me.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke, if l have to kill you and him to do it!
Well, there's something in what the lass says.
She's a hysterical, arrogant shrew, and shouldn't be trusted with a lethal weapon.
Take it away from her.
Now, now, lassie, calm yourself, calm yourself.
You wouldn't shoot your loving father, would you?
The last male member of the fine line of the MacDougalls.
One more step, Mac, and the fine line is finished.
Wait, Janie,
Dr. Stoke is 15 miles from here. l can take him through.
What else do you think l want with him but to see him alive and safe?
Why do you treat me like a witless child?
Put him in the wagon.
-Put me astride.
-No, Jim, the lass is right.
She'll get you through.
You're being twisted about by a comely face.
She loves you, Jim.
Are we to be the victims of a girl's springtime fancy?
-l'm going with you.
-And me.
You'd do best, Mac, to stay far away from Jim for a while. l'm sorry, Janie, terribly sorry.
Rum and lndian fighting makes a poor mixture for the father of a young lassie. lf l had it to do all over, Mac, l'd pick you again.
''Whereas l have received information that sundry persons have,
''at several times, assembled themselves in armed bodies,
''and have in a most riotous and illegal manner
''presumed to interrupt the passage of supplies to the fort,
''l do hereby require all His Majesty's subjects
''to give such evidence as to apprehend all persons
''concerned in the leading of these riots
''so that the offenders may be prosecuted according to law.
''Signed, John Penn.''
God save the King.
Disperse them and get on with it.
Next prisoner.
Driving his cattle into the swamp and refused to billet. lsn't he one of the scum that whipped me? lt looks like him.
Put him in irons.
Turn them over.
-Another one.
-All right, stand in line. Stand up.
Put his leg irons on first.
Heave ho, here we go.
All right, get the other one.
Stay on your feet!
All right, stand over there.
Come over there.
Prepared to talk, gentlemen? l want James Smith.
The man that tells me where he is, wins full pardon. lf you'd serve your King with one-tenth the loyalty you serve that treasonable dog Smith, you wouldn't be in jail this moment!
Jim, Jim Smith! Jim !
He's not here. l know he's here, Janie. l've got to see him.
-He's not here. ls he, Doctor?
-No, he's not here.
-Jim, Jim Smith, it's Anderson.
-Shut up, you blasted...
-Will Anderson! Will Anderson!
-He's not here, l tell you.
-Shut up!
-You looking for me, Will?
Jim, they've got half the valley in irons.
No warrants, no trials.
Just a trader's word and you're in chains.
They're even paying off men that ain't had nothing to do with it.
You just don't have to like them to find yourself accused and convicted of riot, arson and armed robbery. l'll be right down.
Dr. Stoke said you're not well enough to go. lt's finally come. l knew it would, and now's as good a time as any. lt's been so pleasant here, Jim. l sometimes even thought that...
They think more of money than they do of men. l said, l sometimes thought that you thought...
No more trading with lndians.
Jim, Jim, please don't go.
Don't let me have to stay behind and die inside of me.
Troops sit in forts and the settlers die.
Let us get up to save ourselves, and they move fast enough.
All right, go ahead.
Go ahead, l don't care!
Get shot or hung from a scaffold!
We've obeyed the law, they've broken it.
You've always torn and twisted the heart out of me. l've loved you from the first minute l can remember, and you've brought me nothing but misery.
Well, l didn't expect much more, so l asked for nothing, and l'm not asking for much now.
You fool. You cruel, merciless fool.
Come, magistrate, join the fun.
What are you men going to do?
We are going to stand the red coats on their thick heads.
Your stomach's got to be right to take a whore.
They've gone to report to the fort.
We'll give them a half-hour start.
They are all drunk at McDougall's, bragging that they are going to take the fort.
McGlashan, take a squad and bring those men here.
Yes, sir.
Nine men are going to take the fort.
And nine drunks are going to take the fort.
The garrison's all asleep. The gate's open.
There are only three sentries on the wall, this side.
The guard's away across the parade ground, by the kitchen.
They're getting the morning rum ration. lt's grand rum. l could almost taste the smell of it.
The guns are stacked together, full 40 paces nearer to the gate than what they are.
All right, when we run, run crouched in the mist.
Put down those muskets.
Come on down and join the party.
Calhoon, stand at the barracks door and keep them inside.
Shoot the first one that shows his head.
Find your commandant.
Tell him if there's one move, l'll blow daylight through these men.
Yes, sir.
Mac, open the guardhouse.
Get those prisoners out here.
Will, get the flints out of those muskets.
Now, Corporal, find your blacksmith and fetch him here.
Yes, sir.
All right, lads, all right.
That's the last one, Mac.
Let me do for him, Jim !
Let me do for him once and for all!
Why not add murder to your traitorous acts?
You'll never learn, will you?
You'll never learn to know us.
Take him to his quarters.
We'll give him back his fort.
That's a mistake, Jim. l said we'll give it back.
All right, men, you can return to your homes.
And leave those muskets here.
Nine men.
Only nine men.
Nine men.
Nine men!
You'd best give up. We've got you now.
One move and you're dead men.
The boldness of the swine.
He's dead.
Now we have got you, Smith.
You've murdered him.
We'll see you hanged for that.
You killed him. My shot went wild.
You fired and he fell. That's murder.
So that's it.
Tie him to a horse.
We'll take him to jail in Carlisle.
Get the stiff one.
We'll bring him along, too.
What shall l do? They'll tear the jail down.
Well, can't you reason with them?
You're the jailer.
But it's a mob. Can't you do something?
Well, l can talk to them, but they aren't going to like these.
Briggs, Briggs, come here.
Bring your chisel. Take these irons off. l've got a wife and children.
Please, tell them l'm on your side.
Here, Briggs, here, here. Right over here.
Hi, Jim, hi.
Just hang on. We'll get you out.
Mac, much obliged to you and the boys, but it'd look bad if l ran away. lt'd look like l was guilty.
Best way you can help me is to break up.
They're planning to take you back to the fort and court-martial you.
They want you out of the way.
We've done everything according to law up to now.
Make way.
Law? What law?
This kind of law, the law of bayonets? l say burn the jail down.
Burn it down around their ears!
Aye!
Men! Men! l'll talk for Jim Smith. l know what he thinks.
He doesn't want anybody to get fired on by the soldiers.
But if any of us were in there, he'd go in and get us, soldiers or no soldiers!
Janie, hold your tongue.
Tell them, Professor, tell them for me.
Men, we've fought and won, but in winning we've lost something. ln defending one law, we've come to despise all law!
And if you go on like this, we'll destroy the very thing we fight for!
Men, disband.
Go home and let me stand my trial.
-Bring in the accused.
-Yes, sir.
Bring in the prisoner.
You may remove that barbarian from the courtroom.
-He's a witness.
-Remove him.
Step out, you.
Now, laddie, l was only clearing my throat. lt's the right of every free-born Scotsman to clear his throat if he's a mind to. l clear mine a wee bit noisily perhaps.
Now, do not push. Do not push, laddie.
Any lout who feels the need of airing his spleen at the expense of the Court's decorum will find himself dining on bread and water.
Proceed.
-You're sure he's the same man?
-He made no pretense about it.
His attitude throughout was a contempt for authority. He was openly seditious. l object. The defendant is on trial for murder, not for treason. lt is our intention to establish a connection between the two.
He fired on His Majesty's troops, destroyed army supplies, interfered with the King's messengers, released prisoners held by us for court-martial.
The pack-train leader.
Ralph Callendar!
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear or affirm that the evidence you shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? l do.
Did you hear Tom Calhoon offer to turn
King's evidence against James Smith? l did, sir.
When Tom Calhoon said he was going to Philadelphia to swear to the Governor about Jim Smith's treason,
Jim Smith shot him dead. l tried to stop him but Jim fired that shot so sudden and unexpected.
And he was Tom Calhoon's best friend.
Your witness.
Can you identify this, Mr. Callendar?
That there is the shirt that Tom Calhoon was wearing when Jim Smith killed him.
There's the bullet hole.
Can you identify this?
That looks like the gun he shot him with.
Now, how far would you say
Jim Smith was standing from Tom Calhoon, when you say he shot him?
About four feet.
He just put the gun up against him and shot him.
About that?
You're certain of all else you saw, why aren't you certain of this?
That's how far it was, l'm certain.
May l have the Court's permission to make an experiment?
An experiment? l should have thought the facts were sufficiently plain to speak for themselves.
Well, why try my client at all? Why not just hang him and be done with it?
Oh, all right, proceed with the experiment.
All right, Janie. ls that young person loading that weapon?
That young person is a dead shot.
There's no cause for alarm. l shall be personally responsible for any acts committed here.
Get on with it.
This is decidedly irregular and smelly.
How many more of these detonations are we to endure?
Just one.
You will note the shot fired at 20 paces carries a clean hole.
That fired at six inches is deeply studded with powder burns.
You will also notice, gentlemen, that the shirt Tom Calhoon wore carries a clean hole with no evidences of a burn.
Gentlemen, that shot was fired by some other in the crowd, someone else standing many paces away.
Order, order.
Will you permit a scoundrel to go free?
A scoundrel who leads treason and sedition and defies England? ls there to be a stench in this courtroom that will linger for centuries? l protest.
-The man is innocent of the crime.
-You are under arrest, for revealing your decision before a majority vote.
Captain Swanson.
Captain Holmes, place Mr. Poole, Ralph Callendar and the drivers under arrest for breaking the King's proclamation and transporting illegal trade-goods.
Captain Swanson, you'll retire to your quarters.
-l'll talk to you there.
-Yes, sir. l am a soldier, sir.
They could have been carrying the murderer of my own father, if they'd had a permit for it. l would have defended him with my life.
There is such a thing as understanding, Captain.
-Yes but...
-l know, l know.
We haven't taught soldiers to soften themselves at understanding.
We'll probably suffer for it.
Well, l've ordered the release of Jim Smith.
And l'm sorry, Captain Swanson, but l must relieve you of your command.
You'll report to Philadelphia and prepare to leave for England.
Yes, sir.
-Goodbye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye.
Sure you don't want to go, Mac?
Those Tennessee hills are big, wild and away from the crowd.
There'll be you and me and Professor and our surveyor friend.
Mac, are you thinking of leaving me?
This is your home, Jim.
You'll be back, l know.
Make it soon lad. We'll miss you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, Janie, even the worst of enemies must part.
Don't forget us, Jim.
Don't ever forget us.
Not for one small minute.
-Now, lass.
-l'll do my own talking.
There's so much for a man to do that there's no time for, well, other things.
But if there was time, l mean, if l was inclined, l mean... lt wouldn't be any other woman.
Only you.
-Bye, boys.
-Bye, lad.
Janie, where are you going?
With my man.
You've the skirling blood of the... lf she ain't a contrary female MacDougall!
Wilt thou, Magdelana Borst...
take this man to thy wedded husband...
to love, comfort, honor and obey him, and forsaking all others... keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Oh!
Wilt thou, Gilbert Martin, take this woman to thy wedded wife... to love, comfort and honor her... and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
- I will.
- Let us pray.
O Almighty God, look down upon and bless these two young people... as they go forth this day into the wilderness...
to make for themselves a new home.
Guide them,
Gracious Father... protect and keep them through all the trials and vicissitudes of life... that they may never cease to remember this hour... and this pledge of love which they have given, one to the other...
in thy sacred sight.
Amen.
And now, in the name of the Father... and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
I pronounce you man and wife.
What God hath joined together...
let not man put asunder.
Kiss her, my son.
- Lana! Lana, throw it!
- Good-bye.
- God bless you, Gilbert.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye, son.
Good-bye, Mrs. -
Mother.
- Take good care of her.
Wait till she sees this.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
- That sure was a nice weddin'.
- Wasn't it?
- The cow hitched easy?
- Cow?
- Giddyap.
- Mother, good-bye.
Bye.
- Good-bye.
- Oh, no, my friends.
It's always been like this since Bible days.
Every generation must make its own way in one place or another.
- It's the most beautiful country I've ever seen.
- I told you so.
The Mohawk Valley is the prettiest place in the whole country, for a fact.
Susie.
Gin.
Have one. Just especial, seeing it's tonight.
- You folks come far?
- Yes. Albany.
- Where?
- Albany!
- Albany.
- Yes.
Been married long?
Oh, not so long.
How long?
Not so long!
I- I thought that's what you said.
I knew it the minute
I laid eyes on ya.
Honeymooners.
You got it written all over both of you.
Honeymooners!
To your health, madam, sir.
You planning on settling here in the valley?
Yes. I have a place at Deerfield.
Deerfield? That's pretty far out of the way, isn't it?
Yes, but it suits me.
What political party do you folks up that way belong to?
The American.
Any Tories?
Not that I know of. Why?
Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering.
They say the Indians are going to line up with the British, but I suppose that's just talk.
Well, good night.
That's a queer one, ain't he?
Too many questions to suit me.
And that patch over his eye-
I bet he lost it trying to see something that wasn't none of his business.
Good night.
Good night now.
Good night.
You didn't get scared, did you, at what that fella just said... about the Tories and the Indians?
I wasn't even thinking about Indians.
What were you thinking about?
I was just wondering... if you love me as much as I love you.
Are there always flies like this?
In the real woods there are.
It must be gonna rain, though, the way these take hold.
You'll get used to 'em up here, though.
Lana, we're home now! Look!
I'll get a fire going.
It's just a cabin, but-
Well, I've always thought it would be nice living in a cabin.
It's so handy to look after things when it's small.
It seemed so fine to me because I built it.
I didn't realize it might look different to a girl... who'd been raised in a big house like yours.
Oh, it's all right, Gil.
Beginning this way... we'll like our things even better when we get them.
Oh, Lana.
Just wait till I put up the mare and we get something to eat and feel warmer. We'll-
Things will look different then.
You'd better take those wet things off, Lana.
You'll be sick.
No! Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil!
Oh, Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil!
- Get him! Do something!
- Why, Lana, that's only Blue Back.
- He'll murder us! He'll murder us!
- Lana, stop that!
Gil-
I'm sorry, Lana.
I had to do it.
You've gotta get a hold of yourself.
This is my wife, Blue Back.
She's kind of nervous and tired out.
We had a long, hard trip in the rain and everything.
Sure. Much rain.
I guess she didn't expect anybody to drop in at a time like this.
Me go hunting.
Bring you half deer. Hang outside.
Half deer, huh? Well, that's mighty fine of you, Blue Back. Thanks.
Sit down. I got some rum outside.
We'll have a drink together.
No. Me go now.
Come back again, maybe.
Sure, any time.
- You're a good friend, Blue Back.
- Sure, fine friends.
Good Christian!
Hallelujah!
Lana.
- I'm going home.
- Home?
I can't stand it!
Mother was right.
I'm no frontier woman.
I had no idea it was like this.
I hate it!
- Lana, what are you saying?
- You had no right to bring me here!
It- It's awful! And that horrible man- that Indian slipping in here.
Now you're acting crazy again.
Blue Back wouldn't hurt you.
- Why, he's as good a Christian as you or me, maybe better.
- I don't care!
- I'm going home. I'm going now! Gil!
- No, you're not.
You're gonna stay right here and do as I say from now on.
You're gonna get over this foolishness and stop being scared. Do you understand?
Lana, I didn't wanna hit you.
I had to do it.
Lana, look at me.
I love you.
I need you.
I can't live without you now.
You know that.
Yes.
Look, here's Blue Back again, see?
You got a fine woman.
But you young man.
You use this on her.
Lick her good!
Make fine woman.
What are you thinking about now?
Gil.
What are you thinking about?
Oh, I was just thinking about what this place is gonna look like couple years from now.
Next summer we can start building a barn, right on that slope over there.
A hillside barn, just like I've always wanted.
Then after that, we can start thinking about building a decent house.
I like our house just as it is now.
Oh, sure. But I always remember how you ladies hanker after frame houses.
Well, I suppose the place will look so beautiful you won't care what your wife looks like.
I can get blisters all over my hands, and my nose peeled... and that's the thanks
I get for it.
Let's see some of those blisters you're talking so big about.
No! No, never mind! Leave me alone.
Let it go.
Why, Lana, your hand is sore.
- Maybe you oughtn't come out here like this.
- I want to.
I know, but haying's hard work.
It's about the hardest work there is.
It's... no job for a woman.
Oh, now, there you go.
Just because a woman is raised in a town, she has to be frail.
I'm not. I'm strong. You said yourself you couldn't have done without me.
- I sure married myself some good hired help.
- No, no! Now stop.
Stop it yourself.
Do you like me as much as you do your old farm?
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hello, Gil.
- Hello.
- Good morning, Gil.
- Hello, Gil! Good morning, Lana!
- Good morning.
Joe.
Mighty pretty.
- Oh, General Herkimer.
- Hello, Martin.
This is my wife, Lana.
Ja. Ja. Hübsch.
She's as pretty as the near side of a peach.
Maybe prettier.
- Reall.
- And, Lana, this is Mrs. Weaver and her husband.
I'm your nearest neighbor.
I've been meaning to call... me and George and John here, my boy.
- How do?
- I'm so glad to meet you.
And this is Christian's wife, Mrs. Reall, and her daughter Martha Ellen.
- How do you do?
- Howdy. And this is my oldest girl, Mary.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Mrs. Martin.
- And Mrs. Demooth.
- My husband is the captain.
How do you do?
- Oh, how do you do?
- And Dr. Petry.
How do, Mrs. Martin?
Oh, pass the lot of 'em.
Um-
Fall in! Outside.
All right, men.
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Don't be afraid of these women, Mrs. Martin.
You'll find they're good neighbors... once they get over being mad at you for being so pretty.
- Oh, don't be so silly.
- That bonnet you got on is giving them a lot of worry.
And they're dying to shoo us men off... so they can find out if you and Gil have got a family on the way.
- Oh, Nicholas Herkimer!
- We weren't gonna tell anybody.
- Lana!
Oh, that's just fine.
- Congratulations, Martin.
- Thank you.
That's just fine. A baby.
You know, I don't believe in young folks waiting.
- I always say a man needs help on his place...
- Stick out your tongue.
And the only way to get it is to have children, especially boys.
- Why, Maggie Weaver, how awful.
Militia, fall in!
- Fall in what?
Attention.
Dress to the right.
- That's my husband.
Call the roll.
- Amos Brock.
- Here.
- John Weaver?
- Here!
- George Weaver.
- Here.
- Gilbert Martin.
- Here.
Christian Reall.
Christian Reall!
Christian-
That's me. Here.
- Adam Hartman.
- Here.
- James McNod.
James McNod!
He couldn't come today.
He had to go and buy flour.
Then I've got to fine him.
That's the law.
It don't look to me as though you had any right to fine a man for not coming if he can't!
I thought that's what this war was about- making people pay taxes when they didn't have no say-so about it.
That's right. That's what
I'm carrying Long Tom for.
Ain't up to me.
Talk to the general.
Oh, I guess we can let that go this time.
And that's enough of the roll call too.
You can check up later.
Stand at ease, men.
Neighbors... ever since New York and the 12 colonies signed the Declaration of Independence... this revolution has turned into a real war.
So far we've been lucky up here in the Mohawk...
but it looks like we are going to be dragged into it too.
Sure as shootin'.
That's why I got you here- to get ready, no matter what happens.
I guess we all feel the same way about it.
This is our home and our land.
And I say it's worth fighting for... only we got to do it by ourselves.
Congress can't help us.
They say Washington needs all the troops he can get... and that the frontier will have to look out for itself.
Maybe them regular soldiers don't like the kind of liquor we drink up here, huh, General?
Adam!
Maybe not, but that's what they say.
Now, about the Indians, from all I hear... the Tories are making them a lot of big promises.
We got our agents working too, but there's no telling which way they'll jump.
Oh, I don't think we'll have any trouble with the Indians.
- We've always treated them fair.
- That's right.
Maybe so, but just the same... if you hear the bell ringing at the fort or the cannon go off... you drop everything and come running.
Do you understand?
All of you, come running.
Else I have you flogged so fast you won't know what.
Now, come on. Show the women how good you can drill.
- Take them around the field, Captain.
- Attention!
Nice talk, Nicholas.
Carry arms!
Forward left, march!
All right!
By thunder, I'll bet we can lick the whole world the way we march.
Ezra, help us over here!
Coming right along with you, Gil.
Put it right on top.
Look out now.
Come on! Come on!
Now she's going good.
- How is the core- pretty rotten, Adam?
- Yeah.
- Try to fall it right down in there.
- All right.
Keep working on the edge. That's the idea.
This'll make a nice patch for wheat, Gil.
You got good soil here.
I figure the loam's close to four feet.
Yes, sir, I bet there isn't any better soil in the whole valley.
You're just a natural-born farmer, ain't ya?
So you'd be, if you'd marry and settle down.
There she goes!
There she goes.
That's gonna be good firewood.
There it goes.
Start heaving, Cleave.
- Push her in, Gil.
- Push her in there.
Yeah, get on out!
- Make it straightaway.
- Heave!
Heave! Heave!
Come on! Come on.
You certainly brought a lot of pretty things with you, Mrs. Martin.
- Heavenly.
- I told Mother there was no sense in bringing... a lot of clothes and such things.
I'd rather have the money spent on furniture.
- I see you've got one of these feathers.
- Yes.
Mother had five of them at home.
She said there are times in a woman's life... when something like that is more important than bread.
- What in the world is it?
- A pheasant's feather.
Looks like it came out of an angel's wing.
We had a lot of them at home, but they collected so much dust, we threw them out.
Yes.
This is a nice teapot.
What is it, Wedgwood?
I don't know.
It's just white china, I guess.
- It belonged to my grandmother.
- We always ate off Wedgwood at home.
- Eat?
- Come on out! They've started burning already.
- Great burning. Started it myself.
- Come on.
Let's go see the burning.
Come on.
Throw it on there.
Gil, it's going to be beautiful.
It's Blue Back!
Indians on the warpath.
Coming.
Eight white men...
100 Indians.
Painted. Better hurry.
- Johnny Weaver, get your horse and tell General Herkimer.
Stop it! Stop it!
- Gil!
- Take this, Gil.
- Thanks, Joe. Adam, watch out for Lana, will you?
- Come on, Lana.
- No.
- You go too. Senecas, they kill.
I can't leave my place, the crops.
Gil, you've got to. You've got to come.
I won't leave without you.
All right, I'll get the cart.
Indians. I know. Get.
Two, three, four-
Two, three- One-
Four, five, six-
Come on, Christian.
They're all here. Get in your wagon.
- Here!
- Thanks.
Gil, the cow, aren't we going to take her?
We can't take her.
She'll just slow us up.
Oh, Gil, I can't stand it.
It's like leaving part of ourselves.
Don't look back. Giddyap!
- Come on, Mary.
- Hurry up, Gil!
Come on, Gil!
- Mr. Martin!
- Whoa!
Come on, Mary!
- Wait a minute.
- Where's the rest of your family?
- I don't know. I lost them.
- Give her to me.
Come on. Hurry up!
- All right.
- Giddyap, Susie!
Get!
We got Mary and Martha with us.
Get 'em in, Christian.
Climb right in the wagon here.
Come on, Trudy. You help Mary.
- Trudy, where's Nancy?
- Here she is.
- Where's Martha?
- Here's Martha.
- We're gonna have to throw some of this furniture out.
- Oh, no, Gil!
We've got to.
- We're ready, Gil.
- I told you not to look back.
Keep up there. Keep up there.
- Come on. Pull ahead there.
Mr. Martin!
- You got her?
- Yeah.
Gil! Gil, what's happened?
Oh! Mary Johnson!
- Come on! Come on!
- She was driving, and all of a sudden she fainted.
Never mind. There.
Put her down.
- Get up and get out of here!
- I won't! My husband's the captain.
- Get out before I use a strap on you.
- No!
Get some hot water, and tell that fool doctor to hurry.
- I don't understand. It's not like Lana.
- Never mind. She'll be all right.
- What in thunder's the matter here?
- Oh, Doctor.
- More sniveling women.
- It's my wife. She fainted.
I can't say I blame her, all this racket.
Gil. Gil Martin.
They're waiting for you, Gil.
The company's ready to go.
- What is it, Doctor?
- Nothing you can do anything about.
Go on. Get out of here.
- How is she, Gil?
- I don't know.
- Everything ready, Demooth?
- Yes, sir.
Drummer boy, play the drum.
Men, follow me!
Adam, did you see them?
Did you catch them?
No. We chased them seven, eight miles, but they got away from us.
- What happened?
- The excitement and all that jolting was too much for her.
Oh, but don't fret too much.
You're both young.
You'll have another baby.
Oh, she's all right now.
Just tired.
But don't let her talk too much.
Lana?
Gil.
Oh, Lana, darling.
Gil, our house?
They burned it.
- The crops?
- Everything. I saw it coming back.
Oh, and now-
Please don't, Lana.
- I failed you, Gil.
- No.
No, Lana, it wasn't your fault. It-
It just happens that way sometimes.
My poor Gil.
Oh, Lana.
You're all right.
That's all I care about.
It doesn't seem possible people can work as hard as we did, Lana... for nothin'.
We can build it back again, Gil.
We still have the land.
You think I'd let you come back out here and go through that sort of thing again?
No, you were right that first night.
You should have gone home then.
I was a fool not to see it.
- Gil.
- I never should have brought you out here in the first place.
This is no place for you.
It's no place for any woman.
I'm not the only woman who's gone through this, Gil.
What'll we do?
How will we live?
Well, Adam says that Mrs. McKlennar's hired man ran off... and she's looking for a couple to work her place.
But, Lana, why, you can't hire out!
A girl like you?
Do you think I'd-
It wouldn't have to be for long.
Just until we made enough to come back here and start.
Lana, you can't do it!
Oh, Gil, it won't do any harm just to talk it over with her.
No! Hired help.
No.
Mrs. McKlennar.
Good morning.
- Your name Martin?
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, go on and stare.
I know how I look.
When that fool hired man of mine got drunk and ran off... he left me with everything to do.
Martin, I don't mind a man having his liquor, so long as he knows how to hold it.
When it fixes him so's he can't do his work... then he'd better go someplace else, and the quicker the better.
Well, don't stand there with your mouths open.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
Now you're here on business, so let's get down to it. You know how to farm?
- I had my own place.
- Yes, I heard it was burned.
Well, that's too bad, but that's neither here nor there.
Daisy! Get my dinner ready.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
I don't do much farming here.
Just take care of the meadow and feed my stock.
But you can do what you like.
I'm a widow.
My husband was
Captain Barnabas McKlennar.
Barney.
Barney.
What was I saying?
Oh. I was brought up on army life... so when I give an order,
I expect to get it obeyed.
- What?
- If I take your pay, I'll do the best I can.
Well, I just don't want you coming around afterwards complaining. That's all.
How much do you want?
I never worked for anybody else.
What'd you expect to pay?
Forty-five pounds a year- your house, the wood and food.
If your wife can sew, I'll pay her too.
Can you sew, you, what's your name?
- Lana.
- Well, can you sew?
- Yes.
- Speak up! Speak up! You want to sew for me?
- Yes, I'd like to.
- Well, let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.
Hmm.
That's settled.
I hate sewing myself.
Hate any housework.
So I do the barn and let Daisy do the cooking.
I took good care of my husband.
Now he's gone, I do as I like.
I've got a long face and I poke it where I please.
- You may think I'm a nuisance.
- Yes, ma'am.
What? A nuis-
What? What'd he say?
I didn't mean it.
But I guess if you do poke, I'll think so.
Ah.
Well, your thoughts are your own property,
Martin, but keep 'em to yourself.
Come on. I suppose you want to see your new home.
I'll expect you to use the back door if you want to ask me for anything.
I don't want mud tracked through my house.
I track enough myself.
A mess now.
After that man.
- But it's a good house.
- It sure is, ma'am.
Nice chimney, nice bedroom upstairs.
I used to live here myself... till Barnabas took it into his head to build that stone place.
It's a beautiful house.
Glad you got sense enough to see it.
Now there's one more thing
I want to ask you. Got any furniture?
We have a bed and a few things.
Well, I'll help you out with the rest.
You can consider the job yours, Martin.
Now, any questions you want to ask?
Yes, ma'am.
It's- I just-
- Well, what? What?
- Well, do you belong to the right party?
Right party!
Martin, a woman hasn't got any political opinions.
I run this farm to suit myself.
I'll shoot the daylights out of anybody-
British, Indian or American- that thinks he can come around here monkeying in my business.
- Does that satisfy you?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, when can you move in?
- Well, will tomorrow be too soon?
To-Tomorrow?
What's the matter with today?
- Oh, we'll move in today!
- Good. Good.
- Oh, Lana.
- Oh, Gil!
Oh, Gil. Oh!
Oh, Gil, it- it's a beautiful fireplace.
Hear me, O Lord
And that anon
To help me
Make good speed
Be thou my rock
And house of stone
My fence in time
Of need
Amen
O Almighty God... hear us, we beseech thee... and bring succor and guidance... to those we are about to bring to thy divine notice.
First, we are thinking of Mary Wollaber.
She is just 16 years old... but she is keeping company with a soldier from Fort Dayton.
He's a Massachusetts man,
O Lord... and thou knowest no good can come of that.
Hallelujah!
Now we are thinking of the sick and infirm.
Peter Paris has the flux real bad.
His Uncle Isaacs, who keeps the store in Dayton... asks for our prayers.
And he says that he has just got in a new supply... of calicos,
French broadcloths...
- fancy handkerchiefs, new hats and heavy boots...
- Shh.
All at bargain prices.
But most of all... we call upon thee, Lord Jehovah...
O God of battles... to aid thy people against the Tories... for I have disturbing news for you that will sorrow this Sabbath.
General Washington has advised us... that an enemy army of many Tories and savage Indians... is even now on its way to our beloved valley.
Every man capable of bearing arms... between the ages of 16 and 60...
will report tomorrow morning to General Herkimer...
at which time, a regiment... of Washington's continental army... will arrive from Albany... under the command of Colonel Fischer to help us.
Any man failing to report for duty will be promptly hanged.
Amen.
You stick close to Mrs. McKlennar,
Lana, and do what she says.
Yes, Gil.
Well, I'd better go now.
Watch out for those new apple trees.
Gil.
Thank you, ma'am.
It used to be Barney's, but it's no use to me now.
Might come in handy to you.
Gil Martin, I'm gonna kiss ya, so I better do it now... so's you won't go off with the taste of a widow on your mouth.
Many's the time
I've seen Barney go off... just that same way.
Good-bye. He's off.
Sometimes he'd wave.
Ten-to-one he wasn't even seeing me.
He was thinking about all those men, you see- all those men going out to fight- to kill or be killed.
Blast his eyes, loving it.
So they sent you all the way over here to tell us to come inside the fort, did they?
It's orders. Where women and children shall be gathered together, it says.
Me and other men over 60 are to collect and protect 'em.
You old rooster.
Don't you think I can look after myself?
Yes, ma'am.
But it's orders.
I been saving a corner shed for you.
Shed! Do I look like the kind of a woman... that would start living in a shed at my time of life, like a cow?
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?
- No, ma'am.
- Go on, spit, man. Spit and get it over with.
Hey! Not there! Outside! Go on.
Get on out of here. Go on.
The old fool.
He can't even spit by himself.
Waiting, waiting.
That's all we women do, is wait.
Well, no news is good news.
Why don't you sit down, Lana?
Mosquitoes!
Mrs. McKlennar! Lana!
Here they come!
Come on out!
Here they come!
Where's John?
Have you seen Gil Martin?
Gil.
Take them inside. Go in. Anyone else, go in.
Have you seen Gil Martin?
I'm Robert Johnson, ma'am. Surgeon pro tem of the 1st Regiment, New York line.
Then don't stand there yapping about it.
Go on in and see the general.
Yes, ma'am.
Mark, where's Gil?
Gil Martin?
Gil! Gil!
Gil!
Gil-
I'm Captain Morgan, ma'am.
There's nobody back of me alive.
No.
Well, General Herkimer, a fine mess you've got yourself into this time.
I tell this fellow to go away.
Look after the young ones.
Shut up! You're not giving orders in this house.
What about it?
It's- It's already mortified, ma'am.
I- It'll have to come off.
- Ja, bitte?
- Ja, Nicholas.
- Wait till I light my pipe.
- Yes.
Look out. John!
Tell me something first, Doctor.
Did you ever cut off a leg before?
Why-Why, no, sir. I-
Well, don't be ashamed.
A man has gotta start somewhere.
I'll never forget the first deer I shot.
Gil?
Gil?
- Lana? Lana.
Gil! Gil.
Oh, thank God! Gil.
It's so cold.
Colder here than the woods.
Yeah.
Raining-
Lying there-
I remember thinking how hot it was... wondering-
- I'm cold.
- Yes, dear.
Wondering how long we'd be away... when it happened.
- I heard a crackling...
- Daisy. Daisy, some water.
Like a stick breaking... and all of sudden, the fella next to me stopped talking... and fell over on his side.
Then I heard a whistle.
Shots from everywhere.
Somebody shouted we'd been ambushed.
- I saw General Herkimer slide off his horse...
- Oh.
And grab his knee.
Peter Ten Eyck with his head blown half-off.
Oh, darling, this is going to hurt.
- Somebody told me to lay down...
And then I saw 'em... all smeared with paint- yellow and red- every color.
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
In back of 'em,
Tories with green coats.
I got down back of a log and aimed at a fella.
He leaped straight up in the air.
- Darling, don't talk about it.
- He fell forward on his face.
- After that we...
Just kept shootin' as fast as we could load... for I don't know how long.
Amos-
Adam Hartman came over beside me.
His musket was broke.
But he had a spear.
He kept grinnin'.
I remember thinkin'...
"He's havin' a good time.
He likes this."
Pretty soon he pointed off.
- I saw an Indian comin' towards us, naked.
- Darling, don't talk.
I tried to load, but it was too late.
Adam stood up and braced his spear... and the Indian came down.
I never saw a fella look so funny, so surprised.
He just... hung there... with his mouth open... lookin' at us and not sayin' a word.
- I had to shoot him.
There wasn't anything else to do.
- Oh.
- I had to!
- Yes, dear.
- Brandy, Nicholas?
- Ja, ja.
Swallow. Swallow.
- Now, Nicholas?
Go ahead.
Then it started to rain... and I was sick.
All the time General Herkimer just sat there smoking his pipe and holding his knee.
Then he said we'd all better go home.
Oh, darling, don't talk about it.
Out of 600 of us... about 240 were still alive... but we'd won.
- We licked 'em.
- Yes, darling.
- We showed 'em they couldn't take this valley.
- Yes, darling.
- Lana?
- Yes, dear.
Do you hear? We'd won.
Yes, darling. You won.
Now you've got to sleep, Gil. You-
Adam. Adam, help me get him down.
- Get that pack there.
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- Here.
Sleep, darling.
You sleep.
Lana?
- Lana?
Oh, Gil. Gil.
I feel as if I've been asleep forever.
You needed it.
I've been lyin' here lookin' at you... thinkin' how pretty you are.
Oh, darling.
Made me think of the first days we had together at Deerfield.
I've been thinking about that too- the things we'd planned.
While I was out there...
I kept thinking about you all the time- about how good it'll be when everything's over and we can go back home.
Gil, the Indians-
They won't be coming back this way again, will they?
Oh, I don't reckon they'd have the nerve after the lickin' we gave 'em.
Why?
We're going to have another baby.
Are you glad, Lana?
I feel as-
I feel as though
I'd just begun to live all over again.
Are you hungry?
Doctor, how is General Herkimer?
General Herkimer is dead.
We couldn't stop the bleeding.
"'I am the resurrection, and the life, 'saith the Lord.
- "He that believeth in me...
"though he were dead,
:
And whosoever liveth and believeth-"
"I know my redeemer liveth...
"and that he shall stand at the latter :
"And though after my skin worms destroy this body...
yet in my flesh
I shall see God. "
Come on, Gil.
Don't stop now.
You know what Doc Petry said about havin' plenty of hot water on hand.
I know, but the water's boiled away twice already, and nothing's happened yet.
I don't know why we gotta have so much hot water when babies are born anyhow.
Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin!
Miss McKlennar wants you at once!
Gil! Gil.
One of Barney's soldiers made this cradle.
Give it to me the night we were married.
Your Lana might as well have it.
- Hmm?
- That's mighty kind of you, ma'am.
Oh, nonsense!
What good is it to me?
Can't ever tell. A good lookin' widow like you.
Ah, shut up.
You make me sick.
- Great big good-for-nothing loudmouthed fool!
- Even if you are good lookin'! Ooh!
- Stop!
- Get out of my way!
- Ooh.
- Oh!
Oh! Poor Gil.
- Not yet, boys. Not yet.
- Huh?
- No.
It's the waiting around that-
Not knowing what's going on.
Why can't Dr. Petry do somethin'?
Why can't he?
I don't know, Gil.
Blue Back, you've had a lot of experience in this business. What do you think?
Having babies, that's woman's business.
She better go far, far by herself.
Leave husband alone!
Daisy!
Daisy, hurry with those things.
This is terrible.
Gil! Gil Martin!
Get some hot water, quick!
- That's all right. That's all right.
George Weaver, you keep away from that springhouse.
Uh, I'll get some-
I'll get some more wood.
It's a boy.
Praise be to the Lord.
A boy. Gil. Gil!
It-It- It's a-
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy.
It's a boy.
Joe, we got a boy!
- Give me that.
Mmm.
Christian, it's a boy.
We got a baby boy.
- What?
- A baby boy!
- A boy?
- Yes!
- A baby boy?
- Sure!
And to think, at my age... another son.
- Get some brandy.
- Yes, sir.
- Brandy? For a little-
- No. For you.
Go on in.
- Is- Is she all right?
- Fit as a fiddle.
- Well, who does he look like?
- He's gonna faint. He's-
Oh, Lana, never again.
Gil.
I prayed so hard it would be a boy.
Take him in your arms, just for a moment.
Oh-
Go ahead.
Doggone.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Yoo-hoo!
Come on, everybody! The dance is starting.
- Come on.
- I'll bet Barney never kissed you like that!
Barney McKlennar was a real man.
When he kissed you, you stayed kissed.
Let's see if he taught you how to hold your liquor.
He didn't need to.
I was born knowing that.
Hooray!
To the greatest crop in the Mohawk Valley and the man who's responsible for it...
Gil Martin!
To the bride and groom,
Mary and John Weaver.
May they always be as happy as they are tonight.
Please, God.
Please let it go on like this forever.
Come on, Gilly.
You're gonna help Mommy find some nice wild honey.
Upsy-daisy. Come on.
There we go.
- That you, Daisy? Go away. Go away.
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
Answer me! What do you mean coming in my house?
Burn house. Fire quick.
Don't you dare, you filthy drunken rascal!
Ah! Get out of here quick before I skin you alive.
Get out of here!
What are you doing?
My bed!
Ah, you crazy horse thieves!
If I could get my hands on a butcher knife!
Daisy! Daisy! Lana! Gil! Gil!
- My bed! Take your hands off that bed!
Take your- Oh!
- You go quick, old woman! You catch fire!
- Old woman!
I won't move a step without my bed.
- My husband bought this bed the day after I was married-
Stop that! Shame on you.
Get this bed out of here quick.
- Quick! Get this out of here!
- Sure. Fine. We take bed.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
Quick! Hurry up, you fools!
I'll have your ears lopped off for this.
- Ah! Put it out!
You fools! Upside down.
Turn it upside down.
Turn it upside down.
- Turn it up! Turn it up-
You fools!
- Mrs. McKlennar! Mrs. -
- Oh! Mrs. McKlennar! What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Away! Away!
- You've got to get out!
- Go away! Go away!
My husband built this house. I've lived in it all my life, and I'm not going to leave it.
- Go away. Go away.
- You've got to come!
- Listen to me! You cannot stay-
- Lana!
- Gil! Gil. Gil.
- Go away and leave me alone, Gil.
- Mrs. McKlennar!
Lana! Gil!
Gil! Lana! Andrusville has just been wiped out.
There's over a thousand of ‘em headed this way under Caldwell. You've got to get to the fort!
Take him. Mrs. McKlennar, you've got to come!
- I'm not leaving this house.
I've lived in it all my life.
- Come on, Sarah.
Go away! Hartman, leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Oh, Almighty God... by whose divine assistance
Samson did smite the Philistines... hip and thigh with great slaughter... help thy people now gird up their loins for the coming battle.
Put courage in our hearts, Lord...
that we may drive our enemies back into the wilderness.
For we all know only too well what will happen to us...
if these sons of Belial ever get over these walls... or come in through that gate... which, with thy permission, Lord...
I now order closed.
Amen.
Close the gate.
Tether all the animals or drive 'em out!
You women and children, go into the church.
Hallelujah, men!
- Let's go!
If you can't get your hair under those hats, cut it off!
It won't do any good anyhow if those greasy devils get in here.
- Daisy. Daisy.
- Now sing, children. Sing in praise of the Lord.
Woman!
Brother Reall!
Put down that devil's brew.
I was only trying to get rid of it... so- so's them heathens wouldn't get it.
Beware of the heathen within thine own breast. Cast it away!
- Hallelujah!
Hallelujah.
Do you think they'll attack tonight?
With Caldwell leadin' 'em they will.
Look. What's that?
That's them.
Alarm!
- There goes our barn, off to the right of those trees.
- There goes my place.
- No, that's Ritter's.
Then mine's next to it.
Hold your fire, John. Save your ammunition.
They're just trying to draw us out.
Back to your place.
Martin's right.
Trust in the Lord, and wait until you can make every shot count.
You filthy painted heathens.
Consume them, Lord... as thou didst thine enemies in the days of Jeremiah.
Pastor! Gil! Adam!
- Wait till they're close, men!
- Adam! Here they come!
Ready with those rifles, women!
God have mercy on his soul.
I must be shooting a little to the left.
Here you are, George!
Loaded.
Now shoot the breeches off them, if they're wearin' breeches. Daisy, come on!
Loaded.
Chain shot.
Get to the gate!
Call the filthy beggars back.
We'll wait till the moon sets.
Oh, Barney! Barney, if you were only here, we'd show 'em.
We'd show-
Hold me up.
I can't breathe... lying down.
- Ah.
Lana, come beside me.
- Give me your hand.
Now don't start tuning out.
I want you and Gil to have my place- everything.
You've been like my own flesh and blood.
Oh.
Look under the front porch.
I buried... some gold pieces there, just in case.
Divide it up among the lot of you.
Gil.
Good-bye, good-lookin'.
Barney.
Barney!
- Oh!
For thine is the kingdom... the power and the glory... forever.
- Amen.
How's the ammunition, Parson?
Mighty low.
Ammunition's mighty low, Lord.
- I go Fort Dayton for help.
- That's a job for me.
- No, I'll go.
I know every foot of the way.
Anybody can make it, I can.
Joe.
Joe.
Parson, do you mind?
He'll need it.
Oneida Trail, huh, Joe?
Good luck, Joe.
He got away.
Listen.
Adam!
That's shooting, Adam!
You filthy murderers!
Just leave him-
God, our merciful father... forgive me for what
I am about to-
Amen.
Get away. I'm all right.
Gil.
What about-
Somebody's-
I'm going, Parson.
Good luck, Gil.
- Joe, did he-
- He did not.
- I'm gonna try it myself, Lana.
- Gil.
If I can make the woods,
I can outrun 'em.
They'll kill you.
You're not going to be afraid, you hear?
You're not going to.
- They'll kill you.
- No, they won't.
If I can get in the clear, there isn't an Indian living that can catch me.
Say you're not afraid and you want me to go.
Lana.
I'm not afraid.
I want you to go.
Lana, he got away.
Let 'em start.
Any sign of them yet?
Blue Back says it's quiet- too quiet out there.
He left before sunrise.
It's almost 12:00 now.
If he had reached Fort Dayton, help would be here by now.
Parson! They're over the wall!
- Every man to his post!
Pull!
Have you seen Lana?
No, I ain't, Gil.
Parson, have you seen Lana?
I killed a man.
- Lana. Lana.
It's me. It's Gil.
Oh.
Where's Caldwell?
- Where's Caldwell?
Where's Caldwell?
- Come on! Hey!
Squad left!
March!
Company halt!
- Order arms!
- At ease.
- Where are you men going?
- Home.
- Home?
The war's over. Cornwallis surrendered to Washington at Yorktown last week.
So that's our new flag, the thing we've been fighting for.
Thirteen stripes for the colonies... and 13 stars in a circle for the union.
It's a pretty flag, isn't it?
Hey, soldier, let me take that flag a minute.
- We did a little fightin' around here ourselves.
- Way up high.
- Put it up there!
- Way up to the top!
- Take it up!
- Put it up there!
Well, I reckon we better be gettin' back to work.
There's gonna be a heap to do from now on.
New Mexico
And that's why I tell you to stay out of New Mexico.
And there ain't no law but this.
Show him in. and his help would be invaluable to us.
I hoped you'd say that, Steele.
Certainly.
So they're sending another deputy, eh.
Boys, here's to the big herd.
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah
There's a man following us.
He ain't a-followin' us now.
Hyah, ho, ho!
Sounds like cows.
Ho, ho! It's Arizona.
Hyah, hyah, hyah!
Hey, fellas.
Shh, don't let on, now.
Well, boss, I got over
200 head this time. in that fool country.
Come on, Lem. gonna get any practice
Oh.
He's been around here drunk for two days.
Well, come on, let's drink up.
Everybody okay?

Might have knowed he'd show up today.
Buenos dias, amigos!
Ha, ha.

Ha.
Is everybody all right?
You had a pretty hard trip, didn't you?
Yeah.

How are you? with rustlers, renegades and bad men.
Pleasure, Miss Malloy.
How do you do?

So long, pardner.
Goodbye, miss.

All right, Cal, that road straight ahead, huh?
Ow!
I like your spirit
Thanks.
Aha. and I wouldn't be caught nappin'.
Well, that's mig hty fine of you, Mr. Steele.
Everything's just fine.

Vamos, amigos.
Aw, don't worry.
We'll catch him.
Boy, I'm sure hungry.
Shh!
Afraid you'd be late for breakfast.
Stand up.
Who the devil are you? and I figured you in on the deal. and I'm counting on your help.
Get back against that wall
I'm arrestin' Arizona for the murder of Cal Brett.
Set'em up here, bartender.
Here comes the deputy now.
John Steele.
Aw, come on, let's have another drink here.
What's that?
Hey, hey.
Hm.

It's 9:00.
I'll show you.

Just a minute.

In the name of the law

They're retreating.

Where's Arizona?
I'll be meetin' up with him before long.
Get on that horse.
There you are.
That's fine,sir. Hmm.
Say, pardner,
I wanna talk to you.
Let me go!
Sonora! for spoiling the big romance.
Let's see.
Where were you
Right where I never should have been interrupted.
Hey, John!
Pardon me.
Thank you.
I wonder if we'll get a good price
Round up every gunman in the valley.
Well, major, good to hear this talk.
See you all at the fort, I hope.
They wake me up in the middle of the night...
I'll see he don't get away.
Once more, boys. Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Whoa. Whoa.
Vamos!
Giddyap, buddy.
Where's Ginger?
Giddyap, Mike, giddyap.
Are you all right?
Hello, darling.
Bring'em up the hill.
Get those buzzards!
They're turning the herd.
Come on.
Madre de dios.
Put them in the mill.
Turn the herd.
Hoo-ha!
They're coming around, boys.
They got them in the mill.
They saved'em.
Aww, that's too far.
Giddyap.
Your majesty, North America isn't worth the trouble.
Let Montcalm invade it, withdraw our forces... and concentrate our armies here in Europe, the main theater of war.
Newcastle wants to give the country back to the Indian, what do you propose Mr. Pitt?
To reinforce Colonel Munro at Albany Sire.
Move General Webb in support... and drive the French out of North
America as we are doing in India.
- For a wilderness?
- For the raw material of an empire Sire.
And what is it the Duke says?
I agree with Mr. Pitt entirely sire.
Is the war office prepared?
Major Heyward is ready to take the next frigate to the Americas.
He will carry our dispatches, and remain there... as second in command to Colonel Munro.
Do you think you'll find any difficulty in adapting yourself... to a new country, Major?
The British army has always adapted a new country to England sire.
You may proceed, Mr. Pi.
You have cane Blanche.
Thanks, your majesty.
Your majesty, Pitt is as mad as a hatter.
Mad, is he?
I wish he'd fight some of my other ministers.
Ah, you, direct me to Colonel Munro.
Well, you'll likely find him at the platoon's house, a dancing.
Oh, thank you.
Are you in the habit of addressing officers with a pipe in your mouth?
No, sometimes I chew snuff.
We'll give you a lift, soldier.
Your presence, Miss Cora, changes this Dutch village into paradise.
Sir, you're so impetuous, you frighten the wits out of me.
This is the first time I have seen your daughter Cora so gay, so carefree, Colonel.
Yes, mind her.
The girl had a sad experience.
Young lad she was to marry, lost at sea in a naval engagement.
I thought this trip might help her to forget.
Pardon me, there is an officer to see the Colonel.
Duncan Heyward, why, what wind blows you to America?
Good to see you sir.
So, you bedeviled Munro to grant you fellow, after all.
No sir, important dispatches.
Oh, excellent last, I'm in need of a thrush with the French.
It's still as ditch-water here.
I suppose you know what this says.
Yes, well, you're looking very well yourself sir.
Oh, alright, I see, go and find Alice.
- Report back to me in half an hour.
- Thank you sir.
Last time I saw her, she was in the garden, with a very attractive young captain.
Well, I arrived in the nick of time, didn't I?
Looking for someone, Major Heyward?
Alice.
Jove, I've looked forward to this.
You haven't changed a bit, Duncan.
Can you blame me?
You've no right to look so beautiful.
And gallant as ever.
You're just as cruel.
After I've braved the wide
Atlantic to be by your side.
Yes, I suppose you do deserve a reward, don't you?
Well, that's a very small kiss after such a long journey.
You know, I had hoped you might have changed your mind about me.
I haven't, Duncan, I'm sorry.
There's no chance that someday it might be different?
It isn't fair to ask you to wait.
See, a British officer never gives in without a struggle.
Spoken like a true Britain sir.
And, Miss Munro, you may consider yourself in a permanent state of siege.
I shall welcome it.
Come on, let's find Cora, she'll be delighted to see you.
Oh, yes, how is your sister?
Oh, ever so much happier here.
Gentlemen of the regiment, attention.
Your Colonel has orders.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry, but all arbiters must report to their quarters at once, we march tomorrow.
How are you, Colonel?
How are you, Winthrop?
This is Major Heyward.
Mr. Winthrop sir.
How do you do, Major?
Colonel, I think you're going to be a little short handed.
My men seem to think this is all your fight and none of theirs.
Winthrop, my orders are to advance my entire command to Fort William Henry.
Engage Montcalm until we reinforce
General Webb.
What I didn't realize was that half my command were colonials, however, we march today with or without you.
Whether we go or not is for my men to decide.
Sound the assembly, we'll talk to them.
Yes sir.
Howdy, Hawkeye, haven't seen you in a dunes age.
Hi, Hank. Hello, Zeke.
What brings you to town?
I've been traveling up on the border.
What have you boys turned out for?
British want us to march up to Fort William Henry with them.
Yeah? What's the matter, haven't you enough trouble here at home?
Men, Colonel Munro has asked me to say a few words.
Having just arrived from England,
I can assure you that his majesty,
King George, is eager for your support.
I feel sure that as loyal subjects to the crown, you'll be glad to render this valuable service to your king.
Just how far from the settlement will this campaign take us, Major?
To the main outpost, Fort William Henry.
Why, that's a good two days march, maybe more.
It should be enough to remind you that France is our enemy.
Your enemy, not ours.
Yeah, we ain't fighting France, you are.
We ain't fighting no one, except Indians.
I ain't fighting them if I can help it.
Wait a minute, this isn't war, this is merely a skirmish.
Then you'd better get ready to skirmish because I've just come... from trapping on Lake George, and a Huron war party... is a canoeing down from the border.
That's all the more reason then for you colonials to join us.
You can do what you want with your own scalps, Major, but don't start telling us what to do with ours.
Hey, where are you going, Indian?
Me Magua scout, come to see big white chief Munro.
You colonials, by helping us to defeat Montcalm, are helping yourselves to defeat the Hurons, who are allies of the French.
Yeah, and while these men are cooped up at Fort William Henry, let the Indians burn their homes, butcher their families.
I come from Ticonderoga, see Montcalm.
Montcalm? Why that means the French are...
Men, I've just learned the French are advancing on Fort William Henry.
You know what that means, if they break through, they and the Indians... will loot and pillage every settlement this side of Lake George.
Are you going to let that happen or are you going to help us... stop them at Fort William Henry?
Wait a minute, boys.
I believe the men will enlist sir, on one condition, if the Hurons break through, they can come back and protect their homes.
How about it, boys?
Alright, agreed.
What do you say, men?
What do you say, Hawkeye?
I had my say.
Well, you've learned your first lesson about the colonial.
You play the game, so long as you don't try to make rules for them.
We're lucky to get out of that.
Yes, you need a bit of luck in this country, my boy.
Who was that man talking back to Duncan?
Oh, a fellow the Indians called Hawkeye, he's a scout, a pretty good one...
I understand, why?
I thought we hang traitors.
Yeah, so did I.
Well, this is a country of forests, but
I doubt it there would be enough trees... to go around if we started hanging people for speaking their minds.
Well, go on and pack.
When you keep one man waiting it's coquetry, but a thousand, treason.
Oh, Magua.
Take this to the quartermaster, and give this to Dubago.
Southern beggar that.
He's the best scout I have.
He's a Mohawk, I had to give him a taste of the cane once, but it made a man out of him.
Yes, he probably deserved it.
Magua, I wonder what that weasel is doing here.
Him scout for Yangeze,
Mohawks take him in tribe, make him blood brother.
More, he was born a Huron.
I bet a rifle against a powder-horn, he's still a Huron.
Come on, we'd better warn Munro.
It's the petticoats that make it so full.
Nothing like a woman's modesty to take up space.
Well?
I want to talk to the Colonel, they told me he was here.
Colonel Munro is not here.
It's awful important, ma'am.
You doubt my word?
No, of course not, only I want to...
I'm sure the Colonel would not be interested in anything... that you might have to say.
He'd be an awful fool then, ma'am.
I came hereto be of service to him.
You of service?
If you want to be of service, why aren't you in uniform?
Maybe I've got too much sense to wear a red coat in the woods.
Perhaps you'd be interested to know that the Colonel is my father.
I'm not, ma'am, not a bit.
You see, I wanted to...
I said the Colonel is not here.
You're sure of that?
I'm positive.
- Here come two.
- Yes.
You think it's safe sir?
Oh, they're seasoned campaigners, my boy.
Magua know short trail.
No good for army, good for small party.
Splendid, you hear that, Heyward?
If you don't mind sir,
I'd like to accompany the young ladies.
Oh, that's one way to enjoy a walk.
Come along.

Short trail here.
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Give my regards to the Commodore.
You'll be there hours before we are.
Take good care of them, Major.
We'll take care of him.
We are the veterans here.
This fellow may be a very excellent guide, but cook, no.
Careful Duncan, you might hurt his feelings.
I don't think he's got any feelings.
Never mind, Duncan, we'll be at the fort tomorrow.
Yes, we're wasting time.
Hey, you, get these things packed up.
What's that for?
You take them trail, me follow.
Why?
I forget put out fire.
Alright, go ahead.
These Indians are terrified of forest fires.
They can burn up the whole country as far as I'm concerned.
Get down, water our horses.
Don't be a fool, man, never water a mount when he's sweating.
White chief right, we wait.
That fellow is taking long enough watering those horses.
Duncan, do stop grousing.
Oh, it's all nonsense.
Hey, you, hurry up.
Duncan.
My People.
Oh, and what do they want?
Want pale faced squaws.
What?
No, leave him alone.
Magua great warrior, big white chief Munro whip Magua like dog.
And you deserved it.
Now Magua wipe out scars.
Pale faced squaws live, you die.
Let me go. No, let me go.
Alice. Alice.
Cora, get me a musket, quick.
Don't shoot. Can't you see they're different from the others?
I don't trust any of them.
If your aim is as bad as your judgment Major,
I don't imagine there's much danger of you hitting them.
What are you trying to do?
Among other things, trying to keep you from being burned at the stake, if you aren't too green to burn.
You, tell them to stop that.
Too late to put them back.
And scalps to the Indians, Major, are like your medals, they've got the same meanings, killing.
Well, we better get back to the main track and join the Colonel.
You'll never get through, you better come with me.
I'm quite capable of taking care of these ladies.
So I noticed.
What's that? Wolves?
On two legs and headed this way. Follow me.
Our horses, where are they?
I had them killed.
Killed, you fool? What for?
Indians can hear a horse for miles in the woods.
Come on, grab a musket.
Go on, follow the Mohicans.
Wait a minute, give me that lace piece.
- What?
- This thing.
Eh. Horse trail this way.
Cora, come on.
Come on, keep moving.
Rest now.
I hate running away like this,
I'll wager that fellow has exaggerated the danger.
Why should he?
He hasn't impressed me as a man given to exaggeration.
Maybe Huron canoes in cove.
Yeah, maybe.
Chief daughter rest, Uncas watch.
I think I shall.
Magua, Magua.
No, Hawkeye make false trail.
I wonder if he can be trusted.
What makes you think he can't?
I don't know, he's little more than a white savage himself.
Oh, Duncan, don't be such a bear.
Ok, Chingachgook.
Come on, into the canoes.
Wait a minute, where do you think you're taking her?
Major, I'm not asking you to trust me,
I'm taking the ladies, but if you'd rather wait for the Hurons, that's your affair.
Hear that, come on.
Mohicans.
Take the left fork, to Bear Cave.
I'll lead them off.
Hawkeye, look.
Keep on paddling, we'll turn to shore around at the next bend.
That was a bit close.
We're not out of it yet.
There is a cabin ahead where we can get shelter until sundown.
What happened?
Got their haircut by Huron barbers.
How can you speak so unfeelingly?
I'm feeling, Miss Munro.
I knew these folks and blazed the trail that brought them here.
This is how my parents died, a fire and scalping knife.
How terrible.
And this won't be all, with the men at Fort William Henry, no settlement will be safe.
Will you accept my apology for what I said when I first met you?
That's alright, you didn't know any better.
I do now.
We'd better get back to the canoe.
We start now, when are we going on?
Just as soon as I finish patching the canoe.
Now I keep thinking there's an Indian behind every tree.
And my scalp feels very uncertain.
You don't scare easy, do you?
I'm with you and you seem to know your way around the woods.
I ought to, the Mohicans raised me after the massacre.
Never saw another settlement until I was ten.
And this has been your life, this forest?
Yes.
Aren't you ever lonely?
Lonely?
Yes, I mean curious about the rest of the world, London for instance.
A man could spend a lifetime exploring this country... and never walk the same trail twice.
Men have only touched it.
Why, out beyond the Ohio is a land where no white man is ever been.
Every time I open up a new trail,
I like to think that others will follow.
Maybe someday build a big city at its end.
I wonder if you can understand what it means to be first.
I think I can.
Something frightened that deer.
Or maybe we did.
No, we are down wind.
We'd better get out of here.
Fool, separating our parties like this.
Two party alive, good.
One party dead, no good.
What on earth are you doing?
Listen to beaver, downstream.
Indian sentry, when canoe come, beaver flap tail.
Hawkeye bring sister soon.
Oh, I do hope so.
Hawkeye find way.
Like Indian, Hawkeye same as Uncas brother.
And the other one, is he your father?
Chingachgook Sagamore, great chief of Mohican.
And you?
Uncas, little chief.
This mean Mohican chief.
Mohican, are you taking us to your people?
All my people gone, killed in Huron war.
Once many warrior in tribe.
For many summer this our hunting ground.
Now only Chingachgook and Uncas left.
You're all alone, so am I.
My warrior died at sea.
A chief?
In your way of speaking, yes.
Then your son would be a chief.
Makes a nice dream sometimes.
Here, you eat.
Mohican chief no wait on squaw.
Someone come.
Thank heavens you're safe.
Alice, we were so worried.
- Cora, you weren't afraid?
- No, not at all.
We were perfectly safe.
Duncan, I think you owe this scout an apology.
Well, I apologize for mistrusting him but I shan't forget his insolence.
There's lots of time to settle our differences, Major.
In the mean time, we got to think of the ladies.
Agreed.
I suggest we get some sleep now, we leave at sunrise.
We leave now or we'll never see the sunrise, come on.
- Any sign of the Heyward party yet?
- Not yet sir.
I wouldn't worry about that sir, one of the horses may have gone lame.
Look, there's a flicker in the woods.
Those are picket fires.
- It's the French, sound the alarm.
- Yes sir.
Montcalm got us surrounded.
Call our allies, they'll never get through.
I hope your effort is to last, Captain.
Our British friends are not too hospitable.
We may be knocking at their door for months.
Wait, we brought you here to shoot redcoats, not floating logs.
Log float against wind.
My darlings, you're safe at last.
You're safe, come.
Oh, my poor dears, just look at you.
Take them to the quarters, get them dry clothes.
I'm alright.
I'm very grateful, I'll never forget this.
Well don't thank me sir, the credit belongs to this scout.
I hadn't suspected you as an ally.
I'm not, my only reason for helping the Major was because of the ladies.
Anyway accept my thanks.
Will you come to the Colonel's quarters later?
I'd like to thank you also.
I'll tend to that, my dear.
I'll reward him personally.
Major, any reward I got coming from you I can do without.
Alice, need you be so familiar with that fellow?
Duncan, you're talking like a fool.
On active service, discipline is an important thing.
I was only thanking him for saving our lives.
Well, need you be so effusive about it?
After all you're the Colonel's daughter, you know?
When you say things like that, Duncan,
I like to think that it's the army talking, not the man.
How many Yankees in the fort, Magua?
Two thousand.
And their wagons?
Fifteen wagons.
They'll be short of provisions soon.
We start pounding tonight, Monsieur.
Tonight sir.
We leave as soon as the moon sets.
I wonder if we'll ever meet again.
Some trail cross many times, some trails cross only once.
I shan't forget you, Uncas.
As many dawn are mine, so many shall
I pray to the great spirits... and for the one with the moon in her hair.
Pale faced squaw no good Mohican.
Fair hair make heart of Uncas weak like water.
Can't blame him, Sagamore.
Hawkeye's heart weak like water.
You were going to leave without coming to see me.
I'm not much of a hand at saying goodbye.
But you'll never get through.
Sagamore and I will have to take our chances.
Tell me, why are you going?
Well, I haven't changed my mind.
The colonials made a mistake when they came here, there's not much reason for me to stay.
Seems you have a healthy contempt for everything British, haven't you?
I haven't noticed the British busting into cheers whenever they see me.
That's because they don't know you as I do.
Chances are you'll be court-martialed if they catch you talking to me.
I came to ask you to stay.
You know I don't belong here.
There's a fence between your world and mine.
And you have a trail to follow.
You know, it's a very sad trail that leads back to no one.
There's an old Indian saying:
A trap awaits the otter who follows the same trail twice.
You know, it just doesn't make sense you and me being friends.
I don't care whether it makes sense or not,
I'm asking you to forget logic... and reason, won't you please stay?
Looks like Montcalm means business.
Yes, we're surrounded and badly outnumbered.
We need every rifle.
Sounds like the French have changed my mind.
For the colonies, shoot straight to two.
Put your faith in heaven and keep your powder dry.
Aim those guns to the right and fire rapidly.
It's a war, don't fall back.
Double duty like this calls for full rations, not hard tack and water.
Courage, my boy, let us praise the lord... that he may bring safety to us as to the Israelites, his manor in this wilderness.
Even if it is made of plaster.
Attention.
At ease.
No sign of reinforcements yet?
- None sir.
- I can't understand it.
We are only 15 miles away.
Webb is had over 10 days to get here.
It's possible that his reinforcements from England haven't arrived yet.
The war office assured me they'd be sent at once.
War office.
They don't know this wilderness.
I could lose an army between here and New York.
Poor devils.
Soldiers curse to suffer in silence.
Soldiers privilege sir, pity we don't have more men to fight.
Or less to die.
I'm sure the French couldn't have intercepted all our runners.
And what else?
I've had no reply from General Webb.
At least I'm glad they carry verbal messages and not written ones.
Perhaps one did get through sir, but the message might not have seemed... as urgent to General Webb as a written dispatch.
Yes, he's right there sir.
You certainly wouldn't ignore a message in your own hand.
If he got it.
Well an Indian might get through sir.
Yes, you can try again.
Alright, let one start at dark.
Yes sir.
All clear, Heyward?
All clear to the outer defenses sir.
Pity we couldn't hold them, we could have covered the land better.
Guard these dispatches with your life, we're depending on you.
Good luck, lad.
Get him up there, cover him.
Uncas, watch shore of lake, many Huron canoes in reeds.
Alright, Heyward.
Get in there.
Hawkeye, keep it coming.
Alright, go ahead.
Give me your rifle, hold this.
Is he badly hurt?
No, no.
Good lad, take him to the fixing station.
Easy, lads.
Careful now.
He's my friend. I, I'm grateful.
You can save your thanks.
I couldn't let this dispatch fall into enemy hands.
- Is he alright?
- Right as rain.
Tomahawk wound.
Knocked him unconscious but did no permanent damage.
We'll have him around in no time.
You did your best, Uncas.
Chiefs mark my people.
Do marks speak?
It says, semper valor.
It means always brave, like you.
Your warrior.
My warrior who died in the sea, far away.
How is he?
Fair, has squaw fever.
Ottawa arrow.
Go through Uncas bullet pouch.
Ottawa like Huron, no good.
Run, kill pale face.
Slow death.
How many in their tribe?
Many, like leaves in forest.
I think we ought to take a look at their camp.
We can get to them, through the swamp.
Alright, brothers, the Ottawa go to English village, take scalp.
Not all Hurons go to village, some stay here.
If French take Munro's fort, you take plenty English scalp.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
We saw them, heard them.
Magua stirred them into a frenzy.
If they and the Ottawa is raid the settlements, it'll be the bloodiest massacre the frontier is ever known.
And the blood, Colonel, will not be entirely on their hands.
But, my good man,
I tell you, Montcalm is in command.
And I assure you he's a soldier, a gentleman, not a butcher.
And I assure you that he can't stop them.
We can handle the situation when General Webb arrives.
He never will arrive and anyway Montcalm outnumbers you and Webb combined.
You're short of food, supplies, munitions.
We'll defend our colors till the end sir.
And the end will be the massacre of women and children... left unprotected because of your stubborn pride.
You forget yourself sir.
Perhaps I do, but I didn't forget your promise, that the colonials would be released if the settlements were menaced.
My promise still holds good, but I must've more definite proof... than your word.
His word was good on this frontier long before you came here, Colonel.
There's no use continuing the argument, the situation demands a colonial stay.
If this is an example of British colonial policy, we'd do better to make our own peace with the French.
That's sedition sir.
Well, whatever it is, it's the truth.
I'm under an obligation to you so I won't have you whipped... from the fort as you deserve, but get out of here.
Major, I think someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement.
Quite probably.
- Alright, boys?
- Alright, Captain.
Alright, Hawkeye, I'm ready to go.
Good, strike for the east side of the swamp... until you cleared the French picket lines.
The Hurons are holding a pow wow so you don't have to worry about them.
Alright, boys, no noise, keep close to the man ahead of you.
Yeah, we should've skinned out of here long ago.
You fellows going?
We ain't got no families, Captain.
Figured we'd stay here and give the redcoats a hand.
I too.
When you have no ammunition, you need prayer.
We'll keep an eye on the redcoat sentries.
So you aren't coming?
- No.
- Wait, but...
Don't talk, hurry, you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.
Good luck, Captain.
Well, what is it?
Captain. Stop them.
Sound the alarm.
You men, get out to the colonial camp and see what's the matter.
Put these men in irons.
Sentries, get back to your post.
I want to see the prisoners,
I'll only be a moment.
Certainly, Miss Munro.
Hawkeye.
Sorry, I can't ask you in.
Hawkeye, why did you do it?
You saw the settlers' cabin after an Indian raid.
Oh, but this is different.
Why, it's mutiny, it's desertion.
Maybe it is, but what they're doing is murder.
I don't know the wrong or the right of it, all I know is that they hang traitors.
And they'll hang you.
Knowing redcoats,
I bet they don't tie the knot right.
You should've gone when you had the chance.
Why did you stay?
If the fort falls, we may have trouble with the Indians.
I thought your duty was with the settlements.
I guess now my only duty is here.
It was on my account that you stayed.
It can't make any difference, if you know it now.
Perhaps there's a chance
I can make them understand.
Can't you see what he did was heroic?
He knew the consequences and stayed to face them.
You're not hanging a man for mutiny, you're hanging a man for doing... what he felt was his duty.
Oh, father, can't you see how unjust it is?
I'm sorry, Alice.
Duncan, can't something be done?
No, he knew the regulations and knew the penalties for breaking them.
I can't understand a man sending a woman to plead for him.
He didn't send me, you know he wouldn't ask you for anything.
He hates you and so do I for saying such a thing.
I apologize, but why are you here?
You know the army, its regulations.
I'm here because I love him.
Yes, I thought that was it.
Alice, you know I'd do anything I could to keep you from being hurt, even to saving this traitor, but the man is beyond pardon, it's the army, it's justice.
Justice.
Justice, you've got your idea of justice and the sooner the French guns... blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for the colonists.
Alice. You don't know what you're saying.
Oh, yes I do.
For once in my life I'm speaking from my heart, not out of an army book of regulations.
And if it's sedition, well, I'm proud of it.
Have you any idea where we are?
About five miles from the fort sir.
We better hurry or we won't reach the French outpost before daylight.
You've done well, Magua.
Order a parley, Chevalier.
I'm sorry, Father, but Alice wants to be alone.
It's incredible, losing her head over this man.
I'm recommending clemency for the Indians, but the scout knew what he was doing.
Montcalm is asking for parley sir.
Parley?
Well we needn't grant it sir.
I don't know. It will give the men a rest.
Until Webb arrives, every hour counts.
Alright, if the Frenchman wants to talk, we'll oblige him.
- Send out a guard of honor.
- Yes sir.
Company, halt.
Right face.
Step side.
Present arms.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist.
I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
And I to make yours, Mr. de Marquis.
I have long realized that even outnumbered as you are, it would be merely a waste of breath to invite your surrender.
You are correct in that assumption, Monsieur.
As a soldier, I know that one of your courage... does not surrender until his cause is proven hopeless.
Monsieur de Marquis,
I am a soldier, not a diplomat.
You have called this parley for a better reason than an exchange of compliments.
What is it?
My scouts intercepted a dispatch intended for you.
A dispatch, Monsieur?
Read it.
Colonel Munro, Fort William Henry, no reinforcements available, transports delayed by storms at sea, if you cannot retreat, advise immediate surrender of
Fort William Henry.
Signed, Webb.
This may be a trick sir.
No, it's Webb's signature.
You have no alternative, Colonel.
Your own general advises surrender.
I know the temper of our men sir.
I'm sure that rather than spend the rest of the war in a French prison, they'll fight till the end.
You've heard your answer,
Monsieur de Marquis.
Good evening.
No, Colonel, I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many brave men.
Listen to my terms.
Which are?
The fort must be destroyed.
Your men must lay down their arms and return to England.
Further than that, ask what you will.
The honors of war?
They are granted.
My colors.
Take them to England.
Carry them to your king.
I accept your terms, the fort is yours.
So ends a career boy.
You did all you could sir.
Four o'clock, it'll be daylight soon.
Transports ready?
Yes sir.
The men will be ready to march in half an hour.
Have the girls been called yet?
They're dressing now sir.
Should I have the assembly started?
France say peace.
They say bury our hatchets.
Plenty Huron warrior dead.
Our hatchets should be red with the blood of our enemies, but they are bright.
We have no scalp, we are without honor.
There are plenty English scalps.
We'll get them.
Close the door.
General, the Indians have broken into the fort, they are massacring the garrison.
No. Reinforce the guards, Chevalier, summon the fifth regiment.
Alice, Cora, let me in.
Hey, you.
Oh, no, let me go.
Stop, I command you. Stop.
Colonel Munro.
The girls...
Hey, you.
Oh, no. No, no, no. Let me go.
The young ladies, Magua took them.
- Magua.
- They'll head North to their own country.
Yes, yes, go. Save them.
Colonel Munro,
I've come to beg your forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
For a victory, General?
I'd rather have defeat than a victory such as this.
As a soldier I've known both, but this is the first time...
I've ever known disgrace.
The disgrace was not yours, General.
No one could stay the savagery of the Hurons.
I'm proud.
My last battle was lost to you, General.
There is no stigma to being vanquished by such an adversary.
I'm more grateful for those words than I shall be... for his majesty's decorations.
We've looked everywhere for your daughters sir.
We could find no trace of them.
But we shall continue to search, Colonel.
Every British officer shall be given his parole to look for them.
It is my turn to be grateful, General.
My men recovered your sword from the Hurons.
I beg to return it to you.
Thank you, General.
I shan't need it again.
What you stalking, robin red breast, worms?
Well, now that you've tracked me down
I wish you'd get on with the shooting... and spare me your wit such as it is.
Tracked you down?
Shoot you?
No, Major, when I go hunting it's after mountain goat, not sheep.
I guess we're on the same mission.
I'm looking for the young ladies.
Well you're headed in the wrong direction, you better come along with us.
Yangeze warrior like white squaw in forest, no good.
It's his right to come.
I'll join you but I want you to understand that I still consider you... a mutineer, and if ever we are under British jurisdiction again...
I shall enjoy pressing charges against you.
We understand each other, Major.
They took to the stream to keep us from knowing... whether they went up or down.
Uncas, try upstream with the Major, we'll go down.
We've gone over a mile, they must've gone the other way.
Look.
Stone turn.
It's Cora's ring, good girl.
Let's go and get the others.
No, wait. No time, leave mark for them.
Magua bring squaw to council house.
Let Magua tell council what he wishes.
This one Magua take for squaw.
Take your hands off her.
What of this one?
This one like warrior, she die in fire.
We'll die together.
This my squaw.
My son, she is unwilling.
I took these women, it is for me to say.
Malato has given us a law.
It is for law to say.
What kind of a law could you have?
White squaw, listen.
Our fathers planted corn, hunted deer in these forests, many moons before white man's war canoe crossed great salt water.
Our law is good, it is squaw's right to choose between Magua and fire.
Magua wait till sunrise for answer.
Bring them my house.
Day come soon, must be quick.
You watch.
Squaws wait see you in fire.
Come.
Cora, they are offering you your life.
How can you even suggest such a thing, Alice?
- I want to talk to you.
- Why you come out?
Quick, come.
No, no don't go in there, please let her rest, will you?
Hawkeye.
Uncas got away with Cora, big war party after them.
- Which way?
- Follow me.
Mohican.
Go on Uncas, save yourself.
No, Uncas never leave you.
Mohican dog dead, now you Magua's squaw.
No, Hawkeye, I go.
Stay here.
You can't let him go alone.
They must settle it by their own tribal laws.
We can't interfere.
Magua, come down.
Uncas.
Father in heaven, we ask you to receive them in your mercy and wisdom.
This girl who's died on an alien shore, and this boy who's perished to save her.
Amen.
Great spirit, a warrior goes to you swift, straight and unseeing like arrow shot into sun.
Let him sit at council fire of my tribe, for he is Uncas, my son.
My fire his ashes, your fire is bright.
Now all my tribe is there but one.
I, Chingachgook, last of Mohicans.
Go to the trail, Sagamore, and keep watch.
Uncas should've waited for us.
I'll never forgive myself for letting him go after Cora alone.
We still got Alice to think about.
I'll bet it's hopeless, they've got her under heavy guard.
We still have one chance.
What's that?
The Hurons have a prisoner they prize more highly than Alice.
Alright, I'll go.
They wouldn't take you.
Why not?
British officer.
They've had them by the bushel.
There's only one Hawkeye I suppose.
Well, they've waited a long time for a chance to burn me.
And supposing they took you and wouldn't release her.
They wouldn't do that, even they have a code of honor.
They'd shoot you on sight, you wouldn't get a chance to explain.
The wampum is the red man's flag of truce.
They'll respect it.
You know these Hurons well?
Never spoken to any, except Magua.
We weren't exactly on speaking terms.
Do any of them know you?
Only at shooting range.
So the British army is going to be cheated at the pleasure of hanging you.
I'm afraid they will.
Sorry, Yankee, had to be done.
You know me?
Yangeze enemy.
I'm Hawkeye, tribe brother of the Mohicans.
My rifle has slain many of your warriors.
Hawkeye does not follow
Huron trail without long gun.
The long gun brings death,
I come to ask for life.
You speak with twisted tongue.
You have a pale faced woman prisoner here, what are you going to do with her?
She die in fire.
Huron chief, it is no honor if a woman dies in your fire, but there is honor if a warrior dies so.
A warrior as great as Hawkeye.
Will Hawkeye go to stake if Huron set squaw free?
I will.
But you must promise that when I'm dead... you'll guide her to a place of safety.
Hawkeye great warrior, his words are good. Huron promise.
Duncan.
I'm afraid you're a little mixed,
I'm Hawkeye.
Now that's very interesting, Major.
Well, maybe I'm the Major.
Hey.
Who are you?
Hawkeye.
The man is lying, he's a crazy Englishman, got knocked on the head.
This one come to village, say him Hawkeye, want to go to fire for you.
Now this one come, one die, one live.
Squaw know.
What does it matter?
I'm the prisoner, send them both away.
Hawkeye make bargain with Hurons, him die in fire.
Squaw tell truth.
I can't answer.
You don't need further proof than my clothes.
Many Yangeze wear cap of skin, robe of deer.
Hurons never see face of Hawkeye, but know Hawkeye long gun.
- Bring rifle.
- No, no. Wait a moment.
- Take squaw away.
- No.
Fair weapons.
Major, let's see how the British army shoots.
There's your target.
You think you can hit that by firelight?
We're not playing pitch penny, my dear.
This is a shooting match.
Hawkeye hit it.
Major, I bet that's the best shot you ever made in all your life.
Try and beat it.
Another jug.
No, jugs are scarce, that'll do.
You Hawk eye.
You creep into our village, take squaw.
Start, when sun come over hills my warriors go look for you.
I ignored your hand once, Yankee, can I shake it now?
Bring squaw.
Hawkeye.
Promise me something, you have till sunrise till they start after you.
Sagamore is watching, he'll find you and take you to safety.
My orders are he's not to come back for me.
My orders, Major, understand?
I have your word?
Yes.
Hawk eye brave warrior.
When sunrise my guns test his strength, find out how great.
What is it?
Yangeze.
- What men are you?
- General Abercrombie's column.
Where's your leader?
Captain Winthrop, Captain Winthrop.
Yes, what?
- Miss Munro.
- Oh, Captain Winthrop, hurry.
General Abercrombie,
Colonel Munro's daughter is dead.
Hawkeye is been captured by the Indians.
Chingachgook, lead the way.
Guards, bring in the prisoner.
You're charged with striking a superior officer.
You're cited to wholesale desertion and high treason to the crown.
A formidable list of charges sir.
Major Heyward, you prefer the charges, give me the details.
The charges sir, are correct.
Each of them is a capital offense.
Explain the charge of desertion,
Major Heyward.
He did incite the men to leave the fort, however,
I might point out that if he hadn't done so, those colonials would never have met your command... to save them from an Ottawa ambush.
And you yourself mightn't be here in Albany to pass judgment on him.
May I ask sir, do you stand before this court... as his accuser or in his defense?
Neither sir.
I'm merely telling you the whole truth.
Thank you.
Now regarding his seditious utterances.
Well sir, I don't remember the actual words... but it was the heat of the moment that made them seditious... and not the thought behind them.
He was concerned with the lives of the unprotected women... and children of the settlement.
I'm sure you'll agree that these are sentiments in accord... with our British ideals.
And British action.
Since you're so familiar with the case,
Major, I welcome a recommendation.
Well sir, personally knowing the value of this man as a scout, and realizing our lack of them,
I would recommend that he be enlisted in the British army.
What do you say to that sir?
Well, I guess after all, we're fighting for the same thing.
I'll join you, General.
Thank you, charges dismissed.
Court martial adjourned.
Thank you.
Oh, I've always promised him a taste of British justice.
Well, we march to Canada.
Goodbye, Alice.
Goodbye, Duncan.
You've got to fall in.
I always thought it was beautiful until now.
Well, this goodbye has been a little delayed.
Does it have to be goodbye?
Aren't you going back to England?
I have nothing to go back for now.
I want to stay here in America.
But this is no country for a girl like you, Alice.
We've got a job on our hands.
You know it takes more than rifles to make a new civilization, it takes spinning wheels too.
That's a woman's way of being first.
And attention.
When you come back,
I'll be waiting for you here in Albany.
Forward, march.
Gentlemen, the war is over at last.
The men are coming back.
The living are coming back.
We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers.
Idle men.
Men badly in need of work, Mr. President.
Gentlemen, we have the country to save fiirst.
But these men have saved their country.
Now the country must save them.
Their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry... by furnishing suddenly a greater supply oflabor than for which there could be a demand.
Mr. President.
Mr. Colfax.
I have read an editorial in the Terra Haute Express... written by Mr.John Soule, in which he says, ''Go west, young man.''
Where there is room for all.
Gentlemen, our land stretches from an Eastern sea to a Western sea.
Surely, in that vast territory, there is a place for men to live and work and be happy.
Right,
Mr. President.
True, Mr. President.
I hope to attract our disbanded soldiers to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges... and to the wealth that lies in the soil itself.
And to the grasslands of the Great Plains.
The fields of Illinois, the broken sod of Kansas, the long furrows of the West.
Yes, Mr. President, but if only the frontier could be made safe for the plow.
It must be made safe.
But during the war hostile Indians massacred our settlers there.
- Mr. Lincoln?
- Yes, Mary?
We'll be late for the theater.
Gentlemen, I promised to take Mrs. Lincoln to Ford's Theater tonight.
We will continue this tomorrow... for the frontier must be made safe.
Good night, Mr. President.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. President.
I have never seen him looking so well.
But the war is over, and we have on our hands order after order... canceled by the government.
Hundreds of thousands of rifles unsold.
Once we were the saviors of our country.
Now we're outcasts.
Our money invested in an unsalable product.
But a good product, gentlemen.
A new repeating rifle would have made short work of the war... had it been introduced earlier.
But now the subject of guns is an unpopular topic... to those who needed them so badly a short while ago.
We'll have to look to Providence for a market.
Providence? Where?
I've been told that the Indians hunt with bow and arrow.
Still, they obtain furs, valuable buffalo hides, otter, fox and beaver.
With our new repeating rifle--
Dearie me.
Why shouldn't we be frank?
I have every reason to believe the Indians will pay $1 00 for each rifle.
A hundred dollars?
In furs. And a dollar a piece for every cartridge.
But we can't sell rifles to the Indians!
I think we can... to peaceable Indians.
But how--
For hunting.
They furnish us with furs.
We supply them with rifles.
Really quite simple.
Won't they use those guns against white men?
We'll get the Indians to promise not to do so.
I'm against this!
But why?
It's bound to make trouble on the frontier.
President Lincoln says--
We have a perfect right to do it.
Sheer nonsense.!
The army would stop us.
They control trade with the Indians.
They did, my friend.
But Indian affairs have been taken out of the hands of the army... and given to a civilian authority.
A civilian authority?
Yep, in which we are to have a certain participation.
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.
But who sells the rifles?
Ask Mr. Lattimer to come in.
Perhaps not the most personable gentleman... but certainly the man for our needs.
Gentlemen, this is
Mr.John Lattimer,
How do you do? who will distribute our rifles through St. Louis... to Hays City and all the Great Plains.
Right, Mr. Lattimer?
I said I'd do it.
Van Ellyn, if ever
Mr. Lincoln finds out--
It's a legitimate business.
The Ford Theater.!
Open that window!
Lincoln shot at Ford's Theater.!
The president is dying.!
Hear that?
Someone has shot the president.
They say he's dying.
Only yesterday afternoon
I was talking to him at the Capitol.
Maybe it isn't true.
We must learn the facts.
A terrible thing,
Mr. Lattimer.
Yes, a national calamity.
You will leave at once for St. Louis.
Dearie me.
Terrible thing.
Oh, there he is.
- Excuse me, soldier!
- Bull's-eye!
I didn't see ya.
That's all right, son.
Come here and let me see your gun.
You haven't got any notches on it.
What'd I kill?
Don't you see that great big buffalo laying there kickin'?
Yeah. He's a big one, ain't he?
Give me your knife, and we'll skin 'im.
You better not.
You might find out he's been eating potatoes.
Gee, whillikens.
I'll bet you could kill a buffalo with this knife.
You can't kill a buffalo with a knife.
Aw. I'll bet
Buffalo Bill could.
You know what
I saw him do once?
What?
First give me back my Arkansas toothpick.
You give me back my gun.
I saw Buffalo Bill shoot at a whole herd of them once.
At first I thought he'd missed.
Then two of them started coughing and fell down dead.
He'd killed 'em both and raised a big cloud of dust a mile and a half the other side of them.
And that isn't all.
That little cloud of dust he raised grew into a whirlwind, turned itself into a cyclone and wiped out one-fourth ofTexas... before they could stop it.
Jimminies!
That's the kind of shootin' I aim to do.
That whistle's just a half a minute wrong.
Listen.
Don't that beat all.
Cute, isn't it?
Say, you're dressed like a scout there.
So's your sister.
That's not my sister.
That's CalamityJane.
Was she your best girl?
Son, one of these days you're gonna grow up, and you ought to know about women.
You see, the thing is this, women are, uh--
Well, they're, um--
Well, son--
I can tell you what an Indian will do to ya, but you never know what a woman will do.
Why?
Well--
Let's go down and take a look at that fire engine.
If you don't like her, what do you carry her picture around for?
It's the only good picture of me I ever had taken.
I can't cut her off without cutting off my chin.
John Lattimer, 1 7.
I see a good mark.
John Lattimer, 1 8.
Wait. I see an easy mark.
Where?
John Lattimer, 1 9.
Oh, yes.
Hello, Virginia!
I'll be around shortly.
We hate to say good-bye.
When you comin' back?
When you come and see me.
I want you to take Hannibal.
He sings.
Oh, Will, look.
I see a good fighting man who's been fool enough to get himself married.
Ow!
What's the matter?
Oh, my hats!
Jiggers! Let's duck.
Here. Hold on, bub.
Come back here.
Hey, who do you think you're--
Bill! You long-legged, fugacious old gallinipper!
What are you doin' here?
Well, I, uh--
Here's somebody who wants an introduction to you.
Boy, you wouldn't know him in these tinhorn garments, but this is the best scout west of the Mississippi.
Shake hands with Buffalo Bill.
Buffalo Bill!
Howdy, youngster.
Son, this fellow taught me all
I ever knew about scoutin'.
Ah!
You mustered out yet,
Bill?
Yesterday.
Ya ain't losin' much time gettin' up the Big Muddy.
He seems to have met a friend.
Yes, a rather strange friend.
How long have you been out?
Oh, about three months.
I see she hasn't cut your hair... yet.
I don't know what you mean, Bill.
You know what happened to Samson when Delilah opened her barbershop.
Has she tamed you yet?
That ain't fair.
She's different.
You're different.
Bill, she's the finest little gal--
I know, I know.
You gotta meet her.
No, Bill.
Women and me don't agree.
All that's goin; get aboard.!
Come on! You'll like her.
All that's goin', get aboard!
Don't be nervous.
He'll be here.
Come, Will!
Hurry.!
All right, Lou.
I want you to meet the best friend--
We haven't time.
We must get on the boat.
All that's goin; get aboard.!
Bye, Buffalo Bill!
Bye!
Bye, Louisa.!
Good-bye!
Honey, we're on our way.
You're not frightened, are ya?
I'm not frightened of anything after these three wonderful months.
It's a big place we're going to-- the West-- isn't it?
Good-bye, Buffalo Bill!
Huh?
What's the matter, boy?
Good-bye, bub. That's yours.
Gee! Thanks, mister!
Don't forget what I told ya about women.
And here's your gun.
Good hunting!
I'm Jack McCall,
Mr. Hickok.
Tickled to death to be traveling with you.
Pleased to meet you.
Hey, your toothpick's on fire.
This ain't a toothpick.
''Cigareetes,'' they call them back East.
Oh, I see.
A new fad, huh?
Hmm?
Barkeep, bring me an applejack, will ya?
Yes, sir.
You want one?
No.
I call ya.
I have ace, king, queen, jack and a ten.
Sorry, mister.
Mr. Hickok.
I'd like to speak to you.
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm Louisa Cody.
Will's told me how long you've been friends... and how you fought for him once.
He says you don't trust women.
Not as a rule, Mrs. Cody.
But in your case--
Mr. Hickok,
I'm going to help Will.
Don't you believe I can?
Well, I don't know, ma'am.
I'll open.
He killed his first Indian at 1 2.
But he's not--
At 1 4, he was riding Pony Express.
He's one of the best natural scouts on the frontier.
Will's promised to give up scouting and killing Indians... and all that nonsense.
The West is in his blood.
You can't change that.
But you've been away from it so long.
It is changing, and why shouldn't
Will change with it?
We're going to start a little hotel.
Cody?
Yes.
Someday you may be one of our neighbors with a wife of your own.
Excuse me, ma'am, but the hotel keeper seems to be in trouble... with his neighbors right now.
I'll bet you $20.
Hello, Bill.
Don't play that hand.
- Why not?
- Maybe you can trust one woman-- authorities differ-- but three?
Not on your life.
Your wife wants to talk to you.
She's outside.
Well, if you don't mind, gentlemen.
It's all right.
How much money did you lose?
About $48.
I'll sit in for you.
Any objections, gentlemen?
No, no objections at all.
We've got new blood in the game.
Heinie.
Yes, sir?
Take the gentlemen's order.
Take the order all around.
Rye for me.
Applejack, please.
Rye.
No, thank you.
Ante.
Cut.
Heinie?
Yes, sir.
Bring me something cool.
Yes, sir.
Well,
I'll bet you $50.
I'll see that and raise you 1 00.
On that watch?
Yes, it's a mighty fine watch.
Plays a tune whenever you press that little spring. See?
It ain't worth $1 50.
It is to me.
I'll redeem that watch anytime for a thousand.
All right, I'll take your word on it, and I'll up ya 300.
And I'll call ya.
They're all blue, mister.
Watch yourself.
What's the matter?
I'm calling the hand that's in your hat.
Take it off!.
Take a look,
Mr.Jayhawker.
The name is Hickok.
Hickok?
Not Wild Bill Hickok?
Mr. Hickok to you.
I'm calling this hand.
And I'm taking this pot.
Maybe I ought to shoot a couple of holes through your ears, so we'll know you.
Men like you ought to be marked.
Maybe he'll do it too.
Wouldn't be no trick at all for Bill.
He's my friend.
He can hit a dime at 30 paces.
Four times out of five.
Five times out of five.
He killed the whole McDaniels gang.
And he got 'em alone too.
Does he kill like that?
Ain't a corpse maker like him, honey.
Cash these in, Mr. Banker.
It's a pleasure,
Mr. Hickok.
Maybe I ought to take
Mr. Cody's losings too.
He's got a wife to support.
Whoa there!
Lizzie's two hours late.
Hustle your passengers off.
I'll pick the best of them for you, Calamity.
My horses ain't used to waitin'.
Back up there,Joe!
Mark three!
Look out!
Don't foul that hauser there!
Hey, there.!
Leavenworth landing!
All for Leavenworth get off.
Hey! Aboard there!
Purser!
Watch the line.
My name's John Lattimer.
You got a bunch of freight for me put aboard at St. Louis?
Yeah, lots of it consigned to Hays City.
I got my own wagons here!
I want that stuff shouldered off first up!
Right away! Hey, Tim!
Hustle that shipment forJohn Lattimer off.
Come on, boys!
Get goin'!
Hi, Calamity.
Hi, yourself.
Keepin' company tonight?
Yeah, me and my six horses.
Seven's a lucky number.
Count me in.
You sailors are all alike.
Hey, Bill!
Help me pack this outfit ashore.
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
What is this? Feathers?
Hats.
''Hats''?
Lou, Bill will take you off to the stage. I got to go see about the trunks.
This going to be the hotel orchestra, ma'am?
Bill, we're not joking about that hotel.
I guess a hotel suits you after all. Start with a birdcage and expand, huh?
Lattimer, six.
Come on, boys.!
Get along here.!
Lattimer, seven.
Lattimer, eight.
Keep 'em on your backs there.
I'm sorry, boss.
Powerful heavy to tote.
- Shut your lip!
John Lattimer, nine.
Hey!
Take this box!
Yes, sir!
Get out, you!
John Lattimer, ten.
Lattimer, 1 1, goin'to Hays City.
Don't that look like--
Farming tools.
You operate out of Hays City?
Sure! What of it?
Didn't have any use for farming tools the last time I was there.
I freight whatever they send me, and I mind my own business.
John Lattimer, 1 5.
That's a right good idea, a right, good way to keep out of trouble.
John Lattimer, 1 6.
Bill!
You mangy old coyote!
Ha!
John Lattimer, 1 8.
Bill, you're back.
Aw, you four-flushing mule.
You ain't wipin' it off.
You're rubbing it in.
Are you gonna stay in Leavenworth?
Are you?
I could.
I'm going on to Hays City.
Why didn't you write me any letters, Bill?
I didn't know you could read.
I could read if you could write.
A woman who has a fellow at every stage station... and a beau in every cavalry troop west of the Missouri--
That woman doesn't need any letters from me.
Those fellers didn't mean nothin' to me.
They did to me.
Let's forget it.
Maybe I did make a mistake.
You won't get a chance to make that mistake again.
Bill!
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm keeping a lady waiting.
I'm awfully sorry to have put you to so much trouble, Mr. Hickok.
That's all right.
I don't know what could have happened to Will.
This is the Hays City stage, ma'am. I'll fetch Will and the rest of the outfit.
Thank you.
Is that chipmunk yours?
Did ya bring her with ya?
What if I did?
It's none of your business.
Ain't it, after you run out on me?
You slab-sided, bird-totin' rat!
You brung that honky-tonk mopsy--
Shut up, Calamity.
Tip your hat when you speak to a lady.
I will, when I speak to a lady.
Aw, Bill.
Careful, Lou.
That's a big step.
Look out for Hannibal.
Will, isn't it exciting?
Have you got everything?
I've got you and the parasol and Hannibal... and boxes and hats and--
Hi, Calamity!
Well, Bill Cody!
What are you doin' in them buzzard feathers?
Pretty fancy, huh?
Calamity, I want to introduce you.
Lou, this is CalamityJane.
Everybody knows her.
Born and bred out yonder.
A dead shot, rides better than a man, drives stage.
Why, I've seen her flick the rattles off a rattle--
Say, is she your mopsy?
She's Mrs. Cody.
Your wife!
Aw.
I'm certainly glad to know ya, Mrs. Cody.
How do you do, Miss Calamity?
Canary's the name, ma'am.
I beg your pardon.
I didn't know.
Not at all, ma'am.
Four passengers for Hays City, Calamity.
Get going.
Suits me.
You'll find the backseat easy ridin', Mrs. Cody.
Thank you.
Come on, Bill. Get in.
That's no way to treat your passengers.
You ain't a passenger.
You're freight.
My name's Jack McCall.
I'm goin' to Hays City.
What are you smokin'?
Chalk?
Cigareete.
Well, get in anyway.
Another one for Hays City, ma'am.
That river clipper's sayin' good-bye to you, ma'am.
Now you're gonna have three long days of this prairie clipper.
But tomorrow's Sunday.
Do we ride on Sunday?
There's no Sunday west ofJunction City, no law west of Hays City and no God west of Carson City.
Hold tight, ma'am.
I'm holding tight.
Still travelin' together,
Mr. Hickok, huh?
What are you doin' up here?
I'm drivin'.
Get! Get up there!
Get up there!
You've been driving for three days.
You've changed horses
1 4 times.
Don't you ever change those beads you're wearing?
I ain't wearin' 'em
'cause you give 'em to me.
I'm wearin' 'em
'cause I like beads.
Oh, Will, are all the roads in Kansas like this?
No, honey!
Some of'em are pretty bad.
What's the matter?
Clem?
Take these ribbons.
Yeah?
Stranger, I wonder if you could--
Breezy!
Why, it's Bill Hickok.
I thought you was off to the war.
The war's over.
Yeah? Just beginning where I come from.
There's 2,000 or 3,000
Sioux Indians cayoodlin' around
Fort Piney with war paint on.
Wild Bill Hickok to see General Custer.
I'll see him.
Yes, sir.
How do you do, General?
Oh, hello, Hickok.
I heard you were coming to town.
I know of your reputation as a killer, and I want to warn you... that we'll tolerate no lawlessness here at Hays City.
You better get that word through to the Indians, because they've just wiped out half the garrison at Fort Piney.
- How do you know?
- I was about to report to you... before you became so interested in my accomplishments... that we've been pulling arrows out of
Colonel Carrington's old scout.
Breezy?
Yes.
Colonel Carrington told him if you didn't get ammunition to Fort Piney, they're done for.
Find Captain Reed!
Yes, sir.
I'll get that ammunition to Fort Piney somehow.
But I can't spare more than one troop to take it.
Here at Hays City,
I'm faced by Satanta's Kiowas.
The whole Sioux nation's up here.
And now Yellow Hand's on the loose with his Cheyenne.
I can't move from Hays City until I find out where that he-wolf s heading for.
He's an old friend of mine.
We used to hunt buffalo together on the Cimarron.
He's hunting men now, and I've got to locate him.
Maybe I can find him for ya.
He ought to be just about... there.
Hmph.
Oh, Captain Reed.
Yes, sir.
Hickok reports that half of Carrington's command at Fort Piney's been wiped out.
I'm sending 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition.
Have Captain Woods prepare to leave at once with a wagon train.
Mules are right handy animals, General.
What?
They can get by the Indians much better than wagons can.
Yes, he's right.
Use mules.
They'll have to get by about a thousand Cheyenne.
Why not send them east of the trail through Deep Valley?
Yes, and across the upper ford of the Republican, but who's going to guide them?
I haven't got a scout who knows that territory.
I beg your pardon, but Buffalo Bill Cody just got in town.
Cody? Yes, he knows the lay of that land.
And he's up to all Indian tricks.
He's got himself a squaw.
You'll probably find him knitting or washing dishes.
What do you mean?
He's married a ravishing little woman from points East.
I don't care if he married an Eskimo.
Tell him to come here.
His mind's set on starting a hotel.
There's an Indian war starting.
Women lying on these plains with Indian arrows in them.
Get Cody here.
- Suppose I go in his place?
- You're going after Yellow Hand.
Don't let him catch you.
He doesn't treat his prisoners very well.
Tell Cody that ammunition train is leaving before sundown.
Yes, sir.
And he'll be leaving with them.
Orderly.
Oh, Will, there's so much dirt blowing in.
It's got to blow someplace, honey.
Tumbleweed, Lou.
They won't bite ya.
Oh, dear!
There's no use fightin' the wind, Lou.
We have to bear with this land.
Oh, I know, Will.
When are we going to move into town and take over the hotel?
I'm gonna see
Jeb Masters tomorrow.
He wants to sell the Golden Rule House.
Here's your grub!
Why, come in, Miss Canary.
Hiya, Bill.
What'd you bring?
Well, I'll tell ya.
I got something to fry, and I got something to boil.
And a jug of whiskey!
Oh!
He never misses, Mrs. Cody.
I'll take that.
You've got a lot to do.
That stove smokes, and there's no mattress on the bed.
You haven't got the lamps filled yet.
Look at this place.
This is a grand shebang.
Oh, Calamity.
You could stable the queen of Sheba.
How can you say that?
It's so dusty, and I haven't got my curtains hung yet.
We'll help ya. Hey, you long-legged two-spot, give your wife a hand.
And here's the bodkin.
Hey!
Put it in that window.
Say! Look it.
That would make a pretty dress, wouldn't it?
Calamity, do you ever wear dresses?
I might if I had one.
You're going to look awfully nice in one of mine.
That curtain looks right pretty.
Bodkin Bill.
Have you had any experience with a horse blanket?
Plenty.
Lou says I've had too much.
That's too bad.
There's a horse outside waitin' for ya now.
You tryin' to trade, Bill?
Yes.
A hotel for the lives of 48 men... and 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition thrown in.
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?
You and the bird feel at home yet, ma'am?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Is Custer sending that ammunition to Fort Piney?
He's hoping they'll get through... if 48 cavalrymen can dodge about 1 ,000 Cheyenne.
Birds do not eat beans,
Mr. Hickok.
You think those swatties can make it?
Depends which way
Custer sends 'em.
Through Deep Valley.
Through the upper ford of the Republican.
Yeah. They might get through that way.
They would get through if Bill Cody showed them how.
There's no trail.
Better no trail if they're dodging Cheyenne.
Will's not going.
He has nothing to do with the army now.
He's promised.
That's just what I told Custer.
What did you tell him?
That you wouldn't go.
You know that's a lie.
Mr. Hickok,
Will promised me.
You don't understand.
I can't let him go.
There are things that have to be done, ma'am.
Lincoln set a goal that we have to work toward.
He said the frontier must be made safe.
Oh, but
Lincoln's dead.
What right have the dead to tell the living what to do?
His words are alive.
Bill Cody knows that as well as I do.
If he refuses to go, you'll think he's a coward, and you know he's not.
The choice is his, ma'am.
Will, I was afraid of this.
You can't leave me.
You can't--
You've never seen the Indian tribes at war.
You've never seen men killed and mutilated and bodies of women burned... and babies dragged from their mother's arms and dashed against--
That's enough, Bill!
Why is it you aren't going, Mr. Hickok?
I have to pay a call on an old friend.
You're goin' after Yellow Hand.
Bill, you're goin' out alone!
You cold decker, ain't you got no sense?
Maybe I can get you another string of beads.
Ya ornery coot!
Good-bye, my darling.
Oh, Will, please--
I've got to go, dear.
I know every foot of the way.
I have to do my part.
Here.
I'll look out for you, Mrs. Cody.
He'll be back in a few days.
He'll be back with nary a scratch on him.
Will! Will!
Come back!
Don't cry, honey.
I wanted to tell him something.
What?
Maybe if he'd known, he wouldn't have gone.
Oh.
Well, maybe it's just as well you didn't tell him.
What is this, Louisy?
Cat?
It's sort of a Russian cat.
Say.
Look at that.
I don't know how I look, but I feel like the queen of Sheba.
You look lovely,
Calamity.
I want you to keep that dress.
Ya do?
Say, that's the first time a woman ever gave me anything.
Why, I never even seen clothes like these.
Now, if I just had me a hat!
Here, try one of these.
Oh, say, ain't that a pretty one.
Well, how do you do,
Miss Canary?
Hmph.
Hmph. Appears to me your face is kind of made out of rubber.
That old coyote's got a toad in his gullet.
Couldn't be an Indian, could it?
Honey, when you hear something yelling at night, it's just some varmint.
But when you don't hear nothin', it's an Injun.
Calamity, I want you to stay here with me.
I've never been alone before.
Now, stop worryin' about him, honey.
He's got a whole troop of cavalry ridin' herd on him.
But my Bill plays it alone, the big mule.
I bet if he could see me in this outfit, it'd be my weddin' dress.
I'd just as leave die with my boots on, but I ain't a-gonna to get married in 'em.
Can I have some shoes?
Louisy, don't look at the windows.
Don't let on anything's different.
Listen to me.
Can you ride?
Yes.
My horse is outside.
Take that coffeepot back to the stove.
Then open that door and wait.
Make believe you're helping me with my glove.
I'm gonna entertain visitors. They're Injuns.
Injuns!
Shut up. When you see them all in here, sneak to the horse.
Ride to town.
Don't stop for nothin'.
Tell 'em there's Injuns here with war paint on.
Make me some fresh coffee, honey.
Come in, fellows.
Come on in.
Don't be afraid.
I-- I got something for ya.
Look. I got some presents for ya.
See? See the pretty feather?
Sure. Sure.
It's a hat. See?
Here. Here, put it on.
Come on.
I'll show you.
Go look at the pretty feather, you painted buzzard.
Here. Here, look.
Pretty?
You don't like it, huh?
Well, here. Take this.
I got something for all of ya.
Presents for all of you.
We've been savin' 'em.
Look.
Presents for my brothers, the Cheyenne, you red hyenas.
Here. Look. See?
Look. Here.
Come on in. Look.
See? Here.
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
Look. For papoose.
See? Papoose.
Uh, want a piece of cake?
Soldier.
''Soldier''?
Me no talk Cheyenne.
I'll never tell ya where they've gone, ya hairless coyote!
Hello there! Hey!
Bill.!
You get outta here.!
Go back, Bill!
These are Yellow Hand's men.!
You're crazy.!
Shoot your way out, Bill!
You'll get a tomahawk in your brains if you keep askin' for it.
Indians will sell anything.
They might sell you.
Wild Bill Hickok, walkin' into the hands of a war party.
Custer sure picked himself a great scout.
Aw, Bill, not your watch.
What's he saying, Bill?
He wants my guns too.
Don't give 'em to him.
Don't give up your guns!
What's he saying?
He says he's got to take us to Yellow Hand first.
He can't let us go unless Yellow Hand's willing.
Well, you done it, didn't ya?
Yes, I ''done it,'' all right.
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?
You sure must remember me.
How do you like me in dresses?
Thought you were Mrs. Cody at first, in that dress.
Oh. Mrs. Cody give it to me.
Were you in Cody's cabin when they caught ya?
Yeah, celebrating on account of Bill Cody's kid.
Bill Cody hasn't got a kid.
He's gonna have one.
He doesn't know it, does he?
He would if he stayed home where he belongs.
I'll tell him... maybe.
Say, Bill, you give up your watch... and your guns.
Couldn't have been on account of me, could it?
No. I wanted him to take me to Yellow Hand, so I can find out what he's up to.
Oh.
What do you think they'll do to us?
We'll soon find out.
You Hickok.
I know you.
Speak your own language, Yellow Hand.
I'll understand you.
You, me, speak white man tongue.
I must know you know what I say.
Remember what I told you last time we met?
I said one of us will lift the other's scalp.
Which one?
It looks like it's up to you to say.
What started you on the warpath, Yellow Hand?
Where sun rise, white man's land.
Where sun set,
Indian land.
White man come, take our land.
Kill buffalo, our food.
White man promise us food.
White man lie.
Now Cheyenne buy white man's thunder stick.
Soon war drums sound in all Indian land.
All tribes ride with Yellow Hand.
We drive white man, like buffalo, away, back to rising sun.
Yellow Hand has spoken.
Yellow Hand has spoken.
And you may be right.
But you can't drive the white man away.
Yellow Hand know.
White man send bullet.
Many, many bullet. Where?
Somebody's romancing Yellow Hand.
You tell where.
I don't know.
You tell where!
He's your friend, Bill.
Why don't you tell him they're heading east toward Leavenworth?
Yes, that's right.
To Leavenworth.
- Now I know soldier take bullet.
- They won't fit your guns.
Hickok, my friend, speak with straight tongue.
Hickok, white man friend, speak with forked tongue.
Now, you tell, which way soldier take bullet?
Bill, what's in that watch?
Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
I couldn't get it out without scratching the case.
You've been actin' like you didn't care, and all the time--
Tie up that tongue of yours.
Look at their faces.
Let her go.
She doesn't know anything.
You too quick to say she not know.
Hickok will not tell, but Yellow Hand will know.
Now is hour of Great Bear rising.
When moon in sky here,
Yellow Hand will know.
What's he talking about the moon for?
What does he mean?
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about
John Lattimer's farming tools... that came up on the boat.
Oh, rifles.
Better rifles than we have.
Seven shot repeaters, and each shot may mean the life of a white man.
But what do you think they're fixin' to do to us?
I think maybe you gave them an idea what to do.
Hear them drums?
That's taps for us, ain't it, Bill?
Won't be so hard, goin' out together.
It'll be harder than you know.
Calamity, there are only two of us.
Two lives against all those men on the ammunition train.
But I don't want to die!
I don't want you to die!
Hang onto yourself.
You'll have to help me.
Just like you did the first time
I saw you, remember?
I was just a kid and no more sense than I got now, headin' down the grade with no brakes on.
I loved you then, Bill, just like I do now.
Looks like that moon's gettin' ready to show.
You never even gave me a picture, but you kept mine.
I know you care for me a little.
Couldn't you say it just once?
Maybe they'll let us go after all.
Bill Hickok!
You ornery son of a mule!
You wouldn't give a bad dime to a sick kid, would ya?
You may be right,
Calamity.
No, I ain't.
I know it.
I ain't worth a bad dime.
Bill-- Bill, every night
I talk to ya.
Wantin' ya.
I know you feel the same.
Won't you tell me?
What difference would that make now?
If only I could hear ya say it once.
It would give me somethin' to keep... like it was kind of holy, like I could keep it forever.
Calamity--
Yellow Hand find out now which way soldier go.
Bill.
Yes, Calamity, I do.
I--
I love you.
You wait.
Yellow Hand no want to kill Hickok... but must know which way soldier go with bullet.
When he know,you go free.
Hickok go free.
Don't talk to him,
Calamity!
Don't trust him!
Bill.!
Bill!
If you no tell which way soldier go with bullet,
Hickok soon be dead.
Bill Cody's with that ammunition train!
Forty-eight men are there, Calamity!
Oh, Bill! I can't!
You tell?
No.
Which way?
Oh, no! No! Don't!
Don't let them do it!
Don't! Please! Don't!
Oh!
Which way?
Don't forget Cody--
And all those men!
Remember what I told you!
They're burning him!
They're killing him!
Put out the fire!
Put out the fire!
Oh.!
Put out the fire!
Which way soldier go with bullet?
Deep Valley through the upper ford.
Squaw no lie.
Yellow Hand no lie.
You free. Go.
I couldn't help it, Bill.
Won't you look at me?
I hope
I'll never have to look at you again.
Look out, Bill!
Look out!
Thing ain't right here,
Captain Wood.
See anything?
No, but I feel it.
Things ain't right here.
We can halt over there while you take a look around.
They're caught, like rats in a trap.
They're all around us, on both sides of the river!
- We'll hold this island!
Throw your horses!
Get those ammunition packs off.
Get them out of the line of fire!
I can't see nothin' to shoot at but smoke.
Where are they?
They'll never get out now.
I gotta go down there.
You ain't goin' down there.
Get behind this tree and wait.
You've got to reach
General Custer.
I'll get there, somehow.
Head down Prairie Dog Creek.
Get a fresh mount tomorrow from the Pony Express at Simpson's.
And if Custer finds out you told Yellow Hand, he'll give you the firing squad.
He won't find out.
I'm gonna tell him.
Tell him you brought a thousand Cheyenne against his 48 men!
Set up that barricade with those saddles! Those saddles on those barricades, and hurry!
Don't go too deep with that hole or you'll get that ammunition in water!
All right, sir.
Burned through the legs.
It feels like it broke the bone.
Your knife, Bill.
Give me that scabbard for the splint.
Watch 'em, men!
They may rush us!
Never saw such rifle-fire from Indians!
They haven't let up for a minute.
There's either a million of'em, or they're using those new repeating rifles.
Look out!
They're firin' powerful fast.
It ain't like what we had at Gettysburg.
Were you at Gettysburg?
I was on the other side in that.
Then you must've been--
- Stop talkin', you two!
- Get down there!
Aim well and fire slowly.
Hold your fire, men!
That's a white man!
Cover him, McGinnis!
Cover him!
What would a white man be doin' out there?
Holy mackerel!
He hasn't got a chance!
He's still ridin'.
Drop some of them Injuns back of him!
That fellow must have nine lives!
He'll need every one of'em.
They got him!
No, they haven't!
Come on, Bill.!
Run for it.!
Keep those long legs goin'!
Hi, Bill.
Sufferin' cats!
Wild Bill!
I'll tell the captain you're here.
Tell him I expect to be here for a long time.
Hi, Bill.
You guidin' for Yellow Hand?
Where's your feathers?
Captain Wood,
Wild Bill Hickok.
Touch 'em up in those trees.
Range about 200 yards!
Hickok?
Wild Bill Hickok?
Yes, sir. He just dropped in from Yellow Hand.
Wha--
I thought Custer sent you to locate Yellow Hand.
I located him, didn't I?
Him and a few Cheyenne.
You sure did a good job.
I notice you're using his equipment.
You'll notice it's better than yours too.
Where did you get that mark on your wrist? Bracelet?
Ha. Squaw bracelet.
Takin' Bill Hickok prisoner just don't sound right to me.
No? What about Bill Cody following his nose into a Cheyenne ambush?
Hmm.
Looky here.
These Injuns were waitin' for us. They knew we was comin' to this ford.
You didn't tell 'em, Bill?
Then who did tell 'em?
I said, who did tell 'em?
I've something more important than that to tell you.
You're gonna be a father.
Huh?
A daddy.
Well, but, uh--
How did you know?
Mrs. Cody told Calamity.
Calamity told me.
Well, somebody mighta told me.
Well, uh... the news didn't leak out till after we left.
Oh, well then how--
Where did you see Calamity?
Oh, uh... around.
Has she got rawhide marks on her wrist too?
What's your guess it'll be, a boy or a girl?
It's bound to be one or the other, isn't it?
That's customary.
From what I've seen of you lately, my guess is a girl.
Girls are all right.
If it's a boy,
I suppose he'll be a bellboy in that hotel of yours.
If it's a girl, we'll keep her out of Yellow Hand's camp.
Oh!
Hey, Bill.
Hey, soldier.
Wait till I knock the tail feathers off of that turkey.
Help me over to the wagon with him.
They got Buffalo Bill,
Captain.
Keep down or they'll get you.
Where's the doctor, Captain?
They got him in the first volley.
Bandages are in the box there.
Here's a fresh one.
Sort of parted your hair,
Bill. Flesh wound.
Looks like that little stranger's gonna have a papa.
Never mind that.
We got plenty of water in the river.
Hickok.
Yes, sir?
It's gonna be a siege.
Days of it.
After dark, I'll call for volunteers to try to get back to General Custer.
I've already sent word to Custer.
Who'd you send?
Who'd you send?
- CalamityJane.
Calamity? Wha--
She oughta get through.
She'd better get through.
There you are.
I oughta have you stood up and shot.
Why don't you?
If I had the authority to do it,
I'd like nothing better, but I haven't.
I can't make you pay for what you've done.
You won't have to.
Ten hut.!
Captain Wood.
Lieutenant Burke.
Sergeant Higgins.
Corporal Brannigan.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
- Bugler Corry.
- Here, but not for long.
Seven days you been calling that roll. Tomorrow there won't be anyone left to answer it.
Then I'll answer 'em all myself.
Private Adams. Anderson.
Here, and I wish I wasn't.
I wish I had two more like you.
Bingham.
Six nights I've been listenin' to the wild talk of the wounded.
'Tis a sad lullaby.
Bronson.
Yo. What's left of me.
Cody.
- Here.
- He's up in his hotel.
Coleman.
Still here.
-Three days now since the mule meat went bad.
- It's six, I tell ya!
Why tell the Indians?
They know about it.
Keep quiet, you baboons!
Seven. Do you think you're the only one hearin' Rankin in sick bay... talkin'half the time about that hole through his lung and the rest about his kid?
He's so scared he can't count.
It's six nights.
This paper says they're expectin' trouble with the Indians.
Huh?
- No?
- Dalrymple?
Here, and hungry.
Try chewin' saddle leather.
That'll ease your stomach.
Aw.
Daniels. Dowden.
Yo.
Easton. Evans. Hickok.
No hits.
- They're savin' him for a hangin'.
- Houston.
Yo.
Hadley. Hillman.
What are you makin' that for?
Holliston.
Sure, and all the Indians won't be makin' no headstone for me.
Jenkins.
Seven days you been doin' this.
They don't answer anymore.
He's roll calling the dead!
It's six days!
What difference does it make?
''What difference does it make''?
Makes a difference to Gillon,
Harry Ketcham and Bailey.
Ray Todd must think it makes a difference where he lies out there.
They might be alive!
Alive!
Easy, son. Easy.
They might be.
You never can tell what'll happen.
I knew a fellow lived on the Kaw River by the bridge.
He used to feed a fish, a big catfish, by hand.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Now wait a minute.
That catfish got to followin' that fellow out of water for his dinner.
Every day he'd follow him more.
And one night when the man was walkin'home across the bridge, not noticin'the catfiish was followin'him.
Now that fiish had never seen a bridge before.
He fell off... and he drowned.
- Ah, fish can't drown.
- That must've been a narrow bridge.
Holy thunder.!
Look at them Injuns.!
Every man up this way!
Hurry, men, hurry!
- Get the wounded out to load the guns!
- Don't shoot till
I give the command.
- Hand me up another rifle.
- Keep your heads down if you wanna keep them on.
Look like buffalo, don't they?
A volley'll stop buffalo.
Volley fire. Ready!
Not yet.
But, Bill!
Hold your fire, men.
Wait for the command.
- They're riding us down!
- Don't wait.! Let 'em have it.!
Not yet!
Now!
Fire!
Load faster.!
Gimme that.!
I'm doing the best I can.
Fire at the center!
Split that charge!
Fire!
- Who was that?
- Keep your barrels red hot!
Fire at will, men!
This one's mine!
- We've turned 'em!
- Now they're goin' down both sides!
Houston!Jack!
Cover the left flank!
Where are you going, you idiot?
Hey, Bill, come back here!
Are you crazy?
- Hey, Dave, help me cover him.
- Cover the right flank!
Load your guns, men!
Load your guns! Remember, you're still in the army.
Gimme some water.
I gotta have water.
What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?
Load your guns.!
- What's the use? We can't stand another charge.
- We may have to.
No.! We can't.
The dead can't fiight anymore.
Why don't you call roll now?
You're afraid? I'll call it for you. Private Dowden.!
- You load your guns!
- Corporal Brannigan.
Load your guns.!
Why don't you tell
Brannigan to load his gun?
- I'm telling you.! Get up.!
- I won't!
Save that fighting for the Indians!
You'll see.
Hold onto yourself, fella.
There's nobody left.
You'll see.
Why don't you tell your bugler to sound assembly?
Stop blubbering and reload your gun!
He can't answer.
Look at him.!
Look at him.!
Saints above.
He's answering to his name.
Yes, it's the dead calling.
- Stop it, men!
Stop it. Listen.
It's Bugler Corry.
He's sounding the charge!
Come on, men, it's a charge!
No, you fools! No!
What are you waiting for?
The dead want us.
McGinnis, hold 'em back.
Fall in men!
- It's the charge.
Don't ya hear it?
- Yes, I hear it.
Come on, follow me!
The boy's right.
It's horses.
They're charging.
Get ready, men!
We'll go down fightin'!
Come on.!
There they are, over there!
You can see 'em!
- Holy saints!
[ Bugle Playing ''Charge'' ]
They know we're alive.
We're okay.
Well, Yellow Hand didn't get that ammunition he was hankerin' for.
He would have, if Calamity hadn't gotten through to Custer.
She did a good job, all right.
- She must've told Yellow Hand.
- Let her alone.
She never was good.
Why don't somebody do somethin'about it?
Only 1 8 come back out of 48.
The Cheyenne must've paid her plenty to tell 'em.
Paid this woman in money, but our soldiers paid in blood.
What are you gonna do?
I'll show you what we're gonna do.
Talk's cheap, ya loudmouthed liar.
Hey, you.
Let me out!
All right, you dirty mule-skinner.
If you want it-- Ow!
If she was a man, we'd know what to do with her.
Go ahead, you crossbred rat!
If you was a man, you wouldn't be here!
Run her out of town!
Get some tar.!
Tar and feathers is too good for her.
That's the way to talk!
Get a rail.!
Here. Here's a rail.
Gimme that hammer.
Why don't somebody get behind her and get that whip?
- Why don't you?
- Get the feathers and tar.
There's a rail.
What do you want with a rail,Jack?
- Bill!
- We're gonna run her out of town.
Why?
You know what she done?
She told Indians--
Well, she's a woman, isn't she?
Keep out of this, Bill Hickok.
And women talk a little too much sometimes.
This woman is gonna get what's coming to her.
Let's ride her out of town.
And men talk a little too much sometimes too!
Those men had wives.
I know what's on your minds!
Yes, there were soldiers killed.
I was there.
I saw them.
Huh?
And they were killed with bullets-- bullets from repeating rifles.
Who'd sell rifles to Indians?
Lincoln said this country's got to be made safe.
Those are his words.
And I'm on my way to settle this matter with the man who sold those rifles.
It wouldn't please me to be the man Bill Hickok's goin' after.
Me neither!
I knew there was monkey business goin'on.
You're right.
And there's liable to be bullets flyin' around this way any minute, so I'd advise you to get inside, off the street.
Well--
I was goin' home anyway.
- I'll go with you,Jack.
- I got a long ways to go myself.
Lattimer's ''crookeder'' than a rattlesnake. You can't go after him alone. His men--
I started this alone and I'll finish it alone.
Why should I stake you to go diggin' for gold?
They found gold and plenty of it right there in the Black Hills.
That's Sioux country.
That don't matter. There's gold there at the grass roots.
So, you're goin' on the dodge, desertin' after gold.
You know what Custer does to deserters.
I know what he'd like to do to you.
He just got back and he's boilin' mad about Cheyenne
Indians and repeatin' rifles.
He can't do nothin'. Let him make his complaint to Washington and he'll find that out!
The army's gettin' riled--
The army can't stop me!
There's bigger men than the army in this with me.
Mr. Lattimer.
I'm busy, McCall.
I want to do you a big favor, Lattimer.
What's on your mind?
Hickok's after you.
Wild Bill.
He says you're the cause of all these Indian massacres.
He's comin' in here now.
All right.
You better get out.
You won't forget that I warned you?
Get out.
Get in there, you three.
Maybe I'll have a job for you.
Hello, Hickok.
That's the name, ain't it?
Met you in Leavenworth.
Hear you been doin' a little scoutin' for Custer.
Did you see anything?
Yellow Hand's been farming with your farming tools.
You know what this is?
Skunk.
Yes.
I'm not armed, Mr. Hickok.
I'm not armed.
I'll give you three minutes to fix that.
I'll be waiting outside.
- I'm just leaving town.
- You're not leaving town unless dead men can walk.
Come in here, you fellows.
Now. I'm gonna stake ya, all three of you.
I'm gonna stake you to 50 Double Eagles.
I've got a wagon train leaving for the Black Hills tonight.
I'm gonna get you away from
Custer and safe out of town.
That's great, Mr. Lattimer.
But first, there's that little job I want you boys to do for me.
You're crazy. Lattimer won't fight you fair. You ain't got the sense you was born with.
Ah, Bill, don't our love mean nothin' to ya?
Our love-- if that's what you want to call it-- all that died back on that island where everything else was dying.
No, Bill, no!
I'll go get Cody.
Maybe he can talk some sense into you, ya big mule!
Get off the street.
You better take cover for a few minutes.
You think you own this town.
I'm just walkin' through it.
And us fellas can get out of your way, can't we, just like we was dirt?
Suit yourself.
All right, Mr. Long Hair.
You're too durn friendly with Injuns to suit me.
You shouldn't have said that, soldier.
What are you gonna do about it, ya gun-totin' windbag?
Oh, substituting for Lattimer.
I can't shoot at that uniform.
If you want action, take it off.
Yeah, and get a slug while I'm doin' it.
Take it off.
I'll give you that much time.
I never draw on a man who isn't ready.
- Bill.! Bill.!
Come on, Bill, let's get out of here.
Sit here, Bill, out of sight.
Close that door, Lou.
Easy, Bill.
That bullet went clean through, but it's bleedin' bad.
Get some water, Lou, quick.
And some clean linen.
You brought this man to our house; a murderer.
Lou!
When is this going to stop?
When will it ever stop?
This killing and killing!
Why don't they kill him too?
Then you can be next and then me and--
Lou, he's my friend.
I didn't mean to bother you, ma'am. I'll be going.
Can I take your horse, Bill?
You can have everything
I've got, Bill, but--
You sit right down again,
Mr. Hickok.
You can't go bleeding like that, whatever you've done.
He's done plenty.
Those men were soldiers.
He'll have every trooper of the Seventh after him now.
Get some towels, Will.
I'll be as quick as I can, Mr. Hickok.
Thank you, ma'am.
Here you are, Lou.
There's hot water on the stove.
Hold this, Mr. Hickok.
I never was a murderer.
I never did fight unless put upon.
Thou shalt not kill.
No ghosts ever come bothering me.
It was always the other man or me... in a fair fight.
What right have you to judge who is to live or to die?
Put away your guns,
Mr. Hickok.
I can't do that, ma'am, not till I find John Lattimer.
Hey,Jake, gimme some more light.
Ready, boys?
Yeah.
Which way, Mr. Lattimer?
South, until we get out of town, then we head north.
Say, where are them three soldiers we're takin'?
They're staying in Hays City, but I'm goin'.
Get on your wagon.
It's dark enough now, Bill.
You oughta head up north.
Hide out in the Black Hills.
That's bad Indian country, but it'll be safer for you than here.
I'm going into town first.
You're crazy, Bill!
I'd be crazier if I didn't do what
I think I ought to.
Bill, open up.
It's me.
Did they hurt you much, Bill?
I'm all right.
I couldn't come till it got dark. I was scared they'd be watchin' me.
I know you don't want to see me, but I gotta tell you somethin', Bill.
Custer's ordered you brought in dead or alive.
The troopers have combed every hidin' down by the river and they're headin' this way.
He's goin'to fiind Lattimer.
Lattimer's gone.
He pulled out with his wagons.
Where?
Nobody knows.
I'll find him.
Of course you will. Someday you're bound to, only don't try to find his trail now.
Just try to save yourself from Custer's men. There's no tellin' what they'll do.
If Lattimer's pulled out with his wagons, those wagons are loaded.
And I know what
I've got to do.
That's a trooper.
Hear his saber?
Get in there, Bill, quick.
You might set the table for three, Mrs. Cody.
Who's there?
Courier from
General Custer.
General Custer's compliments.
You're to report to him right away.
How do you do, ma'am?
Howdy, soldier.
Hi.
What's up?
Custer's been ordered to move against Sitting Bull and the
Sioux up in Big Horn country.
What does General Custer want Will for?
The General doesn't let me in on all his secrets.
Come on, get a move on.
Go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.
Grub's ready. Hustle them dishes. I'm cavin' in all over.
Light out, Bill.
I've got a pack all fixed for you and I brought a horse.
Good-bye, ma'am, and thank you for everything.
Thanks for the coat,
Bill Cody. I'll take good care of it.
Take care of what's inside of it, you old bushwhacker.
Will, what does
General Custer want of you?
Bill. Bill, you ain't fit to ride far.
Why don't you lay up someplace and take care of that arm?
That's what I'll do.
I'll need this arm when I find Lattimer.
Ah, forget it.
You ain't got a chance against Lattimer's men.
Hmm. I've got nothing to lose.
Nothin' but your life!
When you talk like that,
I could bounce a rock off n your bean.
Why don't you try it next time you see me?
When'll that be, Bill?
Where?
Oh, up around
Deadwood someplace.
You can never tell.
I gotta get out of here too after what I done.
Well, I guess this is good-bye, eh, Bill?
Where are you going?
Oh, up around Deadwood someplace, I guess.
I don't give a hoot where I go.
You're well-named.
A child of calamity.
Always gettin' yourself into trouble.
Bill--
Bill, I reckon maybe you don't hate me.
Do you?
Maybe you're just bein' nice to me because you think you won't ever see me again.
Sure. Sure,
I'll see ya again.
This is a big country, and trails cross... sometimes.
Thought these
Big Horn Mountains was full of Indians.
Well, I ain't seen any Indians yet, but I'll swear to Moses there's somethin' followin' us.
Git!
Want your coat back,
Bill?
No. I want some grub.
Well, how do you like your eggs?
I like 'em very much.
You got any?
No.
I got some jerky and a little bacon and a little coffee.
You must've been mighty frugal over the last six weeks since you been gone.
I haven't any grub left.
Well, you're welcome to anything I got, Will.
I know that, Bill.
Build up a little fire and we'll have coffee.
Given up ridin' a horse?
Indians got it.
Mine too.
I see you got holes in your boots.
That's from followin' a long-legged man.
Me?
You.
What were you followin' me for?
Did you have something you wanted to tell me?
I reckon I did.
I thought you were off with Custer.
Custer sent me to bring you back.
Slice up some of that bacon, Bill.
Have a piece of jerky.
Thanks, Bill.
Well, I guess we got a few coffee beans left.
Enough for about two cups if we make it weak.
How's Lou?
I ain't seen her, Bill, for weeks.
She went home to St. Louis the day after you left.
She wanted to be with her mother when--
And what have you decided to call it?
I guess Lou will decide that.
Yeah. She's a fine woman, Bill.
She fixed my arm, so I can pull a gun as quick with my left as I can with my right.
Well, that's fine,
Bill.
It might come in handy for you.
It will.
This is a hostile country.
If you get some water, we'll get this coffee goin' quick.
Can't understand why Custer sent you.
He says I'm the only man you wouldn't kill.
Seems to me Custer's takin' a whole lot for granted.
Well, there it is.
I have an order from the United States Army to bring you back.
So I gather.
Dead or alive.
Which way do you aim to do it?
Alive.
No, Bill.
It's too bad they had to send you. I'm sorry.
But they did, Bill.
Did you hear that?
What's that Indian doing with that Seventh Cavalry stuff?
That flag's shot to pieces.
- Where'd you get that flag?
That's an officer's coat, and there's a bullet hole through it.
Do you understand him?
He says
Custer's dead!
Wiped out with his whole battalion.
He says Yellow Hand's comin' up from the south with his Cheyenne... to join Sitting Bull.
He says there'll be no more white man.
If the Cheyenne reach Sitting Bull, he's right.
Where's the nearest regiment?
Merritt.
He's moving up to join Crook.
You know his line of march?
He's coming up through Deadwood.
Find him.
He says the white man friend is bringing rifles to Sitting Bull.
- That's Lattimer.
To the new village in the canyon.
That's Deadwood.
You go for Merritt and tell him to get between
Sitting Bull and the Cheyenne.
Remember, Bill, you're my prisoner.
I'll see ya in Deadwood.
We'll settle it there.
[''Oh.! Susanna'' On Piano ]
- I seen it myself.
- One nugget?
Yes, sir.!
Twenty-three ounces.
The biggest nugget I seen in Deadwood yet.
Dave, the biggest liar
I've seen in Deadwood yet is you.
I ain't tryin' to sell you the claim.
I'm caught.
Now, Calamity, what did you wanna do that for?
Drinks ain't free, Dave.
If you was a man,
Calamity--
I ain't, so plunk down four bits.
You're a good barkeep,
Calamity, but you're awful ornery.
Hello, Calamity.
Sherry and egg.
Eggs are a dollar apiece.
I said egg and sherry.
You'll get whiskey and egg.
Would you like to try runnin' me out of this town too,Jack?
No, Calamity.
I don't bear you a bit of hard feeling anymore.
Well, that's just fine.
'Cause I bear you a-plenty.
Now, say, Calamity.
You oughta be makin' up to me.
I'm gonna be a big man in this country.
You'll have to grow about a foot, won't ya?
When I get hold of a pile of money-- which I aim to, and soon-- you'll be treatin'me right.
So, you staked a claim?
Nah, not me.
Those fellas are lookin' for gold in the ground.
I aim to find it on top.
If it ain't in the ground, where is it?
I ain't sayin'!
[ In Normal Voice ]
I ain't sayin'.
All I'm sayin' is
I'm gonna be a big man in this Black Hills country.
Yes, sirree, a big man, like Wild Bill Hickok.
Say, whatever become of Bill?
I couldn't tell ya.
For all I know, he may be dead.
[ Whistling ]
The man that killed him must be ridin' high.
The man don't live that could kill him.
Though you done your best.
You told Lattimer, Bill was looking for him in Hays City.
Hickok don't know that, does he? It ain't true.
There ain't a word of truth in it.
Lucky for you
Bill ain't here.
You can throw this old outfit away or burn it.
I don't think they'll burn.
Hey.
You like-a the haircut?
No, no haircut.
Have you seen any freighting or hauling around here?
No, no freighting.
No hauling.
Everybody got a mine.
Everybody dig and a-dig.
Nobody got-a time for Tony no more.
Nobody take a bath no more!
Hey, don't you ever put tobacco in that pipe?
Smells like an octopus.
Hello,Jack.
What's that army horse doin' here?
There ain't been any soldiers around here in weeks,
Mr. Lattimer, but the Fifth Cavalry's comin' in.
We'll be gone before they get in.
My wagons oughta be here in a few minutes.
I need some barberin'.
I ain't seen no Indian guide.
Give him time.
Sitting Bull said he'd send him.
Take it easy.
Mr. Lattimer.
I'm gettin' kinda jumpy about those wagons.
I'll buy ya one.
That's nice of you,
Mr. Lattimer.
A drop of rye will set me up just fine.
You don't happen to have seen any wagons going through... loaded with farming tools?
Now what does anybody want-a with-a farming tools?
They got no time to farm.
Hey. Why don't you want to get the haircut?
Short hair makes the Indians mad, and they're mad enough already.
Thank-a you too much.
He's-a fine fellow.
Bill!
Hello, Calamity.
Ah, Bill.
Gee, you're back.
I been watchin' and askin' and nobody's seen ya.
Nobody's heard.
I haven't been out in what you call society.
I had one caller, though. Bill Cody.
He found you, then.
Say, Bill, you didn't--
No.
No, he's all right.
I'm meetin' him here.
I'm sure glad of that.
Wasn't your fault, them three soldiers gettin' killed.
Say, Bill. You won't have to move on, will ya?
No, I got a hunch this is gonna be my last camp.
You're settlin' down?
You're gonna stay here?
I got a feelin'
I'm gonna stay here.
Bill, you need a drink.
I been thinkin'.
The West is gettin' to be a new kind of place.
Bill Cody's done the right thing.
He's changed.
What room is there gonna be for a two-gun plainsman?
You're talkin' crazy.
You're the best man in this country.
I don't know who thinks so.
I think so, Bill.
If you think Cody done right settlin' down and all, maybe that's what you'd like to do.
I mean, have a home and things... and have somebody to cook your meals for ya and--
Doesn't sound so bad.
Oh, Bill--
Calamity, now you gotta listen to me.
I didn't do nothin',
Mr. Hickok.
- I didn't do nothin'.
- What's he talkin' about?
He sneaked and told Lattimer you was lookin' for him back in Hays City.
She's lying, Mr. Hickok.
She's lying.
McCall, a year ago I'd have shot you dead on sight.
But now--
Go buy yourself a drink.
You're the luckiest rat alive.
I'm beginnin' to think
Mrs. Cody was right.
Who am I to decide whether a man's to live or die?
You feelin' all right, Bill?
No Injun guide yet,Jake.
No? Well, if you don't mind, then I'll go put down a drink.
All right.
Go ahead, boys.
Wet your whistles.
Mr. Lattimer.
Hickok is in town.
Hickok? Where?
In the Bella Union.
Get the boys back, quick.
Hey,Jake!
Mr. Lattimer wants you--
Shut up, you fool!
Lattimer.
Stay in here,
Calamity.
Oh, Bill.
This is the only thing
I have worth keeping.
If you got a wrong hunch, don't go out there.
Don't forget to wind it.
You're a mule-headed man,
Bill Hickok!
Get on your wagons, boys.
Just a minute.!
I wanna talk to you.
Any objections, gentlemen?
Where you goin' with the wagons?
Goin' out of town.
What you got 'em loaded with?
Buffalo hides.
You can see, can't ya?
Your wagons are headed north,
Lattimer.
You're not selling buffalo hides to Sitting Bull's Indians?
Take off the top hides.
I wanna see what's under 'em.
Jake.
NotJake.
You.
Oh. All right.
I don't know what you're lookin' fer, but if you want it, you're gonna get it.
Keep your hands off your guns, or there'll be more dead men than this town can afford to bury.
You gentlemen also sell farming tools?
Get on ahead of me, inside the Bella Union.
Wait a minute.
Don't you belong to this outfit,Jack?
Huh?
Oh, no, Mr. Hickok.
I just know Mr. Lattimer.
You knew
Mr. Lattimer,Jack.
Better get inside too.
Oh, sure.
Sure, Mr. Hickok.
Whatever you say.
- Who was that fella he shot?
- Never saw him before.
He oughta know better than to pull a gun on Bill Hickok.
Cody and the Fifth Cavalry are on their way.
Keep an eye out for 'em.
The rest of you, keep out!
[ Man ]
I'm not going to go in there.
Gentlemen, we're gonna stay right here for a while.
What'll it be?
Name your poison.
Jack, how about tending bar?
We may be here for quite a long wait.
What are we waitin' for?
Jake, don't reach for anything but your glass.
That goes for the rest of you.
Keep your hands away from your guns unless you want... fiive cheap funerals in Deadwood instead of one.
We're waiting till
General Merritt gets here with the Fifth Cavalry... and takes over
Sitting Bull's rifles.
Any objection?
May be an hour, may be a day.
When I have to wait,
I believe in entertainment.
Furthermore,
I'm short of funds.
Cards, bartender.
Find some fresh ones and some chips.
Proceed, gentlemen, over there.
You first, if it's all the same to you.
I'll take the one without arms.
Keep your hands on the table, all of you.
You bank.
I don't hear no shootin'.
It's powerful quiet in there.
Wonder what they're doin'.
Best way to find out is to--
You keep out of this!
Let Bill Hickok play his own hand.
That's-a just what he's a-doin'.
He's a-playin' cards.
Playin' cards?
Tony must be crazy.
- Let's go in and find out.
- No, no.
I see him so plain.
He's a-sittin'down with his back-a this way.
His back?
Cut for deal.
Looks like we're being played for suckers.
Your deal.
Any sign of the cavalry yet, Calamity?
Not yet, Bill.
I hope my prisoner hasn't escaped.
General Merritt, if he's done the job he set out to do, do you think the government would be a little lenient with him?
Mr. Cody, in matters where its sympathies are concerned, the government has been known to bend a little.
- You better not go in there.
- Bill, there's an Injun comin' in the door.
Hello, Charlie.
Come in.
- Charlie's a friendly Injun.
- Yes, I know Charlie.
How many?
Gimme two.
Three to me.
Sit over here, Charlie, where I can keep an eye on you.
Charlie took a shot at me once.
I was too far away.
Too bad you wasn't closer.
He got my horse.
Charlie'd been the biggest man in the West if he'd have killed you, Hickok.
Injuns understand things like that.
Kill a big man and that makes you a big man.
Killin'you, Hickok, is an honorjust waitin' for somebody.
You,Jake?
Not me, Bill, not me.
I'm facing you. Only way to down a man like you is from the back.
Raise ya five.
Seein' that and up five.
Get your foot off my chair,
Calamity. It's bad luck.
Don't go against your luck, Bill.
Your say,Jake.
The soldiers! That means a rope necktie for us!
Sit down!
We'll play out this hand.
- All right.
- This game ain't over yet.
It's almost over.
Calamity, find Cody and General Merritt.
Bring 'em here.
- Play your hand.
- I'm callin'ya, Hickok.!
Black aces and eights.
Your luck's changed.
Three queens.
I'm afraid you lose, Hickok.
A man's bound to lose, sooner or later.
Bill? Bill!
Let's get outta here!
Those fellas just shot
Bill Hickok!
Arrest those men!
Come on, you.
Get up.
Where is he?
Where's Bill?
There's your prisoner,
General Merritt.
We won't forget what Bill Hickok has done, Cody.
We'll remember.
All of us will.
All of us.
That's one kiss you won't wipe off.
Building a railroad that long is somebody's crazy dream.
It's a wonderful age we live in.
A railroad from Omaha to California?
One might as well think of flying.
President Lincoln is for it.
This is the most monumental folly... ever conceived in the mind of man.
In all this broad land of ours... who wants this railroad... that will start at the outer edge of civilization... and wander expensively through the wilderness?
Who, I ask you, except a small group... of money-grabbing financiers, self-seeking politicians... and fanatical engineers?
Mr.
President. Mr. President.
Does the Senator yield to the gentleman from California?
I am not done, Mr. President.
I would like to read... from a speech by the late
Daniel Webster on this subject.
Delivered from this very floor.
"What do we want with this vast, worthless area...
"this region of savages and wild beasts...
"of deserts and endless mountain ranges?
"What can we ever hope to do with 3000 miles...
"of cheerless rockbound coast...
"and not a harbor on it?"
Not a harbor on it?
Order! Order!
Why, there's room in the San Francisco Bay... to float all the navies of the world.
His word against Webster's.
Mr. President. Mr. President.
Mr. Sargent.
Gentlemen. The learned Senator asks...
Who wants this railroad?
Well, I'll tell you.
This nation, crippled by four years of war, wants it.
A great artery... through which may flow the gold and silver of the West... into the empty treasuries of the East.
Grain and cattle into a war-torn South.
And thousands of men released from both armies... want it for the work and the wages it will bring.
And the merchants of the whole world... who need a shorter route to the Orient, they want it.
Gentlemen...
I move you the adoption of this railroad bill... that shall bind us together, East and West... forever as one people.
Mr. Ames...
I want to take a ride on this railroad... the first thing after I retire from the presidency.
Mr. Lincoln had the vision to conceive this railroad.
You gentlemen must have the vision to help us finance it.
Frankly, Mr. Ames, the only vision I can see... is a lot of loose dollars rolling away over those prairies.
Good day, gentlemen.
But there's more than profit... in the lap of this undertaking.
This railroad is the future of the United States.
Along its rails, new cities will rise.
Is there not some danger that the Central Pacific... which is building east across
California, may reach Ogden first... and keep you out of the Salt Lake Valley?
President Lincoln wisely arranged... that the Central Pacific will build only to the California state line.
Here, where our tracks will join with theirs.
General Dodge, uh... as Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific... are you quite sure that a railroad more than 1000 miles long... can actually be built through such a wilderness?
Yes. Yes. My brother Oliver and I... are staking our fortune on General Dodge's word... that it can be done.
How much of your fortune, Mr. Ames?
We'll back the Union Pacific down to the last shovel in our factory.
You're enthusiastic.
I promised Mr. Lincoln to see it through.
Mr. Lincoln is dead. Well, my promise to him is not dead.
Splendid, Mr. Ames, splendid.
I'm beginning to see a golden harvest in these iron rails.
Then you are with us?
My hand on it.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Barrows.
On the contrary, I am indebted to you for showing me the fortune... there is to be made out of Union
Pacific. Good day, gentlemen.
Good day, sir.
Good luck, General Dodge.
Good luck. Goodbye, all.
Goodbye, sir.
Who is Barrows?
The biggest moneybag in Chicago.
He makes them and breaks them out there.
I never thought he'd join you.
What do you think would happen if the Central Pacific... should build all the way to
Ogden in the Salt Lake Valley?
It would bust the Union
Pacific higher than a kite.
Much higher.
But he said that Lincoln had arranged for the Central to stop... at the California border. Lincoln is dead... and there are those in Washington who do not wish the Union Pacific well.
Can't both lines have terminals in Ogden? No, Whipple.
You miss the point.
The Union Pacific has authority to build only... to where it meets the Central. Well?
And if the Central should pass through Ogden first... and meet the Union in the wilds of the Wasatch Mountains...
Yes. Exactly.
The Union would have
1000 miles of track... and a gopher hole for its Western terminal.
Splendid.
We'll sell Union stock short and buy Central.
We'll make millions, Mr.
Barrows. A golden opportunity.
Pure gold. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
But suppose the Union
Pacific gets to Ogden first?
It won't, Whipple.
I can assure you.
It won't.
# They call me the rose of St. Louis #
# The rose of this river town #
Gentleman to see you, boss.
Mr. Barrows.
Bring in a bottle of that extra-dry champagne.
Yes sir, extra dry.
Take a seat.
Oh. Rose...
# They call me the Rose of St. Louis ##
Sit down.
We ain't had the pleasure of seeing you here before, Mr...
Interesting decorations.
Only one like it in St. Louis.
I suppose you brought the idea with you from Panama.
Panama?
This biography of yourself, written by the best detective agency in Chicago.
What's on your mind, mister?
How's that partner of mine doing? Very good, sir.
Mr. Campeau... in the past, your operations have always been, shall we say... of a minor nature.
Do you think you could manage the biggest gambling outfit in America?
Do you think you could handle 10,000 workmen... with plenty of money... out in the wilderness?
Supplying them with liquor... and any excitement the devil can brew?
Do you think you could keep them drunk and discontented, month after month?
Go on.
Excuse me, Mr. Allen.
Mr. Campeau would admire to see you in the other room.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Al. Al Brett... take over.
It's your deal.
It means keeping your tent with its many diversions at the end of the track... as it moves West... and selling the tracklayers all the trouble they'll buy. You'll be protected.
What's the split? None. You take it all.
Including orders from me.
What kind of orders?
They will all add up the same. Delay.
Anything... I might say everything... to delay the building of the Union Pacific Railroad.
Why not?
Longer it takes, the more money I make.
Mr. Barrows, this is my partner, Dick Allen.
Late of the Union Army... but never late with a gun.
He'll be very handy, I assure you.
I've been making a deal with your partner. A big deal.
We're leaving St. Louis.
For where and for what? West, Mr. Allen... for excitement and profit.
All right. Deal me in.
Where's my drink?
Here. I don't use it.
No?
Never take another man's drink.
It's bad luck.
Well, gentlemen... here's to... whatever it is.
'Tis that cottonwood you're feeding him.
He won't eat it.
It gives him a pain in his boiler.
Hey, Monahan.
Do you want I should spell you a bit, Monahan. In case you fall asleep?
Mollie Monahan, will you come down out of that before some Indian... beats me to the pleasure of killing you.
I brought you supper.
Suppose you fell off, and
I had to stop the train.
If you were half the dutiful daughter... that this engine is to me...
Hold your whist. Here's your bite.
Heavens above. What's in it? Coupling pins?
Cartridges. I forgot to put them in your valise.
Get back to the caboose, you brat.
Twenty hours to Cheyenne... and I'm supposed to live on powder and lead.
I think you've been eating dynamite.
Good night, Mr. Barley.
Good night, Mollie.
Down.
I want it up. No. Down.
I said up.
Now listen, lady...
I want some fresh air.
Sure, and you'll get it, right through your skull.
The Indians relish shooting at the lighted windows.
That woman, she's just like my wife I had in Omaha.
You know my wife, she's so mean... she barks like the dogs, but me, well... you know what I do? You married her.
Oh, sure. You bet yourself.
She can cook frijoles. Mmm.
The best in the whole world.
Mollie.
But I look around and... pretty soon I marry my wife in Santa Fe.
The best woodchopper in the country.
You bet you my life, the best.
But one day she gets bite by a rattlesnake.
She did? Yeah.
Did the doctor get there in time? No, she's already dead.
Your wife? My wife?
No, no, the snake. My wife...
My wife, the next day, she's so angry, she bites her brother.
Sure... and his whole family is poisoned.
And, anyhow, I'm already gone to Yuma... and there I marry Carmelita.
Now what did you marry her for?
You think to cook for me?
No. To chop me firewood? No.
Well, what did she do?
She...
Yes, sir. Carmelita sure is a honey.
Yeah.
Hey, what you know?
Leach, what you do here anyhow?
Hunting for you.
General Dodge wants to see us back in his car.
At the rate you're going, Leach,
General Dodge won't live that long.
New troubleshooter is getting aboard, somewheres hereabout.
Thanks, Sergeant. Good luck.
General Dodge aboard, Conductor?
Yep. If you're Jeff Butler, he's looking for you.
I'll report, soon as I wash off some of the prairie.
Yeah. A fella gets kind of sweaty riding.
Campeau's crowd's in this car, Mollie.
Rattlesnakes.
No self-respecting rattlesnake would ride with them.
Mollie.
Mollie Monahan.
Dick.
Sure, Dick, they told me you'd not be back this year.
Did you think you'd get rid of me that easy?
Something's dead.
Easy.
We'll bury him when the time comes.
Every minute that passed had your name on it.
Oh, that's easy to listen to, but hard to believe.
Me father said... That he doesn't like gamblers.
Neither do I.
Here you are practicing to fleece the poor lambs at the End of Track.
Marry me, Mollie, and I'll reform.
You haven't changed a bit.
Except maybe for the worse.
You're in love with her and her three sisters.
You've got cards in your blood.
And you in my heart.
Go along with your soft talk.
You'll die with your boots on... and your four ladies won't be walking behind you.
Would you walk behind me?
Would be safer than walking beside you to the altar.
All the pasteboard ladies in the world aren't worth one of your little fingers... with a ring on it.
I'd better be getting back to the caboose. No. Not yet.
Turn your back to me.
Close your eyes. Both of them.
Turn your head away.
This is to keep your heart warm for your wedding day.
Oh. 'Tis never for me.
Not if it doesn't fit. Oh, it'll fit.
It is the most beautiful thing ever was.
But far too grand for a poor engineer's daughter.
Not that Monahan's a poor engineer.
He's the best there is, but...
I suppose a good engineer's daughter can get... just as cold as a poor engineer's daughter.
And a gambler can love you just as much as a saint.
We might as well face the facts.
Central Pacific has not stopped at the California state line as agreed.
They're over the Sierras, and they've surveyed... right through to Salt Lake and Ogden.
What do you think? But they've got an agreement!
The devil himself is against us!
And what happens to the people... who backed us with their savings?
Busted. And so are we.
We're going to reach Ogden first.
Well, the Central will be there in 10 months. Then we'll be there in nine.
Look at the map, General Dodge.
We've built only 516 miles in three years.
And we're still 500 miles from Ogden.
And we're still going to get there first. What?
Over the Rockies and Wasatch Mountains with Indians claiming your food supply?
Only the Irish could do it. And I doubt if they can.
Good news or bad? Good.
We had a council at Broken Bow.
Red Cloud says the Indians'll lay off the railroad... if the whites will lay off the Indians.
Captain Butler served with me in the war. He's just signed on with us.
Meet the two gentlemen you'll be working for.
General Casement, in charge of tracklaying. How are you?
How do you do, sir? Mr. Reed.
You tell him what your job is, Sam.
I see that the tracklayers don't catch up with the graders... the graders don't catch up with the tie cutters... the tie cutters don't catch up with the tunnel and bridge builders... and the lunatic asylum doesn't catch up with me.
My job, sir?
To establish and maintain order along the entire right-of-way.
Troubleshooter, huh?
Yeah, and there's plenty of it.
What's the worst problem?
Sid Campeau.
His whiskey and cards and what goes with them follow the End of Track... like a flock of vultures.
They've cost us a life every day.
Men drugged, robbed, murdered.
Crews disrupted by hired agitators.
Leach Overmile and Fiesta here have been assigned to you.
They can tell you how Campeau operates.
I don't believe I'll need bodyguards.
Oh, no? You'll need them, all right.
You think we no good, eh?
No. It's not that, I...
We've had a lot of experience, Captain.
We bodyguarded the last two troubleshooters... right up till the very minute they was killed.
We'll get along all right.
There's just one question I'd like to ask, General.
Yes? What's the limit?
None.
Because our town's on wheels, we've no civil law out here.
You're the law. And it's up to you to smash anything that threatens to delay us.
That's all the orders there are. Yes, sir.
I declare, he seems like a right nice young fella.
I hope he lives long enough so as we can get acquainted.
Hey, what's moving? You are.
Oh, am I, now? Yep.
Lady, you're on a brake wheel, and one whistle means turn it.
Are you running this train all by yourself?
No, but passengers aren't allowed on the platform while the train's moving.
Passengers. Me?
You poor tenderfoot.
The new troubleshooter's looking for you, Mr. Campeau.
For what?
I don't know. Heading this way, though.
Keep an eye on him.
Al.
Al Brett, Cordray.
Rose, you and Mame better get to the other end of the car.
A lady can't get no rest.
A lady don't need none.
Sit down and keep your eyes open.
Dick.
Sit down, Mollie, and keep low.
Why? What's going on?
Campeau's expecting company.
That's him.
Wait here.
Lonesome, handsome?
Jeff Butler. Dick.
You old dogcatcher.
You old chicken thief.
Remember the last time
I saw you in Philadelphia...
Baltimore... Oh, now wait.
We started celebrating our discharge from the Army in New York... and we came up for air in Philadelphia.
I put you to bed in Baltimore, and I woke up in Washington.
Old army pals, huh?
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be alive.
Jeff, this is Sid Campeau.
I've heard of Mr. Campeau.
This is Mr. Brett and Mr.
Cordray. Captain Butler.
Howdy. Hello.
Howdy.
You old sharpshooter.
What are you doing here?
I'm working for the railroad.
Doing what? I'm assistant superintendent of the...
Just a fancy name for troubleshooter?
Maybe.
It looks like we'd see quite a lot of each other... for a while.
I was figuring on having a little talk with you.
Maybe you'd better have a little talk with your friend here first.
Tell your playmates they can sit easy for a while.
Same old Jeff.
This is my seat, and this is
Miss Mollie Monahan. Jeff Butler.
Sit down, Jeff.
Jeff and I fought, bled and died together, all during the war.
It wasn't you two that won the war, was it?
Practically.
How much of a friend of yours is Campeau? Sid?
He's my partner.
You'd better get yourself another partner, Dick.
I've already got my eye on one.
Oh.
Is it another slap you're asking for, Mr. Butler?
Darling, will you kindly hold your temper... your tongue, and your two little fists. They ain't little.
You can't fight Mollie and live.
She's the postmistress at End of Track.
The eyes and tongue of 1000 men who never learned to read or write.
She belongs to the railroad.
Although you'd think the railroad belonged to her.
What about Campeau?
What about him?
Part of my job is to clear him and his outfit off the line.
No, you can't do it, Jeff.
Don't try.
We've been through a lot of storms together, Dick.
We've slept under the same blanket, eaten off the same plate.
Join up with me again.
I'm standing pat and liking it.
Well, I'm afraid we're in different armies this time.
You think there'll be a rope around my neck someday?
Maybe.
Sure now, that's a crazy way for two friends to be saying hello.
Hey, what's that? Hey, look.
The Injun boy, he race the iron horse.
Monahan will bust his boiler if the Injun keeps up with him.
Come on, Indian boy.
Open up, Monahan.
Say, he's cute.
Now, Bessie.
$5, I get him on my first shot.
You're on.
He's going to beat us.
Oh, no, he won't.
What did he do that for?
Oh, that's a shame.
Pay up.
That ain't nothing. Why you all...
Look out, Brett.
Get out of the way.
No, Dick.
Everybody just stay in their seats.
Just keep eating your vittles,
Mr. Campeau, with both hands.
Use your feet.
You weasel.
One at a time, gentlemen, you'll all get your turn.
There's the man. Now, what's going on here?
What are you fellas trying to... Conductor, stop the train.
One of my men got thrown off.
Thrown off? Where? Don't pull that cord, Conductor.
But Mr. Campeau said...
This train doesn't stop.
All right.
That shot didn't just kill an Indian.
It killed a dozen white men, and scalped and tortured women and children.
Tsk.
What's a dead Indian, more or less?
The Army's been killing them for years.
The Army doesn't kill
Indians for fun, Campeau.
And I don't think you do, either.
He's sure gonna be unpopular.
Not with me.
Get along.
Thank you kindly. Good day to you, Shamus.
Good day, Paddy.
'Tis news of me wife I've come for, Mollie Monahan.
I've no letter for you, Paddy.
Why don't you send for her?
I've all but $20 of the passage money.
I'm on me way to the
Big Tent to win that.
Sure, Paddy, you fool.
You can't win at Campeau's.
I can't lose.
Only this morning...
I found this shamrock in a prayer book she sent me.
Now, the shamrock's not for that kind of luck.
Wait till you see.
One man's money is as good as another's in the Big Tent.
Step right in, my friends.
If you don't feel like taking a chance... there's plenty of dancing, at $1 a couple.
$1 a couple and there's sweet music on the house.
Step right up, my friends, and enjoy your luck.
Don't lean on my chair.
It's bad luck. Get away.
It's not your rightful card.
You took it off the bottom.
Say that again.
I'll clout it into your thieving head.
Stay where you are.
With me own two eyes...
I saw you slip it off...
You dirty blackguard.
The music. It stopped right with it.
Jeff.
Nothing I can do for him.
Where's his gun? He had none... and he couldn't shoot one if he had.
Who got plugged?
Just some Irish tracklayer.
Is he dead yet?
I don't know.
Who was it? Oh, the pity of it all.
It was Paddy O'Rourke.
One side, gentlemen, please. Easy there.
Paddy.
Paddy O'Rourke.
The letter, Mollie. It came?
The letter?
From Nora.
Yes, Paddy.
Paddy's letter.
Could you be reading it to me?
Sure, Paddy.
Paddy, my darling... my... my heart's so full of love for you, sure... sure 'tis spilling out of me eyes.
'Tis such an impatient husband you are, Paddy, but... after all the work and worry is done... we'll be together again.
And there will be no night... nor day between us... at all.
"No night...
"nor day between us."
Nora.
A lad lies murdered, and nothing will be done about it.
From a far country he came... to do his little part building the railway.
A great and good thing for us all.
And what will you tell his widow, you men that run this... this hell on wheels?
That's what it is.
A hell on wheels that claims a man's life for every day in the year.
Here's a mite for the widow. Who's next?
Come on you Paddies, put it in the hat.
Twelve, red and even.
Don't touch that money. Why not?
I had that pot won. Maybe.
The hand wasn't played out, was it?
No. No.
Which was Paddy's hand? This one.
Three treys.
Now deal yourself one.
Off the top.
A busted flush. Paddy wins.
Mollie Monahan. Keep your hand above the table, Cordray.
I got manners. I'll pick them up for you.
That belongs to Paddy's widow.
Leach! Take Mollie home.
Just as you say, Jeff, but these fellas... Go ahead.
It is a fine thing you've done, Mr.
Butler. I'm thanking you for Paddy.
Come on, Mollie.
Clear out of Cheyenne, Cordray, and keep off the UP right-of-way.
You got a big mouth, bucko.
Better keep it shut.
If you're not out of this town in an hour... one of us will keep his mouth shut for a long time.
Come on, Jeff.
Let's go get a drink.
All right.
Number two. Black, even.
Say, you got eyes in the back of your head?
I'm glad you keep that mirror clean.
He seen him in the looking glass.
Doctor!
Somebody get that doctor!
When Jeff shoots, they don't need a doctor... they need an undertaker.
Come on, boys! Drink up!
Keep your games going, boys. Hit her up, Joe.
Spin that thing, Tom.
Train for End of Track... pulling out in five minutes.
Come on, Terry.
Not me. I'm staying.
Me, too.
Train for End of Track!
Let's go. I gotta go.
Come on back for a while. Come on.
Come on, you gandy dancers.
Get out there and go to work.
Board!
Free drinks, boys and girls.
Everybody have a drink on the house.
Free drinks!
Board for End of Track.
There's not many men boarding your work train, Jeff.
They'll be on it.
Are you going to clean out the tent all by yourself?
Maybe.
I never thought one glass of liquor would do that to you, Jeff.
But when the shooting starts, let me know.
I'll be right over there, dealing blackjack.
By doggies, I knowed
I'd miss all the fun.
Where's that good luck piece of yours?
Oh, you mean that gold nugget
I picked up out in California?
I got it here somewhere.
I always keep it with my knickknacks.
There it is, right there in number five, Jeff.
Say, let me tell you how
I happened to pick that up.
How do you know that's real gold?
What do you know about gold nuggets?
Are you doubting that that's gold?
I wonder if there's any old-timer here that knows real gold when he sees it.
I do.
Take a look at that.
That's gold, all right.
Where'd it come from?
Leach here picked it up at End of Track.
End of Track? A little mite west of there.
Gold.
At End of Track?
Gold? Who found gold?
Who said "gold"? Gold?
What about gold?
Gold!
Who said "gold"?
They struck gold at End of Track!
He's found gold!
What was that, gold?
Train for End of Track. Board!
They found gold at End of Track.
Come back, you fools!
There's no gold! Come back!
Get them on that train and keep them there.
I sure will. All right, Jeff.
Come on, Charlie. It's starting!
The shooting's all over,
Dick. Where were you?
That puts you one up on me, bucko.
Bucko's got a nice broad back.
Ain't he?
Hmm.
The way to get him ain't with a gun. He's too fast.
Get me Duke Ring.
# How I missed her, how I missed her #
# How I missed my Clementine #
# Here I kissed her little sister #
# Then I forgot... ##
I'm looking for the lovely postmistress of Hell on Wheels.
And what do you want to see her about?
About one of her little fingers.
The one she put in your eye the first time you met her?
No. Not that one.
Here, let me see them all.
That's too bad. What's the matter with them?
No rings.
They'll catch cold. Rings!
Rings don't grow on trees.
Oh, no, not on trees.
But there's a certain weed scientifically known as the Ringus Weddingbellikus.
Well, upon my soul.
'Tis some more of your black magic, but gorry it's beautiful.
Grown especially for this finger.
No. You'd be pulling a wedding bell out from under the next rail.
Well, keep it till your finger changes its mind.
'Tis too much of a...
'Tis too much of a temptation, but... the offer deserves thanking.
Wait. And what will the bold
Captain over there be thinking?
Hey!
Hey, hold on there! Good morning.
Please, and who gave you the right to use my handcar?
Oh, I thought it belonged to the railroad. Hello, Dick.
It's mine to deliver mail at the End of Track.
You going to End of Track? I am.
So am I!
That puts you two up on me, bucko.
Is it that you can't talk when there's no gun in your hand?
Maybe.
'Tis a fine job you've done in a few months, Mr. Jeff.
Restoring a bit of order along the right-of-way.
It must give great pride to your lady back in... in Boston.
Is she your wife?
No.
Be like it's some sparrow's got hold of your heart.
Is she very beautiful? Very.
And does she love you very much? Very much.
Now how about delivering your mail?
The wind just whisked it out of me hand.
Well, seems a word from her is more important than your business.
Yes. She's my mother.
Oh, 'tis sorry I am, Mr.
Jeff, and ashamed, besides.
Get back! Get back! Get back to the car!
Gorry, what are we getting into? Come on, Jeff, run for it!
At least, now, you'll have plenty of time to read your letter.
Yeah. If one of the buffalo doesn't want a ride.
Your mother worries a great deal about you, I'm thinking.
With all the fighting and killing you're mixed up in.
I didn't know when I started.
What didn't you know?
No, you wouldn't be interested.
Captain, I've reached the point of being fair crazy trying to understand you.
Mind if I smoke? That's what I mean.
The manners of a gentleman, the smile of a boy, and the quick hand of a gunman.
Now. Now, however did you get started on a career of death and destruction?
I couldn't decide between being a pirate and a fireman, so took up engineering.
Driving an engine?
Get out of there!
No, building bridges and things.
But along came the war...
And they needed your guns more than your bridges.
My dreams went up in smoke.
Then there's much in common between us, Mr. Jeff.
How's that, Mollie?
Both of us seem to be wanting things that don't want us.
You seemed to be getting what you wanted just before we got on this car.
Oh, Dick.
I know. You think I'm an outrageous flirt. Well?
But did you never know that flirting gets into a woman's blood... like fighting gets into a man's?
Now, a girl begins coquetting to discover if she has the power.
Then she goes looking, like a fighter after a bully... for the hardest man to conquer.
But 'tis never the man she wants...
'tis the pleasure of bringing him to her feet.
Till the right man comes along and gives her the spanking she deserves.
That's the man she dreams of.
And the man she kisses.
The buffalo are most gone, and I'm thinking we'd better be going, too.
We might have harnessed a couple and had them pull us to End of Track.
Rail!
Rail!
Bend your backs to it!
Lay ahold of that rail, me lad... you're slowing us down.
Sure, if I was your mother, I'd be ashamed of the strength you have.
'Tis the whiskey you drank in Cheyenne... not the work you're doing here that gave you such a thirst.
Get along with you! Any trouble, Dusky?
Trouble?
Say, what was the matter with them crazy muckers you sent out here the other day?
Why?
All over the hillside they started digging for gold.
Found plenty iron, huh?
And they're laying three miles of it a day, pay or no pay.
Hey, what is this I hear about the railroad brass hats coming up?
Inspection tour. General
Grant's with them.
He'd win a lot of votes in the next election... by bringing our pay along with him.
He will.
Come on. Move it ahead.
Here's one to mail,
Mollie. Give it here.
Mollie, did my cousin from
Cork write? No, she didn't.
Any mail, Mollie? It is sorry, I am.
Have you got a letter for us? No. Mrs. Cassidy.
Saint's alive! Who's dead?
Mrs. Hogan, I hear your new baby came yesterday.
And a fine broth of a boy he is, too. Shouldn't you be in bed?
Well, I had a mind to stay in bed this morning... but there was the washing to do, so I says to meself, I says:
"Now, this is no time for playing sick."
What're you going to name the baby?
Union Pacific Hogan. Was that your husband's idea?
Mike? Sure he's after going to Cheyenne to celebrate.
The lad'll be half-grown by the time he sobers up.
Injuns! Get the kids in!
Redskins!
To your posts, men! Get ready for action!
Hold your fire till they get closer.
There's only two of them.
And they look like my men.
I smell worse trouble than Injuns.
Get back to work, you mollycoddles... or I'll be banging on somebody's pants with me pick-handle.
Get back to the job, you terriers!
We got plenty troubles this time, Captain.
You know that Andy Calahan, the foreman over at the grader's camp?
Yeah. What about him?
Nothing, only he's dead.
How?
Fella named Duke Ring sort of lost his temper.
Yeah. Now, nobody's working at all.
But they gotta work.
We can't lay track if there's no grade.
Couple of hundred of them over there yowling about no pay... so we didn't start nothing.
I'll go on up and entertain Mr.
Ring. Back by sundown, maybe.
You better take us with you,
Jefferson. That foreman is awful dead.
Dusky! Dusky Clayton!
Would you give me the loan of this team to take mail to the graders' camp?
That's no place for you to be going now. Thanks.
Sorry, Mollie. Hey, what's this?
Well, by the soles of me feet!
What're you working for?
It ain't money because you don't get none.
Are you working for your sweat?
That's all you'll get out of it.
Unless some Injun comes along and tears the hair off your head.
Whoa.
Give me that.
That's Duke Ring.
You ain't gonna need this.
Oakes Ames would hate to see his shovels used like that.
Wait here.
'Tis suicide you're contemplating, going against that mob.
Maybe. Jeff.
No one's ever put any sense into a man's brain... through a bullet hole in his head.
Maybe you're right.
Whatever happens... you keep out of it.
The fool ain't got a gun on him.
Hello, boys!
Where's your foreman?
Your foreman was a fine fellow.
This bruiser taking his place?
What're you going to do about it, bucko?
Nothing, Mr. Ring... if these men are fools enough to believe a lying windbag like you.
Lying, am I?
Have you been paid for two months or ain't you?
No.
Sure, sure. You've all got wages coming. So have I.
We'll get every cent that's due us.
The railroad won't pay you for sitting around... watching Mr. Ring break shovels.
Now, let's go to work.
That sounds like horse sense.
Oh, does it?
I'll kill the first man to move a shovel of earth.
You'll go out of here feet first, bucko.
I'm not there. I'm over here, Mr. Ring.
I see you, you stinking railroad cop.
Still here, Mr. Ring.
This way, Mr. Ring.
Well, mates, there's your bully.
Nobody can make you work.
But if you're through with the job... get out of camp and make room for men who do want to work.
Well, boys, it's 1:00.
That's still horse sense.
What are we waiting for? Come on, boys.
Come on, boys, bring your shovels.
# I've been working on the railroad #
# All the livelong day #
# I've been working on the railroad #
# Just to pass the time away # Hit the ties, Ring.
And don't stop to say goodbye to Campeau.
# Don't you hear the whistle blowing? #
# Rise up so early in the morn #
# Don't you hear the foreman shouting #
# Oh, Dinah, blow your horn #
Gorry, what a man.
# I've been working on the railroad #
# All the livelong ##
Can you see him?
Last time I seen him, I was shooting at him from a huckleberry patch.
Plenty big talk, but no payroll.
Such a move means disaster, General Grant.
Our credit is stretched to the breaking point.
An element, lawless beyond all reason, hangs onto our coattails... here at the End of Track.
It's like a monstrous conspiracy determined to wreck the railroad.
And now Mr. Barrows proposes a new survey west of Laramie.
Reputable engineers advise me our present route is impractical.
I'd rather take the advice of one old buffalo.
A buffalo? Oh, come now, General.
This railroad is being built on an old buffalo trail.
Those animals are practical travelers, Mr. Barrows.
And I never knew one that changed his route for financial reasons.
And we can't do it and reach
Ogden before the Central.
My only concern, General Grant, is to lay an honest stretch of track.
Mr. Barrows wants
90 miles of additional track.
If that is ordered, then I must resign as Chief Engineer.
But, General Dodge...
The Government expects the company to finish the railroad as contracted.
It also expects General
Dodge to remain in authority.
Mr. Ames.
How much money do you need for immediate bills and wages?
At least a million dollars.
You seem to have the interest of the road so deeply at heart, Mr. Barrows...
I suggest you lend Mr. Ames the money.
A million dollars? Yes.
For the Union Pacific.
I consider it a privilege to serve the road... and the next President of the United States.
The first shipment of cash will be sent before the week is over.
General. Gentlemen.
Thank you, General. Thank you.
Thank you, General.
It takes money to put iron over those mountains, General.
Come on in, boys. An equal cache for one and all.
Can I trouble you for a light, stranger?
Sure.
Shipment of money is coming in on a special, Tuesday night.
Payroll, huh? Yes. I prefer that it should not arrive.
How much?
$200,000. My money. I want most of it back.
We'll get it.
Thank you for the light, stranger.
The money belongs to Barrows.
So it ain't a real holdup.
Does Jeff Butler know that?
What if he don't?
Is there any reason why you wouldn't plug that yellow-livered skunk?
Jeff and I aren't partners in this game.
I'd plug him... as quick as he'd plug me.
But don't go calling him names.
You ought to call him a couple.
He's certainly got the whole town giving you the horselaugh.
Yeah, he's... two up on me right now.
Mollie seems to think so.
Are you looking for something between the eyes?
After I lift that payroll... nobody's gonna laugh.
Nobody but me.
So long, Art. Hello,
Jeff. Where are you from?
Laramie. What's there?
Nothing. Tomorrow it'll be a city.
They're packing up Cheyenne now and loading it on the cars.
Will you have a cup of tea while
I'm patching Monahan's pants?
No, thanks. But I'll sit on your front porch till the special gets in.
Special? Who's on it?
Old John Dough. Jeff, it's never the payroll?
I could do a jig for joy.
I've sat on quieter front porches.
And you've spooned on them with better company, no doubt.
Not better company.
I'll dust the blarney off that and be thankful.
There's no blarney between you and me, Mollie.
I often wonder if I'll ever have any other front porch than this.
Someday you'll have your house anchored under you.
I don't know.
I've never lived without wheels under me head when I lay me down to sleep.
You'll be darning socks for some happy man before long.
I hope his heart won't be far from the rails.
And where do you think you'll spend your declining years?
I probably won't have any declining years.
Don't say such a thing.
You change the night to fear and the wind from warm to cold.
Feel my hand, 'tis ice.
In my job, Mollie... a man can't look very far ahead.
Maybe when the road's done, I...
What do you mean, the wind's cold?
There isn't any wind.
'Tis no ordinary wind. 'Tis the kind that witches ride on.
It blows trouble.
If you'll are making any promises dealing with the future... you're taking a lot for granted.
What's up?
Well, sir, it might be a sewing bee, and it might be a hayride... but there's eight of Sid Campeau's top gunfighters missing from the Big Tent.
Is Dick with them? I reckon he is. He ain't there.
Hey, Jeff! Yeah.
Eight horses, they're gone from Campeau's corral.
Could you pick up their trail? The
Mexican boy said they ride east.
Maybe the Injuns is giving an ice-cream social.
Pay train. That's what I figured.
Mollie, run for the telegraph office.
Tell Calvin to stop the pay train at Pine Bluff.
Leach, get an engine and a flatcar. I sure will.
Put our horses on the flatcar and round up a few men.
You bet yourself. We have good time tonight.
Oh, dear.
Pay train went through
Pine Bluff 10 minutes ago... gathering speed for the Pole Creek Divide.
Calvin, get that chief dispatcher over here. Take the key, Mollie.
Try Egbert Siding. Oh, no.
It is closed after 6:00.
Maybe Joe's playing solitaire.
Try anyway and keep trying.
I'll see you later.
The saints ride with you, Jeff.
Let her go, Clancey!
Let the silver lay. It's too heavy. Not for me, it ain't.
There's the headlights.
Slow her down.
Train coming from the West!
All right, boys. Let's get out of here.
Whoa.
Split up! Every man for himself.
Each of you, pick a man.
We got good fun, eh?
That all depends. Yeah.
What in the name of...
Tell Campeau to send a couple of men over to this car. Run!
Gee, sure.
Why do you throw mail through the window?
Hide that or you'll have a killing on your front porch.
What's happening?
Quick. Well...
Hiya, Jeff. Where's the fire?
Man ride by here just now? Yeah.
You can still see his dust.
You can get him with a little... hard riding.
Thanks.
You been here long?
Just waiting for a cup of tea and a kiss from Mollie.
I'll join you.
For the tea.
Come in. Come in.
Hello, Mollie.
So it's the pair of you.
Can we give this bucko some tea? Sure, sure. But...
Did you get to the pay train in time? No.
Well, what happened?
Who broke your window? Oh, I...
Monahan must be back.
No, some gandy dancer feeling his liquor was throwing a bottle at the moon.
What'd you do with it?
Do with what? The bottle.
Sure, now, I think you're both a bit cracked.
Much of a crowd at the
Big Tent tonight, Dick?
I don't know. I was out at the End of Track.
The dirt at the End of
Track is white gypsum.
You've got the same dust on your boots I have.
It's red. Like a rose, huh?
More like the ground where the pay train was held up.
Now, don't tell me they got away with the payroll.
You should have asked that fellow that rode by here.
Well, say, that's mighty serious for the railroad.
Where were you, Jeff?
Now drink your tea, and you'll both be feeling easier.
How much did they get? A mail sack full.
A mail sack?
Will you drink your tea and stop staring like there was bullets in it.
Well, out here, Mollie, you never can tell where you're gonna find a bullet.
That's right. A man can't even trust a friend.
Hello.
There's no letters for you, I'm not boiling tea for the house... and we don't want to make up a male quartet.
Captain Butler's a little upset over a pay train holdup.
Too bad, bucko. Somebody put one over on you?
Maybe.
You've had your refreshment, Jeff, and now you'll want to be traveling... after the robbers.
Sounds like good advice.
Maybe.
Lost something? No.
I just thought I might find the bottle that broke that window.
You know, there's a fellow named Pullman... that just invented a new kind of bunk that folds up like this.
Curiosity killed a cat once, Jeff.
You'd better say good night.
Why? You leaving? No.
But you are. This is Mollie's place, and she told you to get out.
Hold your yelps, all of you.
Never in me whole life have I seen two such outrageous fortunes.
Sit down, Jeff, and look what's in store for you.
The little leaves, all crooked and helter-skelter.
Now, they tell you of life and love and hope and grieving.
Will the tea leaves tell me everything that's in this car, Mollie?
No.
No, they...
They're warning you to get moving... or you'll be taking the long journey on a one-way ticket.
What do you see in mine?
A girl with Irish eyes?
About your size?
No, I see two horns and a pointed tail.
I feel that cold witches' wind, Mollie.
How about some wood on the fire?
Don't let your hand slip, bucko.
That's your second mistake, Dick.
What was the first? Sending for help.
What are you waiting for,
Dick? Let him have it.
Dick, wait.
Will you...
Will you look at this now?
This circle in your cup here.
Does it look like a noose? No.
It looks like a ring.
A wedding ring? Well, now, maybe it does... but let's not be talking about it until after Jeff is gone.
Does it look like this one, that was made for the third finger of your left hand?
Why...
If this prying troubleshooter ever gets out of me house...
I'll tell you, it's... It's yes.
Mollie.
Dick's been with me all evening waiting to plight me his troth.
Dick's been with you? Yes.
Now, will you please go home?
Or are you waiting to see it sealed with a kiss?
Did you hear that, bucko? Yes.
I heard it.
I'll be on me oath there's no money here but $6.70... in the cash drawer, and I'm keeping Monahan's savings... sewn up in the mattress.
Will you swear to that by the little cross you wear?
Yes, I...
I must have lost it.
But I swear by what's dear on this earth... and by all the love that's in me... and...
Please go, Jeff, there's nothing in this car you want.
I guess that's right.
Mollie, my darling, you were glorious.
Me heart's still jigging on me back teeth.
Where'd you hide it? Me heart?
No, I know where that is. I mean the pay sack.
The pay sack?
Now what would I be doing with a pay sack?
Quit the blarney and turn it over while you're still able.
Threaten a Monahan, would you? If
I knew, I wouldn't be telling you!
Don't hurt him, Mollie.
All right now, clear out, the both of you.
Tell Campeau I'll be there pronto.
Maybe I'd better stay and help you with it.
I carried it quite a way without your help.
Out.
First it's me heart, and now it's me knees.
Where does Monahan keep his
Rule G? On top of the shelf.
How long will it take you to pack?
Why did you do it, Dick?
We've a lifetime together to talk about that.
Suppose we find out first... if they've got lakes in
Ireland the color of your eyes?
Take off your sweet lip and say what you're meaning.
Or if you'd rather stay in America... there's New York, St.
Louis, San Francisco.
And there's General Casement's car across the tracks.
What do you mean? Back it goes. Every penny of it.
I'll not be helping you rob the railroad that's been mother and son to me.
You're crazy, Mollie.
Do you know what there is in that sack?
Champagne and carriages and pretty dresses... and a good time for the rest of our lives.
There's nearly $200,000 in cash.
Use your wits, man.
Do you think you could travel one mile with it now?
Jeff Butler suspicions you. The whole railroad will be after you.
The only chance of saving your neck is to return it yourself.
Me? You.
Or you'll be dancing with your feet off the ground, and that's not a pretty sight.
Not for a bride on her wedding day.
I love you, Mollie.
I believe you do.
But there'll be no talk of a wedding till you've done as I say.
It's the first time I've ever discarded aces for a queen.
Where's the money? You're sitting on it.
Nobody knew the money was on that train but you, Casement, and myself.
And Campeau.
How did he find out? I don't know.
Campeau's partner is a close friend of yours, isn't he?
He was.
I want that payroll, Butler.
Or I want your resignation.
Good evening, gentlemen.
'Tis sorry I am to be interrupting you, General, but this belongs to you.
To me? What is it? The payroll.
The payroll? The payroll? What?
Where'd you get it?
'Twas like this, I was...
Wait. How did you know it was the payroll? By the bullet holes.
I wasn't shooting as badly as I thought.
Sure, that explains it.
The poor bandit running for shelter, dropping the bag from weakness... with your bullets in his back. The bullets didn't go through the bag.
Where did you find it? Well, Mr.
Allen and I were taking a walk... there's such a beautiful moon tonight... Never mind the moon.
How long have you been with Miss Monahan?
Not long enough.
Watch your talk, Allen. We intend to hang the man who did this job.
No fooling.
Mollie, how did you come by this?
Well, now, I'll not remember a thing... if you all keep charging at me like a bull at red flannels.
Go on.
Well, we were taking some tea over to Grandpa O'Shaughnessy...
Grandpa O'Shaughnessy has drunk nothing... but straight whiskey since the war of 1812.
Well, except when he's got the misery in his back... and then he puts one part of tea to seven parts of whiskey.
Miss Monahan, are you telling the truth? Well, not quite.
As a matter of fact, we were on our way to
Father Ryan's to talk about getting married.
Getting married? You two?
Yeah, show him your ring, Mollie.
I'm waiting to hear where you found the money.
On the tracks near Mollie's car.
How near? As near as you might throw a stone.
Or a bottle? Well, anyway, we brought it right here... didn't we? Yes.
Before we even talked to
Father Ryan about our wedding... in the morning.
Yes. Mollie, it's a medal you deserve for this... as well as congratulations.
I agree with General Casement, but the wedding will have to be tonight.
But there's no great hurry. Sure, there is.
We're moving up to Laramie... and Father Ryan's church will be on a flatcar in two hours.
You gonna be best man, bucko?
Captain Butler has work to do.
I want the man who robbed that train, Butler.
Yes, sir.
I hope you deserve her, Dick.
We're all very grateful to you, Miss Monahan.
Now, Mollie, what can we do for you?
I'll tell you what we can do for her.
We'll give her a wedding tonight that'll go down in history.
I wouldn't want to be putting you to that trouble.
We could wait until...
Trouble?
I'll drive you to the church myself.
That's little enough.
Why, she saved our bacon.
Mollie, you've saved the railroad.
The church goes on the next train, George.
Hey, lend us your hammer.
The board house comes now.
All right,
Donovan. Come on, O'Toole.
Don't take all week.
McGukkin's a sound sleeper, ain't he?
Hot or cold, he goes.
Murder alive! If you wanted to come in, why in blazes didn't you knock at the door?
Leave hold of it, Mike.
Everything goes to Laramie.
And where is Laramie? It's wherever we set down this town.
All right, boys, come on, we'll take the block. The roof comes next.
All right, Sullivan.
Come on, take the block.
# The fireman rang the bell #
# Oh, Lulu in a pink kimono says #
# Baby, fare thee well #
Where's Jeff Butler taking them tracklayers?
Wherever they're going, they mean business.
# I ain't gonna lie in jail #
# But I'm goin' down to Cheyenne town #
# To live with my Lulu gal #
# My Lulu's tall and slender #
# My Lulu's tall and slim #
# But the only thing that satisfies her #
# Is a good big drink of gin #
# My Lulu hugged and kissed me #
# My Lulu gal's a daisy #
What is that? The Irish are coming.
Jake, give him a free drink. Okay.
Keep the ball rolling.
# My Lulu, she's an angel #
# Only she ain't got no wings #
# I guess I'll get her ##
Hello, Campeau.
I hear you're moving to Laramie.
What about it?
Go on over in the corner and turn your back and keep your hands up.
Come on back. You've got visitors.
One yelp and you'll get the ax!
Get over here!
That's what claps me ax through skull.
Don't you reach for your gun.
Who do you think you're shoving?
Get those Irish clodhoppers out of my place.
They just came down to help you move.
Fiesta, take Mr. Campeau in there.
Please. Get one for me, Jeff.
Leach, watch the door.
Come on, boys. Free drinks for everybody.
Nobody ain't drinking, Jake.
Ain't you heard the
Irish is teetotalers?
It's the first time I've heard about it.
Who held up that train, Campeau?
How should I know?
What'd he say, Fiesta?
He say, pretty soon he will tell you all about it.
Pretty soon.
There were eight horses missing from your corral. Where'd they go?
I don't know. Somebody must have borrowed them.
Did you hear that, Fiesta?
Sure. You bet yourself.
Sure, I hear.
He say he think he knows who take those horse.
Who rode those horses? I don't know.
I ain't left the tent tonight.
Look here, Butler.
You and your railroad cutthroat can't bully me.
He called you a cutthroat, Fiesta.
He knows me pretty well.
Who led those men?
Butler, you're nailing the lid on your own coffin.
Dick nailed the lid on yours tonight. I ain't seen Dick.
Then you didn't know he turned the money back to the railroad.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He sold you out to the railroad, Campeau.
That's what you get for picking a man in love.
You're lying. He turned the payroll over to Casement.
I saw Dick give that girl a ring, and she promised to marry him.
Looks like you're the sucker this time, Campeau.
Now you talk.
All right, all right. What's it to me? I wasn't there.
Sure. Dick stuck up the train.
What am I supposed to do about it? Nothing.
Just come with me. You, too.
I'm going.
I declare, it won't seem natural in Laramie without you boys.
Don't reach for your handkerchief, Brett.
Just use your sleeve if you want to wipe your mouth.
Leach, the mule's ready? Yeah.
You and Fiesta take all the dealers outside and get them started.
Yeah.
And here. Don't forget this rat.
Sure, we have big fun with him.
For every crack of that half-breed's whip...
I'll put a bullet through that pig's hide of yours.
Come out from under the table, you.
Dusky Clayton, it's all yours.
Take your hands off me.
Spit on your hands, you terriers, and smash into it.
Yeah! Yeah!
I hope Dick don't get you, Butler.
I don't want nobody to get you but me.
There's a train east tonight, Campeau. Be on it.
You're seen out here again, you'll be shot on sight.
Now, dust!
Come on, Jeff, get into the shindy.
Haven't time. I'm going to a wedding.
All right, boys, put them back.
Cut it out!
Now you boys has got your options of getting out in 30 seconds... or being buried in 30 minutes.
Why, I can't ride this way.
It's a mite on handy, but the Indians can't sneak up on you from behind.
Hey, you can't do this to us.
Well, come on, mule.
Hang the mule. I'm leaving.
And I plight unto thee my troth.
And I plight unto thee my troth.
Allow me to wish you every happiness, Mrs. Allen.
Thank you, Father.
Congratulations. Thank you, sir.
Dick. Why, hello, Jeff.
Come to kiss the bride?
No, Dick. I've come for you.
You've got guns, I haven't.
That's your hard luck.
Have you found proof,
Butler? Yes, Campeau talked.
'Tis a terrible thing you're doing, Jeff.
And for what? They've got the money back.
The soldier that was guarding it hasn't got his life back, Mollie.
Killing?
Dick would have been safe away but for me. I got him into this.
Come with me, Mollie. No.
The railroad gives short shrift to a train robber, Mrs. Allen.
Come on, Dick.
'Tis a brief honeymoon you're giving the bride.
There's no other way, Mollie.
Can I kiss my husband goodbye?
All right.
Could you know the heart-scald that's inside me... there's much you'd understand, but I...
I know the railroad law and I...
The window, Dick! Run for it!
Don't shoot. Don't shoot into that crowd.
What did he do?
He robbed the pay train.
What's the ruckus? Dick Allen. Got away.
Well, I declare.
Leach, get a couple of horses. No, Jeff.
You go on to Laramie.
They'll be needing you there.
Leach and Fiesta will stay here and give Allen his medicine.
It might be better that way, I reckon.
Maybe.
When you reach Laramie, pack your things... and turn your car over to the superintendent.
Your service with the railroad is finished.
Lot of warm winter overcoats on the hoof out there.
I hope the hogger don't hit one of them.
My apologies, Mrs. Allen.
Disgraceful hour for a bridegroom to be coming home.
I'll wash off some of Wyoming before I kiss you good morning.
A fine wedding night.
Under a car with a floor between me and my wife.
You're not gonna give me lead for breakfast, are you?
You shouldn't be on this train. Jeff Butler's aboard.
Jeff? Back in the caboose.
'Tis an awful chance you're taking, being here.
You're here, aren't you?
I'm not sure where I am.
Now, don't look so glum.
Here I am, all washed and beautiful and wanting a most important kiss.
I loved you before, Mollie.
But after last night... Dick,
I must tell you straight out.
I don't feel for you what a woman should for the man she's just married.
The cards are dealt, Mollie.
I'm the husband you found in a teacup. I know.
Till death do us apart, but...
All I'm asking for is a little time to... Time?
I'm borrowing it from the devil.
Why should I wait? You're asking me and I'll tell you.
Do you know why I married you so quick?
Yes.
To stop Brett from putting a bullet in Jeff's back.
You married me knowing that?
I love you enough to take you any way I can get you.
Listen to me, Dick. I...
I've loved Jeff ever since I clouted his face on the Omaha train... but I'm married to you and
I'll stay that way, but...
Don't start out by making me hate you.
You won't hate me, Mollie.
You'll love me.
Gorry. What's hit us?
Keep down. It's a big war party.
What are they, Jeff?
Sioux, and a lot of them.
The saints forgive me for taking human life. The red devils.
Are you all right? I don't know. I think so.
Now's our chance. Once we're clear of the train they won't get us.
I'm going to find Mollie. It's too late to do her any good.
Maybe.
Come on, you fool, before they see us.
I hope you make it.
No, don't shoot.
You'll lead them right to us.
What do you think happened to the caboose?
I hope he's okay.
Jeff!
Glory be.
Well, I'll be...
Hello, bucko. Me prayers were answered.
I guess we're the only ones alive.
How much ammunition you got? A few for the pistol.
About 16 for the carbine.
Any chance of getting help?
If we could telegraph Cheyenne.
Wires cut? No.
But we've got nothing to send with.
Mr. Calvin showed me how to send without any key.
How? Manna from heaven.
The wires across the window.
Cut one and give me your gun.
When I break it, pull the other end down through the smashed roof.
Through your private entrance?
Now where's me poker?
All right, try it.
What'll I say? Cheyenne.
Is there anyone left there? Leach and Fiesta.
They're looking for you.
What are you chuckling at, Mr. Calvin?
Some operator feeling his liquor, Alida.
When a man's on his trick he ought not to... Wait.
Get Leach and Monahan. They're outside.
Indians wrecked Number
11 near Skull Rocks.
It's Mollie calling for help!
Mr. Monahan! Mr. Overmile!
Mr. Monahan! Mr. Overmile!
It's near an hour and I'm thinking our message didn't get through.
Sure it got through.
They had to get soldiers from Fort Russell.
Do you hear it? Help's coming!
Some buck's pounding the bell of the dead engine.
Here's a bite so we'll not be dying on an empty stomach.
Jeff.
They're working down this way.
What do you think?
We'll try again, Mollie.
Keep sending.
We'll have no chance after they see us.
What do you say we...
That does it.
Take this gun, Mollie.
Let them have it, Dick.
Something like old times, huh?
Yeah, only you didn't have a wife with you then. Make a barricade.
Faster, faster!
Feed him more wood. You're starving him.
Hope your old kettle don't blow up.
Why don't you get out and push?
Mollie's all right, Monahan.
Jeff's on that train.
This engine she... she never gets full.
Why do you keep me loading when there's shooting to be done?
Because you wasted a shot on that cigar store Indian out there.
Yeah, what did you have against him?
You're just joking to keep me spirits up... because you know Cheyenne never got our message.
Sure they got it.
I'm no surer than you are.
Jeff, behind you!
Hey, look up there.
Trestle over Dale Creek's afire, Leach!
Keep going,
Monahan, we're all right!
If we're gonna burn after we're dead, let's get some practice.
Here we go.
Dale Creek Bridge afire, Major!
Got your asbestos pants on?
Let her go!
Lie down men, and cover your heads!
Flat on your face or your wives won't know you.
Smoked herring!
Hey, my coat's on fire!
Well, take it off! Take it off!
Get it off!
This is nothing.
You know, I got a wife in Yuma.
She...
My mustache.
My mustache, she is gone. My mustache!
I declare I never liked it no way.
There's one in there and none for that.
How many have you got?
Three.
Just enough to go around.
You won't let them take me alive, will you, Jeff?
No.
Maybe you'd better do the honors all around... before they find we're out of ammunition.
Give me mine while I'm not looking.
That's the last of mine.
I'll say a bit of a prayer for the three of us.
Did you hear it?
What? The whistle.
Jeff! Dick!
Didn't you hear it?
Or am I so close to the other shore I'm hearing things?
Go on with your prayer, Mollie.
Mollie, darling.
There! Can't you hear it?
It's Monahan's old engine. It's McPherson.
I know the shrill voice of him.
You hear it, Jeff? Yeah.
Come on, Monahan. Good old Monahan.
It's his old iron horse. I know his bray from here to Omaha.
Oh, Jeff!
Forward!
Charge!
They got them on the run.
Dick! Not all of them!
By gorry, they're rushing the car.
Scat!
Clear out of here!
Scat!
Mollie.
Mollie, darling.
She's badly hurt, Jeff.
I'll get her to the army doctor.
No, you can't, with that arm.
I'll carry her. No, you won't.
Get up to Skull Rocks. I'll bring you word there tonight.
No, I'm not going to leave her.
She's mine. She's my wife.
When Leach and the soldiers come back here, you'll be a dead man.
You're still wanted, Dick.
Mollie, my darling.
Hello, bucko. Hello, Dick.
How is she?
Doctor says she'll come through all right.
My thanks to the Big Dealer.
I'm afraid it's going to be a long pull for her, though.
And you won't let me see her?
Dick... you and I have fought side by side many times.
We've been through hell and high water... robbed the same chicken coop, chewed on the same bone.
But you're on the other side in this fight... and the next time I see you on Union
Pacific property, I'll have to...
You got a match?
Won't your conscience bother you for letting me go?
There's grub and blankets in the pack on that horse.
I won't be hung for horse stealing, will I?
Belonged to an Indian.
He won't need it anymore.
All right.
All right. I'll get going.
Where to?
Central Pacific.
You're going to help the road that's trying to beat us?
Yeah.
I'm gonna help them the same way I helped the Union Pacific.
Here. You might need that.
Don't deal any cards off the bottom with it. Thanks.
Extra cartridges in the pack. Thanks.
You're all aces, bucko.
But you're in love with Mollie... and don't you ever forget she's my wife.
I might. She wouldn't.
Now, when the Central meets the
Union's tracks, I'll be there, Jeff... and you and the Union Pacific and the devil himself... won't keep me from my wife.
I'd hate to kill you with your own gun.
I'll be there, Dick.
Oh, Jeff... you're wasting your time on Campeau.
The man behind him is
Barrows, the banker.
Thanks.
So long, Dick. So long, bucko.
Thirty days? Thundering
Hades! We can't lose one day.
The ground in that tunnel is frozen harder than rock. We can't dig through!
We've got to blast every inch for 900 feet.
Stuck here for 30 days?
And Ogden only 60 miles away.
And the Central on the plains... with nothing to stop them but daisies and buttercups.
In the Army, when we can't smash through the enemy's center... we always go around the flanks.
What's that, Butler?
Lay a track on the snow.
What? On the snow?
On the snow? No one ever laid track on snow.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Go ahead, Butler. I'll show you what I mean.
Go around the mountain instead of through it.
Then finish your tunnel later. Impossible.
Impossible?
It was impossible to lay four miles of track a day... impossible to clear out the gamblers... impossible to make engines climb mountains.
Jumping Beelzebub! It was impossible for Moses to cross the Red Sea.
Why can't we lay track on top of snow?
Well, let's find out.
You never seen the like.
A track laid on 10 feet of snow.
We have the race as good as won.
Come here before you hang yourself.
That Jeff Butler... don't wear all his brains in his holster.
Who's going to take the first train over?
Now, who else would they be trusting to it but me and old McPherson.
It is a chancy thing, so don't go breaking your neck.
Well, 'tis the first time for an engine to run on snow... and if he don't like it,
I'll put snowshoes on him.
Here, open your mouth and take what's good for you.
Tastes like it come out of McPherson's boiler.
The highest and longest railroad in the whole world... had just come out of McPherson's boiler.
So don't you be insulting him.
Here... take this along in case you...
Let me kiss you to keep you warm.
Looks like you won't need to put those snowshoes on him, Monahan.
Well, he's been through fire and snow... and if he comes to a river, he'll swim it.
They're going to make it. Sure they are.
Jump, Monahan! Jump!
There she goes! Look out, Monahan!
They're both gone!
Poor old Monahan.
I know you're hurting me... no more than you can help.
Monahan!
Monahan! Praise Heaven, you're alive.
I fell clear. We'll get you out.
It's no use, Jeff.
Me and him has come to End of Track.
Oh, no.
Now. Oh, no, it's no use.
You'll have to beat the Central... to Ogden without us... if you can.
That'll be hard without you.
Mollie's cross.
Bury us both together, Jeff.
Here where we can hear the trains thundering by.
There's nothing like hearing an engine whistle... in the still night.
What's to be done now?
Start shoring up that track, Dusky.
And what will happen to the railroad now?
As soon as the track's shored up, we'll try again... with another train.
Hook this car on it, will you?
There's only one thing wrong about dying in the snow, Jefferson.
A fella's liable to catch cold!
Here she comes! Tighten up!
Good boy, Jeff! The
Central can't beat us now.
He's over! They've made it!
I told you they could do it!
You passed the 1000 Mile
Tree back there, General.
We're gonna beat them, Jeff.
We lay six miles of track today, seven tomorrow...
Then wire your congratulations to the Central Pacific.
Why? What's wrong?
That parlor engineer that Asa M. Barrows brought with him just condemned...
27 miles of our track.
What? Condemned 27 miles?
Why, that'll let the Central into Ogden ahead of us.
Barrows, huh?
Boy...
Get me Leach Overmile and Fiesta. Yes, sir.
You lay the track into
Ogden, General Casement...
I'll handle Mr. Barrows.
You'll regret this.
You'll regret this as long as you...
Don't you worry none about us, Mr. Barrows.
You just think about yourself. Here.
This is plain abduction.
Do you hear that, Fiesta?
Abduction.
That is why I had to marry my first wife.
How much do you want?
We don't want nothing. We're just interested in the Union Pacific, same as you are.
Here, put that on.
Now, about this track you say won't pass inspection.
What about it?
You and us are going to walk over every inch of that 27 mile of track... and then you're going to show us every place that needs fixing.
What?
And then you're going to fix it.
Walk over 27 miles of track.
Here's your cane, Mr.
Barrows. Time's a-wasting.
Here's another one, right there.
Seems to me like I've found more the matter with this track... than you have, Mr. Barrows.
He will ruin the railroad.
You're all mixed up, Mr. Barrows.
You're trying to drive the tie through the spike... instead of the spike through the tie.
I do declare, he's improving.
General Casement. Yeah?
At this very moment, the
Union Pacific's first train... is pulling into Ogden, Utah.
The victor in the great race to girdle the continent.
Say, does the New York Tribune own this telegraph line?
We're about to turn it over to the Boston Post.
Gentlemen...
President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point, west of Ogden... as the place where the two Pacific railroads shall meet and join their rails.
Promontory Point? Where is that?
And so President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point as the meeting place... for the two railroads.
The actual meeting place...
Jeff.
I've not seen you in a month of Sundays.
Sit yourself down.
I just came over to say goodbye before you get lost in the crowd out there.
Everybody's coming to see the engines meet.
You know...
California sent a golden spike to clinch the last rail.
But when they drive it... it will mean the end of everything.
Not for you.
Dick'll be out there... waiting to take you to a home that's not on wheels.
And no engines whistling to put me to sleep.
And where will your restless boots be taking you?
Texas.
They're starting another road down there.
Dodge asked me to go as an engineer.
It's the coming true of your dream.
I am glad for you.
Sure... sure there'll be some girl to throw you sheep's eyes... and boil the tea when you call for your mail.
Mollie. 'Tis just the excitement... of joining the rails and all.
Remember me to yourself sometimes when you're... when you're riding the handcars with some of them beautiful Texas women.
It's you I'll always want.
Some of your sweetness got into my blood.
I guess it's there for life.
And my heart will be answering you... as long as ever it beats.
And now you'll be merciful if you'd take yourself out of here as quick as you can.
Goodbye, Mollie.
Laurel wood, eh?
Ain't no hard feelings on our part, Mr. Barrows.
I'd put you in jail but for one thing. You like us, eh?
I hate the sight of you.
You've cost me millions.
But you've cured my indigestion.
How come you ain't out to the big jamboree?
I got something else to do.
...and that this mighty enterprise maybe unto us... as the Atlantic of thy strength... and the Pacific of thy love. Amen.
I'll bet that all them that lies under the sod between here and Omaha... would love to see this sight.
They're laying golden rails in Heaven.
And Monahan's giving the angels a free ride on old McPherson.
He is that.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Dr. Harkness of California.
Ladies and gentlemen... the last rail needed to complete... the greatest railroad enterprise of the world... has just been laid.
And the last spike... needed to unite the
Atlantic and the Pacific... is about to be driven.
To perform these acts... the East and the West... have come together.
Never since history commenced her record of human events... has man been called upon... to meet the completion of a work so magnificent in contemplation... and so marvelous in execution.
California, within whose borders... and by whose citizens the Pacific
Railroad was inaugurated... desires to express her appreciation... of the vast importance... to her and her sister states... of the great enterprise, which by your joint action... is about to be consummated.
From her mines of gold... she has forged a spike.
From her laurel woods... she has hewn a tie.
And by the hands of her citizens... she offers them to become a part of the great highway... which is about to unite her in closer fellowship... with her sisters of the Atlantic.
From her bosom was taken the first soil.
Let hers be the last tie and the last spike.
May God confirm the unity of our country... as this railroad unites the two great oceans of the world.
The honorable Leland Stanford...
Governor of California... and President of the Central Pacific... will strike the first blow at the golden spike.
Mama, he missed it.
We'll take the will for the deed, Governor.
The next blow will be struck by Vice President Durant... of the Union Pacific.
By doggies, looks to me like this railroad ain't never going to be finished.
I now call upon the man... whose financial aid came to us in a time of great need.
Mr. Asa M. Barrows.
I didn't think he could do it.
Maybe we go drink our health now. Yep.
The hand is quicker than the eye.
Now stop your flapdoodle and watch... Miss Mollie...
I can't find Mr. Jeff nowheres... to tell him Campeau's in town looking for to shoot him.
Don't worry.
Jeff'll make that tinhorn look like... But he's not wearing his guns.
Well, that's different.
Use this for an anchor till I get back.
Attention, please!
Before the engines come together... will everyone please take positions... for a photograph.
I thought you was Butler, but you had it coming anyway.
Dick. Dick!
Watch yourself.
Campeau.
I'll get you to a doctor first. No. No use, Jeff.
I've drawn the black deuce.
Bend closer. Mollie...
I'm just a...
I'm just a busted flush.
It's your deal, Jeff.
Yes, sir.
The very next day she trotted a mile in two minutes flat.
Thank you!
And so this great nation is united... with a wedding ring of iron.
Mr. Bradford!
Mr. Booth!
The saints be praised, you're safe.
Where's Dick?
He'll be waiting for us, Mollie... at the End of Track.
Who you voting for this November, Sheriff?
- Me?
- Yes.
James G. Blaine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Eph, here, is casting his ballot for Grover Cleveland.
No.
You voting for that New York Copperhead?
You bet your life I be, and he's gonna beat the britches off of your Mr. Blaine.
Lem! Lookit.
Slapping stickem all over your walls.
Well, you've got a gall, smearing up Darke County with them consarned stickers.
Well, a man's gotta make a living.
Well, I can't help that.
You take that ding-busted thing down off of my wall.
Why, even the side of a man's cow ain't safe from you fellows nowadays.
Go on, take it down.
Go on, take it down.
Lem, let's see the top half of it.
All right, hitch up the rest of him.
If Annie Oakley likes him, he stays up.
If she don't, down he comes.
Gosh, ain't he pretty?
All right, leave him up.
Who is he, Annie?
Toby Walker.
He's the greatest shot in the whole world.
Maybe at trick shooting, Annie, but I'll bet he ain't one-two-three with you on quail.
Oh, Lem, I just point a gun at them.
Say, that big hotel in Cinci's still begging for some of your birds.
- You got some for me today?
- Sure, six dozen.
All dressed and picked.
Bet at 50 yards, she can knock the eye out of a bumblebee.
Yeah?
Yeah. Them quail she shoots don't know what hits them.
Slab in the head every time.
Supported her folks pretty near five years on that gun of hers.
Wish I could shoot that way.
Wish you could.
We'd have law and order in this county.
Sheriff.
Do you remember the time you aimed at a chicken thief...
- Yeah.
...and killed a hog?
Killed...
Mr. And Mrs. Quail, won't you walk into my broiler?
Yes, sir and ma'am, a warm welcome sure do await you.
Oh, my!
I's gonna baptize you slow in hot butter.
Hot butter!
And put you to sleep in a bed of rice.
Sleep on, sweet quail
Say, boy, how many of those quails you done already counted?
- Twenty-six.
- Well, forget to count about four of them.
Don't you think I like quail myself?
- I done already uncounted eight.
- That's right.
Boys.
Your bad arithmetic's gonna get you in trouble one of these days.
Them quails ain't no good, Mr. Maclvor.
They full of buckshot.
Not these quail.
They cost me fancy prices.
The hunter always hits them in the head.
That's right, boss.
That hunter sure is a shooting fool.
I want you boys to out-cook yourselves on these quail.
The Mayor is giving this banquet for Toby Walker.
Yes, sir, and it'll be fit for a king, too.
It better be. Mr. Walker is very particular.
Well, Toby Walker, I hereby pronounce you a member of Buffalo Bill's happy family.
Yep, you've done a good day's work, Jeff.
Yes, I think so.
I think my partner will think so, too.
Colonel Cody and I don't sign up any second-raters, only champions.
So, you're a champion shooter, huh?
I don't believe it.
Take it easy. That's Toby Walker.
Never heard of him.
Bet I can beat him myself.
What are you laughing at?
Well, maybe he could.
We haven't seen you shoot yet.
Well, money talks, Cap.
Your shooting rate's pretty high around here.
Why don't you take me on?
I'm only an amateur.
I don't want any contest with you, Walker.
I'll lay you 3-to-1, and you can name your own targets and distance.
- Take him on, Cap. He may not be so good.
- Sure, Cap. You're a good shot.
Take him on, Cap.
Ain't there one sport in this burg?
I'll give you 4-to-1.
Could you make that 5-to-1, Mr. Walker?
Look, Mac, you better keep out of this.
We ain't betting marbles.
This is for money.
Oh, is that a fact?
Well, I believe I've got someone that might make it interesting for you.
How about a little side bet of $100 to make it more interesting?
$100, eh? No, I don't think that would interest me, but $200 should do it.
Mac, it's a bet.
But you'll have to see my new boss here to arrange the details.
Well, would tomorrow morning at the Gun Club suit you, gentlemen?
It's a go. Let's have a drink on it.
Oscar, set them up, on the house.
- On the house.
- On the house!
Well, Mac...
Beers all around.
And make mine a short one.
Make mine a champagne cocktail.
- I'll take champagne, too.
- Make mine champagne, too.
Make mine champagne.
All right, Oscar,
I'll have a champagne cocktail.
Mac, if I hadn't been here to see this,
I wouldn't have believed it.
Put it back. I've lost my thirst.
What's the matter, Mac?
Are you mourning?
Yeah, for his $200.
- Oh, that's not for ladies.
- Oh, I'm no lady.
Pardon me, miss, this is a saloon.
Oh, how cozy.
I've lived for 60 years and that's the first time
I ever saw a woman going into a saloon.
The next thing you know, they will be smoking cigarettes.
Talk sense, man, talk sense.
- Here's to Toby Walker.
- Here's to Toby Walker!
Well, gentlemen, I hardly know what to...
Hello, honey. Getting your hair curled?
What's the matter? Don't I get introduced?
Allow me, gents.
The great Toby Walker and Company.
I nearly forgot what time it is.
They're probably yelling for me at the theater. I...
Come on, get out of here.
Seems there's nothing sacred anymore.
In all my born days
I've never seen such gall.
What are you trying to do, make a jackass out of me in front of my public?
- Honey.
- Don't honey me. You're too dang fresh.
Toby Walker, you're supposed to be a sharpshooter, and you can't even see a willing gal right under your own nose.
- I can see anything I'm aiming at.
- Yeah, I know.
You only go high, wide and handsome for the lady swells, like you claim you was with Sarah Bernhardt.
Let's leave Miss Bernhardt's name out of this.
Bernhardt. You never knowed her well enough to carry her trunks.
Listen, Vera, I think you're a swell little trouper.
Now, let's leave it like that.
You've got your ticket back to New York and two weeks extra pay.
I'd keep you in the act if I could, but there just ain't no place in the Buffalo Bill show for a gal.
Well, sharpshooter, I got to hand it to you.
You sure got the power to resist a beautiful woman.
Well, don't take it too much to heart, little girl.
Maybe I'm doing you a favor.
You know, Lily Langtry couldn't act for sour apples till I turned her down.
Talk louder, will you, Lem?
I can't hear you.
Blast these newfangled instruments of torture.
Hello. Oh, Lem, Lem. Just a minute.
Hello, Lem. Lem, I want you to get a hold of that quail-shooter, the one that sells you the birds you send up here.
I've got a shooting match.
A shoot... A shooting match, Lem.
Aye. If he wins, there's $50 in it for him.
Yes, I said $30.
What did you say his name is?
Shake up the telephone, Lem.
I can't hear a word.
What? Oh, Oakley. Andy Oakley?
All right, Lem, all right.
Have him here in the morning.
Oh, Lem, Lem, Lem, and make certain sure he's sober.
Aye, aye.
All ready, Joe?
Bend down, please. I want to see the sign.
Everybody ready?
Smile.
Smile bigger. That's fine.
That's fine. That's a beauty.
- Well, don't they know you're here?
- Come on, Ma.
- Who's shooting against you, Mr. Walker?
- A fellow by the name of Oakley.
A rube from the tall timber, by crackey!
Well, good luck to you.
Well, we'll have some fun, anyway.
If he ever gets here.
Hey, Mac, better get your man here.
I can't wait all day.
Oh, he'll be here all right.
He's had a long ways to come.
Well, I'll go down and warm up a bit.
I'm waiting to see that dark horse, Mac.
And the longer we wait, the longer Mac keeps that $200.
Anyone that can hit quail in the head with a single ball can shoot for my money.
Are you looking for me?
My name is Oakley.
Oakley?
- Where is your father?
- Well, he's dead.
Dead?
- When did it happen?
- Oh, a long time ago.
- Then, where is your brother?
- This is my brother.
And this is my sister Susie and this is Ma.
Excuse me.
I am looking for an Andy Oakley who's been supplying me with game.
Oh, I guess you made a mistake, mister.
Not Andy Oakley. Annie.
It's me you sent for.
You?
A joke's a joke, but this one is just a little too practical.
But it's not a joke.
I want to bet my own money.
Show him what you've got, Ma.
Lem sent down $10 and Sheriff Bixby sent down $5, and a lot of other people chipped in.
$37 in all.
Yes, sirree.
Then forget about it.
There's not going to be any contest.
Maybe you can settle for half, Mac.
You mean just because I'm not a man, you ain't gonna let me shoot?
That's perfectly all right, Miss Oakley.
You're going to get your chance.
The bet still stands.
But I'll discount it and pay off right away,
Mr. Hogarth.
Oh, no, you don't.
The whole hog or nothing at all.
And I'm speaking for Toby Walker, too.
Toby Walker?
You're in big company now, Miss Oakley.
Oh, I couldn't shoot against Toby Walker.
Oh, now, you mustn't be afraid.
You just do the best you can.
Just pretend you're shooting quail.
Oh, I ain't scared he could beat me.
It's just that it don't seem reasonable.
Of course it isn't.
But we're going through with it just the same.
Ma, can I have the money?
Would... Would you bet the money for me?
Oh, yes, of course I'll bet it for you.
Here's yours, Annie.
Here. They don't belong to you.
Here's a seat for you, Mrs. Oakley.
Hey, don't meddle with those guns.
Oh, I'm sorry, mister, but whenever I see a gun, I always...
What's a kid like you know about guns?
I got one here.
It was clean through the Civil War.
Well, gee... Well...
Well, gee whiz, don't tell me you shoot with a thing like that?
Of course I do.
What do you shoot? Doodlebugs?
You hang around, kid, and you'll see some shooting that is shooting.
I figured on seeing some tall shooting, otherwise I wouldn't be here.
Up from the sticks to see me make a monkey out of that Oakley?
The shootingest monkey you ever saw, and we got $37 says so.
No! About all the ready cash in that county, I suppose.
Bring on that hickory-nut-knocker.
Mr. Walker, meet Miss Hickory-nut-knocker.
- What?
- Your opponent, Miss Annie Oakley.
What do you mean?
Hey, Maclvor, is this your idea of a joke, asking me to shoot against a half-baked kid, and a girl at that?
Now, if you'd like to call off the bet...
He's right, Mr. Maclvor.
He'd look awful silly if I beat him in front of all these folks.
Beat me! Why, you...
Get those targets ready. Beat me!
Make him earn his money, Annie.
I was wondering, Mr. Maclvor, if you could help me find some plain sewing?
Well, I don't know about needlework, but I've got a cigar stand at the hotel...
Oh, I love a man who smokes a cigar.
Mind you, the job only calls for selling cigars.
As the challenger, you shoot first.
Start with the end target.
Yes, sir.
Clear the range, boys.
All right.
You started at the wrong end.
- That's all right. Set it up again.
- Set them up.
First potshot I ever took.
All right, Mr. Walker.
This is too easy.
Give us something to shoot at.
Certainly. We'll use moving targets if it's agreeable with Miss Oakley.
Well, I never shot a quail while it was sitting down.
All right, miss.
Get in the pit, boys.
You'll shoot alternately.
The first one to miss will lose the contest.
- Is that all right with you?
- Yes.
- And you, Mr. Walker?
- Fine.
And you, Mr. Maclvor?
It's fine with me.
Just call "Ready."
- Ready.
- Throw!
A hit!
Good shot.
- That was well done, little lady.
- Thank you, sir.
- Ready.
- Throw!
A hit.
Good shot.
- Ready.
- Throw!
A hit.
- Ready.
- Throw!
- Ready.
- Throw!
- Ready.
- Throw!
- Ready.
- Throw!
Hey, Hogarth, you signed up the wrong shooter.
You better look for another job, Toby.
There goes your championship.
- Ready.
- Throw!
Hogarth, you better get that contract back, in case the girl beats Toby.
So, you're the champ!
Quiet, please, gentlemen.
Ready, Miss Oakley?
Honey, I hope you ain't gonna be the cause of that young man losing his position.
Don't worry, Ma. I ain't gonna be.
- Ready.
- Throw!
A miss!
- Ready.
- Throw!
A hit!
Sister, don't take it too much to heart.
You gave me about as good a match as anybody does.
Thanks, Mr. Walker.
You know, you've got possibilities.
It's too bad I won't be around to give you a few pointers.
Come on, Ma, let's go home.
Everybody! Everybody up to the bar!
The drinks are on me!
All right, Fritz, it's on me.
Beers for everybody.
- Make mine a champagne cocktail.
- I'll have champagne, too!
I don't see how she could have lost.
Newt said she tied him shot for shot right up till the very last.
I never knew her to miss a shot before.
You'd better break the news to them, Annie.
I'll keep an eye on the young'uns.
Hello, Annie.
- Howdy, Annie.
- Good evening.
I'm gonna pay you folks back the money I lost if it takes a whole winter's shooting.
Oh, forget it, Annie.
You done the best you could.
- Sure you did.
- You bet.
That's just it, I didn't.
Now, Annie, you don't know what you're saying.
I know, all right, and I'm gonna fess up.
I missed that last shot a purpose.
You missed it a purpose!
Yes, I did.
I couldn't beat that fellow.
I didn't have the heart to.
He was...
He was just too pretty.
- Hello, Miss Oakley.
- Hello.
Mrs. Oakley. You know, in all the excitement,
I completely forgot to get that bet of yours covered.
When I remembered,
I had to chase all this way to find you.
- Honest, you didn't bet the money?
- No, I didn't.
Gee, now, I can pay back the boys.
Just a minute. There's something else
I wanted to see you about.
Mrs. Oakley, this daughter of yours is one of the finest shots I've ever seen.
We're mighty proud of her.
And we'd be mighty proud to have her with the Buffalo Bill show.
Buffalo Bill?
Yes, you see,
I'm a partner of Colonel Cody's.
Well, I hope you ain't suggesting that
Annie go gallivanting around the country with a lot of cowboys and wild Injuns.
Well, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Annie?
But what would Ma and the kids do without me?
We'd pay you good money.
Just think of it, Annie Oakley in the greatest shooting act in the country, billed right next to Toby Walker.
You don't mean he's going to be there.
Every day for the next two years, rain or shine.
Mister, it's a deal.
Reckon the first thing you'd better know about this outfit is how I figure on running it.
This is a real Wild West show with he-men doing the things they did on the plains.
Now, if you're carrying any sleight of hand up your sleeve, you'd better forget it.
I want the real, genuine article or nothing.
That's what you're getting, Colonel.
And, naturally, I expect to get billed right up there on top.
I don't suppose you'd mind, Walker, if we put Buffalo Bill's name on the posters, too.
Oh, I think that'd be all right.
No hard feelings, Colonel, just a little friendly chat.
What?
Now, you wait here until I break the news to the Colonel.
- I hope he likes me.
- How could he help it?
Well, you old horse-thief.
About time you turned up.
I'm sorry. I was a little delayed, Bill.
I should think you would be.
Probably ashamed to show your face after sending me that New York buckaroo.
Who? Toby Walker?
Why, he's the greatest shot on earth.
With the exception, maybe, of a gunslinger I've just signed up.
Another one? Well, what's his name?
- Annie.
- Annie?
What in tarnation do you think we're running around here, a danged burlesque?
Calm yourself, Bill. Annie Oakley's as good a shot as any man I ever saw.
Did I hear someone call my name?
Colonel Cody, meet Miss Annie Oakley.
Well, dog my cats!
- How do, little missy?
- Howdy.
And, Bill, she shoots as pretty as she looks.
Maybe so, but I never knowed any woman could shoot good enough to join this outfit.
They say you're a mighty fine shot yourself, Mr. Buffalo Bill.
How much you got says I can't beat you?
Well, bust my buttons, how much you got says you can?
Say, now, hold on, wait a minute.
With a woman who can outshoot most men, why, she'd soon be the greatest attraction in our show.
Maybe you're right.
But how would it look on the billing?
"Buffalo Bill's blood-curdling
Wild West show
"with the dainty Annie Oakley."
You know, Bill, you're a downright chicken-liver when it comes to women.
No, it ain't that, Jeff. It's...
Well, it's the boys.
To tell you the truth,
I ain't got the gumption to go out there and tell them.
Well, you leave that to me.
Boys, now that we're all here...
What I mean is I've brought you all together because...
Well, you see...
This is kind of in the nature of an occasion and...
And I...
Well, boys, I want you to...
I really want you to...
You tell them, Jeff. It was your idea.
Well, I've got some good news for you, boys.
The Colonel and I have decided that what this outfit really needs is an uplifting influence.
And what could be more uplifting than the presence among us of a fine, high-minded little woman?
Here she is, boys.
The newest member of our happy family,
Miss Annie Oakley.
That's all, boys.
- What could she do in a show like this?
- I don't like this, anyway.
Well, I can get a job with Pawnee Bill.
What could a woman do in a show like this?
Come on, Annie.
I'll show you the papooses.
Yes, little missy, we're all just one big, happy family.
Here we are.
This way, missy.
Perfume.
Dang it, you smell like Happy Minnie's back in Omaha.
The Colonel's had me out there sleeping with the horses.
Judging from the turnout,
I guess you boys see the light.
All right, fellows, what do you say?
Howdy, Miss Oakley.
Well, that sounds mighty good, boys.
Now, let me tell you something, someday you're gonna be darn proud to say you knew Annie Oakley.
That's right. Take it from one who knows.
Miss Oakley, I want you to meet that old scallywag, Ned Buntline,
- my press agent.
- Howdy.
Howdy, little lady.
It's up to you to put her across, Ned.
You might even write her into one of those dime novels you write about the Colonel, there.
Well, sure thing, if it's all right with the Colonel.
How's this?
When she was just a little tyke,
Bill, here, saved her from Chief Sitting Bull's redskins.
Sitting Bull?
Why, sure thing, Colonel.
Sitting Bull's worth five cents of any man's dime novel.
The papers say old Bull's in Washington, calling on the great white father.
We've got to grab him, Jeff.
Great way to start our season if we got him out the opening night.
Not to see the show, to join the show.
Well, that's tall thinking, Bill.
Why drag in a dirty Sioux to mess up a good outfit?
He might forget himself and saw off another massacre.
Surely Mr. Bull's learned some manners since he chawed up General Custer.
Of course he has.
Besides, folks will pay good money to see him.
Out in the woods, maybe, but as long as you play these eastern spots,
Toby Walker's the lad who will pack your arena.
You can see for yourself, Annie, you're in the safest possible neighborhood.
That's where Major Buntline lives, that's my tent, right next to Colonel Cody's quarters, and that's where you live.
Oh, a chiffonier and flowers, too.
Oh, I do want to thank you for everything.
Don't thank me.
Mr. Hogarth, then.
Well, I thought a few flowers might help.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Good night, Annie. Sleep tight.
Good night. Good night, Colonel.
Good night, Annie.
Hey, what's this?
Hey, you. Razorback.
What's eating you, Jeff?
Listen...
What's the matter?
Oh, nothing an old bullwhacker like you would understand. Come on.
The main thing for you boys to remember is never get discouraged.
Why, when I think about how I started in that shooting gallery, nothing seems impossible.
Whenever the boss would go out,
I'd just keep popping away until finally I was...
- The best there was.
- The best there was.
Nope. The best there is.
Whereabouts was this shooting gallery?
The Bowery.
- The Bowery!
- What do you know about that?
A Bowery cowboy.
Boys, I just had to make this jaunt to show you western monkeys how to shoot.
That bronc's begging to be busted.
Hello, cowboy.
Hey, what's going on, here?
A little change in the layout, Mr. Walker.
Mr. Hogarth's fixed you a place all by yourself.
The other side of the buffalo corral.
Well, now, ain't that thoughtful of him?
Well, maybe I shouldn't let them buckaroos sleep close to these firearms.
One of them might go off and scare my little playmates.
Mr. Walker, I've been thinking,
I guess you thought I was sort of fresh coming up to Cincinnati to shoot against you.
Why, no, kid.
What put that idea in your noodle?
Well, I don't know.
You being Toby Walker and famous and all that.
Say, there was the grandest picture of you on the side of Lem Jordan's store.
- Yeah, was it really good?
- Move on, there.
- Who are you talking to?
- Mr. Hogarth's orders.
- Nobody's to annoy Miss Oakley.
- What do you mean "annoy"?
Nobody ever accused me of annoying a gal when I was talking to her.
Them's the orders, Mr. Walker.
Oh, Mr. Walker, you know that time up in Cincinnati?
- Yeah.
- I let you beat me.
That's it!
How do you like that, Colonel?
Not bad, Walker.
A little harder than potshotting a herd of buffalo, eh, Colonel?
Yeah, and almost as dangerous.
Afraid she don't know how to sell it, Jeff.
Well, she hasn't had a chance yet.
Anyway, you don't see her missing, do you?
No, but she's just a shooting machine.
No color to her work.
I'll be as sorry as you are, but I don't think she'll make the grade.
Gosh, that looks just like him.
A little trick I was saving for next year, but on account of the act
I'm doing is going so good,
I'm gonna pass it along to you.
That's mighty fine of you, Toby.
And I can do it, too.
Sure you can, and here's another one.
You take these and come on down here.
This one's a pippin.
When I say ready, you throw them up high.
Both of them?
Throw them.
I'll bet I can do that, too.
Of course. You can shoot as good as I can.
All you need is color, showmanship.
Let me try it.
Oh, Colonel.
Get out of here, you darned, sneaking coyotes.
Get out of here!
Close, Colonel, but no cigar.
Here you are, Bill.
Dad bob it, Jeff. Why can't I get a haircut?
Well, Bill, that mane of yours is the biggest thing in the show.
You might as well have your head cut off.
What would the President and the rest of the bigwigs say if you came out like a shorn Samson?
And they're all here today, Bill.
Everybody that is anybody in Washington.
That's fine. What about Sitting Bull?
No cause for you to worry.
Ned Buntline's got him out there as big as life in a front box.
Great, Jeff, that's great.
Go ahead now and comb out your curls.
Introducing Ogallala Slim and his band of bronco-busting, bull-dogging cowboys.
You'd like being with the show, Chief.
Travel all over.
Maybe you'll join, too, Rain-in-the-Face.
How old are you?
- Me?
- Yes.
- Ninety-four.
- A spring chicken.
Magnificent, huh?
Rain-in-the-Face, ask Chief Sitting Bull how he likes the show.
What's his nibs saying?
Bull said, "All show no good like that, he go home."
Thrilling feats of horsemanship by Russian Cossacks.
What was that?
Bull say, "All show smell bad."
Do you know something?
The Colonel thinks
I'm not going to make good.
- Oh, I doubt...
- He really does.
I can tell the way he's been looking at me, lately.
Listen, will you do like I showed you?
I've been practicing.
Introducing the world's greatest rifle shot,
Mr. Toby Walker.
Well, wait till you see this one.
He's gonna shoot a two-bit piece right out of that fellow's fingers.
- What's that?
- He said, "Not bad for paleface.
"Bull can hit dime."
Introducing one of the country's greatest woman rifle shots,
Miss Annie Oakley.
Boys, throw up five.
Five? You want to ruin the only chance you've got?
I can hit them.
Tell Bull I'll bet he hasn't any squaws that can shoot.
He don't want the squaw shoot, he want the squaw cook.
All right.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Chief.
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?
Don't be scared, Annie.
Bull is just trying to tell you how scrumptious he thinks you are.
Goodness, I thought I was a goner until you grabbed him.
What's the matter, Chief?
Annie, Chief Sitting Bull has just rechristened you lpawa, that means "little sure shot."
And now, a thrilling battle between the Indians and the cowboys during an attack on the immigrant train.
He says if you'll do this every day, he'll join the show.
I certainly will if he won't do that again.
Chief, it's a bargain.
Hey, pal, take it easy. This is all in fun.
"Buffalo Bill's trusty rifle barked and another redskin bit the dust.
"Riding like the wind, he swept from the ground the beautiful girl,
"last survivor of the ill-fated wagon train.
"He spurred his mustang to greater speed,
"sending leaden messages of death into the ranks of the foe,
"but the redskins, with fiendish screams, still pursued him.
"Little did the doughty plainsman realize that this tiny prairie primrose
"was one day to burgeon into womanhood's fairest flower,
"Annie Oakley."
Ned, you're a genius.
Fifty thousand people will be wanting to see her after reading that.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna bill her right up, name for name, with Toby Walker.
Oh, Colonel.
So, I'm gonna be aced out of my own act, huh?
Now, listen, Walker.
Colonel Cody and I are still running this outfit.
Since you're asking for it,
I may as well tell you something.
When it comes to draw, you're not quite the biggest thing out.
No wonder, with everybody else getting all the razzle-dazzle.
Taking a green kid and billing her up even with me.
Oh, now, please.
Mr. Walker knows I wouldn't do anything to hurt his chances.
You? Hurt my chances?
Not you or anybody else with this troupe.
I'll still be headlining when the rest of you are working in livery barns.
- Just one big...
...happy family.
Just a minute! Just a minute, Colonel!
There's gold in this domestic crisis.
I can see it on the billboards.
"Toby Walker versus Annie Oakley.
"Male against female.
"A titanic battle of the sexes for the rifle championship of the world."
Ned, you're the thinkingest horse thief in history.
Forty years in the business and never lost a spangle.
Darned if this don't call for a drink.
Everybody back to my car.
I'm going to break out a bottle of Old Crow.
I'm sorry, Toby.
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be with the show.
I don't take it personal, kid.
Business is business.
Besides, I enjoy a brush with them hairy-pantsers, once in a while.
Don't you worry. You're aces with me.
- Mad, Toby?
- No.
You're looking kind of mad.
Got on a new rig, ain't you?
Sure looks pretty.
- Gosh, it's funny how things turn out.
- Ain't it, though?
It seems like only yesterday
I saw your picture on the billboard and Lem Jordan wanted to tear it down.
Why, the fellow must have been crazy.
He wanted to but I wouldn't let him.
Well, it's a funny world.
You looking at my picture on the billboard and thinking I was so gosh-darn grand, and now you...
Now you really got me.
- I got you?
- You sure have, Annie.
No other girl's got a chance.
But look we...
Look, we can't let anybody know we're stuck on each other.
It's good show business if we even let the company think we're unfriendly,
- pretty near enemies.
- Oh.
You think so?
I know the ins and outs, kid.
People will pay to see us battle each other.
I don't care no more who wins those matches.
- You don't?
- No.
I know you can beat me and I'm proud of you.
Never thought I'd see the day when I could stand that, but now...
Toby, I'm gonna tell everybody how wonderful you really are.
Honey, we've got to give the folks who think we hate each other a run for their money.
Now, remember, you hate me.
Mister, I hate you to pieces.
- Hello, Lem.
- I got no time for you today.
Just leaving.
Looks like the whole township's leaving.
- What's going on? Lmmigrating west?
- Immigrating nothing.
We're going to Cincinnati to see the gal that's making this county famous.
Now I know why they call him Sitting Bull.
I guess he wants us to share the sofa.
Thank you, Chief.
Positively, Chief.
He says you'd make a fine squaw.
You may know pretty near everything,
Toby Walker, but not Indian talk.
Anything nice about you, honey,
I'd understand in any lingo.
Toby, your tepee.
Annie, your tepee.
I savvy.
Two can live in tepee cheap as one.
Look.
Papooses good, too.
Hey, hey, hey, Bull. Take it easy.
That's the best I've heard in two weeks.
Mr. Maclvor, how are you?
Well, well, how fine you're looking, Annie.
She hasn't changed much, has she, Mac?
Considering the fact that she's become a very famous young lady.
- And didn't I invent her?
- Sure you did.
If it wasn't for you, I'd still be quail-shooting down on the farm.
And now, Mac, I want you to meet a new member of our family, the one and only Sitting Bull.
Well, you won't need that tent, Mr. Bull, not while you're in Cincinnati.
Yes, Mac's invited us all to stay at his hotel while we're here.
Oh, how nice.
We're advertising for the Maclvor House.
There'll be customers sleeping on the billiard tables.
Gosh, it'll be great sleeping under a ceiling again.
Ever since I joined this hairy-pants outfit, I...
Walker, if you can't say something pleasant, just don't say nothing at all.
I just told this little squirt a thing or two.
I'm getting sick and tired of pulling my shots just to make her look good.
Pulling your shots?
Walker, one of these days somebody's gonna bust that gas bag you call your head.
Better cowboys than you have tried it, Colonel.
Why, you lowdown, yapping Bowery puppy.
What this happy family needs is a good spanking. Come on.
Come on, Bull, we'll get your stuff together.
Now, just a minute, gentlemen.
- Where do you keep them Indians?
- Well, the Indian village is right over there.
In fact, if you'll hurry, you'll find Sitting Bull right at home.
They'll dig him a new home when I get through with him.
Forget it, Dan.
Them Indian wars are all over.
Let me alone.
I ain't forgetting that I had a brother with Custer at Little Big Horn.
Now, you Sioux snake, I'm gonna pay you for one of Custer's boys.
Call them off.
You all right, partner?
A little scrap now and then means nothing to you, eh, Bull?
Gosh, I wouldn't have wanted that blast much closer to my peepers.
Well, come on, kid, I'll flag a hansom and ship you off to a bulletproof hotel room.
Well, young man, it's not as bad as it might have been.
Come on, come on, Doc. How about it?
You're suffering from a form of corneal opacity.
You don't say.
A compressed condition of the optic membrane, but don't worry.
- You'll be able to see reasonably well.
- Oh, sure, I can see.
Come in and see me again tomorrow.
In the meantime, go easy with those eyes.
What business are you in?
- Me? I'm Toby Walker.
- That doesn't answer my question.
I can see you're not a patron of the theater, Doc.
- I'm an actor.
- Oh, an actor.
Well, you'll be able to go on with your work all right.
- It's lucky you're not a bookkeeper.
- Yeah.
- Toby, darling.
- Well, well, Vera.
You sure look elegant back there with all them explosive stogies.
You don't look pekid yourself.
Oh, I'm all right, I guess.
It was nice of Mac to give you the job here.
Oh, he didn't lose nothing by it.
The smoke business has perked up some since I took over.
Say, tonight's my night off.
How about a little supper after the show, just for old times' sake?
Well, I'd like to, Vera, but I've got a little business to attend to this evening.
Is that the little business over there?
Tell me, Annie, is it true them Injuns eat D-O-G?
Oh, I know what that spells.
That spells "dog."
Hey, I'll see you later.
Do they, Annie?
Well, I don't think so.
Mr. Sitting Bull just loves hash.
He likes it with molasses.
Oh, here's Toby.
Mr. Walker,
I want you to meet my mother and all the folks from down home.
Mrs. Oakley, folks,
I'm delighted to meet you.
Mac, have you seen the Colonel?
The last I saw of him, he and Mr. Hogarth were busy sending telegrams.
- Try and locate him for me, will you?
- Aye.
Well, Mr. Walker, I reckon you ain't gonna win so easy tonight as you did the last time you shot here.
That's right.
Annie's had a chance to get used to his good looks.
I'm sure you'll see her at her best tonight.
And how about you, Mr. Walker?
You know, Annie is a show all by herself.
She don't need me at all.
- You see, folks what I mean...
- You ain't getting cold feet, are you?
You mustn't mind the folks, Toby.
They're up here from down home to see me, just like if we were playing New York, all the people from the Bowery would come to see you.
And we aren't going to disappoint them, are we?
Well, Walker, what's on your mind?
I'm sorry I bothered you, Colonel.
I guess what I wanted to say just sort of slipped my mind.
Fresh buttered popcorn?
A bag of popcorn, sir?
It's very bad for you.
Step lively, folks.
Count your change before leaving.
Thank you, neighbor.
Step lively, please, and see the big performance, the big show, Wild West show, a congress of rough riders.
- Get tickets. How many, neighbor?
- How much are they?
One dollar and a half, sir.
- Have you any dollars?
- We have dollar tickets. Yes, sir.
How many?
You're keeping 11,000 people from seeing the show.
Aye.
You know, Vera, the more I think about this...
Now, it isn't the money, it's poor Colonel Cody's feelings
I'm thinking about.
Why, he'd be all broken up if I paid for the tickets.
Yeah, the shock would probably floor him.
- Well, make up your mind.
- Step lively, please. Step lively, folks.
- How many, neighbor?
- Well...
Give me...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Your money's bogus around here, Mac.
Don't you know that?
- I didn't know it was you.
- Give me a couple of blues.
Here we are, my friends.
A couple of Annie Oakleys.
Step lively, folks.
Annie Oakleys.
Oh, that's a bonny name for them.
Two holes, and clean as Annie might have shot them herself.
Just a minute. This is hardly right.
- Oh, go on, go on.
- Well, if you insist.
Miss Annie Oakley, the winner.
I am sure Miss Oakley will favor us with an encore.
Is there any brave gentleman in the audience who would like to have Miss Oakley shoot a cigarette from his mouth at 30 paces?
I'll do it.
Ladies and gentlemen, proving chivalry is not dead,
Mr. Toby Walker will show his faith in the marksmanship of his fair opponent.
I wish I was making that shot.
Give me a coin. I'll hold it for Toby.
Ladies and gentlemen, the courage of the fair sex is a match to that of the male.
The little lady will now permit
Mr. Toby Walker to shoot a 25-cent piece out of her hand at the same distance,
30 paces.
Since when did you take over setting my routines?
- Why I only thought...
- You're paid to jabber, not to think.
My contract don't call for carrying out your half-wit brainstorms.
Sorry, friends, but Mr. Walker seems indisposed to accept the challenge.
Oh, he's scared he'll miss.
Indisposed nothing. He's afraid.
Yeah, he's afraid she'll beat him.
I always did say he didn't have any nerve.
He's trying to queer Annie's act.
What's the matter with you, trying to start a stampede?
Oh, just having a little fun with him,
Mr. Hogarth.
He's got it coming to him.
Any fellow that chicken-livered...
Shut up.
I ought to fire the whole lot of you.
He could do it easy.
He's just trying to queer the show.
He's got a yellow streak down his back a yard wide.
He aimed to hit her.
- Annie!
- Walker, I ought to kill you right here.
There, now, honey. We'll have a doctor for you in just a second.
Oh, I'm all right.
Bring on the next act!
Honest, Colonel, I tried...
Walker, I'm giving you 10 minutes to pack up and get off the grounds.
That suits me fine, but first I'm gonna see Annie.
She don't want no part of you.
This is my fault. I should have thrown him out a long time ago.
He didn't mean to do it. I know he didn't.
Oh, yes, he did. He deliberately hit you in the shooting hand.
Oh, he wouldn't try to hurt anybody.
You don't understand him.
Rustle him out of here, boys.
- I've got to see him.
- Come on, Annie, we'll see the doctor.
Presenting riders of all nations in review.
- Well, Doctor, what's the verdict?
- No tendons severed. She'll be all right.
- To shoot?
- Oh, yes, it's not really serious if she takes care of her hand for a few weeks.
Better let Annie rest now, folks.
Please stop fussing over me and tell me where Toby is.
- Now, now, now, now.
- You children, run out in the hall and play.
But I want him. Why isn't he here?
You mustn't upset yourself, Miss Oakley.
Please try to rest.
But I can't rest until I find what's become of him.
It doesn't hurt a bit anymore.
You're all keeping him away from me.
Now, honey, you mustn't have any more truck with that...
He didn't mean to do it.
He's sweet and kind.
You don't understand him.
- None of you do.
- Annie, please.
You never gave him a chance from the first day you saw him.
Well, I'll tell you something, he's better than the whole bunch of you put together.
There, there, precious, everything will be all right.
Now, don't you worry, little missy.
We're going to have you right as rain in just a few days.
- Good night, Annie.
- Boys, if you don't mind.
Bye.
- You're gonna be fit as a fiddle, Annie.
- Good night, Annie.
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Good night.
There, there, baby.
Try to get some sleep.
I'll be along in a minute, Mrs. Oakley.
It wasn't his fault. I know it wasn't.
If I could only talk to him.
Annie, dear, you're just a kid.
You've got to believe in the people who really love you, and the sooner you forget about him, the better.
But I'm not going to forget about him.
Try to get some sleep.
Toby!
Honey, your hand, honest, I...
It's nothing.
Nothing, now that you're here.
They're saying I done it on purpose.
There's something
I've got to tell you, Annie.
- You've said enough already, Walker.
- Please, Jeff.
I'm sorry, Annie. You may hate me for this but tonight he'll do his talking to me.
I've got nothing to say to you, Hogarth.
What did you want to tell me, Toby?
The less you say, the better, Walker.
But I've got something to tell you, you're going to clear out of this kid's life.
I see, trying to fix it up for yourself, huh?
You know that isn't so.
I think Annie knows that her happiness is all that matters to me, to everybody in this show, except you.
What have you got to offer?
A selfish, swelled head and a future that's behind you.
Maybe you're right.
Toby, you know I don't believe that.
- Goodbye.
- Toby!
Now, now, now.
I'm going to run along and let you get some rest.
You mustn't be too hurt about this.
You'll find that a fellow like that is pretty easy to forget.
Well, I guess
I'll let you get a little sleep, Chief.
Good night.
Good night.
Come in.
Hello.
I thought you might need a little cheering up.
You're wasting your time, kid.
The great Toby Walker is on the skids.
Don't let them sell you that, Toby.
Why, we could put the old vaudeville act together again and play to standing room only.
I'm all played out, Vera.
You've got a good job. Hang on to it.
Oh, that. Listen, Toby, what you need is a little romping.
I'm gonna take you out and show you the town.
Toby.
Well, well, if it ain't little dead-eye.
Maybe you'd like to join us.
We're just going out and paint the town.
Toby, I've got to talk to you.
Your friend Hogarth was right.
There's been enough said already.
- But...
- Listen, dead-eye, why don't you quit pounding this man?
You ain't done him a nickel's worth of good.
Ever since he first seen you, he's had one piece of rotten luck after the other.
- Vera!
- Ain't you satisfied with the way you got him messed up now?
Just busting with the juices of human kindness, ain't you?
Well, I guess you helped me do her a favor, at that.
Well, so long, my little sugar plum.
So long?
I thought we was gonna paint the town.
The Bill show's celebrating with the rip-snortingest blowout this old town's ever had.
Bill, don't bother Annie tonight.
Wait and tell her in the morning.
Why, this will do her more good than a barrel of medicine.
Don't be such a bluenose, Jeff.
You'd have the poor kid thinking there wasn't no Santa Claus.
Annie! Annie!
Well, missy, we've got great news and you're gonna be the first to hear it.
Buffalo Bill's Wild West show with the one and only Annie Oakley is breaking camp for a tour of Europe.
- Europe?
- That's right.
Why, Annie, you'll have kings and queens throwing their crowns in the air.
But right now, you're gonna help us celebrate.
Champagne for the boys, but for Annie Oakley, a big bottle of sarsaparilla.
- Come on, Annie.
- Would...
Would you mind very much if I didn't come to your party?
Why, no, no. Of course we wouldn't mind.
Come on, Bill.
I guess I'm just an old blundering fool.
- Your little hand. You must...
- My hand's all right.
- Come on. Good night, Annie.
- Good night.
Good night, missy.
What's this?
- Here.
- Gas.
- Chief!
- He's been shooting out the lights.
- Of all the unmitigated nerve...
- What happened to you?
All right, all right, all right.
Never mind, never mind.
Don't you worry. Don't you worry, Mac.
I'll pay all the damage.
The Chief can shoot up all the hotels he wants tonight.
We're celebrating, Mac. We're celebrating!
Annie, you're to be presented to the Czar and the Czarina.
Your Majesty, may I present to you Miss Oakley.
Annie, I'm afraid you just never will learn about crowned heads.
You're supposed to always take the gentleman's hand first, and kiss it, not shake it.
And I shook hands first with the Czarina.
Gosh, I suppose that was terrible.
No, no, you were just yourself.
That's why we all love you.
I love you all, too.
Colonel Cody and Mr. Buntline and Buck, Jim and Sam...
Hey, now, wait a minute.
What about a fellow named Hogarth?
You're first on the list, Jeff.
I thought you knew that.
First in the show or first everywhere?
Annie, I know I'm not your idea of something romantic, but I can't help it if I love you, if that counts for anything.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I see it all in the crystal ball.
Madam, I see a blonde villain hovering about you.
He seems to have designs on your future.
I see him pursuing you to Germany.
Annie, His Highness Crown Prince Wilhelm wants to ask you something.
Is it true, Fräulein Oakley, that you are able to shoot a cigarette from a person's mouth?
- Yes.
- Very well. You will shoot one from mine.
But kindly do not muss the Schnurrbart.
For heaven's sake, be careful, Annie.
This fellow has to be Kaiser some day.
Gosh, an inch the wrong way might change the history books.
Oh, gosh, that spring breeze smells wonderful.
Madam, do you realize that at this moment it's spring in New York, too?
- I was thinking of that.
- Yeah.
Just about this time a man named Anson's come on from Chicago and hit at least four home runs, the organ grinders are tuning up their hurdy-gurdies, the little girls are maypole dancing in Central Park, and the new bock beer is foaming at Luchow's.
Every time they broach a keg, Annie, they ring a gong.
That, my darling, is when you know it is spring.
Gosh. And down home in Ohio, the buds are coming out on the trees, and the bluebirds are wondering why they ever went away.
I guess spring is the time to make you think of far away and long ago.
It was spring the first time I went up to Cincinnati to shoot against...
Cheer up, Annie, you're not the only one who's homesick.
Why, dog my cats, in exactly two weeks and four days, the Buffalo Bill Wild West show will be putting on the dad-bustedest parade up Fifth Avenue that was ever gawked at by man or critter.
I'm leaving the show when we get to New York.
Annie.
Oh, I'm not happy, Jeff.
It's still Toby, isn't it?
I guess it's human nature to fight for anything we love, isn't it, Annie?
I guess so.
But we don't always win.
No, we don't always win.
Here's something I should have given you a long time ago.
Oh, I know what you must be thinking of me.
Oh, I'm only thinking of one thing, Jeff.
We've got to find him.
We will.
Step right up, ladies and gents, and take a lesson from the champ shot.
Never beat in any contest anywhere by any living man.
Say, Charlie, if the champ is such a razzmatazz, how come he don't never do no shooting?
It's the lamps, the lamps.
Holy gee! Annie Oakley.
Gosh, and the Buffalo Bill show is coming here next Monday.
Hey, mister, do you know Annie Oakley?
Son, I knew her way back when.
Sure, he knew them all.
Annie Oakley, Sarah Bernhardt,
Mrs. Astor's horse, Bessie...
Yeah, you...
Introducing a congress of the world's roughest riders.
First, a group of Sioux Indians.
Next, Crow Indians, Cherokees,
Cheyenne, Blackfeet and Arapaho.
Cowboys from Montana, from Wyoming, from Oklahoma Territory, from Colorado, from Dakota.
Mexicans from old Mexico,
Russian Cossacks from the steppes of Russia and the South American gauchos.
And a troop of the United States Cavalry.
And now, introducing Colonel W. F. Cody,
Buffalo Bill.
Well, dog my cats.
Annie, did you see that crowd?
Why, half of New York's out there tonight.
Do you think Toby might be out there?
Do you think he'd come?
Now, don't you worry about finding him, honey.
Today, your Uncle Jeff took it on himself to engage the Pinkertons to locate him.
Jeff, you're real.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure personally to introduce that little lady who has played before all the crowned heads of Europe, the greatest shooting star the world has ever known,
Annie Oakley.
Can I borrow your glasses?
Wild West, are you ready?
Poor Little Sure Shot. She's always so sad.
We present that world-famous, thrilling spectacle, the Indian attack on the Deadwood stage, featuring the one and only
Chief Sitting Bull.
Toby! Toby!
What's the matter? Couldn't you get in?
I saw all I wanted to see.
Well, that's fine.
Then you can help handle the trade, of which there ain't none.
Introducing an aggregation of the outstanding horsemen of the world, brought for your entertainment from the four corners of the earth.
Military riders, representative of all nations.
And last, the United States Cavalry.
Annie, I found Toby.
- Chief, where is he?
- Come quick.
I will take you.
Gee, Toby, did you honestly know Annie Oakley?
Did I know her?
Did he know her?
Six shots for a dime, ten cents.
Step up and try your luck over here.
Here, over here.
But, Toby, we ain't got no dime.
All right.
Here you are.
You kids can have three apiece.
But hurry up before the boss gets back.
Let's see you hit something for a change.
Annie!
Toby!
Gosh, it's her!
Did I know Annie Oakley?
English
Hey, this thing ain't working right.
It's working all right for me.
(Landlord) Mary! Mary Roberts!
Get busy now. Here he is again.
What's up with you?
Why aren't you helping Lola?
I'm sorry, sir, but the dishes...
Bother the dishes. You've got to help her make her changes.
- Yes, sir.
- Now get going.
Come on, get going, get going. Go on!
We want Lola! We want Lola!
Gentlemen, it's my aim to give you the best entertainment money can buy.
I've brought here at great expense...
Get a piece of fat and slide off!
Who said that?
All right, you'll get Lola.
Hurry, they're getting restless.
- I gotta look good.
- They shot at me!
- Aw, quit whining.
- Hurry!
If we ever get enough money, we'll leave this one-horse tank.
Come on, hurry.
- How do I look?
- Like a million.
# Say, I've been roamin' from Frisco to Maine
# Been huntin' a man that's not too tame
# He's gotta have somethin'
I need a lot
# Baby, dear, that's what you've got
# Will you be my lovey-dovey, my little honey man?
# We could bill and coo
- Baby!
- # The way all lovers do
# Will you be my ducky-wucky, my little sugar pie?
# Never make you blue
# I'd be so sweet to you... #
Say, Finn, you're a lucky skate, having a swell gal like Lola.
I certainly am...
What do you mean?
She's the lucky one, having a swell fellow like me.
- # Will you be my lovey-dovey
- That's me.
# My little honey man?
# I'm a little bit lonesome... #
Have you seen my husband?
Yeah, over there.
# Won't you be my ownsome
- # My little turtle dove... #
- Will I?!
Waiter, I want a big bottle of wine, right here!
Come on, this here's no good.
Sweetheart!
Oh!
Hi, Charley. Hiya, boys.
Oh!
Watch where you're going!
Hey, Ollie, look.
We're only two miles from town.
Well, I'll never make it.
I've got one foot in the grave now.
Hey, stop him.
Maybe we can get a ride.
I'll get my clothes on.
Hurry up.
Whoa! Whoa!
All right, mister. We're in.
Come on, Dinah. Come on.
Are you going to Brushwood Gulch?
Uh-huh.
We are, too.
A lot of weather we've been having lately.
Pretty.
It's only four months to Christmas.
Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Do you mind if I put my hand right here?
I saw her first. Come.
That's it.
Darling!
Not you! I meant my husband.
Have a nice trip, darling?
Lovely... until these two came aboard.
They've done nothing but annoy me all the way in.
Here, you run along home.
Goodbye.
Fiddlin', huh?
We don't like your kind around these parts.
And there's one thing we don't allow, and that's messin' with our women.
If you want to stay healthy, get the next coach out of town.
Yes, sir. We'll be glad to.
Just as soon as we've finished our business.
If you miss the next coach... you'll be riding out of here in a hearse.
- Good day, strangers.
- Good day, sir.
Goodbye.
Let well enough alone.

Howdy, gents. What'll it be?
Do you know the whereabouts of a lady named Mary Roberts?
(Bartender) Sure.
She's around here someplace.
I'm Miss Roberts' guardian.
What do you want to see her for?
We have some news for her.
What's it about?
I'm sorry, sir, but we're not supposed to discuss that.
It's private. Her father died and left her a goldmine.
We're not supposed to tell anyone but her.
Didn't we, Ollie?
- A goldmine?
- It's the biggest...
Now that he's taken you into our confidence, you might as well know the rest.
(Whispers ) We've got the deed to the property.
We have to give it to her in person.
What?
I said we've got the deed to the property and... Oh!
Say, you better show it to him.
Maybe he doesn't believe us.
It's the truth.
Say, did I give you the deed?
Oh, I know where it is.
Excuse me.
See? Mary Roberts.
Come here. Have you ever seen
Mary Roberts?
Good. I'll go and find her.
Don't tell a soul till I return.
- We won't.
- Thank you.
Good thing we found her.
Lola!
Lola, we've got a fortune right in the palm of our hand.
What?
There's men downstairs looking for Mary Roberts.
So?
They have a deed to a goldmine left to her by her father.
They're here to deliver it.
Well, ain't that just grand?
It would be if you were Mary Roberts.
Yeah, but I'd never get away with it.
Sure you would!
They've never seen her.
Then it's a cinch.
Put that shoe on properly.
- What's wrong?
- I can't eat that.
It's as tough as shoe leather.
- Think you can do it?
- Can I do it(?)
For a goldmine,
I'd be Cleopatra.
- That's the girl.
- Bring 'em up.
(Landlord) Hey!
- Come and meet Mary Roberts.
- Right away.
Did you call, Mr Finn?
Get back to the kitchen where you belong. Don't bother me.
This way, gentlemen.
Come right this way.
This way, gentlemen.
Sit down and I'll get Lola...
I mean Mary for you.
I've told her the news and she's terribly shocked.
- Lola, they're here.
- Swell, kiddo.
Put these in your arms.
Mary, these are the gentlemen
I was telling you about.
Tell me... Tell me about my dear, dear daddy.
Is it true that he's dead?
Well, we hope he is.
They buried him.
It can't be. What did he die of?
I think he died of a Tuesday.
Or was it Wednesday? Do you...?
I'll handle this delicate situation.
Little lady, you've heard the worst.
Now prepare yourself for the best.
Now, cheer up.
Smile. That's right.
Remember, every cloud has a silver lining.
That's right.
Any bird can build a nest, but not everyone can lay an egg, eh, Ollie?
That's right.
Do you know you own one of the richest goldmines in the world?
Your father left you the whole property.
And he gave me the honour of presenting you with the deed.
- Isn't it wonderful, Uncle?
- Yes, my dear.
Who's there?
- Mary.
- Mary who?
Mary... Merry Christmas.
Excuse me, Mr Finn.
One gentleman dropped this on the stairs.
Ooh, thank you, little lady.
You don't know what you've done.
All right. All right. All right.
There you are.
Signed, sealed and now... delivered.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.
Come, Stanley. We'd better go.
Oh, say. What about the locket?
- That's right...
- We've something else.
I almost forgot.
And besides that... your father left you this family heirloom.
Oh, yes. I remember it well.
Help me get it off, Stanley.
Am I hurting you?
No. Just a minute.
Won't be long.
Maybe I'd better try opening it again.
I think so.
(Whispers ) Slipped.
Maybe you'd better take your coat off.
Pardon me just a minute.
We'll find it in just a moment.
We got it.
I'll go in and change.
Pardon us.
- Say, Ollie?
- What?
Now that you're undressed, why not take a bath?
Would you mind leaving the room?
Can't I have a little privacy?
Just trying to kill two birds with one stone.
I'll take care of those bozos.
Don't worry, leave it to me.
I've done pretty good so far.
You certainly have.
I wish you were in my shoes.
- (Coughs ) How about a drink?
- That suits me fine.
- How did you dress so quick?
- None of your business.
Goodbye, and thanks for the use of your boudoir.
- You're very welcome.
- Goodbye.
Now you have the mine, you'll be a swell gold-digger.
Goodbye.
Why did you leave them?
You have her sign the deeds over to us.
You get those guys out of town now!
All right.
What a cinch.
Give the gentlemen the best in the house.
Yes, sir.
I'll be back in a minute.
# On a mountain in Virginia
# Stands a lonesome pine
# Just below is the cabin home
# Of a little girl of mine
# Her name is June and very, very soon
# She'll belong to me
# For I know she's waiting there for me
# 'Neath that lone pine tree
(In harmony ) # In the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pine
# In the pale moonshine, our hearts entwine
# Where she carved her name and I carved mine
# Oh, June, like the mountains I'm blue
# Like the pine
I'm lonesome for you-oh-oh-oh
# In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pine
(Bass voice ) # In the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pine
# In the pale moonshine, our hearts entwine
# Where she carved her name and I carved mine
# Oh, June, like the mountains I'm blue
# Like the pine
I am lonesome for you
(Sings soprano ) # In the Blue
Ridge Mountains of Virginia
# On the trail of the lonesome pi-ine #
That's fine.
Miss Lola, what is this for?
Er... Now whatever we do on your behalf is legal.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it. Now run right along with your work.
Well, here's looking at you.
Shoo!
- Well, I've got to be going.
- So have we.
- Goodbye, Mr Finn.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.
Have a good time.
- Goodbye, Miss, er...? Miss...?
- Roberts. Mary Roberts.
- Goodbye, Miss Roberts.
- Goodbye.
Did you hear what her name was?
Sure - Mary Roberts.
How can she be if we've just given the deed to Mary Roberts?
I don't know.
- I smell a rat.
- I smell something, too.
Come on.
Pardon me.
Did you ever have a father called Sy Roberts?
Why, yes. He left me with these people when he went prospecting.
Who's that woman upstairs?
Lola Marcel. Mr Finn's wife.
She's my legal guardian now.
Can I speak to you?
- Pardon us.
- We'll be right back.
You know what?
I think we've given that deed to the wrong woman.
Our first mistake since that guy sold us the Brooklyn Bridge.
That was no mistake. It'll be worth a lot of money some day.
Maybe you're right.
Let's get the deed.
Say, maybe they won't give it back to us?
What do you mean?
We'll get that deed or I'll eat your hat.
That's what
I call determination.
Come on.
Splendid! Splendid!
She fell for it like you fell for me.
Lola, my girl, we're sittin' pretty.
- Who's there?
- Me.
- Me who?
- Me who(!)
What do you want?
Out of my way, you snake in the grass!
You toad in the hole.
Say, what do ya mean bustin' in here like this?
We want to know why you're not Mary Roberts.
I'll take care of this.
So, you got wise?
If it's this deed you're after, you're out of luck.
Take it, Stan. Beat it!
That's it. There you are!
Ow! Ow! AAAH!
AAAH!
That's it!
Get it, Stan! Get it!
Go on, get it! Go on, Stan!
Go on and get it, Stan!
Give me that deed.
Get away! Get away!
Why don't you...?
Give me that!
Go on, get it.
Get away from that door!
Get away from it!
Now, you stop.
Stop!
Back! Steady. Get back.
(Squeals) Ollie, come and get...
Don't you touch that!
Stop! Ooh, you're tickling!
Not yet! Not yet!
Stay where you are. Don't move!
Ah-ha!
Ho-ho!
Hee-hee!
Here, Stan, take it!
I can't stand it!
Now, get 'em outta here.
(Finn ) Get out!
Now! Get out!
- Who's there?
- The Sheriff.
Just in the nick of time.
Now we'll get justice.
Sheriff, you're just the man
I'm looking for.
And you're just the man
I'M looking for.
Thank you. This man... Oh.
I thought I told you two dudes to catch the next coach.
Yes, sir.
It left ten minutes ago.
It did? Maybe we'd better try and catch it.
I'll say you better!
- Look at them go!
- You can't see them for dust.
- Say, Ollie?
- What?
Are we taking a chance going back and robbing that safe?
Chance or no chance, we're getting that deed back.
As soon as my clothes are dry, that's exactly what we'll do.
That's a good idea.
If that girl ever found out...
Give me a light.
Those matches are soaking wet.
Thank you.
See if my clothes are dry.
Your hat's dry.
That reminds me, you made a statement this afternoon.
Did I?
You said if we didn't get the deed, you'd eat my hat.
Now you're taking me illiterally.
Nevertheless, I'm going to teach you not to make rash promises.
Eat the hat.
That's silly. Who ever heard of anybody eating a hat?
Who ever heard of anybody doing that?
- Eat the hat.
- I won't do it.
If you don't,
I'll tie you to a tree and let the buzzards get you.
- Would you really?
- I certainly would.
(Squeaks ) I never ate a hat.
Eat it.
Get my clothes.
Ow!
Shh!
(Whispers ) Wait a minute.
I'll help you.
What did you push me in there like that for?
You're the dumbest thing
I ever saw.
(Whispers ) Hey, hey,
I've got an idea.
Why don't we climb on the shed, get on the balcony and go in there to save us going in the front?
Now, that deserves consideration.
Hey! Psst! Psst!
Hey, Ollie! Psst!
Are you all right? Psst!
Wait. I'll get a ladder for you.
Won't be a minute. Shh!
I'm going to get a ladder for him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
We'll follow our original plan and go through the front.
Now, go ahead.
Do you mind if I have another idea?
If it's anything like the last one, yes. What is it?
How about me pulling you up on the block and tackle?
What are you doing out here?
There's something wrong...
Yes, it's you. Come back to bed.
Scaring me to death...
Here, hold that.
Now, are you all ready?
Upsadaisy.
Now, don't get fancy.
Just get me up there.
Wait till I spit on my hands.
All right... No!
Upsadaisy.
I'll spit on 'em again to make sure.
Uh!
Hand me the end of that rope.
Now hold out your hand.
Hold out your hand.
This one.
Now tie that on the mule.
Tie that on the mule.
Get on the mule.
Get on the mule.
Hey!
- Where are the tools?
- In the saddlebag.
Hand them to me.
OK.
I'll be right over.
Aaaaah!
What are you trying to do?
Get the mule down.
Not now.
We'll attend to that later.
- Maybe we can get in here.
- Good idea.
- Shh!
- Shh!
- Wait there. We'll be right up.
- Shh!
What's the matter?
- Stop laughing in your sleep.
- I'm not.
I'd know your laugh anywhere.
Go to sleep!
Keeping me awake all night like this...
Psst!
Shh!
(Ollie ) Ow!
What are you doing here?
As soon as I get out of here,
I'll explain.
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing?
Hide me! Hide me!
(Finn ) What's that noise down there?
(Finn ) Answer me!
Mary!
No! You must hide.
(Finn ) Mary, what's going on down there? What's that noise?
Why are you roaming around this late?
- Mr Finn, I...
- You...
Get back to bed and not another peep out of you.
The idea.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Shh!
Please, what are you doing here?
Come in and I'll tell you all about it.
- Ollie.
- What?
Wait there.
I'll be right back. Shh!
You put on your clothes and we'll see you later. Shh!
Ooh!
- Where have you been?
- I told Mary what happened.
When you get the deed, she'll leave with us.
Good. Where is she now?
She's getting dressed.
She'll meet us outside.
Fine. Now get me out of this.
OK.
Take it easy, now.
You can't...
You can't do it that way.
Take it easy. Shh!
Maybe I can pull you all the way through.
Let go, you're choking...
Oh, me apple!
Are you all right?
Oh!
What did you go and do that for?
Well, I didn't know...
Shh!
(Finn ) Mary!
What are you doing down there?
What's going on?
(Finn ) Mary! Mary!
(Finn ) Mary!
(Finn ) Mary!
Will you move over?
Aaah! Oh!
Give me that gun!
Put up your hands! Not you!
- What are you doing?
- Getting those deeds back.
- You can't do that!
- Go on! Go on!
Get in that room. Go on!
Open the safe and get the deed.
Hurry up.
Get back in that room. Go on.
Now give us that deed.
Come on, take it, Stan.
Get in there and get to bed.
- I-I-I...
- Go on! Shut up!
You can't get away...
- Get in bed.
- I'll fix you.
Tie him up.
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.
- Stop that. You can't do that!
- Shut up. Shut up.
You can't.
I'll get you for this.
Go and get Dinah.
I'll take care of him.
Let me out of this.
Let me go. You can't do that.
Stop that. Let me down.
Let me outta here.
What are you going to do?
I'll get you for this. Let me go! Let me go! Help! Lola!
Lola! Lola! Lola! Lola!
Help me, Lola!
Oh!
Hey, come back here! Come back!
Come back! Come back!
Let me out!
Stop! Come back here!
Now our troubles are over, where do we go from here?
I'd like to return to my hometown.
- Where's that?
- Way down south.
- You're from the South?
- Sure am.
Well, fan my brow!
I'm from the South.
You are?
Well, shut my mouth!
I is from the South, too.
South of what, sir?
The south of London.
London! Well, honey, we'll all go down to Dixie.
Oh, for a slice of possum and yam. Ooh!
Yes, sir, and some good ol' fish and chips.
Fish and chips(!)
# We're going to go, we're going to go
# We're going to go way down in Dixie

THE EMPEROR OF CALIFORNIA
THE HEROIC FATE OF
JOHN AUGUST SUTTER
John A. Sutter was born in the
small town Kandern in Baden, Germany.
At the age of 1 6 he moved to Switzerland
and later became a Swiss citizen.
This settler of
almost legendary stature,
as well as the memory of his
court case against the United States,
are still alive in the American West
and inseparably linked to the
historic development of California.
This screenplay was loosely based
on existing documents
and the locations were chosen
at the discretion of the production.
GERMAN BROTHERS!
The spirit of Napoleon is about!
Our fatherland is torn!
I got startled.
- Because of me?
No, just because.
Look.
"He who fights tyrants is holy, he who
tames arrogance serves the Lord. "
"The Lord only dwells in proud hearts
and Heaven is too high for low desires. "
Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. Did you write it?
No, it was written by a certain
Ernst Moritz Arndt.
We'll hang them all over town.
The things you print don't bring in money. No wonder we're in debt.
They're spying on you everywhere.
You're sacrificing too much.
- So do others.
As a reputable person,
I can't act any differently these days.
The police!
I think they're coming here.
Good day.
Is Mr. Sutter home?
He's in the workshop.
What do you want from him?
There he is.
Did you print this inflammatory pamphlet?
Inflammatory?
- Yes, inflammatory!
"German brothers!
The spirit of Napoleon is about. "
"Our fatherland..."
- I know the text well.
What do you have to say?
- Nothing.
Except that every word is true.
And that you think the same as I do!
- Pardon, I'm just a civil servant and don't talk about politics.
We simply have the order to confiscate the machine and arrest you.
Here's the arrest warrant.
Christ Almighty!
Stop! Guards!
Oh my God!
Did you see Sutter?
- He didn't come this way.
Commence the pursuit.
Shoot if necessary.
Don't drive him to despair.
You can't just shoot him down!
Constable, I must admit, we have orders to arrest him, but not to shoot at him.
He'll come back.
He has to.
He has no choice, no other place to go.
Yes. It will be better to take care of this case discreetly.
Worries, my dear Sutter?
Nothing left of your bold plans, but to leap from this tower?
What do you want from me?
Who are you?
Don't be afraid.
Only he who gives up on himself is lost.
The Lord only dwells in proud hearts and Heaven is too high for low desires.
Don't pester me with sayings!
You can serve your people anywhere.
You can fight anywhere.
Look.
Isn't the world beautiful?
Isn't it immense?
Magnificent!
Tremendous!
Immeasurably rich.
The oceans vast.
The world has room for all.
Go out and conquer it, if you have the courage!
Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Amen.
Make a nice cross.
Very good.
Now sleep tight.
It's still so early, Mommy.
Hurry!
You have to leave right away.
I'll pack your things.
Anna, have faith.
God willing, we'll see each other again soon.
Yes, I have faith.
And I love you.
270 going once!
- 280 going once, going twice...
- 290 going once, going twice and...
- 300 going once, going twice and...
Top-quality furs!
300 going once, going twice, going three times. Sold!
Hey-ho! 5000!
Hey-ho!
Ermattinger, where've you been?
- Mississippi.
Damn!
I'll buy you a drink!
Two whiskeys!
- That guy's on top of things.
Remember how he showed up here six months ago with a borrowed nag and a rusty shotgun?
I won't be staying here much longer.
Hey, Willy, where's our whiskey?
- Please pay first, guys.
Nice try.
You hear it everywhere: west, west, west, west.
That's all I've heard for two years now!
They say it's like paradise there and that the wheat ripens three times a year.
We should really get to know that guy.
Do you know the way there?
- I know it to Santa Fe, but not any further.
And to Santa Fe it's already 2000 miles.
So, it's 2000 miles to Santa Fe, then 1 000 miles to the coast.
That's 3000 miles, right?
That means... about one year in the saddle, huh?
Good horses... and hard asses!
What's keeping us here, Ermattinger?
You coming?
With you I'd go all the way to hell!
Bravo! We're going!
- Cheers!
How about three clever Wild West men as companions?
Five men are better than two.
He could supply you with your own travel money!
Do you know him?
Captain, when are you leaving?
None of your business.
Concentrate on mixing less water in your whiskey.
There's their tracks.
They went that way.
Onward!
There they are.
Three riders are coming.
I bet it's Harper.
Hello, boys!
Hello, Harper.
Nice coincidence meeting you here.
Indeed, a lucky coincidence!
You must have ridden real hard.
We had to, to be able to eat that soup with you.
Sit down and join us.
Ermattinger, wake up!
You fell asleep.
What's wrong?
They're gone.
The horses and money are gone.
What a mess.
Damn it!
That hasn't happened to me in 20 years.
This neither, huh?
No!
I guess that the three gentlemen will have to walk now, huh?
Shut up!
Move on!
Carrying a saddle is silly.
Three, four, five.
Eight. And ten.
Twelve, fourteen, sixteen.
Indians, by golly!
Quick!
Damn bastards!
Is it bad?
- No, just a shoulder wound.
Indians are tough.
Horse thieves!
Crooks!
Move on now!
Leave me behind.
Go on alone.
Stay with him.
- Okay.
I'll try to find water.
Or all three of us will die.
I never thought we'd get out of that hell.
California must be a sham.
Our situation is just as bad as yours.
My caravan is completely lost.
But you can help each other.
You're over 30 people!
Who are starving and thirsty.
They won't go one step further.
But there's mountains, Marshall.
So there's got to be water, too!
Because of those damn mountains we haven't reached our goal.
We have to find a way out of here!
Give me a horse.
I'd like to ride up there!
Take my horse, Sutter.
Thanks, Marshall.
Good-bye.
I'll find a way out.
You can rely on me.
Here's some water.
Thank you.
Good-bye everyone.
- Good-bye!
Good luck, Captain.
California!
Heaven!
I like it here!
We're staying here.
- What did you say?
Get down and take a look.
Look at this soil.
It's like bread.
It's the same dirt everywhere.
The soil is surely good here.
But I'll eat Mexican spores, if the soil isn't just as good by the ocean.
But do you want to have to tip your hat to others all the time?
But do you want to have to tip your hat to others all the time?
I think we'd all prefer to live in a place where we can leave our hats on as we please, huh?
I suppose you're right.
- You bet I am.
We would like to stay with you, if you have use for us.
Thanks. We'll ride to the governor in Monterey to get land.
And I hope we'll all get along well in the future.
Give me the land on the upper Sacramento and I'll turn it into paradise!
You'll die of thirst.
- I'll get water from the mountains!
The sun will kill you.
- I'll plant trees.
The Indians will scalp you.
- They'll be our friends.
You have big plans.
Goals can never be too big!
- Right.
Okay, I'll give you one square mile to start with.
Governor!
I traveled 8000 miles to get here.
Almost died of hunger and thirst!
I had a garden at home as well!
We need soil. Land!
- What do you mean by "land"?
His demands aren't very modest.
Who cares about modesty.
I came here to propose...
I wonder what Sutter is doing up there?
- He's fine.
The longer he stays up there, the more he'll achieve.
Besides, I'm sitting on an ant hill.
Governor, you know my opinion.
I have nothing more to add.
- Okay.
So...
Cultivate as much land up there as you can.
I give it to you provisionally for ten years.
We'll see what you do with the desert.
- Thank you.
How will you start?
- The way God created Earth: from the beginning!
Look at this.
It's like gold.
Remember what you said when we started?
You mean me?
- Yeah, you!
You said,
"It's the same dirt everywhere."
Where's the Marshall?
- Over here!
Hopkins, come on over here!
So now... everyone take a close look.
Starting at the San Francisco coast, we'll build a road directly along the Sacramento River up to Sutter's Fort.
Then we'll continue over the American River past Hock Farm to the Coloma saw mill.
Then we'll have a connection from Coloma through our fields to the ocean.
What is this Hock Farm?
- I'm building it near the Coloma woods.
It'll be special.
- How so?
Do you know who it's for?
- No.
It's for my wife and my two boys.
Are they coming now?
I want them to come, but it's still too early. - Why?
We don't know if we can stay here.
The land is just leased.
I want to be a landowner, not a leaseholder, when she comes.
Immigration must be stopped, Governor.
That German is bringing in too many foreigners.
San Francisco is almost a city!
We have room for many more.
Sutter's people are hard-working, honest farmers who are of benefit to us.
So you will continue to tolerate his growing power and let this foreigner act like the "Emperor of California"?
I'm having Sutter's tenure papers signed by the President.
He deserves it, after all.
- What?
You're going to bestow him the land?
The best part of California?
That he cultivated!
- Governor!
I'm warning you.
And let me tell you that all my work will be focused on...
- Your "work"!
If you want see a man working, then take a look at Sutter.
In the name of the almighty Lord, we, Antonio Lopez Santa Anna,
President of the Mexican Republic, by the authority rested in us, have resolved the following:
"We thank Captain John August Sutter
for his beneficial activities
for our country
and grant him the estates cultivated
by him north of the Sacramento
as permanent and inheritable property. "
This makes you one of the richest men in California.
We are proud of you, Captain Sutter.
I thank you, Governor.
And I hereby solemnly promise to continue to serve this blessed land with all my power.
This land has become a new home for me and for many others.
Long live California!
Thank him for the new school.
We are proud to have such a townsman.
I always said that
Sutter is a great guy.
I'm sorry that back then...
Well, have a nice trip.
Send him regards from
Police Council Friedel.
Send Sutter my regards.
Come on, boys!
Mrs. Sutter, we have to go.
Don't cry, Mother.
- I'll be praying that you're alright.
Farewell.
- Oh, Mother.
Mother!
PROCLAMATION
U. S. Citizens!
The Union government
has occupied California,
which had been agitated
by rebellion and civil war.
California has now joined the union
of the United States of America.
Peace has been restored.
The ditch is almost done.
- Where are you from?
From Eimsbüttel.
- Really?
Cigars?
Where are you from?
- I'm Italian.
Good day, Sutter!
- Hello!
Where are you from?
- I'm Swiss.
Where are you from?
- From Bern.
And you?
- Partenkirchen.
Listen to what I have to say.
When you finish here with the saw mill, go tell Marshall where you want to settle.
By the ocean or up here.
There's plenty of land.
Now continue working.
Good-bye!
Now continue working.
Good-bye!
Soon we can build as many ships and storehouses as we want.
It's got to be a land full of happy people.
I'll do my bit.
I know I can count on you.
Are you alone?
- Yes.
What's wrong?
- No one's here?
We're alone, damn it.
What's wrong?
Here.
Look.
Do you know what this is?
It's pure solid gold.
Yes, Captain.
Gold.
Pure gold, huh!
Where did you find it?
- Near Coloma, in the riverbed.
Is there more?
- As much as you want.
You just have to pick it up.
What's your plan?
- To stop working for you.
I'll dig for gold.
Stake claims.
I've already marked my land.
Overnight I've become the world's richest man!
Marshall, be reasonable!
These are just a few gold nuggets.
A few gold nuggets!
Do you know what this means?
You can buy everything with them!
You can buy America,
California, everything!
Yes!
- That's what the gold means!
Scream it out about the gold!
Tomorrow the workers will know and then the whole country.
Our people will run off.
The riffraff, rogues and tramps of the world will come here.
There'll be murder and theft because of your gold.
Go ahead and preach all you want!
I'm riding to San Francisco to get horses, wagons and food.
Or the others will take what's mine!
Mine!
Stop, or I'll shoot you down!
You're staying until we come to an agreement.
Swear to me that you'll shut up about the gold and not tell anyone until I say so.
Even if it takes five years!
- Five years? That's crazy!
I found it!
The gold belongs to me, not you!
The land belongs to me!
And that means everything that's in it and on it. That's the law.
Marshall, come on!
If we would've behaved like this in the desert, we'd both be dead.
Think about it.
Be reasonable!
You decide!
- Put your gun down first.
We're old friends, after all.
I admit... that you're not completely wrong.
Thank God.
I knew you were a decent fellow.
Let's drink a glass of wine and calmly think about what needs to be done.
Gold is no simple matter.
Calmly or not, he who acts fast, gets rich.
A bottle of whiskey!
So, how are things for you up there in Coloma?
Is the mill running?
- Better than that.
What?
- Can you give me change?
From where?
- Coloma. Sutter's land.
Is there more?
- As much as you want.
Something's going on.
He has gold.
Here. Look.
It's gold.
- My God!
Working for Sutter is over.
A new life begins.
I need horses, wagon, food.
Are you in?
- I'm in! Let's get the gold!
Gold! Gold!
What are you doing?
Get back to work.
Panning gold is better than sawing boards.
Damned lowlifes!
Damn it!
You're here to work, not to pan gold!
Get away!
Hurry up!
Get back to work, you dawdlers!
Damn it, have you all lost your mind?
Has the gold already gone to your head?
Turned you into crooks?
- We want our share! We want gold!
Sutter!
Get out of here!
Look, gold can't conjure up bread from the ground.
And gold never made anyone happy for long.
I tell you, gold only brings disaster and ruin!
He wants to keep the gold for himself!
We want our share, too.
- Naturally.
You will all get your fair share of the gold.
But you can't forsake me just now!
And what's our reward?
Working is more important than gold.
Please listen to me!
Gold-hungry men from all over will be here soon.
They'll rob you of your gold and your bread.
We were always good friends.
Don't we want to stay good friends?
Hey, Sutter.
Are you done now?
Hey! Hola!
Why are you still here?
Let's head to Coloma to where the gold is!
Twenty-five.
Twenty-five.
Here.
Twenty-five and a half.
Twenty-five and a half.
Twenty-three and a half.
Wait, that's not enough.
Twenty-three...
- Wait a minute!
Not one cent more.
I've been looking, but I think I won't recognize him anymore.
Do you see him?
- No.
But he has to be here, by golly.
Wait here for a moment.
I'll go see what's going on.
Hello!
Have you seen any of Sutter's men?
Sutter's men?
- Who knows if he even still has men.
You can't cut off my credit just now.
I've fought too hard for this land.
I can't pay back the money.
I don't have any.
What will you do?
- Keep working.
You don't have men.
- I'll get more.
They'll run away.
- Not all of them!
There's no point. It's unprofitable.
- At first maybe.
But not in the long run.
In 20 years there'll be nothing left of the gold rush, while my fields will still bear crops.
Let's stick to the facts, Mr. Sutter.
Most of your land is ravaged and out of your control.
You have one last chance.
Join one of our gold syndicates with the rest of your land.
The choice is yours.
Either you participate in the greatest business venture ever or the chance will pass you by and you die as a poor man.
I understand.
"The greatest business venture ever."
And if Sutter doesn't comply, you'll wring his neck.
That's no doubt the easiest way to take his land and get the gold mines cheaply.
But...
I won't give up my land!
As you wish.
But then you have to pay your debts within two months.
Or your land will be auctioned off.
This means you want to ruin me.
Gold is now more profitable than my work.
Basically, you're just the same thieves and robbers as the crooks who are ravaging and stealing my land.
But the law's on my side!
And I'll defend it until my last breath.
Anna.
I wasn't even at the ship.
I'm so happy.
One can see you had a good mother.
Our Father, who are in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Haven't heard that for a long time.
- Yes, real long.
Wine?
- Yes, please.
EMIL AND RUDOLF SUTTER
How did you get up here?
- We got a ride in a wagon.
Oh yeah?
And who allowed you to steal?
We're not stealing.
- It all our father's.
Right.
Good evening.
Can I help you?
Someone's waiting.
You should go downstairs.
Who's waiting?
Tell him to come up.
What is that?
Oh my God.
What happened?
No!
No!
Oh, yes! Bye-bye!
Who would have ever thought?
Oh, boy from Arizona,
your money isn't tight!
And that is why Lona
will stay with you all night!
Hello, boys.
Hello, boys.
- Hello!
Hello, Harper.
- Hello, Marshall.
Oh, boy from Arizona,
are your pockets full...
Hey, you!
You just sold some land.
Will you pay me back if Sutter wins the trial?
Not one cent!
- What?
Everyone bought and sold things.
San Francisco was created that way.
Those idiots in the Senate want to honor him tomorrow at the celebration of the founding of the city.
What if he wins his trial?
They say the ruling is against us.
- If Sutter wins, all is lost.
There are 50,000 of us.
We'll deal with the verdict.
And what if he wins?
- And doesn't give in? He'll be lynched.
We won't have to lift a finger.
They even want to appoint him general.
They even want to appoint him general.
A general!
He wants to clear the gold fields and chase the prospectors away!
He wants San Francisco back.
He might even sue us!
Actually, he's right.
All his land was just taken from him.
And he lost his two boys and his wife.
- Shut up, damn Sutter agent!
And? What happens if the verdict is against you tomorrow?
Then San Francisco will burn.
Then Hock Farm will burn.
Then we'll clean up here.
Oh yes, my friend,
isn't that just great?
Sutter!
Dear townspeople and distinguished guests...
Today we are celebrating the 1 0th anniversary of our city.
Ten years ago a man came over the mountains and set up a small trading post here.
He ploughed the first furrows up in the hills.
He built our first roads.
From the desert sand, he produced the first Californian wine.
John August Sutter.
He gave bread and work to thousands.
And to thousands more he gave happiness and a new home.
In appreciation of your services,
I appoint you, John August Sutter,
Senator of the State of California on behalf my government.
Senator, on behalf of the U.S. government
I present you with this saber, and inform you of your appointment as general of the U.S. Army.
Long live General Sutter!
The verdict!
Order!
Order!
- We want the verdict!
Order! The Chief Justice of California has the floor.
Dear citizens,
General, the Supreme Court has passed a verdict in the case Sutter vs. the state and the cities of San Francisco,
Fairfield, Sutterville and Venetia.
With the greatest objectivity and much detail, the courts have attempted to resolve the situation and have decided as follows:
The Supreme Court recognizes the legitimacy of John August Sutter's claims.
Order! The Court recognizes his lawful possession and the inviolability of his estates.
The cities of
San Francisco and Fairfield are obliged...
Down with him!
- Damn him!
Order!
Or I'll have the military clear the room!
In effect...
...the decision is only a formal one.
The Supreme Court merely recognizes his right in principle.
For it to be legally effective...
Down with Sutter!
...the U.S. Congress must confirm it.
Say something or there'll be mayhem!
- I have nothing to say.
Say that you'll be satisfied with the formal judgment and will waive all your claims.
I insist on having my rights.
I don't want a formal judgment.
I demand the immediate return of all estates on which San Francisco,
Fairfield and Stockton were built without my consent!
Hang the bastard!
I demand that the gold mines be vacated immediately!
And that all prospectors be removed from my land!
I will not give up!
Halt!
Listen to me!
Sutter's brood must be destroyed!
Exterminate them!
Sutter!
Quick, to Hock Farm!
The city's burning!
Sutter's storehouses are in flames.
- There's his verdict.
San Francisco is burning!
Shut up!
Let it burn.
What have you done?
- It was you... It was you...
Everything's burning...
It was you...
Hang him!
To hell with his title deeds!
Hello, Sutter.
We know each other.
Now your travels are over.
Why are you still fighting against the gold and for your rights?
You can't stop the wheel from turning.
Look!
The human race is triumphing over everything.
Look at the splendor of the cities.
The eternally pulsating power of the machines.
Wealth and blessings.
Who can say what's right or wrong?
Be satisfied.
You have served the world in your way.
Your heart will beat forever in the forests and rivers of California.

<b>THE OKLAHOMA KID</b>
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>
The gentlemen of the press, Mr.
President.
Good. Let them come in.
President Cleveland will receive you now, gentlemen.
Gentlemen,
I'm at your service.
Mr. Cleveland, we'd like to know what you're going to do about the Indian appropriations bill.
During my previous term in office,
I was opposed of the opening of any Oklahoma territory to white settlement because I felt the terms were unfair to the Indians.
The cherokee strip contains 6 million acres of the finest farming land in America.
It is our last free frontier.
It's 180 miles long and 50 miles wide, but both houses have now approved the measure, and since I happen to believe that the will of the people is properly expressed through the congress,
I will sign the bill, and I'm issuing this proclamation.
That's it, boys. They pay off the injuns, and we move in!
Get that cherokee silver, Joe. We're in.
Right.
Who'll sign for this money?
I will.
Hear that stuff clink when they set it down?
Yeah. I kind of like that sound.
Good luck.
All right, throw down those guns. Get 'em up.
Now fork over those moneybags.
Unhook this lead horse.
All right. Come on.
Come on. Get up.
Hey! Hey!
Whip, it's a holdup!
All right, get cover, boys!
Come here.
I've had time to survey the whole cherokee strip, and as most of you know, the section we've chosen is perfect for a town site.
It's flat, and there's plenty of water.
The Texas cattle trails run down through here, and the sante fe railroad can build their line down here from Wichita.
And they will build it, too.
We'll give them a decent town and decent trade.
All around are thousands of acres of the richest land in Oklahoma, and it'll all be peopled by this time tomorrow...
Folks that will need doctors, lawyers, merchants.
It's a new start for all of us, but it's going to mean a lot of hard work, and it's going to mean sticking together for the common good, and it's going to mean getting there first tomorrow.
Now, there may be some trouble because I've been watched and trailed by men who probably aim to beat us to our town site, but they won't, for when that shot is fired, my son and I, with our fastest riders, will race across prairies and stake a claim.
The rest of you can follow with wagons and camp equipment.
Now, is that clear?
Yeah.
All right, then.
Good luck to everybody.
Let's take a look at that map.
John, you know
I envy you.
It's a great plan. I wish
I could be with you.
You will be later, judge.
Pop's counting on you bringing law into this territory, judge.
That's going to be some job, judging from the scum of the west I've seen drifting in here.
Won't be too big a job for you, dad.
You think one poor old judge can make the whole robber's roost behave?
If anybody can.
Seems I've raised an optimist, ned.
Come on, John.
There'll be a lot of changes in our lives after tomorrow.
First, you'll be riding circuit with your father, and I'll be helping to start a new town.
Aren't you thrilled?
I would be if it didn't mean us being separated.
Tulsa will spring up overnight, ned, and we'll soon be settled there with father holding court and sending dangerous outlaws to jail.
I soon as I get there,
I'm going to claim the most beautiful spot of all for us.
Ned, isn't it wonderful?
A whole new life ahead of us, a whole new city, and soon a new state, and it all begins tomorrow.
Get your partners for a dance!
Ned, let's dance.
One more couple right over there.
That's it.
Well, here we go!
Salute your partner.
Forward dance, swing on the right.
Swing on the left.
Hold the man proud and tall, and swing him round.
And forward and back, swing on the right, now on the left.
First lady and last gent, forward dance.
Do-si-do.
The next lady and the last gent, forward dance.
Do-si-do.
Now, then...
All join hands and circle to the center.
Grab right, then left.
When you reach your partner, everybody swing to the right.
Now to the left.
Have...Have you seen who's here?
Take her to your arms and swing her all around.
Who's the stranger with Jane?
I wouldn't know.
How'd we get in here?
Well, I don't know.
Beautiful night, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Just feel that air.
Feel that air. Go on.
What?
Feel that air. It's like velvet, isn't it?
What's the matter with you?
Can we go, darling?
So soon? Let's stay a little longer.
Hello, ned.
Surprised?
Hardly. I expected you to show up sooner or later.
You know each other?
Yes, but ned's a very funny kind of fellow.
Doesn't like to admit it.
Your father's waiting for us.
Wait a minute. I haven't thanked the lady for the dance.
Thank you, milady.
May I look forward to again being favored next time we meet?
You're a lunatic.
'S crazy.
Did ask you to feel the air?
Why, yes. Who is?
Someone I'd like to forget.
But I told you, we ain't got no rooms left.
I didn't ask you that.
I asked you which was the best room in the house.
Number 6, and there's about 18 boomers sleeping in it right now.
But that's our room.
I told you we couldn't hold nothing, miss.
I told you, you had to sit in it to keep it.
The town's overrun with boomers, and if you ain't there, they are.
What's this about our room?
I told you we couldn't hold nothing.
I'd be glad to let you have my room, ma'am.
Well, that's very kind of you.
Thank you, but we couldn't put you out.
Wouldn't be putting me out.
Just a minute. What room do you think you have?
Number 6, and you're very welcome to it.
See here. I told you who was in number 6...
About 18 boomers sleeping on the floor, 3 deep.
That's all right. They'd be glad to do a favor for a lady.
That's awfully generous of you, but I really don't know how to thank you.
Not another word.
Just leave it to me.
Hey, what's going on here?
Come on, you mavericks!
On your feet!
The land rush is on!
Come on!
They've fired the starting gun! Come on!
'S taking me home to his house.
The soldiers are all bunched on the immigrant line, but on the other side of the creek, they begin thinning out to one soldier every 50 yards.
Two.
We can slip through there tonight and be on the inside, waiting for them.
What about this
"sooner" law?
Once we've staked out a claim, they can't prove a thing.
Well, what are we waiting for?
We're waiting for the line to thin out so we can slip through.
Bet $10.
That's brand-new money.
Where'd you get it, mister?
Minted it myself this morning.
Well, aces always beat kings.
Whip, I just seen one of the fellas that took that
Indian money off us.
Yeah? You sure?
'S playing with a lot of new-minted money.
Play that for me, will you?
Sure.
Where is?
That little fellow over there with the piano.
Say, do you know, I don't want to play in your yard?
They don't want that tonight.
Play it.
Not tonight, brother.
Play it.
Sure, that's one of my favorites.
Yeah, it would be. You know who that is?
No.
That's the Oklahoma kid.
Handley.
Tell that little squirt over by the piano
I want to see him.
Put it away, handley.
Kid, I want to talk to you.
Keep on playing.
I said I want to talk to you.
Well, go ahead and talk.
My name's whip mccord.
That mean anything to you?
How's that?
Mccord.
Mccord, mccord, mccord....
I don't like it.
Do you?
I want that
Indian money.
Well, go and get it from the Indians.
Kid, I'm giving you a break
'cause I'm pressed for time.
Don't you raise that bottle at me!
Give me that bottle!
Go on.
Get over there.
Get over.
That's a boy.
Play, professor.
Hi, sheriff. I'm glad you got here.
What's it about, mccord?
You looking for the man that held up the stagecoach and got that
Indian money?
Naturally. What's that got to do with it?
That's him just left here.
I called him on it, and started shooting.
How'd you know him?
How else would a man get new-minted money?
'S been spreading it all around the joint.
That's right.
We all seen him.
Who was?
The Oklahoma kid.
The Oklahoma kid, yeah.
Let me take a look at that silver.
I'll show you.
Let's compare watches, captain.
Here's ned.
Hey there!
Well, how are you, judge?
Get there first, ned.
We will, and don't be too long coming to our city.
Get it built first.
It's almost time to sound the warning signal.
Sound the attention.
Good-bye, ned, and good luck to you.
You're my good luck.
Bye!
Come on, ned.
Starting gun goes off in 5 minutes, boys.
Wait a minute, pop.
Wait a minute.
What's your best whiskey?
Kentucky bourbon,
11 years old.
I'll try some of your bar whiskey.
Want to catch that stampede?
Go ahead.
I'll hold down the bar.
Thanks. Have a drink on the house.
Squad, ready.
Squad, fire!
Hello, young fella.
Never got to thank you for the rooms.
Don't mention it.
Where's the bartender?
Outside watching the rush, I suppose.
It was a great sight, wasn't it?
I don't know.
I didn't see it.
You didn't see it?
No. I thought I'd have me a quiet little drink instead.
What'll you have? I'll serve you. It's on the house.
Here, try some of this uncut moonshine.
Got some taste to it.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
How come a strong, healthy young fellow like you isn't out there up to his neck in this land rush?
Why? I'm doing all right.
Those people are going out there to build a new empire.
Fine.
Let them have it.
You mean to say you've got no feeling for the country, no pride in seeing a civilization carved out of a wilderness?
What sort of an American are you?
I like the country fine.
As for civilization, I've got nothing in particular against it.
I can take it or leave it alone.
What sort of folks did you come from?
The most god-fearing, law-abiding, land-grabbing, empire-building fellas you ever saw.
Suckers for this land-rush stuff, too, but not for me.
I crave a nice easygoing existence, and I've got it.
I see. No responsibility.
No ambition.
None of this get-up- and-get-it stuff that regular folks have.
Exactly, and that's why my folks and
I have been on the outs for years.
You seem like a very antisocial young man.
But I'm not. I'm as social as a setter pup.
I like all kinds of people, but I don't take to this itch for plowing up new empires, that's all.
But why not?
I'll tell you why not.
Now, look.
In the first place...
The white people steal the land from the Indians, right?
They get paid for it, don't they?
Paid for it?
Yeah.
A measly
$1.40 an acre, price agreed to at the point of a gun.
Then the immigrants sweat and strain and break their hearts carving out a civilization.
Fine. Great.
Then when they get it all pretty and prosperous, along come the grafters and land-grabbers and politicians and with one hand skim off the cream and with the other, scoop up the gravy.
Not for me. Listen.
I learned this about human nature when I was about so high, and that is that the strong take away from the weak, and the smart take it away from the strong.
I suppose you never heard of the law that protects people's rights and property.
Yeah, I've heard of it.
I've seen it work, too.
Sometimes, it's all right.
In the cities, maybe fine, but here, you can't trust it.
This is the only law that I know that's worth a hoot in this part of the country.
The only law.
This is wasting time.
Come on. Let's have a drink.
Hands up.
Hello, Abe.
Hello, Sam.
Howdy, judge.
Will you kindly remove those irons, please, sir?
Why, certainly.
Excuse me, son.
This young fellow a friend of yours?
Well, not exactly. We're just having a drink together.
'S got some very original ideas about life.
I wouldn't wonder.
Just keep them up, son.
Don't start any trouble.
Well, what's up?
I'm Abe Collins.
Who?
Abe Collins.
Is?
Yes.
'S the sheriff.
Now, look here. You dropped some new-minted money last night in a Blackjack game, didn't you?
That's right.
What of it?
Nothing, only it happens to be part of that Indian consignment stolen from the stage yesterday evening.
Well, it seems like law won out, even out here.
We've been waiting a long time to pick up this boy.
Is that so?
Well, 's an amiable thief.
So pleasant about it all.
Who is?
We don't know his right name, but throughout the territory,
's known as the Oklahoma kid.
All right, kid.
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning.
Lovely morning.
Father, what's happened?
Seems that our young friend is the Oklahoma kid.
Whip, here they come.
Sorry, gents.
I'm afraid you're trespassing on private property.
Sooners?
No. We just got here ahead of you. That's all.
We led the field all the way, nobody else in sight.
We'll have you sited at the land office.
Now keep your shirt on.
There's no sense in starting any trouble when everything can be settled quiet and peaceful.
The only way to settle this is for you to get off our land.
Your land?
Here's our claim stake sticking right up here in front of you.
You won't get away with this.
I think we will.
We've already got a man halfway back to the claim office.
You're licked, Mr.
Kincaid, and you know it.
Hey, what are you after?
Nothing much. We just heard you were figuring on building a town here.
That's all right with us.
All we want's a part of it and the exclusive rights to any saloons or gambling houses the town might need.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
Whip mccord from the panhandle.
What's your proposition?
You go right ahead and build your town and attract settlers.
So you can take away their money at faro and roulette?
Yeah, that's the idea.
You take care of their virtues.
I'll take care of their vices.
That's simple, ain't it?
We'll fight you through the courts first.
You aren't going to do yourself any good in court.
You can't start building until the title's cleared, and you know how long that'll take.
Meanwhile, some other town will be years ahead of you.
Anyway, why fight?
What's a few hundred foot of business frontage to an empire builder like you, Mr. Kincaid?
All right.
Pick out your ground.
Right here, and here's a waiver of right to protest under the sooner law, so that everything will be fair and square.
Hey!
All right, boys.
'S only a floater.
Get on with your play.
Shootings, killings, robberies, and a mighty orgy of drunkenness, gambling, and vice all directly traceable to mccord's influence.
Why, owns our mayor, our sheriff, and half our deputies.
Yes, they make arrests, just enough to save their faces, but we can't convict because, despite my efforts, juries are bribed and witnesses intimidated.
I say we need a showdown.
Either mccord and his crowd run this town or we do.
It's time to find out.
I know.
I've been wondering how much longer this could go on, but we made a mistake in the first place in making a deal with him.
Now, what do you suggest?
I say we should form a vigilance committee.
No, no. That would only be one mob fighting another.
We represent law and order.
We've got to take control away from mccord legally.
We've seen these gamblers and criminals make our city the nesting place for all the scum of the west.
We've seen vice and corruption flourish and our officials do nothing about it.
We've seen murders committed in our streets and public places and the murderers go unpunished.
We can't tolerate this condition any longer.
It's up to you, men, as voters, to stop this lawlessness.
I ask you to elect me mayor so I can clean out mccord and his gang of thieves and murderers.
I ask you to elect my son sheriff.
All right, boys, break it up.
Mccord!
Breaking up a few speeches isn't going to save you.
In the end, I'll see that the law gets you, and it won't be just to run you out of town.
It will be at the end of a rope.
We ought to do something about Kincaid, whip.
'S likely to get up the vigilantes like they did in dodge city.
We'll do something.
We'll get him on the end of that rope, and it'll be in his own law-and-order fashion, too.
What's the matter, Jose?
You don't like music?
You don't like the music?
All right, come on.
Come on over here with me.
I'm going to sit down here.
I'm going to sing to you.
Come on.
Ho ho ho.
All right.
You don't mind if I sing, do you?
Hey, now.
Once again, now.
How's that? You like it?
All right. Come on.
Everything's all right.
Come on. We're going to get a nice sleep?
We're going to get a nice rest, aren't we?
That's a good boy.
Callate!
Shut up.
It's Pedro.
It's all right.
You get everything,
Pedro?
- Si, senor.
- Everything.
Here's the dinero, senor.
Gracias, senor.
Pedro...
Pedro, saddle my horse.
Si, senor.
You go?
Si, manuelita.
You no stay for dinner?
No, gracias.
You come back soon?
Yes, very soon.
Manuelita, take care of these things for me, will you?
Adios.
- Adios.
- Adios.
Morning, friend. Where's the jailhouse in this town?
Right up the street.
You can't miss it.
Glad to hear that.
How's that?
Is that where they're keeping old man Kincaid?
Yep, smack-dab in the front cell upstairs where folks can stare at him.
All right. Thanks.
You're a stranger in town.
That's right.
Seems like I've seen your face someplace.
Well, I wouldn't know that.
I've been a lot of places.
Hyah! Come on!
Holy smoke!
Holy smoke!
Now, son, I wouldn't worry too much.
Who was that?
Why, it was the kid.
Who, the kid? It couldn't be.
Wouldn't dare.
Why, i...
I guess you're right, ned.
I must have been mistaken.
Now, about the trial.
With judge hardwick on the bench, there's nothing to alarm us.
Dad, you're covering up.
It was him, wasn't it?
Sheriff, the Oklahoma kid's in town!
I knew it!
I saw him myself!
Where are you going, ned?
I think I know where 'll be.
Wait. Don't do anything you'll regret.
What are you doing here?
Hello, ma'am.
Came here to see you and talk to you.
You shouldn't be in Tulsa.
The whole town is plastered with posters offering a reward for you.
I saw them... every one an insult. A measly $500.
Well, you'd better come inside before someone tries to collect it.
Won't you come in?
You're still as crazy as ever.
Thank you, ma'am.
I...
Very pretty.
This is aunt Maggie.
How do you do, aunt Maggie?
The hem got loose, and...
I see.
Well, excuse us, aunt Maggie?
We'd like to be alone.
There you are.
Now you can stop blushing.
Did you say you wanted to talk to me?
Yes, I did.
As a matter of fact, I want to talk to your father.
Isn't here. I don't know where I can reach him.
You could help me if you wanted to.
They tell me that the candidate for mayor is in jail.
Is that why you came?
Yes, strangely enough, it is.
I don't like to see anybody in jail.
You can understand that, can't you?
I never know whether to take you seriously or not.
I'm absolutely on the level.
I'd really like to help him.
It's not going to hurt anything if you tell me what you know.
Please.
Well, they say killed a man, a Mr. bates.
Let's not mind what they say.
What does say?
Says that bates sent for him.
When arrived at bates' house, found him dead.
A few moments later, mccord and some others of his crowd came in.
They've sworn that Kincaid had the gun in his hand when they entered.
Why?
Because they want him out of the way.
Thank heaven my father will be the judge.
Then you don't think they'll be able to get away with anything?
They most certainly won't.
Well, that's all
I wanted to know.
'Cause if you're satisfied...
I mean, you and your father are satisfied the old man didn't do the killing.
Of course didn't.
'S not that kind.
My kind?
Yes, your kind.
Thank you, ma'am.
Why are you making this your business, anyway?
Because happens to be my father.
Your father?
Hey, hey, hey.
Go out this way, through the back door.
Here's a chance to get yourself 500.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Jane, I want to talk to you.
What's the matter, ned?
Where is?
Who?
Sorry, aunt Maggie.
I'm looking for the Oklahoma kid.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
You remember him.
Danced with you that night in cherokee city.
Yes, I remember him, but...
Well, 's here.
In Tulsa?
In this house.
Why, it's ridiculous.
Isn't.
Jane, look at me.
I told you isn't here.
Don't you believe me?
I'm sorry.
Ned, why didn't you ever tell me that was your brother?
How did you know that?
I'd rather not say.
Then was here!
Yes, was.
Why did you deny it?
Because was your brother, and
I wanted him to get away.
Are you sure that's the only reason you wanted him to get away?
Yes.
Where did go?
I don't know.
Ned, why didn't you tell me about him?
It's just that dad and
I don't think of him as a member of the family anymore.
Is that bad?
Wasn't as a kid.
We were great pals then.
But as grew up, everything changed.
Got so thought the law was meant for one thing...
Just to be broken...
So finally dad had to throw him out.
Why are you so interested?
I'm not. It's just that
's your brother and...
Jane, you know how
I feel about you.
Of course I do.
I would have spoken sooner, but I wanted to get myself established first.
Please, ned, not now.
Jane, will you marry me?
Ned, let's not talk about it now.
Come back later, tonight.
You are upset about Jim, aren't you?
Jim?
That's the kid's name.
Perhaps it is, ned.
I don't know, but please go.
All right.
Think you ought to take him up on that.
I thought
I told you to go.
And miss all that wonderful lying you did for me? No.
I wasn't lying for you.
Now you really are lying, like a gentleman.
Then it's lucky there's one gentleman present.
You mean I didn't thank you?
Well, I do thank you.
I really think you ought to grab ned off. Make a great catch.
Sober, serious-minded, industrious...
Law and order himself.
Good-bye, ma'am.
Where are you going?
I'll be around.
I'm going to give your father's justice a chance to work, but it had better work.
We haven't got a case.
I've known this fella hardwick for years.
You can't get to him.
Hasn't bothered us much so far.
That was different. We were getting people off, not convicting them.
It's easy to fake a prosecution, especially when the witnesses are fixed.
Why not? We own the jury, don't we?
It won't get to the jury.
If we'd used some cleverness in framing this thing, we might have had a chance, but with the case we've got, hardwick will throw us out of court.
Well, then, we'll get rid of him.
Use sense, whip.
I am.
Regardless of hardwick,
Kincaid's going to swing.
We'll start a run on that bank of his, and when it goes down, we'll take it over.
We'll get the rest of those upright citizens one way or another.
When we end up, this will be my town, wide-open, with more money pouring in than you ever saw before.
In the meantime, we've still got to worry about hardwick.
Yeah.
How long have you known him?
10 or 12 years.
'S from Kansas City.
There's nothing on him.
I've tried that before.
Has got any relatives?
Yeah, a brother. Feed merchant in Kansas City.
All right. We'll get hardwick out of the way.
You have the trial moved up a couple of days.
I think
I can do that.
That'll give us
Morgan for the judge.
Doolin, get me a boy we can trust...
Somebody that isn't known around here.
All right, come on.
Get moving.
All right, write a letter to hardwick.
We'll make it look as though it came from his brother.
I'll have a friend of mine mail it from Kansas City.
This is bad news, judge, very bad.
I'm extremely sorry.
Well, of course,
I'll leave immediately.
I'll catch this morning's stage for Kansas City.
Yes, I suppose you must, but what about Kincaid?
I'll have plenty of time to get to Kansas City and back before the trial.
Watch over things while
I'm gone, will you?
Of course.
All right, boys.
Everybody up!
It's on the house...
A celebration!
Here's to Mr. Ringo, the smartest lawyer west of Chicago!
And the trial set up for tomorrow with judge Morgan presiding.
Hooray for Mr. Ringo!
This can't be true.
I just received a postcard this morning from uncle Stephen.
'S not dying, and 's not in Kansas City.
'S in Montreal.
You think him trick?
Of course it is, to get father out of town.
When did the stage leave?
Maybe 4, 5 hours ago.
Get my horse saddled, quick!
Good morning, ma'am.
Kind of a hot morning to be riding so fast.
Please don't stop me. I've got to catch father. The trial...
Just a minute. Get those words out one at a time so I can understand them.
Yes, you should know.
Somebody's tricked father with this letter.
It must be mccord.
Not a word of it's true. It's just to get him out of town.
Why?
Mccord owns judge Morgan, that's why.
They've moved the trial up to tomorrow. Morgan will preside.
And they'll railroad the old man.
Unless I can bring father back in time.
Look here, you go on, get back to town.
Back to town?
Get hold of the old man's lawyer. Show him that.
Tell him 's got to delay that trial if you got to pull a trick out of the bottom of the bag.
But father...
I'll go after him, bring him back.
I'm kind of handy at stopping stages.
All right. I'm so glad you saw me.
I see you more often than you know.
I said I'd be around, didn't I?
Hello! Hey, wake up in there!
Hello in there!
Hey, wake up!
Who is it?
What do you want?
- Stage go by here?
- Yeah.
- How long ago?
- About two hours.
Put up the gun. I want a change of horse.
I'm willing to pay for it.
Which...
Hyah!
All right, boys.
Throw them down.
The rest of you can take it easy.
All I want is judge hardwick.
Come on.
Well. You?
Yep. Put them down, judge.
This is no holdup.
Well, what is it, then?
This may surprise you, but right now
I'm working for law and justice.
Your brother isn't sick at all.
Mccord sent you that note to get you out of town.
How did you know about that note?
- Your daughter told me.
- My daughter?
Yeah. She didn't like the looks of it, and I did a little investigating.
Mccord has had the trial moved up, and judge Morgan is presiding.
- Morgan?
- Yeah.
That sounds like him.
What's your interest in this?
My name is Jim Kincaid.
Are you
John Kincaid's son?
Yeah. But this is wasting a lot of good time. Come on.
Have you got another mount?
No, but we can pick one up at a settler's cabin down the road.
All right, boys, on your way.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Handley, take the stand.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
You say that Mr. bates was alive when you left the house?
Yes, sir.
Showed us out.
Ned tolley can tell you that.
Saw bates come to the door and say good night to us.
I object, your honor, to the witness testifying that...
Overruled. Proceed.
Mr. tolley saw bates see you out.
Yes, sir.
What did you do then?
We walked on down toward the square.
I happened to turn around just in time to see Mr.
Kincaid go into the house.
Then?
Well, that kind of worried us.
We knew Kincaid had it in for bates...
I object, your honor, to the witness...
Overruled. Proceed.
So we went back.
Just as I got to the door, I heard a shot.
We busted in and found Mr. Kincaid standing in the center of the room with a gun in his hand and Mr. bates lying on the floor dead.
What did you do then?
Naturally, we looked to see if was dead.
Was.
We took the gun away from Kincaid and sent for the sheriff.
Not ned... the old sheriff, hartley.
Kincaid came up the steps to mccord and said to all of us...
Well, anybody could tell you what said.
I object, your honor, to the witness testifying that...
Overruled.
Proceed.
Well, said, "I'm going to get you, mccord,
"and I'm going to get bates, too.
One way or another,
I'm going to get you."
So, gentlemen, if you think the defendant did shoot and kill Mr. bates, you can find him guilty of murder in the first degree.
On the other hand, if you think did not kill him and there's any reasonable doubts in your mind, you'll find him not guilty.
The jury will retire.
Your honor, I don't think there's any need for the jury to retire.
We can take a vote right here.
I'm so glad you're back.
Where's dad?
Stopped at the bank to see Mr.
Martin. Well, what's happened?
Has the trial started?
It's all over.
They found him guilty.
It was the worst kind of a farce.
They'd hardly let
Mr. Martin speak.
Well, I guess
I'll be moving along.
Don't do anything foolish.
It seems to me that's just what I've been doing, riding around trying to catch the law by the coattails.
Perhaps dad can get a new trial.
Perhaps can prove that this one was illegal.
Perhaps, but you can't expect him to lean on any of these people.
Jim, think of your father and how feels.
'S an honorable man.
'S lived with the law.
Yes. I think
's very lucky to have a no-good son to see doesn't die by it.
I don't think 'd get much satisfaction out of having your father, the judge, read blackstone at his burial.
Hyah!
Get them up.
Over here.
All right, out.
Come on.
Is that cell empty?
Yeah.
Now, where's my old man's cell?
Who?
- Kincaid.
- Your father?
Where's his cell?
Upstairs, in front.
Get in.
John Kincaid?
Hello! Here!
Hello, pop.
Jim!
Come on, pop. I'm taking you out of this tin can.
No, you're not.
Come on, get into that coat.
I don't need your help.
Wrong again.
If you're going to depend upon the law, you're going to wind up on the end of a rope.
Hey!
Go to the bank and get the sheriff.
The kid is breaking
Kincaid out of jail.
And here's one for you...
The kid is Kincaid's son!
What's that?
Yeah. Now, get going!
I know you mean well, but there's an issue in this town you wouldn't understand...
Law or anarchy.
I represent law and order.
You don't. You never have.
I'm not here to argue right from wrong.
Do I have to hit you over the head or carry you over my back?
That's the only way you'll get me to go with you.
If I let you take the law in your hands, it would be an admission of my guilt.
You see, Jim, it isn't only my freedom that I'm fighting for.
But they've got you framed!
Sheriff, the kid's got the keys.
Went upstairs to the old man's cell.
Come on!
Come on!
So long, pop.
Good luck, son.
Locked the deputies in the cell and went upstairs to get Kincaid.
What do you think? Kincaid is the kid's old man!
Say, that makes it easy.
That's a jailbreak.
This time, we'll be the vigilantes.
Men, come over here!
Come in close!
You all know the Oklahoma kid?
Yeah!
Well, I just heard that the Oklahoma kid is old man Kincaid's son.
And what's more, the kid's in town right now, trying to break his old man out of jail!
Old man Kincaid was convicted of a murder.
A jury made up of you men said that should hang.
Yes, of course should!
Are you going to stand by and let an outlaw take a murderer out of jail?
No!
If the law won't stop him, we will!
Right. And if the law won't hang
Kincaid, then it's up to us!
And if we get the Oklahoma kid, we'll hang him, too!
Are you with me?
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!
Go with them and keep them hot.
Come on, boys, for old man Kincaid!
Looks like a hanging party.
Mccord gang's in the lead.
Think this will fit him, boys?
Let's go up and try it out on old man Kincaid.
They're on their way to the jail.
Come on, boys!
Come on, where are those keys?
Come on, boys!
Here is!
Where's the kid?
I don't know.
Was here, wasn't?
Yes.
Helping you to escape.
Wanted me to go with him.
That's all
I wanted to know.
Listen to me, in the name of the law!
Shut up!
Hello, Jane.
Do you know where my old man is?
'S in there.
Jim, they've killed him.
The mob broke into the jail, and...
Who was it?
Mccord?
No, his gang, but mccord wasn't there.
Do you know who was there?
There was doolin, curley,
Indian Joe, and handley.
Doolin, curley,
Indian Joe, and handley.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm going to the territorial governor in the morning and insist put this town under marshal law.
A little bit late for that.
Then we'll go after the ringleaders and bring them to trial.
You better do it fast if you want to get there ahead of me.
Father stop him.
Stop him!
'Ll be killed.
You couldn't stop him now, Jane.
I don't know as I want to.
Come on, get over there.
Over.
Now, where's mccord?
Ain't here.
And curley, doolin, and handley?
They ain't here either.
Indian Joe?
Where's mccord?
I don't know, kid.
Who did the hanging?
I don't know, kid.
It was mccord, wasn't it?
Was in on it.
I don't know, I tell you.
I don't know.
All right.
Come on down here.
Now, you can tell mccord and the rest of his gang,
I'll be calling on them, too.
Great bunch of quitting rats, the whole crowd of you.
A couple of hundred men, and the kid walks in and picks off Indian Joe like it was a shooting gallery.
We didn't have a chance, boss.
Now, look, get out!
The kid said was going to get us all, whip.
Named every one of us.
Are you turning yellow, too?
No, but don't you think we ought to duck, at least till the law gets the kid?
No.
I'm staying here.
This is my town, and nobody's going to run me out of it.
The kid wants to shoot it out with me, I'll be here.
How do we stand legally?
Just like I told you, you weren't there.
You're all right unless somebody can prove you started it.
They can't prove that unless somebody says something.
No.
There ain't nobody gonna say nothing.
But the boys here are not in such a good spot.
There was a big crowd there, and some of the citizens must have recognized them.
I'm going to hit the trail.
Might be best if they all did.
I don't want any part of that kid.
I'm with doolin.
I think we better go.
- All right.
- Go ahead, run out.
If anybody talks, you won't have to worry about the kid.
How far is it to burden?
That's over the Kansas line about 30 miles.
You figuring on getting there tonight?
How many horses you got?
None. Just a mule, and 's lame.
Go on. You two better get out of here. Go on. Go.
Where's doolin and handley?
How should
I know?
You were in on the hanging, weren't you?
No. Give me a chance, kid.
I'll give you the same chance
I gave Indian Joe.
Go on, reach for it.
Well, if you don't reach for it, I can't shoot you.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Right.
Come out and get me, kid!
Aha!
I didn't do it, kid.
I didn't...It was mccord.
Mccord...Water...
It was mc...
It was mccord...
First Indian Joe...
Then curley.
The list dispatched from
Kansas City simply says they found handley's body in the freight yards with the neck broken.
Yeah, but, judge, you know as well as I do, the kid got him just the same as got curley and Indian Joe.
Yes, I know.
And one of these days we'll hear that doolin has gone to his reward...
Whatever that may amount to...
And then we'll chalk up another for the kid.
Yes, it's a puzzle to know how to feel. A man's torn.
One side of him says it's a frightful thing for a lad to be piling up such a record of bloodshed, and the other side of him says, "go get him, kid.
Get doolin next."
If only we could get evidence against mccord and bring him to trial.
Martin, you know, that ned has worked as hard as any man possibly could these past few weeks.
It's impossible to get evidence.
The mccord gang is a closed corporation of closed mouths.
If we don't hurry up, the kid won't leave anybody for us to get evidence against.
Jim.
Hello, Jane.
Is your father in?
'S inside with Mr. Martin.
I've got something that'll interest him.
Jim, you shouldn't come here.
Do you realize there's a price on your head?
Yeah, yeah. Look, I've got doolin outside.
- Doolin?
- Dead or alive?
A little bit of each.
But I think may be revived enough to bring his voice back.
What did you get out of him?
The whole story, and I don't think I'd like to hear it again, so I'll leave him in your hands.
Take doolin down to the jail with ned. I'll be right down.
Well, in that case,
I'll be going, too.
Jim, what are you going to do?
I've got a date with mccord.
Son, I know just how you feel.
In that case, you won't hold me up with a lot of talk, will you?
Haven't you done enough?
I haven't done anything, except kill a lot of coyotes in self-defense, if you want to put it in law talk.
Please wait.
It's no use, Jane.
Would it mean anything to you if I asked you not to go?
Don't talk like that.
You and ned are...
I love you, Jim.
You don't know what you're saying.
I'm no kind of a man a woman could tie her bonnet to. Ned is.
Women are crazy.
That's why they fall in love with the wrong men.
But they do.
Now will you stay?
No, no. I've started a job, Jane.
I've got to finish it.
It's a small point of honor that maybe a woman wouldn't understand.
All right, Jim.
I'll try to understand.
There's only one thing
I want, really, and that is for you to come back safely.
Give me some of that water, will you?
Take it easy, doolin. Tell me one more thing, then you can have a drink.
I'll tell you everything, only give me a drink of water...
Mccord responsible for that lynching or not?
Water, please.
Mccord responsible for that lynching?!
Yes, of course was. Was behind the whole thing.
Excited the boys to do it.
That's all you need, ned.
Here's our witness.
Give him a drink.
I'm going down and arrest mccord.
Water.
Whip, I saw the kid.
Brought doolin into town.
'Ll be coming here next.
All right, fine.
I'll be glad to see him.
Now, you two boys go outside, and when the kid shows up, make sure you draw first.
Make sure your aim is good.
Leave it to us, whip.
We'll watch him.
Mccord, you're under arrest.
Get your hands up and walk toward me.
Look out, kid.
Good work, ned.
Good work.
Yeah. We make a good team when we're working on the same side.
Now, don't talk anymore.
You're not hurt much.
I'll go and scare up a sawbones. Come on.
No, wait.
I must tell you now.
I wrote the governor, said you'd been working on the side of the law, asked him for a pardon for...
Never mind that.
You'll be all right.
Just get up here, and I'll get you.
I'll get you.
Remember when we were kids, you fell out of the apple tree?
I had to carry you home that time.
Yeah, sure, ned.
I remember.
One good turn deserves another.
Come on, now.
Easy. I'll get you home.
I'm sorry, ned.
We should have gotten together sooner.
Where are you going, Jim?
Chasing the moon.
I hear there's a lot of new territory out Arizona way.
Oklahoma's practically new.
Couldn't you just stay here?
No, I don't like the country around here.
Why, it's beautiful country.
I know the scenery's all right, except those placards.
Every time I look at one of those $500 insults,
I get madder and madder.
Get around!
But they're coming down.
Father says it.
Down or not, I'd always remember where they'd been.
I understand.
A new country, a new leaf.
Me, turn over a new leaf?
I'd have to turn over a whole public library.
Well, after you've done all that, you think you'll ever, ever be back this way again?
Well, maybe, maybe not.
It all depends on the way things turn out.
Well, good-bye, Jim.
Good-bye.
Jim, is Arizona an awfully big place?
Yeah, yeah.
So they tell me.
Then I'll have a hard time finding you, won't I?
Look here, Jane, you don't want to let yourself...
I just mean if you're empire-building, it would save time...
Who said anything about empire-building?
I just mean it's a difficult thing to do by yourself.
For an empire, you've got to have people.
For people, you've got to have children, and for children...
By authority as judge in the crying need of this situation...
Just a minute, judge, you...
Jane, do you take this man to be your...
Yes, I do, dad.
Yes.
Just a minute...
Jim, do you take this girl to be your...
You don't want to get yourself into this.
Takes me, father.
Whether likes it or not.
Very well, then.
I pronounce you...
Hold that hat.
Man and wife.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MUSIC - "LAUGH YOUR TROUBLES
AWAY"]
Say that was swell.
How about another song?
Buck, if you've got all that chirping out of your system,
Maybe you can get back to the ranch.
Sure Dad.
I'm riding back right away.
I want you to go up to North Fork Range,
See what's wrong up there.
What do you think is wrong?
I don't know.
I was up through there the other day,
And there ain't hardly a calf on the range.
And I don't think cows have quit having families.
Maybe mountain lion's been getting them.
I didn't see any lion tracks.
Well I'll scout around and see what I can find out.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Slow that critter, don't waltz with him!
I got him.
Bring him in.
Hurry up.
We got to make tracks out of here before we have visitors.
Here comes Buck Lawson.
Hit leather.
Leave that iron.
I want Buck Lawson to find it.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Dad, it ain't mountain lions that's
Been getting away with our calves.
I jumped a bunch of rustlers at work.
Rustlers?
And they left in such a hurry they
Forgot their branding iron.
Keep RP, Tex Preston.
That's the way I read it.
Why that lowdown coyote.
I fought Tex Preston to a standstill 15 years ago,
And it looks like he ain't learned his lesson.
That branding iron fixed things with the Lawson outfit.
Now let's go scare Tex Preston.
You boys know what to do.
Stay here and watch for my signal.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Howdy, Bat.
Hello, Tex.
How's everything?
Things are not so good.
Seems like I'm losing stock lately.
When I was riding over this way,
I found a cow of yours laying in the brush.
She'd been shot.
What?
Someone killing my stock?
It looks that way.
There was a calf hanging around.
Looked like he was related to her,
But he carried Pop
Lawson's brand.
Well the lowdown coyote, killing
My cow so he can steal my calves.
Why I fought Pop Lawson to a standstill 15 years ago.
You think he's know better than to monkey with a buzz saw.
Mr. Preston I think to myself, you're tired of eating beef,
So I cook you a nice duck.
Boy she looks beautiful in the frying pan.
This comes from our prize stock.
Looks to me like somebody ain't very friendly.
I got a pretty good idea who did it.
No one ever asked me for a fight without finding
Me willing to oblige.
Mr. Preston, I think for myself again you have to eat beef.
Ducky, ducky.
Fritz, come here.
Fritz, come here ducky.
Nice duck.
Go away.
I don't want you.
Go away.
Go away.
Come here.
I won't hurt you.
I won't hurt you.
Come here.
Perfectly safe.
Can we not sit down somewhere and talk things over?
Come here, Fritz.
Look at the nice corn.
I can eat myself.
Come here.
I won't hurt you.
Fritz, come here.
Ducky, ducky.
Come here, ducky.
Come here.
Come here.
I just want to make friend with you.
Look Fritz, it's getting late for the boss's dinner,
And I'm getting tired.
Fritz, I only need you for one minute.
Fritzy, come out.
I got something for you.
I got something nice for you.
[SCREAM]
Fritzy, you're around here someplace.
You boys enjoy yourself while we're waiting for the stage.
As I was saying,
I never thought
That Mrs. Clancy could be so small.
You're absolutely right.
Well good bye.
Good bye.
Good morning, Mrs. Johnson.
Good morning.
Howdy, Tex.
Hello, Sheriff.
I'm warning you, Tex.
Don't start no trouble in town.
I won't hunt no trouble, and I won't run away from it either.
Buck, there's no sense in all you boys riding to town.
You scout around, keep an eye out of rustlers.
But you might end up with that Preston outfit.
If I do, I reckon I can take care or myself.
I don't need someone to ride hurt on me.
All right, Dad.
We'll head back.
Now don't forget what I told you.
Come on.
Let's get those supplies.
Hello, Tex.
What are you doing in town?
My niece comes in the stage today.
Your niece, huh?
Coming out for a visit?
No, she's going to make a home with me.
Her folks died, and I'm all the kin she's got.
She's not coming to a very peaceful spot.
Oh it will be peaceful all right,
When I do some exterminating that
Needs to be done around here.
And you're just the man that can do it.
Don't worry.
We will do it.
Come on.
[APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MUSIC - "HEY, LOOK OUT"]
I want to talk to you.
What's on your mind?
You keep your nose out of that fight
Between the Lawson and Preston outfits.
Let nature take its course.
It's my duty to keep peace.
Your duty, if you're smart, is to do as I tell you.
I'm grabbing myself a nice bunch of cattle from both sides,
And each one blames the other.
I'll finally end up owning both outfits.
[MUSIC - "HEY, LOOK OUT"]
What about that money for the bank?
Is it coming in on the stage?
I stood for rustling and a lot of dirty work,
But holding up the stage might mean murder.
That's going too far.
If you don't like my game, just say so.
The warden at the penitentiary would just
Love to see you come back and finish your time.
When a man wants to go straight,
Why won't you give him a chance?
Cry about that some other time.
What about that money?
It's due to arrive on the stage.
Now you're talking sense.
Beat it.
Well Bat, how's everything working out?
Great, Nita.
I'll sure keep my promise and load you down with diamonds.
I can carry the weight.
Bartender, my private bottle.
Yes, sir.
Coming up.
Will you be in town for a while?
No, I got a little job to do.
The one I told you about?
Yeah, I just got some information about it.
I'll see when I get back.
Be careful, will you?
Don't worry about me.
Come on.
Why you big ox!
What are your trying to do?
I can't help it, boss.
I schlitzed.
Well schlitz that stuff into the wagon.
I'm going over to the barbershop and get all cleaned up.
Good.
[MUMBLING]
[MUSIC - "SHE'S THE DAUGHTER OF
SWEET CAROLINE"]
That was mighty fine, boys.
Give her another whirl.
Sure will.
Curry me down, Sammy.
I don't want to scare my niece by looking like an outlaw.
I'll make you look Beau Brummell.
Oh you needed go as far as that.
Don't strain yourself.
[MUSIC - "SHE'S THE DAUGHTER OF
SWEET CAROLINE"]
Pop Lawson and Preston are both in town.
Pop Lawson just got in town.
Reckon I got to head to the cyclone cellar.
If anybody in town's got any calves,
They'd better watch them today.
I thought the county paid a bounty on coyotes instead
Of letting them run around loose.
Seems to me, I smell something that should be buried.
Smells mighty like a polecat.
Why you...
I won't get shaved here today.
I might catch smallpox.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Here it comes.
I wonder who those hombres are.
Let's pick up their trail and see what they're up to.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Stop that trouble.
Come on, men.
Beat it, boys.
Here comes trouble.
After them, men.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Are you all right, Miss?
I'm nearly frightened to death, but otherwise all right,
Thanks to you.
You had a right to be scared.
Nobody would have found that ride a pleasure trip.
Why it's outrageous that a respectable citizen
Should be endangered like that.
I'll see that something is done to put a stop to it.
That's a way for a man to talk.
I'll have the Sheriff take you along
When he goes after those outlaws.
He needs more men like you.
Lend me hand with those fellows on top,
And we'll take the stage on in.
Someone will hang for this job.
Pete in there was a good man and a good friend of mine.
Maybe you'd rather ride on top with me.
Yes, I would if you don't mind.
I'm proud to have your company.
Hey cowboy, climb aboard or we're going to leave you.
Hurry up!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
We missed a rich haul on account of Buck Lawson.
Do we stand for that?
What do you think?
I think we send
Baby Face after them.
Sure boss, I'll make smoked beef out of him.
Shut up.
Take it easy, Baby Face.
He'll get his.
Only we'll do it the smart way.
We'll have those two outfits killing each other.
It's about time we run off another bunch of stock.
Don't you see the dynamite, you local maverick?
I hear the stage was held up today, Sheriff.
They didn't get anything, but they
Killed Pete and the
Wells Fargo messenger.
Hm that's too bad.
Sheriff, outlaws have been mighty busy
Around here of late.
And I can't see where you've done much about it.
You better not prod the Sheriff, Buck.
He might take an interest in all that gun smoke out your way.
That ain't just according to law.
What a minute, Buck.
You're wrong, Bat.
Any man's got a right to protect himself.
What's the matter, Nancy?
Forget something?
Oh no, I was just looking around.
Well there ain't much to see in this town.
We better get going.
All right, Uncle Jim.
But it seems I should say something
To the man that stopped the runaway.
The least you have to say to him, why the better.
All right, boys.
We'll get started.
Buck, how about riding with the posse?
I got an idea it would be wasting my time.
Meaning anything in particular?
No, it just seems that you don't
Have any luck when you go hunting outlaws.
Dad, don't you think we better get back to the ranch?
All right.
I don't admire that remark Buck Lawson made.
He's too smart for his own good.
I'm taking him out of circulation before long.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Boss, we ain't been able to round up enough prime beef
To make it worthwhile sending a trail
Real herd to the railroad.
I bet I can thank
Pop Lawson for that.
And the Sheriff must be on his side.
Why I'm being rustled poor and can get no help from the law.
You better do something about it pretty pronto.
I'll do plenty.
Put on more hands, but get men that can sling guns.
I'll stop it.
I'll ride into town and see what gunfighters I can locate.
All right.
[SINGING]
What's the matter?
Worried about something?
I was just thinking what a fine world this would
Be if there wasn't any Lawsons in it.
I think it's a pretty nice place just as it is.
And I'm sure you're the nicest uncle in the world.
Going for a ride again today?
You don't mind, do you?
Why bless your heart, no.
Go on and enjoy yourself.
Otto, I'm going for a ride.
Would you put up a lunch for me?
What would you like to eat?
Oh a half a dozen sandwiches, some boiled eggs, and pickles.
Where are you going to put all that?
In my saddlebag.
In your saddlebag.
And then where are you going to put it?
In my tummy.
In your tummy, a little girl like you.
Every day she gets more appetite.
Oh I get terribly hungry when I ride.
Yeah, I know.
It's the exercise.
You want two pieces of cake like yesterday?
Yes, two pieces.
You make such wonderful cake.
I know.
[MUSIC - "DOWN ON THE SUNSET
TRAIL"]
[MUSIC - MISTER JACK AND MISSUS
JILL"]
Say that was mighty pretty.
Why didn't you tell me before this
That you could really sing?
Can I?
The best I've ever heard.
Liar.
Honest.
Was that song for me?
Well there's nobody else around.
Did you really like it?
Why certainly.
That is all but the finish, the part about the wedding.
Oh I see, a woman hater.
Don't you ever think of settling down?
Not until I stop this feud between our families.
I hope you can, Buck, soon.
Oh let's forget all this trouble
And just go on with our picnic.
Wait a minute, Buck.
I'm trespassing on the Lawson range.
Aren't you going to throw me off?
Well not until after we've had this lunch.
Oh is that the only reason why I'm
Welcome, just because I feed you?
I'm not saying it is, and
I'm not saying it isn't.
In other words, you don't believe in taking chances.
Well come on, I'll feed you anyway.
A range war's like rolling a rock down a mountain.
Easy to start, but might hard to stop.
But you don't hate me, and I don't hate you.
Why can't we be allowed to live in peace?
We have the right to be happy.
We could have all that if only we could make folks
Use common sense instead of gun smoke.
Oh I better get back to the ranch.
I tried to reason with Uncle Jim,
But it only makes him angry.
He just won't listen to me.
We still can be friends in spite of everything.
Just friends?
But there's a very serious matter I want to talk to you
About just as soon as I get this trouble ironed out.
I'll be waiting.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Is this the way you ride the line,
Lollygagging with one of the Preston breed?
Dad, she has nothing to do with the quarrel
Between you and Tex Preston.
She's of the same breed.
And man or woman, I won't have one of them on my range.
Dad, I don't take to that kind of talk about my friends.
Please Buck, don't quarrel with your father on my account.
If there's any quarrel, it's of his makings.
Dad, if you're calling for a show down, I'm standing pat.
If you favor my enemies, you're not my son.
Go back Buck, and make up with your father.
I can't come between you.
We'll work this out somehow.
I'll make those two old warhorses
Understand some common sense.
If you don't mind, I'll ride a ways with you.
All right.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Tex, your niece has been riding out to meet Buck Lawson.
I think they're headed for town.
What?
I'll put a stop to that.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
You get home just as fast as you can.
I don't allow no
Lawsons on my ranch.
Get before I make a shiv out of you.
Uncle Jim, please.
Do as he says.
There won't be any trouble.
You promise?
I promise.
Now you make tracks and make them pronto.
You're not afraid to shoot it out with me, are you?
No, I'm not.
I dare you to talk to me for five minutes.
Why I never took a dare in my life.
Come on.
Come on.
Start talking, and make it fast.
Tex, you think our outfit rustled your stock.
I know you're wrong.
Well I've lost plenty of stock.
So have we.
Are you rustling from us?
I am not!
Hold on, Preston.
You agreed to talk for five minutes.
Well all right.
We're both losing stock.
You blame us, and we blame you.
That don't make sense.
Doesn't it strike you as being reasonable that someone is
Playing us against each other and rustling from us both?
If you and Dad would stop this fool war and work together,
We might find out who it is.
Even if I was willing, it takes two men to stop a war.
If you'd only meet Dad halfway,
I know he'd be reasonable.
Buck, you sound honest to me, and I
Believe you're talking horse sense.
I'm glad you see it my way, Tex.
I'll make Dad wash off the war paint
And meet you in town for a powwow.
Will you be there?
Sure.
So long, Tex.
So long, Buck.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Royce, Nancy!
Buck Lawson just killed Tex
Preston over on the south pass.
Shot him in the back.
Hit leather men, and shoot on sight.
I'm sorry, Nancy.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
How could he do a thing like that?
You can't tell what a man might do in the heat of anger.
You can count on me to do all I can for you.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC - "MISTER JACK AND MISSUS
JILL"]
[APPLAUSE]
Hello, sweetie.
I haven't seen you for so long.
Don't bother me.
I'm busy.
Sheriff, I got a job for you.
Yeah?
I reckon it won't be anything I can be proud of.
What is it?
I want you to arrest Buck Lawson
For the murder of Tex Preston.
Hey, hey hey!
I hear you've been showing a lot
Of interest in that Preston girl.
What I do is my own business.
Oh like this, eh?
Yeah, just like that.
That's where you're wrong.
You owe me plenty.
And don't get the idea you can kick me off like an old shoe.
What will you do about it?
Stick around.
You'll find out.
I'm so sorry, Nancy.
Nan...
Stay where you are!
Get out of this house.
What do you mean?
What have I done?
Don't pretend.
Bat Haines said you shot my uncle.
He lied.
Nancy, you can't believe that.
Oh I don't know what to believe.
I left you talking to Uncle
Jim, and now he's dead.
That's what I came to tell you.
Only two people knew that
Jim Preston was killed,
Myself and the man who shot him.
Bat Haines and I are due for a talk.
I want to talk to you.
Hold on, Buck.
I'm arresting you for murder.
On whose say so?
Bay Haines.
Hold on, Bat.
This man is in the custody of the law.
I'll take those shooting irons.
We both know who killed Tex Preston.
Yeah, but I know who's going to hang for it.
Don't bank on that too heavy.
Get going.
If we could stop this rustling, we'd pull out of the hole
All right.
But there's no chance to raise any money right now.
Thank you.
That's all I wanted to know.
Your uncle was talking about taking
On some more gunfighters.
I've located three or four.
No!
I'll have no more bloodshed.
Yes'm.
I think Bat Haines is a snake in the grass.
Snake or no snake, he'll be boss around here pretty pronto.
Oh yeah, boss around here.
Don't forget I'm the cook.
I'll fix him.
Why try to run a cow ranch?
That's no job for a woman.
Now as my wife...
No, that's out of the question.
What's the matter with me as a husband?
Why some day I'll be the biggest man in this county.
That has nothing to do with it.
Oh still hankering for that half pint
That murdered your uncle, eh?
I don't believe he did it.
You mean I lied?
When two men tell a different story, one of them lies.
All right.
I tried to be friends, and for thanks
I get slapped in the face.
Your uncle owed me a lot of money.
You better be ready to pay it up.
You know I can't right now.
That's your worry.
Thanks, Otto.
I hope you get stomach trouble.
Otto, how many times have I told
You not to eat so much pie.
Do you want to get sick?
I feel all right.
Hurry up and get ready.
I want you to ride to town with me.
What's the matter, Bat?
You look worried.
What makes you think so?
Just the way you've been acting.
Don't pay so much attention to me.
Maybe the Sheriff takes orders from you,
But no jury will come with him if she's on his side.
Maybe we won't have a jury.
Men, we've got to take things in our own hands
And take care of Buck
Lawson in our own way.
[MURMURING]
Nancy, it was mighty nice of you
To drop in and see if they're taking good care of me.
I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
There's nothing to worry about.
They can't convict me of something I never did.
Bat Haines is buying the drink.
Everybody chin up to the bar!
Nancy, Nancy!
They coming to take Buck over to the gambling house
And hang him.
Who is?
The whole town, I guess.
Let him go and give him a chance to save himself.
I can't turn a prisoner loose.
Would you keep him here to be murdered?
They won't try anything like that.
If I had a couple of the boys from Dad's ranch,
I'd give them a run for their money.
You'll have them.
What about the Sheriff?
He might object.
Oh he'll be reasonable.
Come on.
Let's get going.
What if I told this crowd what I know about you?
[SLAP]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Wait a minute, Haines.
Don't forget, there's a law in this town.
That's all right, Sheriff.
We figured to save you some bother.
Come on, men.
Hurry, or you'll be too late.
Get the boys.
We're riding to town.
You're back of this, Haines.
You're not man enough to fight it out with me.
Why bother?
This suits me all right.
Sentences you to be strung up until you are dead.
Hold on, men.
Buck Lawson is innocent.
It was Bat Haines who...
[SCREAM]
Stay where you are!
From now on, I'm playing a lone hand.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Stay where you are.
Turn around.
Take care of them, Dad.
I got a job to do.
Buck, wait!
I'll be right back.
Drop those gun belts, and be careful how you do it.
Are you hurt bad, Sheriff?
It looks like I'm at the end of my trail.
Haines did all the rustling and caused all the trouble
Between you and Tex Preston.
And Nita was in with him.
You'll find him in a cabin at Big Rock Canyon.
Round up all the boys.
We're heading for
Big Rock Canyon.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Go ahead.
You got it all your own way.
I'll give you an even break.
That's more than you did for me.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Are you looking for Bat Haines?
Yes.
[LAUGH]
In about one minute, he'll be scattered all over these hills.
Buck, Buck!
Some of you boys take her to town.
Lock her up.
The rest come with me.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
NANCY: Buck, Buck!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Are you hurt?
I don't think so.
But what happened?
You just missed being an angel by about three seconds.
I think he's somewhat of an angel right now.
What is this important matter you wanted to talk to me about?
That's right.
I forgot.
Wait a minute.
Now.
