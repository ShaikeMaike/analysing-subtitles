The channel's here on the chart.
So are the marking lights.
Then what's wrong with them?
Those lights don't seem to be in just the right place.
They're both a bit out of position, according to this.
Two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over.
"Safe between the world over" doesn't go in these waters.
Look here. You'll see the water shoals on the island side... while the deep soundings run to the mainland.
Have any of you seen the captain today?
- No. He wasn't down for dinner.
- No, and he wasn't down for lunch.
He hasn't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel.
What are you driving at?
Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters... he's had the jitters.
There's something wrong. I...
Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?
- Give him a shot of scotch.
- Give the whole bottle.
- No! I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc.
Just what you need.
- Well, maybe you're right.
- And how, boy.
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead.
We're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland.
- Good.
- But the lights are just a bit off, according to the chart.
The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific. You know that.
I know, sir, but...
Doesn't Branca Island mean anything to you?
- Well, not a lot.
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...
Bob's not a sailor.
He's a hunter.
He's made many of these trips.
He's young, but he has judgment.
I'll call him.
- Oh, Bob. Bob!
- What is it?
- Come up here, will ya?
- Just a minute.
What's bothering you, Captain?
There are no more coral-reefed, shark-infested waters in the whole world than these.
Boy! Just take a look at these.
You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter,
Doc, but oh, what a photographer.
If we'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip... they might have believed my book.
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip, you'd have never had me on this one.
Say, here's a swell one of the ship, Skipper. What's the matter?
These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other... and end up believing it all themselves.
I think that Mr. Rainsford should know... that the channel lights aren't just in the position given on the charts.
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?
I think we should turn back and take the outside course.
We'll go ahead.
Very well, sir.
It's your ship.
"It was the schooner 'Hesperus,' and she sailed the wintry sea. "
Now, wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk this over.
- There's no use taking any chances.
- Chances? That's fine talk... coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face.
Get an eyeful of this.
And he talks about taking chances.
Here's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera.
Get the expression on Doc's face, Bill.
He looks more frightened than the tiger.
- He is.
- What'd you have on your mind, Doc?
I'll tell you what I had on my mind.
I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization.
The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage.
The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized.
- Hear! Hear!
- It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?
Now, just a minute.
What makes you think... it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?
Take that fellow right there, for instance.
There never was a time when he couldn't have gotten away.
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.
He didn't hate me for stalking him... any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.
As a matter of fact, we admired each other.
Perhaps, but would you change places with the tiger?
- Well, not now.
- Mm-mm!
Here comes that bad-luck lady again.
Third time tonight.
- Here. Let me shuffle them.
- Wait a minute. Don't evade the issue.
- Yeah, speak up.
- I asked you a question.
- You did? I forgot.
- Oh, no, you didn't.
I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.
- Come on.
- What's your answer now, Bob?
That's something
I'll never have to decide.
Listen here, you fellows.
This world's divided into two kinds of people... the hunter and the hunted.
Luckily, I'm a hunter.
Nothing can ever change that.
Hang on!
Hello! Hello, down there!
Hello, Engine Room!
- The panel is flooded!
- If the water hits those hot boilers...
Help!
Help!
You trying to drown me?
Where are the others?
See anybody?
Nobody left but us two and... that fella.
Doc! Help!
- Look!
- Shark!
Ohh! It got me!
Hello!
Is anybody here?
Anybody around, I say.
Oh, hello.
Is this your house?
I'm not trying to break in, but I've been in a wreck.
Our yacht just sunk with all hands.
I got ashore and found your place here by accident.
I'm not trying to intrude, but I'm in sort of a jam.
Don't you understand any English?
Lvan does not speak any language.
He has the misfortune to be dumb.
Oh, hello.
Are you the owner here?
Yes.
Welcome to my poor fortress.
- Fortress?
- It once was.
Built by the Portuguese, centuries ago.
I have had the ruins restored to make my home here.
I am Count Zaroff.
My name's Robert Rainsford.
Glad to meet you.
Very glad.
Lvan is a Cossack.
I am afraid, like all my fellow countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.
Smile, Ivan.
I was trying to make him understand there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.
But how appalling!
And you mean to say that you are the only survivor?
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
You're certain?
I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been.
The swellest crowd on Earth... my best friends.
- It's incredible.
- Such things are always incredible.
Death is for others, not for ourselves.
That is how most of my other guests have felt.
Your other guests?
You mean this has happened before?
My fellow, we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house.
It would seem that this island were cursed.
That's just what the captain said.
Only he thought it was uninhabited.
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.
- Well, it's a break for me, anyway.
- My house is yours.
Oh, by the way. You'll want to change those wet rags immediately.
Yes. They look about the way I feel.
Yes.
I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests... that you can possibly get into.
Lvan will show you to your room.
- Thank you.
- You'll find a stiff drink there also.
Thanks a lot.
All pleasure is mine.
Come in.
- Ready, Rainsford?
- All set.
I'm afraid we have finished dinner.
But I have ordered something for you.
Thanks. I don't feel like eating, though.
Oh. Well, perhaps later.
Now, then, what do you say to coffee... and most charming company?
It is hard to forget your comrades' fate, I know... but our feminine guest is easily perturbed.
If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter.
A- Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel.
- Why, sure. Of course.
- Thank you.
Miss Trowbridge, may I present
Mr. Robert Rainsford.
- Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.
How are you, old chap?
Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?
- Coming out of it now, thanks.
- We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?
Indeed we do.
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.
Vodka, that's the stuff!
One shot'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java.
Have to toss it off, though.
Like this.
Now, Martin, you don't have to drink it all tonight, do you?
Don't be ridiculous, sis.
We are victims of circumstance.
Same as Mr. Rainsford.
And if anyone has a right to his liquor, it's a victim of circumstance.
- Isn't that so, Count?
- Of course, yes.
- You were in a shipwreck too?
- Yes.
Our lifeboat was the only one saved... my brother and I and two sailors.
The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs.
Those channel lights must have been shifted.
- I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report 'em... just as soon as we get back to the mainland.
You see, the count has only one launch... and that's under repair.
Russians are not the best mechanics.
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient a few days longer.
It's all right with me. I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now.
Speaking of that, perhaps now you'll tell us... a little bit about who you are.
Just sketchily, you know... born, married, why I left my last job.
No, no, no, no.
One moment, please.
Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house.
We entertain a celebrity,
Miss Trowbridge.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I know. Flagpole sitter.
- I know. He wrote some books.
- No, he lived some books.
If I am not mistaken, this is Mr. Robert Rainsford... who hunts big game so adventurously.
Yeah? Here's to ya.
- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little. "
No, I have read your books.
I read all books on hunting.
- A papiroso?
- Thank you.
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view.
- What do you mean, "sane"?
- Cigarette?
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse.
Let me see.
How did you put it?
"Hunting is as much a game as stud poker... only the limits are higher. "
- You have put our case perfectly.
- Then you're a hunter yourself?
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.
He sleeps all day and hunts all night.
And what's more, Rainsford, he'll have you doing the same thing.
We'll have capital sport together,
I hope.
Don't encourage him.
He's had our two sailors so busy... chasing around the woods after flora and fauna... that we haven't seen them for three days.
But what do you hunt here?
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.
I have done a rare thing.
I have invented a new sensation.
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.
What is this sensation, Count?
Mr. Rainsford,
God made some men poets.
Some He made kings, some beggars.
Me, He made a hunter.
My hand was made for the trigger, my father told me.
He was a very rich man... with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.
When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun.
- Good for him.
- My life has been one glorious hunt.
It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.
- But when the revolution...
- Look out.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Count Zaroff was so interesting...
I didn't realize the danger.
Oh, it's all right now. What were you saying about the revolution, Count?
Oh, merely that I escaped with most of my fortune.
Naturally, I continued to hunt all over the world.
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this.
That must have been a close call.
Yes. It still bothers me sometimes.
However, in two months
I was on my way to the Amazon.
I'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning.
No, no, no.
No sport at all.
Well, conditions are bad everywhere these days.
One night, as I lay in my tent with this... this head of mine... a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain.
Hunting was beginning to bore me.
Is that such a terrible thought,
Count?
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has been the whip for all other passions.
When I lost my love of hunting...
I lost my love of life... of love.
Well, you seem to have stood it pretty well.
I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage.
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow.
Tartar which?
Tartar war bow...
That one up there.
It's cute.
Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it... but alas, even that was too deadly.
What I needed was not a new weapon... but a new animal.
- A new animal?
- Exactly so.
You found one?
Yes.
Here on my island...
I hunt the most dangerous game.
"The most dangerous game"?
You mean tigers?
Tigers?
No.
The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.
I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water. Was that it?
It's no use, Rainsford.
He won't tell.
He won't even let you see his trophy room... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.
My one secret. I keep it as a surprise for my guests... against the rainy day of boredom.
You let me in on that game... and I'll bet you
I go for it.
You know, Rainsford, he hasn't failed yet.
If he says a thing is good, it is good.
He's a judge of liquor, wizard at contract... plays the piano... anything you want.
He's a good host and a good scholar, eh, Count?
Yes, yes.
You want me to go hunting?
You just say the word. We're pals.
We'll have a big party, get cockeyed and go hunting.
A completely civilized point of view.
I tell you what you do. You come to my place in the Adirondacks, see.
We'll have a private car, liquor and gals on the trip... and the guides will make the deers behave.
I think we'd better change the subject.
All right.
Change the subject.
Oh, I know!
Play the piano, huh?
If you wish.
Good idea. Play the piano.
Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.
Perhaps the count doesn't want to play.
There you go, sis, throwing cold water.
Leave me alone.
I know where the piano is.
I'm perfectly sober.
Charming simplicity.
"Completely civilized," did you say?
He talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt.
We barbarians know that it is after the chase... and then only that man revels.
It does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast.
Of course, yes. You know the saying of the Ugandi chieftains...
"Hunt first the enemy, then the woman. "
That's the savages' idea everywhere.
It is the natural instinct.
What is woman... even such a woman as this... until the blood is quickened by the kill?
- Oh, I don't know.
- "Oh, I don't know. "
You Americans.
One passion builds upon another.
Kill!
Then love.
When you have known that... you will have known ecstasy.
Oh, Martin!
Here you see Zaroff, the keyboard king... in his Branca Island hour.
Come on, Count.
Now, you show them.
- What do you suggest?
- Oh, just a good tune.
But not highbrow, like last night.
- Just a good tune, see?
- I see.
Oh, his hunting dogs.
Keep your voice low and listen.
It isn't true about the launch needing repairs.
I heard it leave the boathouse last night. It returned this morning.
You mean he's keeping you from returning to the mainland?
Yes.
Well, perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people.
Two, maybe.
There were four of us a week ago.
- The other two have disappeared.
- What do you mean?
One night after dinner, the count took one of our sailors... down to see his trophy room... at the foot of those stone steps.
- That iron door?
- Yes.
Two nights later he took the other there.
Neither has been seen since.
Have you asked him about them?
He says they've gone hunting.
Oh, be careful.
He's watching us.
Will you smile, as if I'd said something funny?
Now look here. You must be mistaken.
Not now.
Applaud.
- Attaboy! Attaboy!
- Thank you.
What did I tell you?
Smacks a mean ivory, eh, Rainsford?
It was splendid.
Don't stop, please.
I'm afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience.
Well, I expect it's rather difficult for Mr. Rainsford... to concentrate on anything after all he's been through.
My dear lady, you are pleading for yourself.
I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes.
Excuse me.
You know, the count's worse than a family governess.
Every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children.
Oh, no, my dear. No.
Charming children.
There, you hear that, sis?
Now trot along upstairs and don't bother us grownups anymore.
Well, after that I guess...
I guess I'll have to go.
- Good night, Mr. Rainsford.
- Good night.
We'll be seeing each other at breakfast.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, sis. We won't be seeing each other at breakfast.
Oh, my dear Rainsford,
I have been most inconsiderate.
You must be feeling the need of sleep too.
- Yes, I am just about all in.
- Then Ivan will show you to your room.
Oh, Martin, turn in early, please?
Don't worry. The count'll take care of me, all right.
Indeed I shall.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.
Sleep well.
Oh, uh, well, here's to long life.
A long life.
Tell me, Mr. Trowbridge... are you also fatigued?
Tired? Me?
You know I'm not.
You know, Rainsford, we two are just alike.
Up all night and sleep all day.
Well, good night.
Well, what are we gonna do, huh?
What's the big idea?
I thought that perhaps... tonight you would like to see my trophy room?
Your trophy room?
I'm sure you will find it most... interesting.
Say, that's a great idea.
Ho-ho. Now we're pals.
No more secrets now, huh?
- We'll make a night of it.
- I hope so, Mr. Trowbridge.
Just you and I... pals.
We'll have fun together, huh?
Precisely, yes.
Fun together.
Attaboy, County, old boy, old boy, County.
Please let me come in.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm frightened.
- What was it? Those dogs?
- My brother.
I've been listening for hours for him to come upstairs.
I've just gone to his room.
He isn't there!
- He's probably somewhere with the count.
- That's just what I'm afraid of.
Count Zaroff is planning something... about my brother and me.
You don't really think anything has happened to your brother?
Oh, I don't know, but we've got to find him.
Won't you help me?
Why, of course I'll help you.
- Where do you think he's gone?
- Where did the others go?
The iron door.
I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes.
Thank you.
That's queer.
It's unlocked.
Zaroff! He's coming down.
Back here, quick!
Where is my brother?
You killed him!
You killed my brother!
You!
Why, you...
Come, come, my dear Rainsford.
I don't want to treat you like my other guests.
You and I, we are hunters.
So that's your most dangerous game.
Yes. My dear fellow,
I intended to tell you last night... but you know, Miss Trowbridge...
You hunted him like an animal.
I know what you think, but you are wrong.
He was sober and fit for sport when I sent him out.
An hour or two strapped up in here brought him to his senses.
You raving maniac!
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take it off... when we've finished.
The stupid fellow tried to escape through the swamps of Fog Hollow.
You see, when I first began stocking my island... many of my guests thought I was joking... so I established this trophy room.
I always bring them here before the hunt.
An hour with my trophies... and they usually do their best to keep away from me.
Where do you get these poor devils?
Providence provided my island with dangerous reefs.
But there are light buoys to mark the safe channel.
They do not always mark it.
- You shifted them.
- Precisely right.
Too bad your yacht should have suffered... but at least it brought us together.
You take half-drowned men from ships you've wrecked... and drive them out to be hunted.
I give them every consideration... good food, exercise... everything to get them in splendid shape.
- To be shot down in cold blood.
- Oh, no, no.
Oh, I admit, with this annoying fellow... but usually I give them hunting clothes... a woodsman's knife and a full day's start.
I even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark.
And if one eludes me only till sunrise... he wins the game.
Suppose he refuses to be hunted.
Ivan is such an artist with these.
Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose to hunt.
And when they win?
To date I have not lost.
Oh, Rainsford, you'll find this game worth playing.
When the next ship arrives, we'll have gorgeous sport together.
You murdering rat!
I'm a hunter not an assassin.
Come, Rainsford.
Say you will hunt with me.
Hunt men?
Say you will hunt with me!
No?
What do you think I am?
One, I fear, who dare not follow his own convictions... to their logical conclusion.
I'm afraid in this instance,
Mr. Rainsford... you may have to follow them.
What do you mean?
I shall not wait for the next ship.
Four o'clock.
The sun is just rising.
Come, Mr. Rainsford.
Let us not waste time.
Ivan.
Your fangs and claws,
Mr. Rainsford.
Bob! Bob!
Lvan.
Bob! Bob, what are they going to do?
- I'm going to be hunted.
- Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge.
Outdoor chess.
His brain against mine.
His good craft against mine.
- And the prize?
- The prize?
You may recall what I said last evening.
Only after the kill... does man know the true ecstasy of love.
Suppose you lose.
If I do not...
What shall I say?..
Find you... between midnight and sunrise tomorrow, freedom for both of you.
- I'm going with you.
- No. He'll kill you too.
Not at all.
One does not kill a female animal.
If you lose,
I can easily recapture her alive.
All right.
I'll take her with me then.
We'll set him a trail he'll remember.
It's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow.
Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.
Don't lose your nerve.
We'll beat this thing.
- The others didn't.
- We will.
Come on.
Let's get going.
It seems as though we've come miles.
Yeah, but three hours doesn't take you far in this jungle.
Come on.
Let's keep going.
Come on.
Just a little more of this, then easy downhill going.
We'll soon be safe.
No wonder he was so sure.
This island is no bigger than a deer park.
Oh, Bob!
Come on, now.
What are we going to do?
We didn't each live through a shipwreck to let this crazy man hunter worry us.
I shouldn't have come with you.
You might beat him if you were alone.
Alone? And leave you here with that savage?
Not a chance.
Now we've got to think of something to worry him.
You'd never get near him.
He'd shoot on sight.
Weapons aren't everything in the jungle.
Say, did you notice that leaning tree down there?
- The one we just passed?
- Yes. I want to show you something.
You see? If that supporting branch were cut away... this fallen tree would make a perfect
Malay deadfall.
A Malay deadfall? What's that?
A man-killing contraption the natives use.
It would stop that madman, all right.
Trouble is, it takes quite a few hours to build.
He said he wouldn't follow till midnight.
That's right. If you help me,
I think we'll have time.
Come on.
We'll cut some strong vines.
There. Almost ready.
This bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie.
He'll have been on his way almost an hour now.
Look out!
Don't touch that trip line.
You'll have a two-ton tree down on your back.
- Jungle wood's as heavy as iron.
- Will it really work?
I've never known a living thing to get by one yet.
Look here.
You touch that trip line... it'll pull that trigger free.
Once that's loose, there's nothing to keep the log from coming down.
It'll crash down and kill anything underneath it.
Look.
We're ready.
Let him come.
Give me that knife.
Come out, Rainsford.
Why prolong it?
I'll not bungle this shot.
You'll never even feel it.
But surely you don't think that anyone who has hunted leopards... would follow you into that ambush?
Oh, very well.
If you choose to play the leopard...
I shall hunt you like a leopard.
Wait. Maybe it's a trick.
Eve.
Why did he go?
He's playing with us... like a cat with a mouse.
What do you mean?
You heard him say he'd hunt us as he'd hunt a leopard.
That means he's gone for his high-powered rifle.
His rifle?
Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!
- Run, quick!
- Eve, wait.
- No, I tell you, no!
- Don't stop! No!
Wait. That's Fog Hollow ahead.
- Fog Hollow?
- The swamp where he caught the others.
We haven't a chance of keeping ahead of him there.
- But there's no place else to run.
- That's just what he's counting on.
We've got two hours till dawn. We've got to use our brains instead of our legs.
But he'll have his rifle.
And we'll have a man trap.
Look.
It makes me dizzy.
Cover this over.
When Mr. Zaroff falls down there, he'll be all through hunting.
Quick. Gather some leaves and grass.
I'll cut some branches.
Yes. Very good, Rainsford.
Very good.
You have not won yet.
Look at your watch.
Are you looking at it?
Still half an hour till sunrise.
Swamp or no swamp, we can keep ahead of him that long.
As you are doubtless saying, the odds are against me.
You have made my rifle useless in the fog.
You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle.
Those animals I cornered... now I know how they felt.
Achmed, Miss Trowbridge... bring her here.
Now!
My dear Rainsford,
I congratulate you.
You have beaten me.
Not yet.
Oh, but of course.
I insist.
Why, you're...
You're not even wounded.
You hit the dog not me.
I took a chance and went over with him.
A clever trick, Rainsford.
I cheerfully admit defeat.
Here's the key of the boathouse.
The door is in the trophy room.
You and Miss Trowbridge may leave at once.
No!
Ohh!
Bob!
Eve!
The boat! Quick!
Impossible.

- Not yet!
- About time we came up with it.
- Look to starboard!
Where?
I've lost it. It's gone. Did you see it?
No.
Nothing there!
Argh!
Argh!
Tell 'em to make sure no-one gets clear of the wreck!
No-one, d'you hear?
That's all! Load up the horses!
Carry the rest yourselves!
Come on!
Get the stuff up to the inn!
Come on!
Come along now!
You're sure no-one got away?
You can reckon on that, Joss.
Aye, you can reckon on that.
Joss!
Help!
I told you to make certain, you fool!
Can't you use your eyes?
Do you want the lot of us to swing?
I don't like it. I don't like it at all.
- That place gives me the creeps.
- Eh?
That place. Jamaica Inn. It's got a bad name.
It's not healthy, that's why.
There's queer things goes on there.
Queer things. I won't stop there, not if she were to offer me double fare.
Is Jamaica Inn on this road?
Yes.
How much further is Jamaica Inn?
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Gee up!
Why are we going so fast?
What's happened? Have the horses bolted?
BOTH: It's Jamaica Inn.
But this is where I want to get out.
Hi, coachman! Why don't you stop?
I want to get out!
Coachman, listen to me, you fool!
Pull up at once!
Why don't you stop, you fool?
Stop, I tell you!
Whoa!
Why didn't you stop? Are you deaf?
I've been shouting myself silly.
You've taken me past Jamaica Inn.
Take me back at once.
You'd better try Squire Pengallan's instead.
They say he's partial to young women.
Here's your box. Gee up!
MAN: I think we owe a toast to Sir Humphrey.
Sir Humphrey.
Eh? What?
Jove, yes.
Pengallan.
Thank you.
Might have asked you to drink the health of
His brand-new Majesty George IV, but I forgot.
Fact is, I haven't been on speaking terms for years with the fat fool.
You were much in his company at one time, Sir Humphrey.
When Charlie Fox and Sheridan would be there with him in the Pavilion at Brighton.
In those days he was still a gentleman.
Now he's nothing but a painted bag of maraschino and plum pudding.
WOMAN:
Last summer we made a tour of the lakes.
Which lake do you admire the most,
Sir Humphrey?
Chadwick!
Which lake did I admire the most?
- Windermere, sir.
- Windermere.
It is very beautiful.
Why not a toast to beauty, Sir Humphrey?
Why not?
Chadwick, my figurine.
I need inspiration, by gad.
- Oh, there's beauty.
- But it's not alive.
It's more alive than half the people here.
Look at them, what?
You want to see beauty alive? Chadwick!
Ask Sam how long Nancy's going to be.
- Nancy?
- The most beautiful creature west of Exeter.
That's why he stays here and never comes to London any more.
He keeps a girl here, the monster.
- Then I prefer not to make her acquaintance.
- No. I'm curious.
Yes, by Jove.
Have her in, Pengallan.
Here she is.
My exquisite Nancy.
Brought me in a hundred guineas yesterday.
Ran away with the Bodmin Steeplechase, didn't you, my dear? Chadwick, what's that?
It's a woman, sir.
Don't argue with your women when I'm entertaining.
WOMAN: The coachman left me stranded.
Ask your master to lend me a horse and trap.
Let's have a look at her.
Ringwood, bet you 20-1 in guineas she's ugly.
I'll take you.
Would you er... oblige me by taking off that coat for a moment?
Why should I?
I have a wager here.
Always respect a wager.
Would you allow me?
But you're an exquisite shape, too.
My dear, you're a beauty.
Ringwood!
You've won.
Here y'are!
RINGWOOD:
Look, here. I say, my bet, you know.
"She walks in beauty like the night.
Of cloudless climes and starry skies, hmm?
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect...
...and her eyes."
Thank you, sir, but I didn't come for poetry, but for a horse.
A horse?
Being worthy of Lord Byron's poetry, you shall have the horse.
My name is Sir Humphrey Pengallan.
I'm squire of Pengallan and justice of the peace.
I'm Mary Yellan from Ireland.
- And you're going where?
- To Jamaica Inn.
To Jamaica Inn?
You can't go there.
- Why not?
- Sam!
This young lady wants to know why she can't go to Jamaica Inn. Tell her.
Ooh, very rough there, miss.
No place for a young lady.
See, even Sam knows that.
No, you better stay here.
No, of course not.
I've come all the way from Ireland alone, because I've nobody there now.
Your parents?
I'm going to Jamaica Inn, because my Aunt Patience is there.
What a lovely horse.
Yes. Could you ride her?
Yes, of course.
I've been riding since I was a child.
Well, you shall ride her to the inn.
Thank you, but I've got a box outside.
Oh, um... l'll take the box and conduct you myself to er... your relative.
Sam, saddle the bay as well.
Chadwick!
Chadwick, this is Miss Mary Yellan who's going to Jamaica Inn.
So she said, sir. I don't understand.
You've never understood anything, so why be surprised at yourself now?
Try to understand this.
Miss Yellan is my friend.
If she returns here at any time, admit her at once. See that she has everything she requires.
Give me my greatcoat and muffler.
And a thick scarf for this lady.
Pardon me.
Chadwick,
I'll have some hot brandy when I come back and see that they put a warming pan in the bed.
Very good, Sir Humphrey.
If you'll wait a moment, miss, I'll get the scarf.
But I really don't need it.
If I can be of any service, please command me.
Remember, I'm Pengallan, and this is Pengallan land.
- Don't forget, now.
- No, I won't.
Good night, Miss er... Yellan.
Good night, Sir Humphrey.
Who's there?
What do you want?
Does Mrs Patience Merlyn live here?
She might.
And she might not.
Depending on your business.
I'm her niece from Ireland.
You must have heard.
I'm coming to live with my aunt and uncle.
What?
What put that in your head?
Who told you so, eh?
That's my business.
Go and tell your master I'm here.
Aren't you going to give me a kiss first?
You'll... You'll suffer for this when my uncle's told of it. I'll have you turned out of here.
- You'll see.
- Oh, you wouldn't be hard on us, ma'am.
- You see, your aunt would miss me.
- Get out of my way!
Correct.
Entirely correct.
I'm your aunt's loving husband, your great big uncle Joss.
Come on.
WOMAN: Who's there?
There we are.
Aunt Patience.
Mary. Mary, my sister's Mary.
- You know me, then, Aunt Patience?
- Yes, my dear, yes.
You're so like your mother.
When I heard your voice at first,
I thought it was hers.
And then when I saw you,
I thought for the moment...
She said you were expecting her to stay.
No, Joss, no.
But I wrote to you telling you everything.
Nothing came.
You wrote...
Mary, you're in black.
Yes.
Mother died three weeks ago today.
(Mumbles) I'll have a drink.
How did it happen?
She hadn't been well, but she said she must leave her bed and work.
You know how Mother was.
Patience. Don't stand there yappering, woman.
Get the girl's box inside.
Yes. Yes, Joss.
No, no, Aunt Patience, let me.
Easy, easy.
Your new uncle's very particular.
He's not the sort to let lovely ladies spoil themselves with rough work.
He knows different, does Joss.
Lively with it, Patience, my dear.
- I'll take this end.
- No. I can manage. It isn't heavy, Mary.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Mary, don't say anything.
I've had pretty women pay me compliments before.
Stand clear there.
There.
Our Mary's a little bit sour tonight, but, bless you, the best of us can't be sweet-tempered on an empty belly.
Fill it up for her.
Yes, I'll get her something to eat.
Mary, if you'll come with me.
I won't be a minute.
If you'll sit down and rest.
- I'll set the table.
- No, no, no, no.
You'll be tired after your long journey.
I'm not. Where's the cloth and supper things?
Over there in the middle drawer.
It's nothing. Only some late customers in the parlour. They'll be going soon, no doubt.
Shut that gab!
Keep it quiet.
- You see, boys, we've got a visitor.
- Harry told us.
She's a neat piece from what I've seen of her.
Very neat.
That's all you think of, women.
Vanities of the flesh.
Following petticoats along the path to everlasting corruption.
- Salvation's off again.
- You can laugh now.
But you'll sing a different tune, when you're roasting in the consuming fire that's waiting for all of us.
Me included.
- Where are you going, Harry?
- To pay my respects.
She's not partial to your sort, Harry.
What about me in my new lace cuffs?
Anything in mind that way yourself?
Well, I hadn't given the matter a thought, but I might.
I said I might, Harry.
All right, Joss.
Added to which, she's my wife's niece from Ireland.
Why didn't you say that before?
My business, Harry, my business.
I knew a girl once.
Come from Ireland.
Talked funny, she did. Like a foreigner.
But it was all right.
I'm not what you expected, am I?
I was only a child when you went away,
Aunt Patience.
I can only just remember you then.
And what was I like then?
You were beautiful.
Was I?
Yes...
I suppose I was.
No doubt your mother told you all about me.
You're thinking I'm paid out for leaving home.
For running away. Well, you're wrong.
Joss has been a good husband to me.
There's nothing I'd change even if I could.
It's hard work and it's risky work.
It's work we'll rot in chains for one day.
All in a neat row.
And what do we get out of it? Next to nothing.
Why, a man's share doesn't come to enough to hold body and soul together.
That last wreck didn't bring in what it should have. That's what I say.
That's what you say.
No, that's what Sydney said.
- So, you've been yapping, eh?
- No, no, Mr Merlyn, I assure you.
Showing off your arithmetic, eh?
Doing pretty sums for poor lads that can't read nor reckon.
You're out to list the goods, not set a price on them.
Just a minute, Joss.
I told him the last haul didn't fetch a quarter of what it should have done.
You did, eh?
Reckoning by our share of it, maybe you're not getting the right price for the stuff.
Maybe there's a leak somewhere.
You're looking thoughtful, Harry.
Perhaps you'll give us the benefit of your sentiments.
If any.
About this leak, I think the word is, if you've a notion in your mind, Harry, don't be bashful.
Spit it out. We'd be glad to listen.
I wouldn't know about that, Joss.
Well, perhaps I would.
Supposing there is a leak.
And supposing it happens before the goods get to the inn, do you follow me?
Some absent-minded chap might mislay a piece or two, in a manner of speaking, on the way up from the wreck.
Have you ever thought of that?
How long have you been with me?
A matter of five years, Joss.
Salvation?
We've been lost souls together for two years and seven months, Joss.
Sydney?
Almost two and a half years, Mr Merlyn.
Dandy?
Let's see, now. I was carrying on with a bit in Penzance around that time.
Here she is. Annie.
That makes it four years, Joss.
And you?
I'll tell them for you.
Mr Trehearne has been with us the enormous time of two months.
Eight weeks.
56 days.
How's that for arithmetic?
What do you say to that, Mr Trehearne?
PATIENCE: Joss.
JOSS: Clear out!
Joss, please.
Why, what's wrong?
Joss, Mary's just told me, she came to the inn with Squire Pengallan.
He asked her why she was coming here and about us.
And, seeing he's a magistrate, I thought...
Joss, you don't think he's found out anything?
What's this about Sir Humphrey, eh?
How did you come to meet him?
Why, I called on him.
The coach took me a long way past here.
So I went to the house for help.
Sir Humphrey was very kind and most obliging.
He knows how to behave towards a woman.
He even lent me a horse to ride here.
One that won him a hundred guineas in the county steeplechase.
We didn't get the haul we hoped for tonight, sir.
There was a full gale blowing down there and the ship broke clean in two, sir.
Get a pair of scissors, Merlyn.
Yes, sir.
Why did you leave this blood on?
What do you think we're conducting?
A slaughterhouse? Cut it off.
There were so many tumbling in.
It was butcher's work.
What have they to live for, poor scum?
You were right to put them out of their misery.
Look at this exquisite stuff. Worth the miserable lives of a hundred rum-rotten sailors.
Perfection of its own kind.
That's all that matters, Merlyn.
Whatever is perfect of its kind.
I'd transport all the riffraff in Bristol to Botany Bay to save one beautiful woman a single headache.
Something you don't understand. Never will.
Because you're neither a philosopher nor a gentleman.
- But you made certain, no survivors?
- Certain sure, sir.
I'm sorry about that girl Mary, sir.
We didn't know she was coming.
She'll be no harm.
I'll get her away in the morning.
Make up the fire. It's cold.
- Get me a drink.
- Yes, sir.
I didn't expect you so soon, sir, before I'd put the light in the window.
A man's a fool to stir out on a night like this.
Taking a bit of a risk, wasn't it, coming before I got the men out of the way?
Everything's a risk.
This girl, Mary, not without character.
A mind of her own.
Oh, you leave her to me, sir.
I'll manage her, just as I manage my Patience.
- Have you looked at the stuff?
- I don't see any resemblance to your wife.
Maybe not, but my Patience was a bit of a beauty when I married her. Why, I...
This won't do, Merlyn. It's not enough.
No, sir, it's not quite what we looked for.
Better luck next time, eh, Sir Humphrey?
We could do with it.
The men are getting impatient.
I can deal with them, but they're asking where the money goes. They want more.
What for? Rot their innards out sooner with the blue ruin you sell 'em?
Listen, Merlyn. I want more.
I know what to do with money when I have it.
That's why I must have it.
- Do you understand? I must have it.
- Yes, sir.
Anything more this week while the weather still holds?
Perhaps tomorrow.
I've been thinking about your wife's niece.
It seems a pity to bundle her off before she's seen anything of the county.
I've nothing against her stopping.
Provided, of course, she's kept out of the way.
Up to your rooms, both of you.
Patience, take her supper upstairs.
Now, try and sleep, dear. You must be tired.
Good night.
- Look at that.
- Ooh, how much?
You was right, Joss. See that?
Best part of fifteen pound in gold.
What did I tell you?
JOSS: You've got yourself in a pretty mess, Mr Trehearne.
What have you got to say?
Get me a drink.
Choking gives you a thirst.
Thomas, I'm sure you'll oblige the gentleman.
Seems I'm a good guesser, Mr Trehearne.
How did you get it?
Saved.
You mean, you've been selling stuff on the side.
I'm ashamed of you, Mr Trehearne.
That's what I am.
Taking the bread out of the mouths of your pals.
There's your leak.
Not true.
He's making fools of the lot of you.
Where do you think the stuff goes?
Who gets rid of it?
Do you think Joss is in this by himself?
Well, go on, ask him! Ask him who!
DANDY: That was a cosh. Clean out.
The dirty thief.
- He asked for it all right.
- He done us. We do him.
What are we all waiting for?
Try the other room.
See if you can find me a nice beam.
About six foot two off the floor.
Go on.
JOSS:
Hold on. I'll see if the women are out of the way.
Don't want a lot of squawking.
Hurry up.
It's a new chap, Trehearne.
They found this gold on him.
Know anything about him?
He came from St lves a couple of months ago, recommended by a pal.
- Can't just kick him out. That's obvious.
- He might talk.
- The men want to string him up tonight.
- Really? That's a trifle formal, isn't it?
Pistol. Oh, no. Too noisy.
Of course, you wouldn't want to alarm your wife's niece.
I suppose it's as good a way as any.
No need for you to go. Tell 'em.
I haven't finished talking to you.
- Harry?
- Yes?
Get on with it.
- I'll be down in a minute.
- All right.
Come on, Salvation. Look sharp.
Stand back, the rest of you!
We don't want any gawpers here.
This is private, see. If you want a public hanging,
Syd, you won't have to wait long.
And you'll get a fine view of it from the best position. Inside the rope.
You're not old enough yet.
SALVATION: What about Joss?
HARRY: He says to get it over.
DANDY: Is this the place, Harry?
HARRY: That's it. Plenty of clearance.
Anything worth doing, I say, is worth doing proper.
Come on.
Let's make a quick job of it before he comes round.
I won't be a party to that, Thomas.
It's only being kind to him.
He won't know nothing about it.
It's no kindness to send a man into the next world unawares.
It's heathen. That's what it is, I say.
Bring him round with a nip of spirits and give him a fair chance to meditate.
I don't like the thought of it somehow.
It's like doing it in cold blood.
Come on. He's heavy.
- What do you say, Harry?
- I say shut your misbegotten mouths.
Both of you.
Aha!
At it again, Dandy?
Grab, grab, grab all the time.
We'll spin a coin for them buckles, when I say the word.
Let's have a light.
HARRY: All together.
Pull!
- Don't you let him have them, Harry!
- Go on.
- Throttle him, Dandy.
- Go on, Harry.
HARRY: Shut your mouth.
Do you want to bring Joss down?
You've got to get out of here.
They'll be back in a minute.
Please, you must try.
Quick, quick.
- You mustn't stop here. Get away.
- I couldn't leave Aunt Patience.
Please, you must hurry.
Quick. Before Joss...
There you are, my dear.
Been saying good night to Patience?
Yes, I've been thinking things over.
"She's a sweet, pretty girl," I said to myself,
"with a lot of character."
It seems a pity to send her away, before she's hardly seen anything of the county.
"She can stay here," I said,
"just as long as she feels inclined."
HARRY: Joss! Joss!
Come down, Joss!
He's been took, Joss.
- What? Who?
- Trehearne, he's been took by the angels.
- Of course, he's been took. I know that.
- But alive, Joss. Alive.
Mary.
It was you.
You set that man free.
Listen to me. You must leave Jamaica Inn now, this minute, do you hear?
There y'are.
That blasted girl, I'll kill her!
For pity's sake, go now.
Before Joss comes up.
Where's that girl?
Where is she?
You let her go.
JOSS:
Thomas, take this lamp. Look in the stables.
Harry, give me a hand.
We'll go through the yard.
If some of you don't get a move on,
I'll break your blasted necks!
SALVATION: They can't have got away so soon.
- We can't stay here. Come on.
- Where?
Down by the harbour. I know a place.
We'll be safe there for a while.
Come on. Hurry.
SYDNEY: Joss! Shall I search the moor?
HARRY: Try the yard.
We'll have to get 'em, if we stay out all night.
There's not a sign of either of them.
- They've got clear. Any luck?
- No.
If we don't find 'em, we'll swing for it, like as not.
Harry, take a couple of men down to the coast.
Thomas, get your brother and any of our chaps you can find. Search the moors.
- What are you going to do, Joss?
- I'll take the Bodmin turnpike.
SIR HUMPHREY: Chadwick!
- It's very late, sir.
- She was a very charming girl, Chadwick.
I didn't mention it before, sir, but the butcher was here while you were at dinner.
- He wants his account settled.
- Remarkably unattractive occupation.
Drearily dismembering carcass after carcass.
- I suppose they must live, sir.
- Must they?
There's nearly Â£40 owing to the butcher,
Â£35 to the baker.
You see, sir, butcher, baker...
Don't butcher and baker me!
You old numbskull!
I'm sorry, huh, Chadwick, what?
Doing your duty.
That's all, Master Humphrey.
These outbursts of mine are quite inexcusable.
I can't think what comes over me.
By the way, Chadwick, what happened to my grandfather?
Yes, went mad, didn't he?
No need for you to hang about, Chadwick.
Go to bed.
How dare you come here to me.
Haven't I told you a score of times?
Yes, but Trehearne has got away.
That girl set him free.
I couldn't help it. It was while I was with you.
- What have you done with her?
- She's gone, too.
Oh, a general exodus, apparently.
You persuaded your wife to remain, I hope.
The men are out looking for them now.
We're doing our best.
Is that all you came here to say?
That chap Trehearne knows too much.
If he was to inform against me and the others...
You're losing your head, Merlyn.
Even if Trehearne lives to do any informing, he'll do it here.
I'm the only justice in the neighbourhood.
If you can't keep your wits about you, kindly allow me to keep mine.
If I didn't, you'd never see another wreck.
When the brains are out, the body dies, Merlyn.
And I needn't remind you that in this little organisation, you and your fellows are only the carcass.
- The brains are here, what?
- I'm sorry. I was only trying to warn you.
Will you let me do the warning?
If you want any more fat pickings on the shore, just obey orders.
And don't come here again. Get out! Get out!
Hey! What?
Come back. What on earth?
- Now, what do you think you're doing?
- Let go!
Don't be a fool. You can't even row.
Leave me alone!
You're not afraid of me?
You are. Well, that's women for you.
Save your life one minute
and frightened for their own the next.
Yes, I'm not a very pretty sight at the moment, but I don't bite.
You think I don't know why my aunt is frightened for her life, that I don't know what you
- and the rest of you are doing at Jamaica Inn?
- No. What?
Thieves, smugglers, cut-throats, for all I know, and I'm not staying!
Look!
Harry, here!
A very significant piece of flotsam, eh?
BOY: It came out of the cave.
Suppose you ask your brother to take you for a nice row? Follow me?
- Rather!
- Can I go, too, Harry? I saw it first.
No, you cut back and tell Joss everything's lovely. Run!
Dandy, you go and get some rope.
This way.
You know what you've done? The tide's going out now, but it'll be high water again before dark.
We can't stay here without that boat.
We'll have to run for it as soon as the tide's low enough.
Trust me to land myself with a woman.
- On the other hand, you did save my life.
- I hope you'll make better use of it in the future.
- A tall order for a desperate character like me.
- No doubt.
A smuggler and a cut-throat, I think you said.
Do you think there's any hope for me?
- Tell me, what ought I to do?
- Anything you please.
I used to be a sailor. I could go back to sea.
- I'm not in the least interested.
- You must be.
- You're responsible for me.
- I am not.
But for you, I shouldn't be here at all.
You can't deny that.
When we're safe in Truro,
I shall put myself in your hands.
- Oh, please be quiet.
- Oh, cheer up. We'll be there by...
SALVATION: Take the little book.
There's a beautiful hymn on page 13.
"While at death's door I trembling stand."
Very comforting.
- Makes dying a pleasure, so he says.
- A handsome couple.
Breaks my heart to disturb 'em.
Coming down!
HARRY: Will you send the lady up first or do you fancy it yourself?
DANDY: Ladies first, I always say.
- What can we do?
- They know we're stuck.
They must have seen the boat drift out.
HARRY: Just in case you'd like a bit of help,
Mr Trehearne, your old friend Thomas is coming down to offer his arm.
He's out.
Any more? We're fond of company.
You'll get it all right. Never you fear.
It'll be a pleasure. Come on. Who's it to be?
Here, Belcher. Grab this.
Slip it round that bit of rock. Quick!
Do you hear that?
There's only one way out of this.
Can you swim?
Just to please you, Mr Trehearne, so you won't feel lonely, we're all three coming down.
Please don't trouble with me. I'll be in the way.
It'll be hard enough for you getting away alone.
I'll be all right. Joss daren't harm me.
- Can you swim?
- A little.
- Take off that dress and your shoes.
- I can't do that.
- Take it off.
- I can't.
- All right, then. I will.
- No, you won't. I will.
(Yawns) I shall be glad when this little job's over.
We've been up all night.
Yes, it'll be nice to get to bed.
DANDY: What about the girl?
Do we hand her over to Joss?
They're coming. Come on!
HARRY: Now, Mr Trehearne...
That's the spirit. You're doing fine.
That's funny.
First time I've ever seen a woman swimming.
All this... this salt.
Look! They've sent a boat. It's coming this way.
Quick! Those rocks.
Hold onto my shoulder. Are you all right?
- Hold on. The boat's coming.
- I can't.
(Jem whispers) Here it is.
- Keep it up. They're going.
- It's no good.
- I'm going.
- Hang on to me.
SIR HUMPHREY: Dowland.
Ah, good morning, Dowland.
I haven't had a taste of that sloe gin of yours this year.
- I'm three pounds short, Squire Pengallan.
- I told you...
Dowland, I want money just as you do.
I can't be Squire Pengallan on nothing.
- Why are you short?
- That lad of mine.
- He went down with a bad leg and it won't heal.
- Take him to Dr Mackintosh.
Give the doctor my compliments.
Ask him to look at the leg. Pay Â£3 next time.
- Thank you, Squire.
- Give him a receipt, Davis.
- But I warned...
- The receipt, Davis.
This man's forefathers were farming Pengallan land when yours were hedge tinkers. Next.
- Where can we go? Which way?
- We'd best make for the turnpike.
Wait! What house is that over there?
- The Squire's.
- You mean Sir Humphrey?
I know him. I was there last night.
He'll be glad to help us. Come on.
This is the fellow I mentioned, Sir Humphrey.
Burdkin. A rank radical.
DAVIS: Burdkin.
Er, well, Burdkin?
I've come to complain. I want my rights.
Your rights? I don't listen to that sort of talk.
- I've the law on my side.
- You haven't.
I'm the law here and on your side I won't be while you take that tone.
Next you'll be telling me you're as good as I am.
I'm a man, same as you.
Put that out of your head before it lands you in the hulks.
You're not as good as I am and never will be.
Nature was against it from the start.
Everything else has been against it since.
I'm a gentleman.
Why, you great...
Have him run out, Davis.
Er, don't give him 24 hours.
If you please, Squire Pengallan.
Why if it isn't Granny Tremarney.
Yes, Your Honour.
It's my roof. I've complained to Mr Davis about it, but he takes no notice. It leaks all the time now.
- Give her a new roof, Davis.
- But, Sir Humphrey...
I said a new roof.
She's my oldest tenant, hm?
While I'm here, she'll be snug.
I'm the only man under the rank of marquis who ever gambled ten years at White's Club and kept his estate out of the hands of the moneylenders.
While I have a roof, she shall have one.
MARY: I must see Sir Humphrey...
- What's this?
MARY:you're to let me in. It's very important.
My dear child, what on earth's happened?
You're... soaked to the skin.
Chadwick, get Mrs Black and close the door.
Come to the fire.
Tell them to go now, Davis. Some other time.
But you're positively blue with cold.
- Where have you been?
- Swimming.
- For our lives.
- Er... Who, er... Who is this?
This is Jem Trehearne.
We got away from Jamaica Inn last night.
It's a horrible place. It's nothing better than a den of smugglers. They'd have murdered him.
- She saved my life, sir.
- Well, this is extraordinary.
We need your help. My aunt's still there.
If you only knew...
You must tell me the whole story, but, first, we must find you some dry things.
Oh, Mrs Black, take this young lady upstairs and see if you can find her something to wear.
Will you come this way, miss?
- Could I speak to you for a moment, please?
- Of course.
SIR HUMPHREY: Really?
Well, er... We, er...
We must see what we can do, hm?
- Thank you. You're very kind.
- Not at all.
Oh, er, excuse me, sir.
Chadwick!
Get the erm... fellow some er... bread and beer.
I'll deal with you later.
MAN: So, I let her have it with nine eight-pounders, then we went alongside...
"Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, of moving accidents by flood and field of hairbreadth 'scapes..."
- Captain Murray, you'll stay to dinner?
- You keep the best table in Cornwall.
- I should hope so. Why go?
- I'm due to rejoin my ship at Falmouth.
By the time you've finished your port and walnuts, I shall be sailing past the house.
- The deuce you will.
I must have a word with you.
- Well?
- Er, in private.
There's nothing you can tell me these gentlemen shouldn't know.
One of a gang of smugglers from Jamaica Inn.
Smugglers, eh?
Have you got any good brandies through?
Well, yes, as a matter of fact,
- I've got a list of them here.
- Kindly remember I'm a justice of the peace.
Nevertheless, I think you'll be rather interested in these brandies.
Erm...
Er, gentlemen,
I think I must look into this matter in private.
- What?
- (Chuckles)
Come along, my dear chap.
Pengallan, if you don't find something good for me, I'll report you to the Commission.
After you, my dear fellow.
I've placed some bread and beer for this person in the harness room.
Have you now? Place some cold chicken and claret "for this person" in the study.
Find some clothes for Mr Trehearne.
Mine would be a trifle generous. One of
Lord George's would be nearer the mark.
- For this gentleman?
- Yes. Will you hurry? Hurry!
- Master Humphrey...
- I must apologise.
I hadn't the least idea who you were. Now, a stiff glass of brandy till you're fed and in dry clothes.
I'm most awfully obliged to you.
Not at all. Come in.
I hold the rank of Lieutenant in His Majesty's Royal Navy.
I was seconded for duty from the Home Office.
I've been at some pains to conceal my identity.
I still haven't the least notion what it's all about, but swallow this before you tell me.
I always had a great admiration for the service.
I knew Collingwood well.
All fine fellows. A trifle desiccated, perhaps.
One can't have everything.
Now, what is all this business?
Smuggling?
No, it's much worse than that, sir. Wrecking.
Deliberate, organised wrecking.
- Not here, though?
- Yes, sir. Along this coast.
Always had wrecks here, you know.
A very dangerous coast.
Lloyds discovered that these wrecks had one curious feature in common.
Indeed? Drink that up.
I think I'll join you with the brandy.
It has been er... quite an eventful morning.
What had these wrecks in common?
There were never any survivors.
Er, Mr Trehearne, if what you tell me is true, it's the most dreadful thing I've ever heard.
- We hear of wrecks down here...
- Lloyds consulted with the Home Office.
They became convinced these wreckers had accurate information
- of the movements and cargoes of ships...
Captain Murray wishes to say goodbye to you, sir.
- Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.
I'm just going. I enjoyed myself immensely.
You're a prince.
- Goodbye, Captain. Bon voyage.
- I'm coming back again.
I shall be thinking of you out there in this wind when I'm sitting over my port tonight.
- All right?
- Jolly good.
Well, er, Mr Trehearne, kindly continue.
My researches took me to Jamaica Inn.
The landlord is the ringleader.
That wreck last night was carried out by his men.
- You were actually there?
- No, thank heaven, I was still on probation.
But I helped carry the goods up afterwards.
Have you erm...
Have you reported all this to your superiors?
No, not yet.
I'm after bigger fry than Joss Merlyn.
I don't follow you. Erm...
You er... said he was the ringleader.
At Jamaica Inn, yes, but he gets his orders from outside.
His information comes from outside.
His thinking's done for him outside.
- By whom?
- I don't know.
Merlyn's own wife doesn't know. The gang don't even know. That's the man we've got to find.
Yes, Joss has called the men for tonight.
There's to be another wreck.
They won't know where until they get information from their leader.
In order to give them that information, he'll be going to the inn tonight.
- We must get there first.
- We can't do that single-handed.
I'll ride for help to the nearest garrison.
But that'll take time. We mustn't let this fellow slip through our fingers.
You and I will go to the inn. My groom can take a message to the garrison at Truro for you.
Take some of those.
You say Merlyn's riffraff won't be there till later?
I fancy we two can hold the fort till the military come.
- I'm game, if you are, sir.
- Excellent. This is positively exciting.
- Come in.
- Chadwick, your money or your life?
- The clothes, sir. I've not told Lord George.
Who's the commander at Truro?
Er...
Captain... Boyle, an Irishman, I believe.
Good fellow in a pinch.
I'll write him a note.
No, I'll do that.
You get into Lord George's breeches.
To, er...
Captain... Boyle... erm... officer commanding...
...county militia,
Truro.
What shall I erm... say to him?
You know this style of thing.
Your help is needed urgently.
Your er... help?
Help, yes. Help.
Is... needed... urgently.
(Jem continues dictating)...which...
SIR HUMPHREY: For which...?
For which, er...? For which, er...
JEM:to give your immediate attention...
JEM: I have with me an officer of the law,
James Trehearne...
SIR HUMPHREY: Officer of the law,
James Trehearne.
JEM: Got that? All right, Sir Humphrey?
SIR HUMPHREY: Yes.
He reports that the wreckers have their headquarters at Jamaica Inn, Pengallan.
And has enough evidence
to hang the landlord and his accomplices.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
A miraculous fit.
You put Lord George in the shade, what?
I'd better get you a hat.
Chadwick!
- We must leave at once, you know.
- One moment, sir.
The girl, Miss Yellan, she mustn't know about this.
Oh, no, no, no. That must wait.
Poor thing. Evidently devoted to her relative.
I had no choice, Sir Humphrey.
I couldn't tell her the truth.
Tell Sam I want him at once. Where is he?
- In the kitchen, sir.
- Sam!
You'd better have a warm cloak.
Get Mr Trehearne the blue cloak, not the one with the astrakhan collar, get him a hat, and get me my cloak and hat.
- Oh, Sam.
- Ride into Truro as fast as you can.
Deliver that to Captain Boyle at Militia Headquarters.
SIR HUMPHREY: Gallop all the way.
SAM: Very good, sir.
Would you be good enough to tell Robbins
I want my coach at once? Come along.
Chadwick!
- Your coat, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Would you tell Mrs Black to look after the young lady and if she can persuade her to get a little sleep, so much the better?
Will you make my excuses for me?
Tell Lord George I'll be back for dinner.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, thank you so much.
Robbins!
Where is my coach?
Isn't it ready?
The young lady came round the back and took it, sir.
BOTH: What?
- She said you had ordered it for her, sir.
- Do you think?
- Horses! Quick, will you?
You must come away with me while there's time.
That man I cut down was a law officer.
He's on his way here now with Sir Humphrey.
They've sent to Truro for help.
I must change.
Get your things together before they come.
I must tell Joss.
- No time.
- I'll not leave without Joss.
They know the truth and, Aunt Patience, so do I.
This is your last chance to be free of him.
No.
He's a wrecker, a murderer.
But he's my husband. Oh, Mary, you don't understand. You don't know him.
She's come here to warn us. We must get away.
Where's that fellow? Where's Trehearne?
Joss, they're coming for you.
Trehearne's a law officer. We can't...
Keep quiet.
I don't think I need tell you why I'm here with this officer, Merlyn.
I fancy you'll be able to guess.
I demand the right to search your premises.
Perhaps you'd show us round, Mr Merlyn?
All clear in there, Sir Humphrey.
So, you're here.
How quick of you, Mr Trehearne, but law officers waste very little time.
I'm sorry. Come here, Mrs Merlyn.
- She had nothing to do with this.
- I hope not.
Why didn't you tell me who you were?
So you could have warned your aunt?
And why not? She's innocent. She won't run away. Nothing will drive her away from Joss.
If that is the case, perhaps Mrs Merlyn will mix us something to drive out the cold.
What would you like?
A hot brandy, if you'd be so kind.
JEM: Up the stairs, Joss. Go on! Get up.
- Joss?
I'm sorry about this, believe me.
But try not to worry. We'll do our best.
Aunt Patience, you've known about Joss all along.
I love him. People can't help being what they are. Joss can't. I can't.
- There's nothing to be done.
- Even now you could leave him.
Go and put the kettle on the fire while I get the brandy.
This is where he comes in, up these stone steps.
You're expecting a visitor, aren't you?
He comes to one of these rooms.
I've tried that door, but it's locked.
Give me the key.
- I'll break that door down.
- Don't be a fool. Give him the key.
Go on. Get in.
Mind your head, Sir Humphrey.
These doors are rather low.
Oh, er, thank you.
- This looks more like it.
- Never used.
- What did you say, Merlyn?
- I say it's never used.
- No? Then why is that fire alight?
- You're right.
Our friend's apparently expected very soon.
Deuced considerate of the fellow.
I like a good fire.
Here's something!
- What do you make of it?
- It's blood on silk.
We got silk from last night's wreck.
You see? He was here last night.
JEM: Foolish of you to overlook this, Joss.
- One might even say careless.
See that, Sir Humphrey?
There's been many others, too.
An unusual place. Behind the curtain.
- A signal?
- You've hit it.
- Open the door at the end of the passage.
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
- Oh. Thank you.
- Joss, who is it who comes here?
- Would you like to know?
I'll tell you. Santa Claus. Every Christmas.
Things'll be a lot easier, if you tell me.
You don't plan these wrecks.
- Who does?
- You'll find out, Mr Law Officer.
The wall's covered in plaster!
- I left the door open for him.
- Good.
What about the signal? Better light it up for him.
I'll do that.
What about the women? Better bring them up.
Right. I'll get them.
- Watch him.
- Fetch my toddy while you're about it.
Right.
SIR HUMPHREY: Still blowing?
- Hard as ever, sir.
- Take your orders, Merlyn.
Another wreck? Tonight?
Captain Murray would like to have dined with me.
He dislikes the food on shipboard, you know?
He was particularly mortified at having to sail past here at dinner time, which means, let's see, er, Barnard's Head...
- Nine o'clock or thereabouts.
- Yes, sir.
- What are they carrying, sir?
- Among other things, gold.
You must make quite certain.
I need the money very particularly.
I hope the wind drops after.
- I'm an indifferent sailor.
- What?
I'm going to take a little holiday.
I advise you to do the same.
- Why? What's happened? Is...
- Nothing yet.
But the authorities sent Mr Trehearne down into Cornwall.
You see, they suspect.
I shall come back when it's blown over.
Then it's the last one?
It's the last of this series.
I shall catch the Falmouth packet tonight for St-Malo.
I shall call back on the way, so have the gold and valuables ready for me.
They're extremely fond of such things in France.
What about Trehearne?
When will your men be here?
If this is what saving your life has brought us all to, I wish...
You don't think I'm enjoying this?
- Is anything wrong?
SIR HUMPHREY: Oh, no.
Our friend made a very elementary joke.
We're ready.
I've locked the women in the bedroom.
Everything, in fact, except the man himself.
Your groom left just before us.
An hour and a quarter there and back.
Which means Captain Boyle should be here within ten minutes.
There's only one way you might save your skin.
Name the man and tell the whole story.
I took the precaution of bringing this warrant for the fellow's apprehension.
His name will have to be filled in later when we know it.
Like to write it in for us, Joss?
You've taken all the risks so far, you and Harry and Salvation and the rest.
And what have you got out of it?
The bare pickings.
Have you thought of that?
You've a chance to break free of him for good.
Turn king's evidence. Why don't you?
Do you think he'd hesitate in your shoes? No.
- A man like that would save his own skin first.
- You think so?
- He'd sacrifice anybody.
- You seem to have a very clear picture of him.
What sort of a fellow do you think he really is?
This man deliberately plans the wrecking of ships and the cold-blooded slaughter
of any who survive the wreck.
He remains aloof, content to hire the scum to do his murderous work for him, thinking there's no blood on his own hands, but there is, blood on his soul...
- The military!
Watch him. I'll go down and tell them to surround the place and to lie low till we give the word.
- Oh, what a beauty.
- (Laughter)
Stay where you are.
You devil!
Sir Humphrey!
- Look out! Some of the gang are here!
- He's got somebody with him.
- See nobody gets outside.
- Sir Humphrey!
There's no other way.
HARRY: Are you up there, Joss?
Joss?
Squire Pengallan?
That's right. Your respected justice of the peace brought here by your pal Mr Trehearne.
- Who forgot to tell you he's a law officer.
- What's that?
What do you think?
They came here to hang us over the wreck.
We'll make a real job of it this time. Come on.
Hold on.
- We've got to go careful.
- What's the matter?
We don't want our justice of the peace found here dead. People might talk.
- He won't be found.
- But he might be missed.
Maybe they knew he was coming here.
- We've got to finish him.
- Surely, but that takes a little thinking over and there's no time for that now.
We're doing another wreck.
- Tonight?
- Nine o'clock.
We'll fix them when we come back.
Get a couple of ropes there.
JOSS: Chairs.
No, I'll do him. It'll be a pleasure.
Do you think I came here just for you?
I told you, there's somebody behind Joss.
If you wait here long enough, you'll see him.
He's coming here tonight.
You shut your gab. Playing for time, are you?
You'd like to see us miss that wreck we're doing tonight. We wouldn't miss it for worlds.
Joss, finished trussing His Worship?
Let's make 'em nice and snug.
And while we're away, we've got to think of a nice little accident for you.
Now, what would Your Worship fancy?
A choice coach over the cliffs?
Or perhaps you'd sooner be caught by the tide with our friend Jem here on a nice, comfortable, cosy part of the beach.
That's it. In death they shall not be divided.
I warn you, all of you, if you lay a finger on either of us, you'll pay for it.
You'll end swinging in the wind at
Execution Dock with tar to keep the weather out.
- It's time we went.
- Well, who's going to stay with them?
What about Salvation?
He can talk to Mr Trehearne about eternity.
SALVATION: Him? Not me.
We'll need all hands on shore. Patience'll watch
'em. The women are locked in the bedroom.
I'm sorry to see you here, Willie Penhale.
I told you when you were up before me for poaching you were among evil companions.
You should have listened to me, my boy.
It looks as though your wish is going to come true. You might just as well have left me.
- What's she doing here?
- She came here to warn us.
- She started the whole thing. I don't see why...
- I'll look after her.
I've got a nice job for you, Patience.
Take this and watch the two gentlemen.
HARRY: You can't leave a woman in charge.
- I'll need you lot down at the beach.
They're tied. This is all the better for a finger that's nervous, like, on the trigger.
I shouldn't move, bearing that in mind. You wouldn't like your suit spoiled with a bullet hole.
You'll have no call to use it, most likely.
Come on. Look lively now!
- Patience, you can't leave them like...
- You're coming with us.
Take your hands off her.
You can't take her to the wreck.
Of course not. I'm going to leave her behind to cut you loose for the second time in 24 hours.
Come on now.
Merlyn!
You'll answer to me for her safety.
Yes, Your Worship.
- What's happened to the military?
- Something must have delayed them.
- If they'd come, we could save the wreck.
- We don't know where it's going to be.
- Our man came here, but he left before us.
- How do you mean?
Or Joss wouldn't have known about the wreck.
I warn you, Mrs Merlyn, if Captain Boyle finds you like that, nothing will save you.
This is very annoying.
I told Chadwick I'd be back for dinner.
Mrs Merlyn,
I wonder if that pistol is loaded.
You're inexperienced in these things.
Would you like me to look?
- That'll never work.
- Very well, Mrs Merlyn.
Let's see if it's properly primed.
You're not fully conversant with the facts.
I know your husband better than you do.
He would no more have loaded that pistol than he would have left me helpless, which would have been quite absurd.
As I thought.
Now, Mrs Merlyn.
I've always admired your devotion to your husband.
The woman shall cleave to the man, even if the man is our friend Joss.
Admirable. Now, if this officer should escape...
...your husband will pay for it with his life, so I needn't stress the importance of the task I'm giving you.
There.
Watch him. Closely.
If there's the slightest chance of him getting free, don't hesitate to shoot him.
Just get firm pressure on the trigger.
On the trigger.
And all will be well.
No.
JEM: You've forgotten one thing.
Captain Boyle.
There's still the military to reckon with.
There is no Captain Boyle.
In consequence, there'll be no military.
Mrs Merlyn, you've got to let me go.
- Quick!
- Please. Don't move.
JOSS: Whoa! Take her round. Take her round.
Whoa!
Up to the beacon with you. Quick!
- Can't I join in the wreck?
- When you're grown to a man's size, maybe.
- I never see anything.
- Off with you!
Would you like me to bring you back a nice ring?
Not including the finger, if you follow me.
Come down out of there!
Hold on to her, Catchpole.
Mrs Merlyn, where is the wreck going to be?
I don't know.
You can't let it happen. You must set me free.
Innocent men and women are going to die.
You'll be responsible.
You love your husband, I know that.
And I know it's my duty to take him if I can.
But the men on that ship have wives, too.
Think of yourself if Joss was on board.
That ship sailing down from Falmouth in the gale.
Somewhere on the shore, a beacon is going out.
Can you see the rest?
The ship striking. Men spread out like flies, clinging to the rigging, screaming at the surf.
And after the wreck, the wolves.
That's why you must let me go.
Tell me where that wreck is.
I can't. I can't. I don't know, I tell you.
I've never known.
Mrs Merlyn!
Let me go now and I'll find out where it is.
Hurry! There's hardly time.
I can't. What will happen to Joss?
You must make a choice. The lives of those men and of other men in the future or Joss?
After all, Joss is only one man.
Yes, but he's my man.
Mrs Merlyn, supposing I allow your husband...
Hey!
- Whoa-up!
- Where's the nearest military garrison?
- Bodmin. Why?
- I want your coach.
Give me those reins in the name of the law.
Here's my warrant.
There she is! Look!
HELMSMAN: A light! Barnard's Head!
MURRAY: Hard a'port.
She's the one that did it.
Women are no good here, bring you bad luck.
All right, Joss. You leave her to us.
We'll manage very nicely. Thank you.
DANDY: I'm sure you'll agree, Harry.
This calls for my attention.
This is where I come into my own.
Let her go! Get into that cart quick.
Keep back there.
- You can't take her.
- She's robbed us of our best cargo ever.
- Fetch her down.
MARY: Robbed you? Thank heaven!
Robbed of your chance to stuff your pockets by murdering innocent devils you've never seen.
I'm glad. I don't care what happens.
- I'm glad!
- Shut your mouth, you little fool!
I don't know how long my business will take me.
- I may be away for some weeks.
- Very good, sir.
- Sir Humphrey!
- What is it, Sam?
I couldn't deliver this note.
The regiment left Truro three weeks ago.
- Nobody's heard of any Captain Boyle.
- Extraordinary.
- Shall I try Bodmin?
- No, no, it's of no importance.
That'll be all, Chadwick.
I can't give you my address in France.
- Sir!
- What?
Well, er, Chadwick?
You'll pardon the liberty.
You're not ill?
III, Chadwick?
III?
I've never felt better in my life.
Come here.
The fact is I'm, er... growing younger.
Come here.
So much younger I'm taking a beautiful young girl with me on my travels.
Yes, sir. Is there anything more?
Yes, you fool!
Don't stand there with that look in your eyes!
- Sam!
- Sir?
Keep the mare and bay in good condition, won't you?
And, er, come here.
Watch Chadwick.
His mind's going.
Hm.
SIR HUMPHREY: Drive on, will you!
Mr Chadwick.
He's, erm...
I've seen that coming along for years.
Aunt Patience! Aunt Patience!
Aunt Patience! Aunt Patience!
Mary! Joss! What's happened?
Joss is hurt.
Careful, Joss. Joss.
Mary!
Mary. Mary, what happened?
I stopped the wreck. The men came for me and Joss saved me and they shot him.
Uhh!
Joss, Joss.
Oh, Patience.
Patience, my dear.
You're all right, Joss. I'm taking care of you.
You're a good girl, Patience.
I'm sorry.
Where's Jem? Aunt Patience, he's not?
I set him free.
He went to find the wreck.
Mary, he promised me he'd let Joss escape.
You know what that means. We can leave here.
We can leave here together, Joss and I.
You must help me, Mary.
We must go quickly while we can.
Mary, we'll begin again.
Think of it. To be able to live without fear
- among different people who don't know us.
- Yes, Aunt Patience.
It'll be like those first days in Bodmin.
Joss was different then.
He's strong.
He'll soon get better, won't he?
- (Coughs)
- Of course.
When he's recovered a little, we must move him.
We can't wait. Joss mustn't be here when... when he comes back.
Who?
Oh, Mary, I haven't told you.
I didn't know myself until tonight, but I've always known Joss wasn't his own master.
There's someone else who planned the wrecks and had Joss in his power.
Tonight I found out who. Mary, it's...
Aunt Patience! Aunt Patience!
Life without Patience?
Get me a drink.
Yes, Joss, yes.
A good, clean shot, wasn't it?
I'm sorry.
Poor creature. She has suffered so much.
But I was forced to do it, you see.
She was going to tell you about me.
I didn't like that.
I wanted to tell you myself.
So, you stopped the wreck?
Pity. I was counting on it.
You're a very brave young lady, but you've made my position very difficult.
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Please don't scream like that.
I shall have to put this handkerchief in your mouth. You must tell me if that hurts.
Of course, you can't. How silly of me.
Put your hands down. Put your hands down.
Or I shall have to tie them up, too.
Right.
This will prevent the cord from cutting your wrists.
You see, you're quite alone now.
You have no-one else in the world.
Except myself.
So I'm going to take care of you.
Er... in fact, we're going away together.
We should be going now.
Trehearne may come back.
You'd better put this on.
It's wise to wrap up well, while this cold wind is blowing.
I'm always telling people they can't be too careful.
But they think they know better.
And you wouldn't want people to see you like that, would you?
There.
I'm er... glad you're quiet now.
Now, come along.
My coach is not far away.
But we must hurry.
We must hurry.
We must hurry.
HARRY: Sir Humphrey!
And the girl's with him.
- But Joss, what about Joss?
- Come on!
DANDY: Trehearne's gone, too.
ALL: Joss! Joss!
SALVATION: Harry, here! Quick!
Dead. Both of them.
You shouldn't have done that to Joss, Harry.
If you ask me, it's er... time we moved on.
What are you all standing there for? Get out!
Don't keep together. Scatter.
Soldiers!
Now, where's that girl?
- That's the question.
- Come on now, where is she? Tell me.
Take it calm now, take it calm.
You're going to be disappointed, Mr Trehearne.
She's gone and found herself another gentleman.
I just seen her sneaking off alone with His Worship.
The squire.
We've got to find them, Captain.
Sergeant, I want six men to ride with Mr Trehearne and myself.
I don't like it. I don't like it at all.
It was breaking that... that bit of looking glass that did it.
I told you. Seven years' bad luck.
No, Dandy, not more than seven days.
Not counting eternity.
What'll they do? What'll happen to us?
Lt'll be a proper public execution with the women watching. I'll make 'em sit up.
I'm ready. Ready.
- That won't do, will it?
- Better tie him up.
Why are you doing that?
Why can't I be chained? Stop.
Stop. I want to be chained like the others.
Listen to me.
I've got a right to be. I'm the same as them.
I've done what they've done, haven't I?
I want to hang with them.
You'll hang me.
I don't want to hang.
I don't want to die. Not yet.
I'm only a boy. I'm only 1 7!
You won't let them, will you?
I only did what I was told.
I never killed anybody.
I never even went near the wrecks.
So you can't hang me.
You mustn't. You daren't!
Because I don't want to die.
(Sobs) I don't want to die.
There's my house. Do you see?
Across the bay.
The Pengallans have been there a long time.
I may never see it again.
Because, you see, we may never be able to come back.
We may be going a long way, you know.
Nearer the sun, of course.
Italy perhaps. The Isles of Greece.
You're thinking that'll cost money, but there, I have enough.
One must have enough.
I always knew that to live like a gentleman, spaciously and with elegance, one must have money.
And a few beautiful possessions, of course, like you, my dear.
- Where's Sir Humphrey?
- Sir Humphrey has gone away on business.
- Where?
- Answer, man, answer!
Sir Humphrey is taking the Falmouth night packet to St-Malo.
I say, I say, what's this? Oh, it's you.
Good heavens! My suit!
These gentlemen are enquiring for Sir Humphrey, sir.
Sir Humphrey is the head of a band of wreckers who are under arrest at Jamaica Inn.
HAWKER: Sweet China oranges.
Sweet China.
I've put your luggage below, sir.
Sir Humphrey Pengallan. The large stateroom.
Are you the steward?
Get me a bottle of brandy.
Very good, sir. This way, sir. Follow me.
What a miserable hole.
Is this the best they've got?
Old traveller, though.
I'll make you comfortable.
I never really cared for wrecking.
After all, not my kind of thing, hobnobbing with cut-throats.
It had to be done.
Half my friends living like paupers.
But I'm living like a prince.
Drowned hundreds of sailors to do it.
But like a prince.
And I'll make a princess out of you.
I believe you're sorry, because you're not marrying some oaf, who'd father on you a dozen snivelling, dirty-nosed brats.
Any man of sensibility would rather see you dead first.
Gangplank away!
In Paris you'll have your woman to attend to you.
I'll see to your new clothes myself.
Yes, I'll dress you, my dear.
And we'll put silk next to that smooth skin of yours, hmm?
Pale green silk, I think, what?
Pah! Stop crying!
Stop it, you little fool!
Be beautiful! Hard as nails if you like, but you must be beautiful.
Well, you have to be hard now.
The age of chivalry has gone.
CAPTAIN JOHNSON:
That's it. Bring her back to the quayside!
SIR HUMPHREY:
Troopers. They may be coming for you.
Of course, you can't go with them.
You shouldn't have done that, my child.
Lots of riffraff about.
Things might be most unpleasant.
Captain Johnson!
I'm here!
Sir Humphrey Pengallan!
Give yourself up, I beg you, Sir Humphrey, and let her go!
Pray, keep your distance.
Careful. Wing him if possible.
Take care!
Lean away from him as far as you can!
No, don't shoot. He can't help himself!
He doesn't know what he's doing!
He's mad, I tell you! Mad!
It's safer here.
SAILOR: Port bow line ashore there!
It must be now.
Please be still.
Jem, don't harm him!
It's not his fault. He can't help himself.
JEM: Come down!
Come down from the rigging and give yourself up!
Come down!
Come down, Sir Humphrey!
Come down, sir. Come down!
Good heavens, what's the squire doing up there?
JEM: Come down, Sir Humphrey, and give yourself up!
You'll not be harmed, I promise you!
Come down, sir!
I shall be down to you before you're up to me,
Mr Trehearne.
If you'll be kind enough to give me room.
OFFICER: Bring that man down!
- All right, sir.
SIR HUMPHREY: What are you all waiting for?
A spectacle?
You shall have it.
And tell your children how the great age ended!
Make way for Pengallan!
SIR HUMPHREY'S VOICE: Chadwick!
(Fainter) Chadwick!
Halt!
Where are all your Touaregs and the battle, murder, and sudden death?
You know the Arabs always carry off their own dead, Major.
Wake them up in there!
Yes, sir.
The lookout tower is empty.
The place is probably bulging with Touaregs, sir.
No, I don't think so.
I'm gonna take a closer look.
Attack if I'm fired on again.
Yes, sir.
Major Beaujolais with a relief column from Fort Tokotu.
Call your officer and tell...
Give me your rope. I'm going over the wall.
Attack if you don't hear from me in 10 minutes.
May I ask a question, sir?
They're all dead.
Dead, sir? Exactly. Dead.
It may be a trap, Major. Let me go.
You are too important.
May I go, sir?
Yes.
Go over the wall and open the gates.
Keep your eyes open!
What about those 2 shots, sir?
I can ask the questions myself, Dufour.
It shouldn't have taken him this long.
No, sir.
I'm going over myself.
I'll tear the place down if you're not out in 5 minutes.
All right.
Bugler!
Bugler!
Bugler! Answer me!
Bugler!
Bugler!
Halt!
I'm glad to see you, sir.
Thanks.
Come here.
Not a soul alive in the place.
No sign of an enemy?
No, sir.
They're dead.
Yes, sir.
Where's the bugler?
Look for him if you want to. I have.
No thanks, sir.
Up here is a young man who died peacefully.
Beside him is a sergeant with a French bayonet through his heart.
Where, sir?
Never mind.
I have several questions
I'd like to ask, sir.
I have a few myself.
We'll camp in the oasis tonight.
Tomorrow, I'll get to the bottom of this if I have to take a trip to the next world.
Touaregs!
Fall back on the oasis.
Break ranks and fall back to the oasis!
Dufour, I want 2 men to go back to Fort Tokotu for reinforcements.
Right, sir. We'll go, sir.
Good.
Now, one of you must get through.
Split up when you get in the desert.
Have Lt. St. Andre bring his mounted Senegalese as fast as he can.
Yes, sir.
Cease firing!
Cease firing.
Look, Major!
There goes the evidence.
Of what, sir?
I don't know.
Dufour, how am I gonna make a report about this?
If I say exactly what's happened, they'll say I'm mad at Headquarters.
I think this is a silly game!
For that remark, Ghastly Gussie, you are reduced from captain to a common seaman!
How much longer do I have to be a common seaman, Admiral?
Well, it takes time to work up.
You know, Digby,
John's a good worker for a common seaman.
It, uh, it wouldn't be a good idea to promote him.
That's right, Beau.
He might stop working.
I knew something would happen.
Are you hit?
Y
- Yes, sir.
Well, come ashore.
And bring the ships.
Are you hurt much?
Yeah. No.
Are you all right?
Well...
Now be careful. It hit pretty hard.
Don't bump that leg.
Here we are.
Lie down... Steady.
...and we'll examine the wound.
Do you... Do you want to bite on a bullet?
That's what they always do in books.
Will... will I get promoted if I do?
If you don't shout.
I... I won't shout.
I'm ready, Captain.
Sit on him. Yes, sir.
Wait till Aunt Patricia hears about this.
There it is.
Bandage him, Isobel.
Look, Digby.
Oh, that must have hurt going in.
Not half as much as it did coming out!
You're very brave.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I just wanted to be promoted.
I'm proud of you, John.
You'll be knighted and given a Viking's funeral.
No! Really, Beau? I... I mean, Admiral?
Kneel.
Ooh.
I dub you Sir John Geste, Knight.
Rise, Sir Knight. Get a ship ready, Captain.
Right, sir.
Sir John Geste.
Wait a minute.
A Viking always has to be buried with a dog at his feet.
There's one on the table in the study.
I'll go and get it.
Isobel, I think this is awfully silly.
I never speak to common sailors.
John, I...
Sir John!
Sir John, I think you're as silly as the rest of them.
Here it is.
Ah. Very good, Captain.
Put it at Sir John's feet, light the fire and cast off.
Yes, sir.
Hats off!
Attention!
Bugler, blow the last post.
Are you crying because you're proud or because you're wounded?
Because I'm proud!
There, that's what I want when my turn comes.
I'd give anything to have a Viking's funeral, with a dog at my feet and the last post blown for me.
If it weren't too much trouble.
Beau, it isn't too much trouble.
I'll give you one whenever you like.
Here comes Aunt Patricia.
Wait till she hears about John's leg.
Sir John. And you keep your mouth shut.
Children. I want to introduce you to an old friend of mine.
Captain Henri de Beaujolais.
Henri, this is Michael Geste.
How do you do, sir?
And Digby.
How do you do, sir?
And John, the youngest brother.
How do you do, sir?
And this is Isobel Rivers, my ward.
And Augustus Brandon,
Sir Hector's nephew.
How do you do, sir?
Aunt Patricia, John got a bullet in his leg and Beau took it out with a penknife!
Oh, John!
It's... it's nothing, Aunt Patricia.
It... it didn't even hurt.
Let me see, John.
An excellent job of surgery!
We couldn't do better than that in the Foreign Legion.
Which is Beau?
Oh, I am, sir.
You have a very steady hand.
Well, I'm very glad to have met you all.
Goodbye.
As soon as I get old enough,
I'm going to join the Foreign Legion.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Me, too.
But of course, we'd have to leave Aunt Patricia.
Oh.
That's right.
Oh, I suppose we'll have to give it up.
She'll always need some men around to protect her.
I like your family, Patricia.
Especially the Gestes?
Yes. Why do you ask? Everybody does.
Who are they? Orphans.
Three young gentlemen of fortune that I've adopted.
And Augustus is Sir
Hector's heir, I suppose?
Mmm-hmm. If Sir Hector leaves him anything to inherit.
Has he really managed to go through everything?
Only the sapphire is left.
I'm sorry, Patricia.
Oh, I don't mind for myself. It's the children.
I want to raise them and give them a chance in life.
I'm a little desperate about that.
And I suppose Sir Hector will be a little desperate the next time he comes home?
Mmm. He has to be desperate to come home.
Incidentally, before I go, may I see this fabulous sapphire of Sir Hector's?
I've been hearing about it clear across the world.
Of course.
You know, I read this in a book somewhere.
Do you mean to tell me in the Foreign
Legion they read adventure stories?
This gets better and better.
This is called the Priests' Refuge.
In Oliver Cromwell's time, the Brandons used to hide them here.
Hmm!
Takes your breath away.
That's the great-great- grandfather of all sapphires.
It's the one thing Sir
Hector really loves.
Everything else he has but the estate has been gambled away.
Hasn't it a history?
Isn't it supposed to bring bad luck to its owners?
Bad luck? Do you think you could ever make any Brandon believe there was bad luck in having 30,000 pounds?
Well, we're not going to get out today.
Let's play something in the house.
What could we play, Beau?
We could play King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.
How do you play that?
Well, I'm King Arthur.
First, you put me in this suit of armor...
Aunt Pat wouldn't like that.
I'll take the blame if she finds out.
Digby, you're Sir Lancelot.
John, you're Sir Gawaine.
Isobel is Queen Guinevere.
And, Gussie, you can be Sir Mordred.
Who's Sir Mordred?
He's the knight who betrayed King Arthur.
Oh, I like that.
Digby, John, and Gussie will have to get swords and helmets.
Now, help me into this suit of armor before you go.
Can you manage?
I... I think so.
Oh! Oh.
We'll be back in a minute, Sire.
Can you breathe all right?
Fairly well.
Go, my people!
That will be all, Burdon.
Ram Singh.
Aunt Pat!
Well, there goes our king.
Thank you, Ram Singh.
Beau, Beau, are you all right?
Yes. Help me out.
What was that man with the towel on his head doing here?
I don't know.
You were close enough to hear what he was saying.
Oh, I suppose I'll have to tell you.
He was from the Arabs.
He wanted me to fight on their side against the Foreign Legion.
And... and he asked
Aunt Pat if I could go.
What did Aunt Pat say?
Well... well, no.
It sounds like a big lie to me, John.
Just a moment, Digby.
Are you doubting the word of King Arthur?
Why, no, Sire.
Are you, John?
I didn't say a word, Sire.
Excuse me.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Oh, no, Aunt Pat. We were just...
Please go on, Isobel.
May I?
Aren't you a little old for those childish games, Beau?
Aren't you a little young for those grown-up cigars, Gussie?
Is he still there?
Yes. Don't make so much noise.
What's the difference? He knows we're after him now.
All right. Then let's get to work.
Let's not act hastily.
This requires some preparation.
All we need to do is move the couch.
He'll move fast. We gotta watch out for him.
Well, one of us on each side.
And have him walk out right between us?
I can see you haven't done much of this sort of thing, Digby.
Now, you move the couch and I'll cover the ground.
The minute he shows his head,
I'll be on him like a tiger.
Now look, I flushed him,
I stood watch while you armed yourself.
It's up to you to move the couch.
Sorry, old boy, I don't see it your way.
Well, then we'll need a third party to move the couch while we do the dirty work.
John.
No, he's too busy. We can't disturb him.
What's more important than this?
When you get a little older you'll realize. Love.
Love?
You mean he's in love with Isobel?
Horribly. Worst case I've ever seen.
Well, he has my blessing.
Here he comes!
Cute little fellow, isn't he?
Probably been here for years.
Has a family, too, I suppose.
Well, go ahead, Beau.
After all, it's your room.
It must be your mouse.
Digby, we can't go down and face all the others with blood all over our hands, can we?
No.
Remind me tonight to bring him up some cheese, will you?
Did you have fun?
Think of him behind that couch.
Same form of rodent.
Thank you.
The Gestes are such witty fellows to themselves.
Ghastly!
If I could only...
Shush!
Don't argue with the heir, Digby.
Thank you.
A telegram.
First one in 5 years.
Who's it for, Burdon?
Her Ladyship, sir.
I wonder if anything's happened to Sir Hector.
Now, please don't start reciting the will, Gussie, until we find out definitely.
Telegram, Madam.
Oh, thank you, Burdon.
Sir Hector is well, I trust?
Quite well, Augustus.
And we are going to have a visit from him.
Oh.
That's splendid.
I don't understand.
He never comes home this time of year.
Only because he's never needed money at this time of the year before, Augustus.
Well, I don't see what more he expects to get out of the estate.
You forget the Blue Water.
Why, he wouldn't sell the
Blue Water, would he, Aunt Pat?
I'm afraid that's what he intends doing.
Why, there wouldn't be anything left!
Excuse me.
Aunt Pat, would you show us the
Blue Water before you go?
We may not get another chance to see it.
Very well. Burdon.
Yes, Madam?
Will you come to the Priests'
Refuge with me, please?
And bring a candle. Yes, Madam.
Well, why are we all so glum?
Selling the Blue Water isn't the end of everything, is it?
It is for Gussie.
Poor Aunt Pat.
She probably doesn't mind losing the Blue Water.
It's having Sir Hector around again.
Well, that's a splendid way to talk about your benefactor.
Where would you be if it weren't for him?
I don't know, Ghastly, but not with you, at any rate.
We couldn't quietly arrange to dispose of Sir Hector in some way before he gets home, could we?
Oh, nothing gory, of course.
Thank you, Burdon.
It looks like a piece of sky that had become solid, with sunlight imprisoned in it.
Cold sunlight.
Cold as the unhappiness it has brought so many people.
Well, must have blown a fuse.
Isobel, you're the closest. Try the switch.
So somebody turned them off.
Another Geste joke?
It's... It's gone!
Why... why, it's impossible!
Somebody in this room took it.
Now, don't be any more of an ass than you can help, Ghastly.
There's no one in this room but the family. Well?
It seems there's someone here with a sense of humor all his own.
Your joke, Augustus?
Me? No, Aunt, really. I... I swear it.
You, John?
No, Aunt Pat.
Digby?
Positively not.
Beau?
I didn't take the Blue Water.
Surely not... Oh, no, Aunt.
I'm very much afraid someone is lying.
Put it back, John.
I said I didn't take it.
Suppose you put it back. Suppose you do.
Whatever the humor of the joke, it's rather bad taste to prolong it.
I think we're agreed on that.
Perhaps our humorist wouldn't mind returning the Blue
Water the way he got it, in the darkness.
Turn off the lights, Isobel.
Turn them on, Isobel.
I was trying to catch the thief. So was I.
Whoever took the Blue
Water has had his chance.
I don't want a scandal in Brandon Abbas.
I will leave the box on the table until morning.
If the Blue Water is not back by then, of course, I shall have to call the police.
Good night.
Have we a magician here?
Or is Brandon Abbas haunted?
Well, there's Augustus.
What about you?
Please don't quarrel.
Somebody's just joking.
You don't joke about 30,000 pounds.
But this is dreadful.
It's got to be a joke.
You go to bed, Isobel.
We know it wasn't you.
Gussie,
I hate to do this, but it's necessary.
Now, then, n-n-n-now, wait a minute!
Now... now, wait a minute!
Wait a minute! I... I...
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he really did have it?
Be sure and look in his mouth, Digby.
You know, I'm really very sorry you didn't have it on you, Ghastly.
I wish I could search you.
I'd wager I'd find the Blue Water.
And if one of you is to blame, then all of you are because you always stick together.
Well, what's the next step?
We all search each other?
No, if I have a brother who's a thief,
I'd rather not know about it till he sends me my share of the loot.
Let's go to bed.
Quite an evening.
Yes.
Isobel didn't do it.
No.
Burdon didn't.
No.
Gussie?
You searched him, didn't you?
Well, there's just us left.
Well, I didn't take the thing.
Neither did I.
It'll probably be back in its little box in the morning.
Get some sleep.
Good night.
What are you doing?
Searching the room.
I thought Gussie might have hidden it somewhere when the lights were out.
We needn't bother any more.
Read this.
When did you get it?
It was under my door when
I woke up this morning.
He must have left it in the night.
Yes.
Where do you think he went?
Where would you go if you wanted to disappear completely and still have some excitement?
Foreign Legion.
So would Beau.
Pardon me, Mr. John, but, uh, Mr. Digby left me this note to deliver to you at 9:00, sir.
Thank you, Burdon. Yes, sir.
Isobel,
Beau left a note for Digby last night and now Digby has left a note for me.
"Dear John:
"It wasn't Beau, but me.
"Love to Isobel,
"a sneer to Gussie, and a command to you.
"Grow up to be a credit to those two criminals,
Beau and Digby. "
Why did they run away?
Beau did it to shield Digby and me.
Digby wouldn't let him take the blame alone.
I should have known what Digby was going to do last night.
What are you going to do?
Don't you know?
I think at least one of the
Gestes ought to kiss you goodbye.
I've been in love with you for a very long time.
I just didn't know how to say it.
Now that I do know, I...
It's too late.
It's not too late.
But I couldn't ask you to wait for me.
Yes, you could.
Goodbye, Isobel.
John.
John, may I ask you a silly question, just once and for all?
I know the answer, but I want to hear you say it.
All right.
Did you take the Blue Water?
If I'd have stolen anything from Brandon Abbas, it would have been you.
Section, halt!
Right face!
Attention!
Company, attention!
Present arms!
Dismissed!
Show me your hands.
Turn them over. Higher!
Never have done a day's work in your life, have you?
Yes, sir.
I'll manicure those before we're through.
You'll do to carry water.
You're not big enough to be a soldier.
You think I'm big enough to be a soldier, Sarge?
Shut up!
Well.
A countryman of mine.
So you decided to re-enlist, eh, Rasinoff?
Yes, Sergeant.
You must be as big a fool as you are a thief.
Discipline makes the strength of armies.
It is necessary that superiors obtain from their subordinates immediate obedience without murmuring.
Discipline will be firm, but it will also be fatherly.
Officers must use psychology in dealing with men.
Any questions about the regulations?
I am Sgt. Markoff.
I make soldiers out of scum like you and I don't do it gently.
You're the sloppiest looking lot I've ever seen.
It's up to me to prevent you from becoming a disgrace to the Regiment.
And I will prevent that if I have to kill half of you with work.
But the half that lives will be soldiers.
I promise you.
Corporal, take them to the barracks.
Yes, Sergeant.
Left face!
Follow me!
Forward march!
Markoff!
I just witnessed that little exhibition of yours, Markoff.
I don't like it!
You have to be strict with scum like that, sir.
They're men! They have their rights, guaranteed with the regulations.
I'll keep within the regulations, sir.
You're a good soldier, Markoff, but I doubt if you're a good sergeant.
If you're not, you won't last long in the Legion.
Watch your step, or I'll break you.
That's all.
Is this Markoff gonna be our sergeant from now on?
Yes. He's a madman.
He was expelled from the Siberian penal colonies for cruelty.
Then he entered the Legion and rose from the ranks.
Enter the third robber.
Beau! Dig!
How are you?
I'm glad to see you.
You confounded nuisance!
You wouldn't do anything original like staying at home, would you?
Not without my older brothers to take care of me.
Why couldn't you join the
Royal Northwest Mounted Police?
We just ran out so we wouldn't have you on our hands anymore.
You mean you ran out on me and left me to face the police.
Well, have it your own way.
We're stuck with you for five years now.
Say, how's everybody at home?
Well, but not happy.
Oh, that's too bad.
Say, wouldn't it be horrible if Ghastly Gussie should suddenly appear here, too?
Ooh, horrible!
Well, the Three Musketeers.
One for all, and all for nothing.
Ahem, ahem, ahem.
Oh, excuse me, two of my friends,
Mr. McMonigal and Mr. Miller.
My brothers, Beau and Digby.
How do you do? Glad to meet you.
And... and I am Rasinoff.
He was Rasinoff! You know, he hasn't been the same since he found out your brother could buy a drink.
Well, I guess this calls for a drink on me.
Will you join us?
Don't be foolish!
May... may I accompany you?
If you insist.
Well, I insist.
"For France beneath Sahara's sky"
"For France, no matter whether"
"we live or we die"
"Noble birth"
"Or beggars of the earth"
"Men of disgrace and of glory"
"Low or great, we share an equal fate"
"No Legionnaire tells his story"
"For France"
Shh.
Sounds worse than a battle.
And they fight it every night.
Wait till Hank joins in.
It'll sound like a massacre.
Aw, you just give me a couple of nights to get tuned up.
Shh.
Listen, Beau.
We can't talk in here.
Talk?
We can't even sleep.
Then let's take our blankets and sleep outside.
Think we'll get picked up by the guard?
Let's humor the child.
This is no place for high-class jewel thieves.
Good night, gentlemen.
Say.
Ain't you gonna stay for the concert?
Listen, we've got to draw the line someplace and you ain't gonna sleep next to us.
Did you hear what the one called John said?
Who?
Get that man out of our boudoir.
They're jewel thieves!
Well, what'd you expect to meet in the Legion, bankers?
Good night.
Good night.
Well, isn't anybody going to say a word?
You young pup, we're both so disgusted with you we're speechless.
I'm no worse than either of you.
There's something in what he says, Beau.
I insist I'm worse than he is, he didn't steal the Blue Water.
Neither did you.
No, as a matter of fact,
I've got it.
I'll be frank with you, gentlemen.
I've got it.
I intend to sell it for 30,000 pounds sometime in the future and live a life of ease in Paris, surrounded by whiskey, ladies and laughter.
Well, that's funny.
I'm going to sell it and go to Paris, too.
Only I don't want any laughter.
One thing I counted on was my younger brother leading an upright life while I spent my ill-gotten gains.
Yes, I was counting on him, too.
If you don't mind my saying so, the great sapphire is in my possession.
And as soon as I can arrange to sell it,
I'm going to the South Seas, buy a plantation and start trading in copra.
He puts us both to shame, doesn't he, Beau?
Let's put him to death and keep his share.
All right.
Oh, we'll have to find it first.
Let's wait till the morning.
I don't like searching people in the dark.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
What the...
Thief!
I... I... I lost my way.
I... I was going for a drink.
Liar, you were trying to rob him.
No, I didn't know where I was going.
I was walking in my sleep.
You were trying to rob him, I know you from before, Rasinoff!
No, I... I... I... I wasn't!
Thief!
Quiet! On the table with him!
He's had enough! Get out of here!
Take it easy, Beau, there's too many of them.
Shh.
The guards.
You didn't wait very long to start your old tricks, huh?
But Sergeant, they had... Silence!
An accident.
Yes, Sergeant.
Go to the washstand and bathe your hands.
Yes, Sergeant.
Save your first-aid treatments for yourselves after this.
You'll need 'em. I promise you!
Who were you trying to rob?
The one named Beau.
Of what?
He has money.
You lie.
You wouldn't take that risk for a little money.
Well, he has a jewel.
Tell me the truth.
It is the truth, I swear it.
They have a great jewel, worth
30,000 pounds that they stole.
They? The other two.
They are brothers, and they're waiting for a chance to sell it.
But he is the leader.
He carries it.
I've watched him.
What about the two Americans?
Well.
They are just friends.
Make sure you're telling me the truth.
I am.
I am!
You know,
I think I can help you get that jewel.
Why...
Why, that's what I hoped.
I'm sure you did.
In a week we go to relieve the garrison at Fort Zinderneuf.
It can be arranged there.
But there are three of them, and... and the two friends.
Some of the company go to Fort Tokotu for mounted infantry training.
It can be arranged.
And if there's no jewel, you'll get a wooden jewel box.
I promise you.
But... but he has it.
I'm sure of it.
Go back to the barracks.
Today marks the end of your training.
You are now soldiers, in the service of France.
We are here on the desert as guardians of 20 millions of natives.
They look to us for the protection and justice that is the tradition of the Foreign Legion.
Yours is a high duty, and a hard one.
The odds are great.
It is our allegiance to France and our debt to civilization to uphold that tradition.
Some of you are assigned with me to Fort Zinderneuf.
Another detachment will go to Fort Tokotu for further training in the mounted company.
Select your men for Tokotu, Sergeant.
McMonigal, 3 steps forward.
Miller!
Benoff!
Personne!
Andre!
Diggs!
Costaud!
Baker!
Noyaki!
Lacoste!
Brun!
Schmidt!
Vandenecker!
Laumange!
Ruclous!
Dirla!
Aloof!
Corporal Golas, take charge of the detachment.
Tokotu party, fall in!
Right shoulder arms!
Right face!
Forward march!
Present arms!
Present arms!
Center dress!
Front!
Count off!
Three.
Four.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Right shoulder arms!
Detail in order, sir.
Right by fours, right!
Forward march!
Present arms!
Present arms!
Right shoulder arms!
Look where you're going. I'm sorry.
Do that again, blubber-face, and I'll brain you.
He'll be gibbering like
Krenke in a little while.
We all will.
I wouldn't mind if it would annoy Markoff.
Come on, bring on that coffee!
Coffee!
Let's try to get Krenke to drink a little.
So this is the cafard!
Did the Captain back in Paris tell you about his red, white and blue skull?
Yes.
He was lucky.
Can't we do something for him?
We can help him to die, that's all.
How's Lt. Martin?
Worse.
I haven't prayed in a long time, but I'm going to pray for him.
You'd better!
Think of Markoff in command!
I wonder where Renault and
Renouf are this morning?
Dead, with their mouths full of sand.
It's no use to desert.
Oh, what's the difference whether you get death inside the walls or out?
There's a chance inside.
Not if the Lieutenant dies.
You don't have to be the pigs.
You can be the butcher.
And then what?
Morocco, all of us.
We leave that pig Markoff well stuck.
And you'd be well stuck before you ever got to Morocco.
The Arabs would never dare attack so large a group.
No, but the French Army would.
Do you know what I think of the French Army?
After we kill Markoff and you,
I'm gonna tear off this uniform...
Cut it out.
What's going on in here?
Schwartz was trying to eat too fast again.
Everybody out on the parade ground.
Renault and Renouf are back!
Any orders this morning, sir?
No, you take over, Markoff.
The scouts brought back our two deserters, sir.
Lock them up.
We'll send them to Tokotu for court martial in a few days.
The men need a lesson, Lieutenant.
Locking them up won't...
Who's in command of this fort?
You are, sir.
Don't make the mistake of forgetting that or you'll join the deserters in the cell.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
Attention!
Stand aside!
Where are they?
They're outside, sir.
Bring them in.
Bring them in!
Attention!
So you decided to come back to us, huh?
Yes, Sergeant.
After the desert, Zinderneuf doesn't seem so bad, huh?
No, Sergeant.
Speak up!
No, Sergeant.
The punishment for desertion is death by the firing squad.
But I'm going to be merciful.
You can escape again.
Oh, no!
You mean you want to stay here and be executed?
Water! Water!
On your feet!
I insist that you escape.
No... no, let us stay!
Yeah, give us a...
Get out!
Out!
Drive them out where you found them.
Keep them away from the oasis.
I'm glad Digby isn't here.
I wish you weren't.
Any more of you want to desert?
If you do, you can go now.
I won't stop you.
Later you may wish you had taken my offer.
I promise you.
Rasinoff!
You can close the gates now.
How do you feel tonight, Lieutenant?
I'm dying.
I hope not, sir.
I'm going to die and be buried under the sand and forgotten.
When I was a little boy,
I thought soldiers always died in battles.
I didn't know there were so many soldiers and so few battles and so many fevers.
Get word to Beaujolais at Tokotu.
Have him send another officer.
You'll be in command until then.
Yes, sir.
The men must be led, not driven.
Remember, you'll answer to the man who takes my place.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant! Have you...
Attention!
Lt. Martin is dead.
I am now in command.
From this moment on, discipline at Fort
Zinderneuf will be severe.
I promise you!
Don't tell me he took your appetites away.
He'll take more than that away before long.
Glock, go to the door, warn us if anyone comes.
Markoff has been asking for it, and now he's going to get it.
Can't you see a mutiny is what Markoff wants?
If he puts it down, he'll be a hero.
And you're the one who would help him put it down, Maris.
Let him hang himself.
Lt. Martin's death gives him enough rope.
When his superior officers learn what he's already done, he'll go to prison for life!
Listen to our little Sergeant-lover.
Our troubles are all over if we bring Markoff a bunch of posies every morning.
You don't want to stay here and die like rats in a trap, do you?
No!
And let that madman squeeze every drop of blood out of you and drive you out on the desert like he did Renouf and Renault, do you?
No!
We're 50 against one. How long are you going to keep on licking the boots that kick you?
Those stripes on his sleeve won't stop a rifle bullet.
Let's get him now! I'm with you!
You fools!
Don't listen to him! He'll never get away with it!
50 against 2!
50 against the legion!
Shut up, you yellow liver!
Wait a minute.
I don't know much about mutinies, but I do know it isn't good form to plan them at the top of your voice.
Where do you stand?
Well, I don't like Markoff, but also I don't like you.
50 against 3!
Make it 4.
Who else?
These 3 won't bother us.
Rasinoff?
He's with Markoff, and he goes with Markoff.
After you kill Markoff, what?
We'll get out of this hole, and we go to Morocco.
Markoff has two Arab scouts outside.
The minute they see anything's wrong, they'll ride to Tokotu for help.
We'll have too much of a start.
Not for the camel corps.
Talk, talk, talk! Let's decide!
You're right.
All those with me, on your feet!
I give you one more chance to change your mind.
Schwartz, there'll be a flag flying out there in the morning that I swore to uphold.
Armies of good men have died for it, gladly.
It's a battle flag and it's a flag of victory.
I'm rather proud to be under it.
And I wouldn't want to go out in the morning like you and know that I was going to be a traitor to it.
We have a patriot!
He wouldn't be so patriotic if he had a slit in his belly.
Would you like to try putting one there?
I will! Wait!
If Markoff hears, he'll send his scouts to Tokotu!
We'll get him right now!
No, we can't march at night. Wait until morning.
Voisin's right, get back!
We'll get him in the morning on parade.
The man nearest Markoff shoots him.
The next one shoots
Rasinoff, then these three.
That's right.
Suppose one of them sneaks out and warns Markoff?
I'll warn the guards, if anybody sticks his head out they'll shoot.
You're full of plans.
Let's get 'em right now.
Shut up, Renoir! Go ahead, Voisin!
Nobody leaves this room!
What can we do?
Outside of prayer, I can't think of a thing.
You're the older brother, it's up to you.
When the shooting starts, we just shoot at everybody, it makes it simpler.
Who?
Voisin!
Well?
They mutiny in the morning, on parade.
All of them?
The English brothers and Maris are faithful.
I'm supposed to warn the guards.
Never mind the guards.
Go on back and go to sleep.
I'll pay you a quiet little call later.
Glock will be on the door.
Now, but not later.
Are they with us? To a man.
You'd better take him out.
Nobody leaves this room, not even Krenke.
Put your clothes on.
Leave your boots off.
We're going to put down an attempted mutiny.
We'll disarm the sentries first.
Before this is over, we'll have the jewel.
Come on.
Get up. Quietly.
One sound out of you and it'll be your last.
Wake Maris, Voisin, and the brothers.
Rasinoff, stay here.
Shoot anyone that moves.
The rest of you gather up the rifles and bring them out.
And don't drop any of them!
Maris, Voisin, go back and get the rest of them.
There's another little matter I almost forgot.
The jewel you stole.
I want it.
I have no jewel.
I know you have.
I haven't.
Are you sure?
Quite sure.
I advise you to change your mind.
Otherwise, when this is over, I may have to shoot you to make sure.
I understand, Sergeant.
You mean you'd rather not hand it over now and save your life?
No, Sergeant.
That's very unfortunate, for you.
Arm yourselves.
Open fire on them if they attempt to rush us.
Attention!
The attempt at mutiny is over, my children.
You bungled it so much it wasn't really a mutiny.
But you'll be punished as though it were.
Maris, Rasinoff. You two, cover them in the yard!
Anyone that makes a false move won't have to stand trial.
By twos, fall in!
Forward march!
Pig!
You're the pig!
Column left.
Section halt!
Close in!
Left face!
And now, you scum, it's my turn.
I'm going to give you a lesson in putting down an attempted mutiny that'll be the last thing you'll ever see.
Maybe this'll make you die happy.
Markoff thanks you.
When he's an officer and has the Legion of Honor, he'll think often of the stupid, blundering pigs that put him where he is.
Smith, Jones, fall in here.
Schwartz, Renoir, line up, backs to the gate.
Now, my children, you're going to see the regulations carried out to the letter.
The punishment for mutiny is death.
Silence!
You two, about face.
These 2 pigs deserve to be first.
And the honor of killing them belongs to the two most loyal men in the fort.
Ready! Aim!
Do you hear me?
Very plainly!
Then do your duty!
It's not our duty to shoot down unarmed men.
Maybe you'd rather be on the other side, ahead of Schwartz and Renoir?
I'll give you one more chance. Ready! Aim!
You refuse to obey your superior?
I don't think you'll shoot, Markoff.
You haven't enough men behind you now.
You forget I wanted an excuse.
Here's your excuse.
Very well.
You each get three in the belly.
Keep them covered.
Touaregs coming, a great harka. We were surprised!
Get through to Fort Tokotu and tell them we must have help!
It will be done.
Prepare for action. The Arabs.
Bugler, sound the alarm!
Pass out the arms and ammunition.
Get your rifles.
Take your posts. Maris,
Voisin, Rasinoff. Follow me.
Here. Thanks.
Oh, those beautiful Touaregs.
Didn't I tell you not to worry?
I suppose you had this all worked out.
Everything but having to fight in our underwear, and I apologize for that.
Keep it up, you scum! Keep shooting!
You'll get a chance yet to die with your boots on!
Bugler! Run up the colors!
Now we've got something to fight under!
Rapid fire, you scum! Rapid fire!
Bugler, sound cease firing!
Anybody hit?
No, Sergeant.
They'll get down to sharp-shooting later.
Schwartz. Voisin. More ammunition.
Maris. Renoir.
Coffee and bread for everybody.
Rasinoff.
Take half the men below.
Get them properly dressed.
Then the other half, if there's no attack.
Fall out. Go below.
Fall out. Go below.
At least the indecent part of this fight is nearly over.
Fall out. Go below. Fall out. Go below.
Maybe the Arabs will save me the trouble.
You're in this, too, Sergeant.
Silence!
Three hours since their first attack.
Maybe they are digging in, Sergeant.
When they return, it'll be slowly and taking aim.
Schwartz.
Yes, Sergeant.
Get up in the tower.
Watch the palm trees in the oasis.
They can shoot down on us from there.
Maybe you can see the route to Morocco before they get you.
That's the place for our mutineers.
Up on a roost like pigeons.
If I could only afford to waste them all.
Why don't they come?
Here they come!
Bugler, sound the alarm!
Turn from your place again, and I'll blow your head off.
Bugler, sound cease firing!
Everybody does his duty at
Zinderneuf, dead or alive.
We'll make those Arabs think we've got a thousand men.
The rest of the bullets you stop won't hurt as much as that first one.
That settles the big pig.
Would you like to take the position of honor next, Rasinoff?
No, Sergeant. No?
No.
Voisin.
Up in the tower.
I'm rewarding you for betraying your friends.
You can see them all from the tower.
On the double.
All right?
All right.
Here they come!
Stand to! Rapid fire! Rapid fire!
They've had enough again. Give it to them!
Rapid fire! Rapid fire!
Bugler, sound cease firing!
Charming fellow, our Sergeant.
A trifle uncouth, but the best soldier we'll ever see.
Rasinoff, how many left?
12, Sergeant.
You'll all be with these others in a little while.
You'll do your duty better dead than you ever did alive.
Take 10 minutes below for food and rest.
Two men at a time.
Smith. Jones. Go first.
If you hear the bugle, come back on the double. Quick.
Rasinoff.
Go up in the tower.
No!
No, no, Sergeant, please.
Up in the tower and dream about the jewel in the moonlight.
March!
Now you can see.
Tired?
A little.
Looks rather bad, doesn't it?
Rather.
Do you mind?
A little.
Isobel?
Yes.
I'm sorry, John.
Let's not go into that, Beau.
Nobody asked me to come here.
I remember what Ghastly
Gussie said one time:
"The Gestes always stick together. "
Hmm.
Digby's probably on his way here now.
He'd better be.
John.
Somebody always gets out of these things.
It might be you.
The Gestes always stick together.
Well, if they shouldn't, would you do me a favor?
Of course.
Thanks.
In my coat are two letters and a packet.
One letter and the packet goes to Aunt Pat.
The other letter stays here with me.
All right.
Could I do you a favor, if, uh, things happen to be the other way around?
Just tell Isobel that...
Just tell her something.
Older brother takes care of everything.
I promise you.
Let's get some rest, John.
Yeah, all right.
No attack since dawn.
That's a long time for them.
Are they still there, Rasinoff?
Yes, Sergeant, but they're... they're moving around a lot.
That means the holy men are arguing for one more attack.
They've lost their stomach for it.
The next attack will be the last one.
No sign of any relief from Tokotu.
Well, we'll show them we're not only awake, but merry and bright.
Bugler.
Yes, Sergeant.
Blow every call they ever taught you!
Now, my children,
I want some happy laughter. Lots of it.
Seven is going to sound like 70.
Laugh, Renoir!
Maris, pick it up!
Bugler!
Jones.
Smith.
Rasinoff, what's the matter with you?
Me? Yes, you!
Laugh, you human jackal!
Run from embrasure to embrasure and fire!
We'll make them think we're still fully manned.
Bugler, sound the alarm!
Beau.
Keep firing, or I'll blow your back out!
March!
Cease firing!
They won't come back again.
They've had enough of Zinderneuf.
But just in case.
Leave my brother's body alone.
Go below and bring me some bread and wine.
If you touch him, I'll kill you.
Do as I tell you. I'm still in command here.
Look.
Look at them.
They come when I want them.
They go when I don't need them anymore.
They're beaten.
But they've put down a mutiny for me.
They've given me the Legion of Honor, and they've made me an officer.
So he had no jewel, huh?
I told you to leave my brother's body alone.
This is all I wanted.
I'm a rich man now, thanks to you and that...
Good. Armed attack on a superior in the face of the enemy.
I court martial you myself.
I find you guilty and
I sentence you to death.
You get six in the belly.
Listen to me.
I haven't got much breath.
Leave the public letter in Markoff's hand.
Take the packet and the other letter home to Aunt Pat.
Yes, Beau.
Go to Egypt.
Promise?
I promise.
Tell Digby I was sorry
I couldn't wait for him.
Lovely sound, but a little late.
John.
John!
John!
Bugler.
Bugler.
Bugler, answer me!
Bugler.
Bugler!
Halt!
I'm glad to see you, sir.
Thanks. Come here.
There's not a soul alive in the place.
No sign of an enemy?
No, sir.
But they're dead.
Yes, sir.
Where's the bugler?
Look for him if you want to. I have.
No, thanks, sir.
Touaregs.
Fall back on the oasis.
Cease firing.
Cease firing!
John.
Dig!
Dig, Beau's dead.
I know.
I was there.
Someday, John, we'll be able to talk about him.
Not now.
Look. What's that?
That?
That's a Viking's funeral.
I knew you wouldn't forget.
He wouldn't have, if it had been me.
Well, what do we do now?
I've been playing Arab, but they're over their surprise now.
We've got to get out of here.
Where? Egypt.
Dig.
Did he have a dog at his feet?
Markoff.
That burning fort makes a pretty sight, don't it?
Not if our friends are in there being roasted instead of hiding out here in the sand hills like I think they are!
Friends! You mean Beau! Digby! John!
Hank! Hank! Buddy!
I knew we'd find you if we rode around and talked loud enough.
We wouldn't have any more company, would we?
He's in the fort.
Oh.
God rest his soul. Come on.
How many would you say?
40 or 50.
Look at that water.
Well, let's start shooting.
No, wait a minute.
I'll go up there and start blowing the bugle.
You three open fire from here.
I'll wave as if there were men behind me.
They'll think they're being attacked by the whole legion.
We hope.
Don't shoot until I give you the signal.
Good luck, Dig.
Good luck.
Dig!
Mr. John.
Hello, Burdon.
I beg your pardon, sir, but
I was so glad to see you.
I'd have been insulted if you hadn't.
How is Miss Isobel?
In splendid health, sir.
Unmarried, of course? Of course, sir.
Well, may I see Lady Brandon at once?
Yes, sir. I'll call her.
Pardon me, sir, but, uh, how are Mr. Beau and Mr. Digby?
They're both dead.
John. Isobel.
John.
You're alone, John?
Yes.
Beau asked me to bring you these.
"My dear Aunt Pat.
"I was inside the suit of armor in the hall
"the day you sold the Blue
Water to the Maharajah's agent
"and received an imitation to take its place.
"When the wire from Sir Hector came,
"I thought I'd repay your devotion to us
"by giving Brandon
Abbas its first robbery.
"So the lights went out, and so did Beau.
Lovingly, Beau Geste. "
Beau Geste.
Gallant gesture.
We didn't name him wrongly, did we?
Good morning, miss macdaid.
Good morning.
Good morning, Rama.
Good morning.
What's this,
Target practice?
If I didn't, they wouldn't
Leave me any flowers.
What about stopping for a drink
Or perhaps a cup of tea?
Oh, it's a temptation,
Mr. Ransome,
But they're expecting me
Back at the hospital.
In other words,
One of my patients has simply
Made up his mind to die...
If miss macdaid isn't there
Every hour she can spare...
Out of the 24
She already works.
Very well, but next time
I won't take no
For an answer.
I'll hold you to that.
Try and persuade major Safti
To take some rest.
There goes a great
And good woman.
Yes, there's no one
Quite like her.
Now, there's one
Of the mysteries of India...
I'll never be able
To understand.
What's that?
That stringless quartet
Over there.
They never
Seem to listen
Or to say anything.
But I know perfectly well
That by Tomorrow morning...
My innermost secrets
Will be the common talk
Of Ranchipur.
But of course,
You have nothing
To hide.
Brandy and soda?
Yes, thanks.
No, I don't think
I'd better.
I may have to operate
This afternoon.
Oh, just a drop.
Steadies the hand, see?
Well, kind of.
Hmm.
Then there's a conference
With the maharajah
At the palace.
In this heat?
Major, your energy appalls me.
Why, it isn't hot.
It's only 109 in the shade.
Aren't you ever
Going to finish it?
Is there any hurry?
But you haven't
Done a stroke since
The last time I was here.
Oh, stop.
You're making me perspire.
If the rains
Would only come.
They were praying at the temple
As I drove by this morning.
I had half a mind to join them.
In prayer?
I didn't know
You had faith
In anything, Tom.
Oh, that's where you're wrong.
I've got faith
In a lot of things.
For instance, uh--
For instance?
Well, for instance,
Queen victoria.
That old statue?
Oh, to you
She's only a statue,
But to me she's an old friend--
A living reminder of the fine,
Brave days before the world
Went to seed.
When london bridge did
Its falling to a dance step,
Not to the threat
Of Tomorrow's bombs.
When every american
Was a millionaire--
Or about to be one--
And people sang in vienna.
There she stands
In her cast-iron petticoat,
Unconcerned about wars,
Dictators and appeasement,
As serene as ever.
God bless her.
The world is not as bad
As you think, Tom.
No? Only trying
To commit suicide
As fast as it knows how.
I don't agree with you.
Here in Ranchipur,
We're trying to make it
A little better.
The whole world?
Our world--
India in general,
Ranchipur in particular.
I rather like the old place
Just as it is.
You see it as an artist.
I see it as an Indian.
My people are crying for help,
After centuries of disease...
And poverty and superstition.
The american girl
And her mother
From the mission.
They're not stopping here,
Are they?
Mother, please don't.
I'll die if you do.
Oh, don't be silly.
If he wanted to know us,
He'd have called before this.
Hold the reins.
Is the honorable
Mr. Ransome in?
I'll find out, memsahib.
Please.
Oh! Mr. Ransome.
Do forgive me
For intruding.
I'm so anxious to have you come
To a little garden party...
I'm giving this afternoon
For lily hoggett-egburry...
And some of the nicer
English people.
Well, the major and I
Had planned some tennis
For this afternoon, and--
Well, I'm sure that major Safti
Won't mind giving up his tennis
Just this once.
Well, I'm afraid
That's for Mr. Ransome
To decide.
There, you see?
It's all settled.
5:00 for tea.
We'll be looking
For you.
Now, why did I say I'd go?
You didn't.
She did.
So nice to see you, lily.
Thank you, my dear.
Oh, you know major craddock
And mrs. Palmer, of course.
How do you do?
Mrs. Hoggett-egburry.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Lily, Tom Ransome
Is dropping in later.
Tom Ransome!
Oh, my dear!
What a catch for you.
I mean, my dear,
A realpukka sahib,
And one of the very best
County families
In all england.
But, being an american,
Of course that means
Nothing to me.
No, of course not.
Oh! How do you do?
Why, how are you?
I'm so glad to see you.
This is a surprise.
- and how do you do?
How nice seeing you.
- fine, thank you.
Phew!
I wish you'd do something
About that dreadful
Smiley woman.
Yes, dear.
Look at her.
She just does it to annoy me.
Does what, dear?
Sits there
And looks so--
Oh, so middle west
In front of my guests.
I wish you'd do
Something about it.
What can I do, dear?
Well, you're head
Of this mission, aren't you?
Yes, but it's her verandah,
My dear.
Here comes Mr. Ransome.
Hello, Tom!
Oh, hello, aunt phoebe.
How do you keep so cool
In this infernal heat?
No hotter than iowa
In good corn weather.
Mmm! All dressed up,
Fit to kill.
Where you going?
Across the way.
Are you going over?
No, sirree.
We've got
A gentleman's agreement.
She keeps her nose
Out of the mission school,
And I don't have to go
To her parties.
You might call it
An armed truce.
How are you, homer?
Hello, Tom.
Hello, darling.
Hello.
What do you think you are,
A two-year-old?
Working after hours
In this heat.
My husband's a fool.
Now, now, ma.
You know what
It says in scripture
About calling people fools.
I had to keep
One of my pupils
After school.
He'd been throwing
Spitballs.
You'll be staying
To tea, of course?
Oh, he can't.
He's going to the party.
Oho.
Better hurry up, Tom.
Mrs. Simon will be
Climbing that hedge
After you.
Here I go.
So glad you could come.
It's my last tea this season.
We'll be leaving for simla
Before the rains.
You'll be going too,
Of course?
Naturally.
No one stays in Ranchipur
During the monsoon.
No? Only about
Five million people.
Oh, you know what I mean.
Proper people--
The kind of people one knows.
It's so seldom out here
One meets anyone...
From one of the real
County families.
Of course, you've heard
The Eskeths have just arrived?
The Eskeths?
Lord Esketh.
Thelord Esketh.
Oh, fern! Fern!
I'm coming.
Oh, there you are.
Fern, Mr. Ransome's here.
Put some powder
On your nose.
It keeps melting off.
If you think he'd marry me,
You're on the wrong track.
Why, how dare you
Insinuate that I--
All right, all right.
Let's not argue.
Okeydoke. I'm ready.
"okeydoke."
I don't know where you pick up
All this american slang.
Mr. Ransome.
Mr. Ransome, this is
Our little girl.
Our little daughter,
Fern.
How do you do?
I've wanted so much
For you two to know
Each other.
May I get you a drink?
Oh, you're very kind.
I'll send one of the boys.
You know what mother
Means by a drink,
Don't you?
I beg your pardon?
Lemonade.
Oh.
Wouldn't you like something,
Uh, a little stronger?
I see that my reputation
Has preceded me.
Father keeps a little brandy
In case of snake bites
And things.
Mmm. The snakes
Have been a bit trying
This afternoon.
I'll get some for you.
You think your mother
Would mind very much
If we--
Mother? She wouldn't mind.
Thanks.
A little water, please.
Thank you.
Oh, I hope I'm not
Keeping you from your guests.
Oh, they're not my guests.
That's mother's idea
Of high society.
They're all excited
Because you're here.
Really?
Should I be flattered?
They say dreadful things
About you.
What sort of things?
That you're a drunkard
And a bounder
And a remittance man.
They'll hang around you
Just the same...
Because your father
Was an earl.
I suppose I shouldn't
Be talking like this.
Why not?
I don't mind.
I don't care
What they say about you,
Because I know
What you're really like.
I've watched you from my window
Every time you've come
To the smileys'.
Sometimes I think
You're the only person
In Ranchipur I don't hate.
You see, Mr. Ransome,
I've wanted to know you
For a long time,
But not this way.
Not with mother throwing me
At your head.
Oh, my dear child--
Oh, I'm not a child.
I'm over 18.
I'm a woman.
I--
I need your help.
I'm-- I'm in trouble.
Trouble?
Yes, I--
Oh, it's so hard
To tell you.
Well, it needn't be.
I understand.
That's why
I had to come to you.
You see, I--
Perhaps I can help you.
- is there a man mixed up in it?
- no.
Except you.
Oh, Mr. Ransome,
I've got to get away
From here.
I can't stand it
Any longer.
What's the matter?
Well, they want to run
My life for me.
They want me to go on
Living this phony life
They think is so wonderful.
And mother pretending
We're not just missionaries.
You will help me, won't you?
Well, what could I do?
Well, you know
All about the world...
And women
And things like that.
Oh, well, if it's advice
You want--
Oh, no, I--
I need more than advice.
I--
I haven't any money.
Well, I couldn't do that.
Well, I only need
A little--
Just enough to get me
To where I want to go.
I'll pay you back,
Honestly, every cent.
Oh, it isn't the money,
My child.
I told you,
I'm not a child.
Look here, I can't be
Directly responsible
For what might happen to you.
Don't you realize
The awkward position
You might put me in?
I didn't think you cared
About respectability.
Well, I don't.
Neither do I. I just
Want everything there is
To be had out of life.
That's all very well,
But it's not that easy.
I'm not looking
For things to be easy.
I just can't
Stand it here any longer.
I've got to get away.
- where would you go?
- on the stage.
- on the stage?
- well, why not?
I'm not bad-looking.
And I have
Very nice legs.
Oh, yes. Very nice.
Uh, miss Simon and I,
We were just, uh, talking
About the theater.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
But there's a messenger here
From the palace.
Oh, yes?
From her highness
To Ransome sahib.
I'm afraid I'll have to
Leave your delightful party
If I'm going to be on time.
Oh, my dear boy,
That's quite all right.
I understand perfectly.
When the palace calls,
We must drop everything
And obey.
Oh, well,
You're very kind.
Charming, isn't he?
I think it was a mistake
Inviting him.
Everyone knows
His reputation with...
Women... And rum.
Don't be provincial.
Do you ever get us
Invited to the palace?
Do you? Huh!
Good evening,
Your highness.
Good evening.
Good evening, Ransome.
I am glad you could come.
To see you again is one
Of the few thrills left
In life, your highness.
You said that
As if you meant it.
I do mean it.
Come along.
I'll introduce to you
Our guests of honor.
Lady Esketh.
- hello, Edwina.
- why, Tom.
We heard of a person
Named Ransome
Living in Ranchipur,
But I never dreamed it was you.
How nice
That you know each other.
Oh, yes. We're old friends.
Albert?
Yes?
This is Tom Ransome.
You've heard me speak of him.
My husband.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Ransome, of course.
How do you do?
Your highness, I've just
Been telling Mr. "bannager"--
Bannerjee.
Yes, yes.
When I first visited India,
I was amazed to find...
That you people had so many
Of the modern conveniences.
Really?
Yes, and the blessings
Of civilization.
Oh, thank you.
We flatter ourselves
To be jolly well abreast
Of the times.
Your highness,
Dinner is served.
Shall we go?
Now that you've met
One of your own kind,
I suppose you'll be
Grand for days.
Why do you always make a point
Of criticizing men
Like Tom Ransome?
Because he happens
To be a gentleman?
If he's a gentleman,
Why is he living here
In India?
He's got plenty
Of money.
I don't imagine Tom's
Ever thought of money,
One way or another,
In all his life.
Oh, one of those
Radicals, eh?
How do you like the maharani?
Tough egg, isn't she?
I call her the "last queen."
You know, nowadays when queens
Do everything in their power
To look like housewives,
She still dresses the queen
And acts it.
Here goes one of
The most expensive figures
In the british empire.
General, for years
I have been telling you...
Never to draw
To an inside straight.
Your highness, would you mind
If I showed lady Esketh
The palace?
Of course not.
Need a guide?
No, thanks.
I know my way about.
Good luck.
Your highness,
My apologies
For being late.
You received my message?
Was it cholera?
No, just old-fashioned
Colic.
Good. Get in the game.
I need some competition.
Now, look here,
Your highness.
Your highness, I'm willing
To pay £5,000-£10,000-
For that chestnut stallion
And two mares.
It is a generous offer,
But asoka is not for sale.
Oh, come now.
Anything's for sale
If the offer's high enough.
I am afraid
You don't understand.
Your highness
Drives a hard bargain.
I mean to have that stallion.
Name your price
And I'll meet it,
Whatever it is.
It is not a question
Of price, lord Esketh.
You have seen other
Horses in my stables
Almost as perfect as asoka.
Now, please let me make you
A gift of a stallion
And two mares.
A gift?
Well, if your highness
Really means it, you're--
You're very kind.
You understand, of course,
I cannot ship them
During the heat.
Of course.
Thank you.
That's a rembrandt.
And that's a buddhist
Prayer wheel.
And that, I suspect,
Was bought...
From a street peddler
In naples.
And this--
This was bagged
By the old lady herself,
And on foot, too,
If that means anything
To you.
Frankly, it doesn't.
No.
I'd like some air.
Well, it's beginning
To look like rain
At last.
You haven't told me
What you're doing here.
I came out here seven years ago
To paint the maharajah's
Portrait.
Been here ever since.
Not a very exciting life,
Is it?
No. Is yours?
Now and then.
Hmm. What brought you
All the way up here
To Ranchipur?
The maharajah's horses.
Albert's very fond of horses.
The only thing he is fond of,
Except money.
- have you become fond
Of money too?
- passionately.
It used to be
Just excitement.
You can't live
On excitement alone.
We found that out,
Didn't we?
I didn't mind.
I did.
I minded washing
My own stockings,
Going without breakfast
And only being able to afford
The hairdresser once a week.
Well, perhaps I was selfish.
There was a time, mind you--
And I hope you won't blush--
When I seriously thought
Of marrying you.
Why, Tom, how touching.
I never suspected.
Well, we've come
A long way since then.
- a long way apart.
- what do you mean?
You'd know if you'd
Lived here a while.
In Ranchipur,
The important things in life
Are the elemental things,
Such as crops,
Starvation and weather.
In europe,
When someone says,
"it looks like rain,"
In all probability
He's trying to make
Polite conversation.
But here, where people die
As easily as they're born,
They're speaking in terms
Of life and death.
You'll see what I mean
If you're still here
When the rains come.
You'll see them overnight...
Turn the fields, the gardens
And the jungles...
From a parched
And burning desert
Into a mass of green...
That seems to live,
To writhe...
And to devour the walls,
The trees and the houses.
Well, I hope I'm not
Keeping you up.
Tom, you've changed.
You didn't used to be
Such a windbag.
You haven't changed.
Haven't I?
No.
You're still a lovely creature.
Am I?
It's exciting seeing you again.
May I have a cigarette?
So you've forgotten.
Sorry.
Well, I was right.
Here it comes.
Has your highness any idea
Where they've gone?
I'm afraid
It's a big palace,
That they might
Be anywhere.
Excuse me.
Your husband's been looking
For you, lady Esketh.
I think he wants
To go home.
Thank you, your highness.
Brandy?
No, thank you.
Who's the pale-copper
Apollo?
Major Safti.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Well, don't waste your time.
He's a surgeon
And a scientist.
Any interest he might have
In romance is purely biological.
You make him sound
Even more exciting.
There you are.
I've been looking
For you everywhere.
Are you ready to go?
Whenever you are.
I'm ready now.
I think I'm going
To be ill.
It's this confounded
Climate.
I'm sorry, albert.
Mr. Ransome tells me
There's a doctor
In Ranchipur...
Who's not at all bad.
If you're no better
In the morning,
We'll send for him.
Oh, that's very
Kind of you.
Hello.
Well. What are you doing here?
I've run away from home.
I'm never going back.
Uh-huh.
You can't do that.
Why not?
Because I told you--
I can't take
The responsibility.
I know,
But since we talked
This afternoon,
I figured out
Another way
That you can help me.
Yes? What way?
- well?
- I want you to let me
Stay here tonight.
Have you any idea
What you're saying?
Of course I have.
Don't you see?
Then everyone
Would think that--
Well, anyway, there'd be
Such a scandal, I'd have
To leave Ranchipur.
They'd send me away.
That's all very well,
But why, in the name
Of the million gods of India,
Do you have to choose me?
Well, it shouldn't
Matter a bit to you.
Your reputation
Is already so--
So tarnished.
Please.
Don't you dare laugh at me.
Oh, listen to me, child.
What's this?
You're soaking wet.
What of it?
And I'm not a child.
Well, anyway,
You're going straight home.
I'm not going home.
I'm never going home again.
- you want me to put you out
By force?
- you won't.
I'd make a scene,
And you're the kind of a man
Who hates scenes.
Well, at least I can get you
Some dry clothes.
Come with me.
Don't be afraid.
Oh--
I'm not afraid.
I'm just cold.
Uh-huh.
Now, change into these.
You'll find plenty of towels
In the bathroom.
Give yourself
A good rubdown.
Oh, I'll be
In the other room.
That's very becoming.
I don't believe
My old school tie ever
Appeared to better advantage.
Well-- I'm so sorry.
It looked so old and frayed,
And I couldn't find a belt.
That's quite all right.
It would be easier
If I could call you Tom.
There's nothing
I'd like better, fern.
Don't you feel anything
At all about me?
I'd be a fool if I didn't.
You're lovely, fern--
Not nearly so much
Of a child as I thought.
There's somebody there,
Behind the blind.
John! John!
I suppose you heard
Everything that went on.
If you breathe one word of this,
I'll feed you
To the crocodiles.
Yes, sahib.
As long as you're up,
You can drive miss Simon home.
Get the car.
Yes, sahib.
Yes, sahib.
Who was it?
Have they gone?
He's gone, all right,
And you're going too.
All right, I'll go now--
Peacefully.
Yes.
May I come and see you
Once in a while?
Why, of course.
You see, that's important,
Because--
Because I guess I love you.
If I didn't,
I wouldn't be going home now.
Has the doctor come yet?
He's with his lordship now,
Milady.
I want to see him
Before he goes.
Yes, milady.
Don't take that.
Bring another cup.
Yes, milady.
Good morning.
Oh. Good morning.
I'm Edwina Esketh.
Oh.
I hope I did right
Asking especially for you.
Maybe I'm imposing on you.
On the contrary,
Lady Esketh.
It's my duty.
There's nothing seriously
Wrong with your husband,
Just a bad congestion.
But his blood pressure
Is much too high.
No unpleasant asiatic microbes?
No, just simple
European overindulgence.
I prescribed
Some tablets for him,
And he should
Be kept very quiet.
Won't you stay for some tea?
I'll have to get this filled
At the hospital.
Bates can take it.
Do sit down, major.
You're very kind.
Frankly, it's rather
A treat for me to have
Someone to talk to.
I expect it will be
Deadly dull...
Now that albert's
Going to be ill.
I think this tea is cold.
I'll send for some more.
No, don't bother.
I like it that way.
Sugar?
No, thank you.
What would you prescribe
For a patient about to die
Of galloping boredom?
I imagine the maharani
Will see to it that you're
Properly entertained.
- how?
- well, the usual routine
With guests, I believe,
Is to, uh, show them first
The waterworks,
Then, in order,
The narrow-gauge railway,
The hospital, the zoo
And the asylum for the insane.
- how exciting.
- yes, isn't it?
And the maharajah
Has promised me
My choice of horses.
I wonder if he'd mind
If I also chose my escort.
Ranchipur is famous
For its horsemen.
I'm sure you'll have no trouble
In finding a suitable escort.
Do you ride, major?
Whenever I have the time,
Which isn't very often.
Don't you ever take a day off?
I'm willing to make
An exception.
That's very gallant
Of you, major.
If you don't mind...
Waiting until
After working hours.
Besides, it's cooler then.
I wouldn't dream of
Interfering with your work.
What's this?
The insane asylum?
No. No, this is
The maharani's music school.
Oh.
Major sahib, memsahib.
How are you, I hope?
Would you care
To look around?
I'd love to.
Lady Esketh would like
To see the school.
Oh, yes. Yes.
This way.
Mr. Das, the director
Of the school.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do you like music?
Oh, I have a box
At covent garden
As a matter of course.
Frankly, I like
This sort better.
Mr. Das, is jemnaz singh
Here today?
Oh, yes. Yes.
This way, please.
Good.
Jemnaz singh,
The rajput singer.
What kind of song
Is it?
Oh, a love song.
Oh, yes.
Do you know the song?
Yes. The words
Are traditional,
But the music
Is improvised--
Free variations.
How do the words go?
Well, it's in
The ancient language--
The ceremonial language.
I'm afraid I don't know it
As well as I should.
Try.
Well, it's a bit florid.
"that my lyre...
"were of purest jade,
"with strings...
"of fine spun gold.
"that I...
"might sing...
"with merit...
"of your beauty.
"your hands...
"hold my life,
"my being.
"drop it,
"and I perish.
"but in your heart,
"my love...
"has found a home.
"and it...
Can never die."
"but in your heart,
"my love has found a home,
And it can never die."
It is a lot
Of sentimental nonsense,
Isn't it?
- hello, miss macdaid.
- oh, hello.
Where's Rama?
He's busy.
Ahh!
Didn't turn up yesterday.
What sort of a woman
Is lady Esketh?
Lady Esketh? Why?
The major brought
Her here yesterday
To show her the hospital.
He's out with her
Again today.
Well, you met her.
What did you think
Of her?
I know her type.
Many like her in europe
These days.
Too many for its own good.
Oh. Well, I would say
She's the one woman
In Ranchipur...
That Rama shouldn't know.
Is lady Esketh
Dining out tonight?
Yes, milord.
Her ladyship is dining
At the Bannerjees'.
Mr. Ransome
Is calling for her.
Oh.
Why should I care
Who's calling for her?
Go on, answer it.
Yes, milord.
What's this?
Major Safti's orders.
I hope that blasted native
Knows what he's doing.
Major Safti is the head
Of the state medical department.
Filth.
Her ladyship
Will be ready directly.
May I offer you
A drink, sir?
Yes. Brandy and soda--
And make it strong.
Yes, sir.
How's the patient
This evening?
Much better, sir, thank you.
Thanks.
Hello, Tom.
Oh, hello.
Good of you to come for me.
Are we late?
Oh, no, no. There's--
There's plenty of time.
No, Mr. Bannerjee's
Dinners always begin...
At the fashionable
Half-past 8:00.
Hear you've been
Having adventures.
I am a victim
Of circumstances.
If you didn't drink so much,
You wouldn't always be
Getting into trouble.
Well, at least my weakness
Is wine.
- what do you mean by that?
- you know what I mean.
Listen to who's moralizing.
I suppose that comes
From philandering
Around missions.
I never philander
Around missions,
And I don't philander
Around hospitals either.
Don't be catty, Tom.
I do believe you're jealous.
You know perfectly well
I'm not jealous.
If there ever was
Anything between us,
We both know it's finished now--
Dead and gone.
Then why do you come here
And act drunk
And dictatorial?
Because I see
Something happening
I don't like.
Stop talking
Like a copy book.
It's not becoming.
When are you leaving?
We planned to go Tomorrow,
But with albert ill--
Is he too ill to travel?
No.
Then why don't you go?
You are a beast, aren't you?
Tom, we've double-crossed
Almost everyone in the world.
Let's not start
On each other.
I don't want
To interfere really.
But Rama's my friend,
And I don't like it.
If you only knew
How wrong you are.
He's the one man I've ever met
I haven't been able to make
An impression on.
Are you sober enough
To take me
To the party?
Almost.
Bates.
Bates!
Have they gone yet?
Yes, milord.
They've just left.
Well, get me
My dispatch case.
Yes, milord.
Go on, get it.
Don't just stand there.
And the pen.
Why are you standing there
Looking like a fool?
Your lordship
Didn't dismiss me.
Dismiss you?
You're lucky I didn't
Dismiss you ages ago.
I've put up with your
Infernal impertinence
For 15 years.
Don't stand there looking at me.
If I want you again, I'll ring.
Now, get out.
Yes, milord.
Come here.
Close those.
I suppose you'd like me
To die of malaria.
No, milord.
Well, get out!
Yes, milord.
Just stand still.
They won't attack
If they're not provoked.
Welcome, lady Esketh.
Good evening, Mr. Ransome.
Please.
Some night, you're going
To fall flat on your face,
And people will begin
To suspect that you drink.
Good evening.
It's awfully kind of you
To come, lady Esketh.
Of course, we are terribly
Upset about lord Esketh--
That he can't
Be with us tonight.
Hello, Ransome.
I believe you know almost
Everyone from the palace.
You know raschid ali khan.
Of course.
Yes.
And may I present miss macdaid?
Lady Esketh.
- yes, we've met.
- yes, indeed.
I hope you're enjoying
Your stay, lady Esketh.
- very much.
- how soon do you expect
To be leaving?
Oh. I'm in no particular hurry.
I find it very pleasant
Here in Ranchipur.
There's major Safti.
Excuse me.
Good evening, major.
Good evening. You know
Major remmington? Lady Esketh.
Could I have
A word with you?
Certainly.
Forgive us.
Poor lady Esketh.
She's so frightfully upset
About her husband.
Better have this cocktail.
It isn't as bad as it looks.
Do you know that your friends
Have been warning me
To leave town?
Leave town? Why?
Why do you think?
They feel
I'm a bad influence on you.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't it?
You're not afraid of me,
Are you, major?
Why, of course not.
You wouldn't feel relieved
If I left?
No. As a matter of fact,
I'd miss you.
I've enjoyed your company
Very much.
- I was afraid
You'd take that attitude.
- what attitude?
Lying to me.
But I--
I just told you that--
Don't bother to explain.
You know perfectly well
What I'm thinking,
And I know
What you're thinking.
I've done everything
But fall at your feet,
And you haven't even blinked.
So I think I will
Leave Tomorrow morning.
Please don't leave
On my account.
Not because of what might
Happen to you if I stayed,
But because
Of what might happen to me.
Earthquake!
It's an earthquake!
Well, it's all over.
Nothing to worry about,
Not a thing.
Just a slight tremor.
Where is his highness?
He was in there.
What's the matter with you,
Standing there like dummies?
Clear this away.
Get through to that room!
Wire's down, of course.
I'm going to the palace
For orders.
Major--
Come along with us,
Miss macdaid.
They'll need us
At the hospital.
Bates!
Fifteen years, it's been
"yes, milord. No, milord.
Yes, milord."
Well, it's too late now.
We're both for it.
You're afraid.
Come on with me.
Good morning,
Edwina.
Good morning.
Water's still rising.
Look at queen victoria.
What's that frightful row?
Bannerjee.
He says I'm an impious
Barbarian.
But not in english,
You'll notice.
That's India for you.
They've been praying
For the rains all spring.
Now that they're here,
They're praying for them
To go away.
Might be just as well
If we joined in.
Look. It's a boat.
Well, I'm glad someone
Besides ourselves is alive.
Hello!
What on earth?
Why, it's the little
Simon girl.
Your juvenile light of love?
Come to snatch you
From a watery grave--
How sweet.
Come on. Give me a hand.
Easy now.
Thank heaven you're safe.
I didn't close my eyes
All night.
I was afraid
You'd be drowned.
Edwina, this is miss Simon.
Lady Esketh.
How do you do?
We are glad to see you.
If you hadn't come,
We might have died
Of starvation.
Or boredom.
Where did you find
Thequeen mary?
Down the road while we were
Looking for my-- my father.
I'm sorry, fern.
I thought, if you were
All right, I'd take you
Back to the mission.
It's safer there.
Yes. It ought to hold
About two--
One to paddle
And one to bail.
You two think
You can manage it?
There's time
For several trips.
I'll take you first.
I'm-- I'm all right.
No more paddling
For you, young lady,
Until you've had some rest.
Now, come on.
I don't need
Any rest.
Now.
You come over here now
And lie down.
Now, we'll fix this
For you. There.
Now, don't you worry
About a thing.
I'm gonna take lady Esketh,
And then I'm coming back
For you.
In the meantime,
You be a good girl.
I'm not in your way
Being here, am I?
You're not going to apologize
For saving our lives, are you?
Well, that's only one
Of the reasons I came.
I wanted you to know
That you were in no danger.
Well, that's reassuring.
I mean from me.
I didn't mean to put you
On the spot,
But when they found out
I'd been to your house,
They wouldn't believe the truth.
Well, don't you
Worry about that.
Mother pretended to be sore,
But I don't think
She was really sore.
Because, you see,
If we got married,
She could spend the rest
Of her life hobnobbing
With high society in england.
Yes.
Well, anyway, I thought
You'd like to know that...
You won't have to marry me.
Unless you decide
To change your mind.
That's a bit of luck.
The rain's stopping.
Hey, Bannerjee.
Don't get impatient.
I'll come back for you later.
Bannerjee.
Says he'd rather die
On this roof...
Than suffer
My unclean presence
In the same boat.
Ready?
I suppose so.
I'd like to go by the city.
You mean by way
Of the hospital.
Don't you care enough
To find out what's become
Of your friends?
Don't be a fool.
I'm sick of being british
And pretending I'm not
Frightened and worried.
But we haven't time.
I've got to bring
The boat back for fern.
I think it's
Absolutely nauseating the way
You're leading that girl on.
I've never seen such
An obvious case of calf-love
In all my life.
Her face
Lights up like fireworks
Every time she looks at you.
That's what you like,
Isn't it?
That's why
We didn't get on.
Get in.
You always want the woman
To treat you like a god.
I treated you as if you
Were just as bad as myself.
Oh, so it's you.
Well, where's fern?
At the Bannerjees'.
I'm going right back
For her.
The lady with the artillery
Is aunt phoebe.
How do you do?
Mrs. Smiley,
Lady Esketh.
Pleased to meet ya.
Why don't you go
Right on up the house.
Thank you.
Yes.
Have you seen homer?
No.
We couldn't get through
To the city.
Oh. I suppose you'll be
Wantin' something to eat.
No, thanks. I've gotta
Get back for fern.
Don't be a fool.
Ain't she safe where she is?
Not if that water rises again.
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.
Good-bye.
Come on in.
I'll get you
Some coffee.
Thank you.
Steady, old girl.
You've come back.
I'm sorry. I lost your boat.
I've done all I can.
Rama?
I know I can count on you...
To help your queen...
Rebuild... Our state.
Close the door.
My good and loyal friends,
Ranchipur has been struck
A cruel blow.
The weakness in our
National character has been...
That we are inclined to blame
Catastrophe on the gods...
And fail in our duty.
I don't propose
To let that happen here.
We must call up
All our strength,
All our resolution,
All our courage...
If we are to bring
Our people to safety.
Each of you
Must do his part.
I have chosen you because
I know you will not fail me.
I proclaim
A state of emergency...
To exist in Ranchipur.
Raschid.
Your police will work
With t
What is it, major?
It has come sooner
Than I expected.
Several cases of the plague
In the sweepers' quarters.
On top of that, half
The water in Ranchipur
Must be polluted.
Do what you can to keep
The plague from spreading.
Burn down the whole quarter
If you must.
The rest of you
Know your duty.
Ransome.
I want you to stay.
Give me a cigarette.
Thank you.
I said I could depend
On this little group.
I meant you too.
I don't know why,
Your highness.
Because you are one of us.
I need a personal
Aide-de-camp--
Someone I can depend on
To carry out my orders...
And use his own head
Whenever necessary.
Do you think you can do it?
If you think I can.
Would you mind
Sitting down...
Or... Doing anything
But just standing there?
I'm sorry.
Don't mind me.
It's just my foul disposition.
Come on and play me
A hand of russian bank.
I don't know how.
What's the matter?
Nothing really.
It's because
I'm so glad.
Last night,
He came back for me.
Not because he had to,
But-- but because
He wanted to.
His face was so tired
And so kind.
He was glad too.
I could tell.
And he tried to smile,
But he was too worn out.
He just fell asleep in my arms
Like a little boy.
I felt he belonged to me.
I never wanted
The night to end.
You have got it badly,
Haven't you?
I suppose so.
What's that?
They're dynamiting
Part of the city.
You know what you've picked out
For yourself, don't you?
Yes.
Then there's no use
Warning you.
No.
Look here. You don't
Expect him to marry you?
Well, not unless
He wants to.
Of course, if he would--
But I'll do
Whatever he wants.
Tom's been a selfish brute
All his life.
What would you do
If you were in my place?
I wouldn't be in your place.
I'd never let any man
Mean that much to me.
Look here.
You're a nice child.
I'll do anything I can
To help you.
If I only had a black eight.
Hello!
Hey! Come on there.
Hey! Hey!
Come on there.
Hey! Hey!
Well, what's this--
Barnum & bailey's
Come to town?
Well! Oh, my!
You're all right, eh?
What's this, an invasion?
I'm afraid we'll have
To turn our place
Into a barracks.
So many of the children
Were left homeless.
Well, there's always room
For a few more.
Come on in, kids. Come on.
Come on, children.
Right this way.
Come on in.
Hurry up now.
My goodness.
Come in, come in.
Well, say--
You'll have to do
Some foragin' for me.
I didn't expect to have
To feed an army.
Miss Simon, take 'em out
And show 'em where
To clean up.
Out. Out.
Hurry up now.
Go on out there.
Well.
That's it.
I bet you got
Your feet wet.
Ma, don't worry.
I'm all right.
Let me see.
Just as I thought. You sit
Right down in that chair
And change your socks.
Eh, all right.
Oh. Wait a minute.
I have a message for fern.
There.
You're to come back
With me, eh?
I'll get my coat.
Worst mess
I've ever heard of.
Are you ready? Every bed
In the hospital's filled...
And not half enough
Doctors and nurses
To go around.
Ah. The maharani's
Sent out a call
For volunteers.
Good-bye, Edwina.
Good-bye, fern.
Did you ever
Ride an elephant?
Next, please.
Your name?
Sibabhai.
Experience?
High school training
In hospital work.
Report to miss ghose,
Second floor.
Next, please.
Your name?
Edwina Esketh.
Oh.
Experience?
No experience.
Assigned to probational duty.
Wait over there, please.
Next, please.
Your name?
Tarabai.
Experience?
Yes.
All right.
Take him away.
Thank you, captain.
Yes.
What is she doing here?
She volunteered.
Why is she doing
That kind of work?
She's had no experience.
Lady Esketh is a very
Intelligent woman.
She's not stupid.
It might be worth your time
To give her some
Quick training.
She ought to be capable
Of ward duty.
Yes, major.
Wait.
I'll do that for you.
Thank you.
It is heavy.
Get your tray,
And we'll make the rounds.
Laying a hand on their head
Doesn't really help much,
Except that
It gives them courage.
You see, they know
I'm of high caste.
For centuries, they've been
Made to step aside...
So their shadows
Won't fall on us
And pollute us.
Call the porters.
They look at you so,
As if they trusted you.
They have no one else
To trust.
You've done a wonderful thing
Coming here like this.
And it isn't easy,
Especially if you've
Never done it before.
It's funny how you
Get used to things.
I don't even
Get sick anymore...
As I did 20 times
The first day.
And yet you stayed.
Yes. I stayed.
Why?
You don't have to answer.
Just remember that you're
In constant danger.
Don't forget to use
Plenty of disinfectant.
We mustn't let anything
Happen to you.
You're too valuable.
Mr. Durga.
We've had a call from
The hospital for more linen
And 250 pairs of sheets.
This will give you authority
To take what you want from
The rajputana textile company.
If Mr. Motilal, the manager,
Objects, send him to me.
Yes, sahib.
And I shall introduce him
To my pet lions, who will
Feed on his liver.
- yes, sahib.
I bring the brandy, sahib.
Aha. The brandy.
No, no. Take it over
To the hospital.
All of it?
Yes, all of it.
Yes, sahib.
But don't think
I'm reforming.
When this is over, I'm going
On the biggest, longest,
Most magnificent bat
In the history of civilization.
Make a note of that.
Yes, Mr. Ransome.
It's good to see you,
General.
I came as soon as the weather
Was clear enough for flying.
Your highness, the viceroy
Has asked me to convey to you
His deepest sympathy,
Not only in his official
Capacity, but as an old
And sorrowing friend.
May I add my own.
I am grateful
To the viceroy.
But more than sympathy,
I need cooperation.
His excellency also asked me
To assure you...
That the british government
Stands ready to help
In any way it can.
Thank you, general.
I knew I could count
On the viceroy
And yourself.
I take off in the morning
To make a personal report
To his excellency.
Oh, by the way,
I have room
For one passenger,
If there's anyone
You care to send.
Yes, I think there is.
Ransome, I'd like
To speak to you.
Yes, your highness.
Thank you, general.
I'll let you know.
Thank you.
What is lady Esketh
Doing at the hospital?
Every conceivable filthy
And drudging task.
Yes. I suppose miss macdaid
Would have seen to that.
But why is she there?
She told me
She wanted to help.
But that isn't
The real reason.
No.
The english
Are an odd people.
I admire them,
But I don't pretend
To understand them.
The english
Are a sentimental people
And very much ashamed of it.
We had plans
For major Safti,
He and I.
I won't be here long.
I have no children,
Though I always wanted them.
Before he died,
He named his successor--
A man whose blood,
Sympathies and training...
Fitted him
For the responsibility...
Of guiding the state
Of Ranchipur.
Did you know that?
No.
No alien influence
Must enter his life.
He must remain dedicated
To his cause.
Would it hurt him so much
To give her up?
For a while, yes.
But he's young.
He'll get over it,
I'm sure.
I want to do
The right thing.
I'd trample her
Without mercy.
But then, of course,
I was brought up
In the hills...
Where charity
Is a sign of weakness.
I only learned tolerance
And humanity...
After I married.
I want to do
As he would have done.
She is a bad woman,
Isn't she?
Mm, not so much bad
As unhappy.
Once, long ago, Edwina
Took a wrong path.
Ever since, she's either
Been too proud...
Or too stubborn
To turn back.
- in many respects,
She's like your highness.
- what do you mean by that?
Well, that she's outspoken,
Intelligent,
Has no particular use
For any other women--
Uh, unless they're over 70.
But your highness
Is the younger of the two.
Her kind of civilization
Is on its way out.
That's exactly
What makes it impossible.
Tell her I'm sending her
On the plane Tomorrow.
How long since you've
Been to bed?
Oh, perhaps a day or two.
I don't remember.
After you've seen lady Esketh,
Get some sleep.
You've been a real help.
Believe me.
Come in.
Hello, Tom.
Hello.
Ever try to curl your hair
Without a curling iron?
No.
Alcohol's a precious
Commodity these days,
Not to be used
For purposes
Of mere vanity.
Sit down--
On sataya's bed.
She's my roommate--
A nautch dancer.
I've been hearing
Dreadful things about you.
It seems you've become
A shockingly useful
Citizen.
Can't help myself.
It's a conspiracy.
Why so glum?
Why so cheerful?
Mm, I'm young again.
That's why.
Mm.
I feel exactly as I did
The day of my first
Real dancing party,
When I was 12.
I remember I had
A pink taffeta dress.
Hideous thing really,
But I thought
It was a love.
And that little beast
Of a joe cumberland--
The one that's in
The cabinet now--
Mm-hmm.
Spilled strawberry jam
On it.
I tried
To scratch his eyes out.
The authorities
Intervened.
Edwina?
I'm afraid
I've come to spill jam
On your party dress.
What do you mean?
The maharani is sending you
Away in the morning.
No. I won't go.
You'd better.
She means it.
No, Tom.
I've thought it all out,
And this time I know
I'm right.
I must be right.
Believe me, Tom.
I'm in love for the first
Time in my life--
Completely,
Honestly in love.
I believe you.
So you can tell
The maharani I won't go.
Yeah. She'll probably
Have you shot.
She can, you know.
I'll risk it.
And will you risk
Destroying him?
I won't destroy him.
He loves me.
I'm sure of it.
That's why you must go.
Let's try to look
At this thing realistically.
The maharani's
Giving Rama his choice.
He can have Ranchipur or you.
He can't have both.
You're asking me to give up
The only real chance
For happiness I've ever had.
Don't get me started.
I hate scenes.
Ah. 6:00.
I'm on duty.
Cheerio, Tom.
You've done your duty
Like a good little soldier.
Coolie. Coolie.
The glass.
Good morning.
I couldn't sleep.
I had to come
And talk to you.
Listen.
Ah, that's a good sign.
It means that life
Is going on again.
It means we're going to win.
Last night, for the first time,
There were fewer new cases
Instead of more.
You look tired.
I'm not really.
This is the only chance we have
To talk to each other.
It wasn't true what I said
About not being able to sleep.
I set the alarm clock.
You shouldn't.
You get little enough rest.
There are all kinds of rest.
This is better than sleeping.
Tom tells me
That you're leaving today.
Yes. By request.
It's probably just as well.
I go through torture
Every moment...
Because you're in danger here.
Nothing must happen
To you now.
Rama.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
It just makes me so happy
To hear you say that.
I never thought,
When I first met you--
It seems so long ago--
That you'd ever say
Anything like that to me.
I wouldn't have
Said it then,
Not to the woman
I knew then.
But now I--
I think
You're someone different.
Please don't think that I'm just
Being mystical and Indian,
But...
I can't connect you
With her--
That woman I met
At the summer palace,
So shiny and glossy
And so crafty
For what she wanted.
Oh, yes, I--
I knew what you wanted.
And I was tempted.
That's why I stayed for a cup
Of lukewarm tea, which I hate.
And you were trying so hard
To make me believe...
You were respectable
And inexperienced.
Wait. I-- I don't think
Much of respectability.
I think a great deal more
Of truth.
Maybe that's why
I hesitated then.
And later, when I pretended
I didn't find you exciting.
Something held me back.
I must have seen
The other woman within you--
The one that came here,
Scrubbed floors
And emptied slop pails...
And fought nausea
And weariness and fear--
The real woman.
You see, it would have been
Like taking a counterfeit...
Instead of waiting
For the real coin.
I wanted you to know
What I felt because I--
I think so much of you
That I can risk making
A fool of myself.
Maybe, in your heart,
You're laughing at me.
No. No.
Well, now you know my secret.
We'll let the maharani
Send you away.
Then when the worst
Is over here,
No matter where you are,
I'll come after you.
You'd leave Ranchipur?
Yes.
Yes. We'll go to some other city
Where I can set up a practice--
Calcutta, madras
Or the malay states--
Where we can live
Our own lives together.
You'd leave all this,
Knowing what it's meant
To you?
Knowing what you do of me?
No.
Just hold me
A little while.
Edwina.
You're not well. You--
You have a fever.
No.
No.
I-- I'm just tired.
Take over in the ward.
How is she?
Rama's with her now.
She sent word
She wanted to see me.
Yes, I know.
I want to give her
Another injection
In about half an hour.
Yes, major.
Miss Simon,
You may go in now.
I don't know what to do, Tom.
I don't know what to do.
She won't fight.
She hasn't any will to live.
I don't know what to do.
Steady.
I'm supposed
To be a doctor.
I'm supposed to help people
To fight for life.
And I want her to live
More than I want
To live myself.
I tried to tell her
That she must fight.
I-- I couldn't.
I couldn't speak.
I'm all gone inside.
Stay with me, Tom.
I need you.
Rama, this won't do.
You've got to get
A hold of yourself.
It's no use.
I-- I can't.
We're different--
Deep down where it matters.
I'm an Indian.
I-- I can't be
Calm and unemotional.
I want to tear my clothes
And wail like a--
Like Bannerjee.
You're not Bannerjee.
You're a man.
You're a doctor.
No. No.
I've failed.
I can't save her.
Rama. Rama.
Rama! Listen to me.
If you lose your way now,
You'll never find it again.
Think of the maharani
And your duty,
Of the maharajah
And all he planned for you.
Think of the people
Who worship and respect you.
To them, you're a symbol--
Something clean and courageous,
That's been born in the darkness
And filth that was India.
You are India--
The new India.
Don't betray all of us
Who have faith in you.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm all right now.
It won't happen again.
Thank you.
But I can't take them.
Don't be an idiot.
If you and Tom
Have children,
Your son might be
The earl of nolham.
He'd have a wife,
And she could wear them
To boring dinner parties,
Tell how they'd been
Left to her by...
A shameless wench
Called lady Esketh...
Who died in Ranchipur
During the great disaster
Of 1938.
We're such snobs at home.
We like stories like that.
I suppose this is the way
It feels to repent
And get religion--
Giving away
My worldly goods.
Anyway,
It's a nice feeling.
Hello, Tom.
Don't look so unhappy.
I'm not.
Rama says if you'd only fight.
What's there to fight about?
Has anything changed since
The last time we talked?
Would you mind, my dear?
Have you got a ring
For fern?
Does she like sapphires?
There's a condition
Attached.
You'll have to marry her.
You said
You'd do anything.
Yes, but I'd be
No good for her.
Oh.
Stop bragging.
She's mad about you.
She thinks you're a god.
That's what
You've always wanted.
We have had such foul luck,
You and I.
But...
You've picked a winner
At last.
Ask him to come in.
As soon as you're well,
We'll get away from all this.
Of course.
I've thought it all out.
We won't be running away
From anything,
Because there won't be
Anybody else in the world
But ourselves.
We'll have each other.
Yes.
Just you and I.
Up to kashmir,
Down the ganges to bengal.
And then perhaps
In a little boat
From calcutta...
Through all the islands
Of the east.
The spice islands,
The coral islands...
And all those places with names
Like magic spells.
Just you and I.
Nothing else will matter,
Will it?
Will it?
Edwina.
Edwina.
Edwina.
This time, it has been
Built to stand--
As long as you live...
And your children...
And your children's children.
The time is here, Rama.
Your people are waiting.
What is it, Rama?
What do you hear?
Nothing, your highness.
Only a song.
They're waiting, Rama.

Second chapter
PARADISE LOST
FLEEING THE VENGEANCE OF THE TABU
THE GUILTY LOVERS FOUGHT THEIR WAY...
OVER LEAGUES OF OPEN SEA
SEEKING SOME ISLAND OF THE PEARL TRADE...
WHERE THE WHITE MAN RULES
AND THE OLD GODS ARE FORGOTTEN
IN THEIR FRAIL CANOE THROUGH STORMS
UNDER A BURNING SKY THIRST-CRAZED AND STARVING...
ALWAYS DRIVEN ON BY FEAR...
FEAR OF THE AVENGING TABU.
The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly.
The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island.
But it seems only play to him.
He evidently does not yet realize what money means.
But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
As the Government desires above all things to avoid conflict between the islands under its rule,... it demands the arrest of this man and woman wherever found.
For their arrest, the Government ofers a reward of Five Hundred Frans.
Et. Cadoustal .
A most unfortunate accident happened today on the Lagoon.
It occured while most of the people were ashore at one of their native peasts.
There is a spot in the lagoon, the richest in pearl beds of any in the South Seas.
But this spot is Tabu. Natives shun it.
Today, one of our old divers defying the superstition.
An enormous man-eating shark guards these pearls the native believe...
Today's tragedy proves this is no superstition: the shark is there.
I trust I have the Government's approval in putting up a sign forbidding further diving in this place.

TABU
And I said, "You children of sin
"destruction and damnation will follow.
"Yes, there shall come pestilences upon you.
"Yeah, pestilence.
"Beware all of these palaces of sin
- these dens of addiction."
- Shut up! drifting on the foul-smelling sea of life..
Hey, it's your place, why don't you throw him out?
My children, your souls are are right above this evil.
- Let me show you the way.
- I'll show you the way.
How about the rest of my crew?
That's the
Shanghai Duck's business.
See, I'm paying the most money to my sailors, $250 a piece and I don't want any dead ones.
I wanna get going at dawn.
Lot of ships in the bay. that would like to get underway.
If everything's so easy to get.
I'll run into the gold field.
Hey, how many are we short? Three?
Now, we're only short two.
- What will it be, sailor?
- How much are your rooms?
Come on, Weasel.
- Dollar six pence.
- Alright.
Just land?
- Yeah.
- What ship?
- North Star.
- I sailed on her once.
Three whiskeys.
You quit the ship here?
- Yeah.
- Gonna try the gold fields?
I am.
Well, here's to the gold fields.
Oh, sailor.
That's it.
Put your arm around me.
That's it. Step up.
'What did you say the name of the place was?'
The Occidental.
Well, for trouble, you went to the right place.
The Shanghai Duck, what a fella.
His own brother sleeps in a room that's locked to keep him waking up at sea.
He works for Burke.
The man who owns the Occidental.
A big fellow with a scar on his face?
Yes. That's Burke.
Him, Slugs, and Duck're partners in the Shanghai business.
And believe me, they got reputation that's gotta smell like when the tire's out.
What does the Duck look like?
A big fellow with a hook for a right hand.
And believe me, him and the hook are two things to stay away from.
Not me. I'm gonna cook that Duck's goose.
Well, what's it gonna get you?
More trouble?
Mr. Morgan, why don't you go back to your ship?
The coast is no place for a decent man who has a trade.
You see, here they believe differently.
They think in order to live, you gotta kill the other fella.
You know, we have an old proverb
Too much for me.
What does it mean?
It means that
"He who digs a grave for somebody else usually falls in himself."
Don't you worry about me.
Now that I know the rules,
I know how to play.
You mean, It's a case of dog eat dog?
- Yes.
- What chance has a puppy got?
Hey, uh..
...how much did you say they'd get for Shanghaiing me?
They've been known to get as high as $250 a man.
And you call yourself a business man?
Why didn't you turn me over to a ship?
I sell merchandise, not men.
Why did you take me in?
Because you needed help, maybe.
Alright, Solly.
I'll make it up to you sometime.
Right now, all I wanna do is meet Slugs Crippen.
Hey, this isn't worth very much to you, is it?
- No, not much.
- Uh-huh.
Well..
That's worth just about
$250 to me.
Wait a minute, Slugs.
I'm going to North Star.
See you later.
Hello, Slugger.
Oh-oh!
Hey, where is Slugs?
He just left for the North Star.
Maybe, you can catch him.
Well..
Dog eat dog.
Hey, Slugs!
Slugs!
Hey, Slugs.
- Ahoy!
- Ahoy!
What is it?
From Spider Burke's, got two men for you.
- Send 'em up.
- Send down the money.
Smart, ain't you?
Yeah.
You are too lucky.
My business to be lucky.
- Not a bad business.
- Make your bets, boys.
Don't do it, Morgan.
Keep your money.
Money? Look Solly, there's money.
You know, people are crazy to go to the mines and break their backs there.
There's a gold mine right here.
- One hundred.
- That's talking to 'em, sailor.
Wait a minute.
Let someone else turn it.
Alright.
Belle.
Belle, turn the cards just once for luck.
How will that do?
Oh, you can't get away with this.
- No one asked her to do it.
- You're mistaken.
I did.
You wanna make any more bets?
Not in your game.
Make your play, boys.
- You playing?
- Playing.
That makes us even.
The sailor that got away from Slugs?
Yeah, the one who got the rope.
Pete said he saw him row the boat ashore and tie it here.
No use looking any more, Spider.
Sluggs is dead or on his way to China.
- But the sailor is still here.
- Yeah, and when I find him..
Wait a minute,
I'll find him myself.
This is Morra's place.
One of the best in the coast.
This one looks much better than the rest of them.
That's the danger.
Once let them build up these places attract our decent people, and our cause is lost.
Ford, as the editor of the
Tribune, you have the power in your hands to clean up this coast.
That's Judge Crawford.
What's he doing here?
Pass the word around he's here and tell everyone to clamp down.
- Make your plays, boys.
- Who's the owner around here?
- I am.
- How about a job?
Back to your ship, sailor.
Make your plays, boys.
Ahh!
Get him, sailor.
Bet you the Shanghai Duck kills him.
Why not, what you offerin'?
It isn't the first guy that the
Duck has killed with his hook.
Can't you do something about this?
You own this place, stop that fight.
Judge, if you think you can stop it, go ahead.
He's killed the Duck.
Here's to the sailor!
'Don't you pay for this, sailor.'
Make way here, make way.
Why don't you get this man to a doctor.
Oh, I'm alright.
I don't want any doctor.
That was a rotten attack.
I'm glad you came out of it.
- Thanks.
- My name's Charles Ford.
I'm the new editor of The
Tribune. May I ask your name?
Bat Morgan
Mr. Morgan, you've done
San Francisco a service.
If there's anything I can do,
I-I'd like to help you.
Thanks very much.
Hurt bad?
Just full of holes as a sieve.
Come on, we'll go to a pharmacy and get you all bandaged up.
What's your name, sailor?
- Bat Morgan.
- Morgan, eh?
- Well, you can have that job.
- Doin' what?
Whatever you think you can do best.
Alright, I'll be around tomorrow to do it.
That's good enough for me.
- You not gonna work for Morra?
- Yes, but not for long.
You mean, just long enough to make a little steak, huh?
No, Solly a big one.
It's good to have the paper come to life again, sir.
Since Mr.Barrat's death, it's been little more than hand bill.
Thank you, Tupper. There's plenty here to give it life.
That is if Ms. Barrat agrees with me.
I'm sure she will, sir.
- Good morning, Tupper.
- Good morning Miss
- Is Mr. Ford in?
- Yes, Miss.
Oh yes, I see him.
Thank you.
Oh, good morning,
Ms. Barrat.
Good morning.
You've, uh, you've read my first edition?
Every word of it.
I think it's splendid.
Aah, I'm glad to hear that.
You're the first managing editor
I've had who wore skirts.
Well, I was a little bit worried that perhaps my editorial policy might be expected to hide behind them.
No, I want The Tribune to fight.
Well, I think we started pretty good this morning, don't you?
I can't congratulate you on this.
My father was a fighter,
Mr. Ford.
He believed that San Francisco could become a great fine city.
But the Barbary Coast was holding back it's progress.
So he fought the coast in the open.
These attacks cost him his life.
We found his body washed up in the bay with a knife wound in his back.
Yes I know.
I'm tellin' you this so you know that you've taken a dangerous position.
I realize that. What I've heard about this part of the country an editor is considered a mollycoddler unless he's been shot several times before he's thirty.
Mr. Ford, I intend that my paper shall follow my father's policy.
Ms. Barrat, a paper that fights for a city grows with that city.
San Francisco is going to be a metropolis and The Tribune a great paper.
That's why I gave up a good position to come out here.
To help build a city and a newspaper.
- That will be our policy.
- It will.
- Good morning, Jean.
- Good morning, Judge.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Ford.
Read your editorial.
I want to compliment you on your stand.
You've got the right idea.
We need men like you out here.
Thank you, Judge Crawford.
May I give you a word of advice?
I wish you would.
You're new here, Ford.
You haven't gone through what we have.
There've been a lot of honest men come here.
Some of 'em have stayed that way. Most of them haven't.
It's been a brutal money-mad life.
But there are still a good number of us who have tried to stamp out vice and corruption who think that San Francisco can be made a decent law-abiding city.
You have a paper.
A great influence...use it.
I'll do my best.
Nice, isn't it?
That the best you've got?
Don't forget. I only got a second-hand store.
Well, Solly, before we're through you're gonna have the biggest emporium in town.
From now on, nothing is going to be too good for us.
He he.
What was the take?
About 30,000.
That's a good night.
Good enough.
Well, it won't be good enough if this keeps up.
Ford's on the warpath again.
Huh!
They won't stand, for this much longer.
Who won't stand for it?
Jim Daley and the boys down at city hall.
First thing you know they'll be down here trying to run us out.
- Chung.
- Yes, sir?
Bag all this and bring it to the office.
- Good night, Bat.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Say, uh, Chung.
- Yes?
Where does Jim Daley hang out?
- International Hotel.
- International?
Oh, thanks.
Say, what are we doing here?
It's all for your education, Solly.
I'm showing you the town.
I'd sooner stay where I belong.
Who're you up here to see?
Jim Daley.
Jim Daley?
The political boss?
Yeah.
- Morning gentlemen.
- Good morning.
Say, uh, is Jim Daley around?
Yes, he's about somewhere.
You'll probably find him in the bar or in the dining room.
- We'll wait for the Judge here?
- Yes.
Wait here.
- Hello.
- Well, how do you do?
How are you getting along?
- Fine.
- Good. I'm glad to hear it.
Uh, you're doing pretty well yourself.
- I've been reading your paper.
- I'm doing my best.
Say, uh, you told me one time if
I wanted a favor, I should ask.
- That's right.
- Well..
I'd like to meet the lady.
'Ha-ha. Certainly.
Ms. Barrat, Mr. Morgan.'
How do you do, Mr. Morgan?
Hello.
Well, well, young man.
I'm glad to see you again in this end of town.
I'm trying to learn my way around.
Thanks, Ford.
Well, huh, you seem to have a new admirer.
Don't talk nonsense.
Who is he?
Bat Morgan.
You read about him in the paper.
The sailor who killed the Shanghai Duck.
Oh!
Look at that.
That's real velvet.
Think of it, that's real velvet.
Nevermind that. Look at that.
That's something real.
- Why, that's Ms. Barrat.
- Yeah!
We ain't even good enough to look at her.
I've been talking to her.
Oh, you don't wanna fool with a lady like that.
- Why not?
- Well..
...don't forget, Bat, that when you came-came here you know, you-you were just a plain sailor.
And now, you work in a dive on Pacific Street.
- And she's a real lady.
- Oh, I see.
I'm not a big enough guy for her, is that it?
No, that ain't the reason.
See you-when you, uh--
Listen, now, wait a minute.
I'll be a big enough guy.
I'm gonna make myself the biggest and most important guy in this town.
Don't forget that. The biggest and most important.
And she'll still be a lady.
What'll it be, gentlemen?
Name it, Solly.
Well, I-I think
I'll have a little..
...uh, maybe, uh, I guess..
What do you think I oughta have?
I know just what you want.
Leave it to me.
Thank you.
- This is gonna be expensive.
- Why not?
- How much do I owe you?
- Two dollars.
Mm. What do you call this?
'Pisco Punch.'
- What's your name?
- McClanahan.
- How'd you like to work for me?
- Where?
I haven't got the place built yet.
This is still the best place.
I will stay here.
- Mm, Yeah. It's alright.
- 'Alright?'
Look at this bar. Best bar west of Chicago.
Brought around the horn in one piece.
- Solid mahogany.
- I'll have a better one.
When you do, come around to see me.
Mm-hmm.
Heya, you know big Jim Daley?
- Who doesn't?
- Is he around?
Sitting over there in the corner.
Be back.
Oh, he'll be back in a minute.
Oh!
Alright, I'll attend it for you.
I've got a proposition for you.
Not interested.
You will be when I tell you what it is.
- Hey, who are you?
- Bat Morgan.
Oh, I've heard something about you.
You pegged the Shanghai Duck.
I did if that means anything to you.
What are you drinking?
What are you drinking?
- Champagne.
- It's good enough for me.
Jimmy.
Another glass for Mr. Morgan.
Go ahead and talk.
Now, listen. You know as well as I do that when someone starts making a lot of money somebody else always howls.
You remember what happened when you sold the Jenny theatre to the city for a city hall?
There was plenty of howling.
But who did they have to howl to?
Nobody but you, so it got them no place.
Well, the yelling has started and Ford is going to keep it up until the people ask you to do something.
Then, your supervisor will decide to hold a meeting.
Decide how to clean up to stop the noise.
Go on.
You and your friends have been overlooking your coast.
There's more gold there than there was in the gold fields of the city treasury.
So here's my proposition.
You put me in charge of the coast, and I'll see that you and your supervisor get an interest in half the places operating.
Then, when you hold your meeting and you'll have to hold your meeting you can tell Ford to go stick his head in the sand.
Who sent you here?
Nobody. It's my own idea.
Worked it out myself.
I see.
Here's something else that may interest you.
You know Morra's place takes in $30,000 a night.
I can make that look like an empty poke.
I'm planning a place that'll make Morra's look like a chicken coop.
And you're gonna build it for me.
- Am I?
- Mm-hmm.
I've got the location all picked out.
Corner of Pacific and Trenery.
There's a warehouse there.
It won't be there tomorrow.
With this kind of arrangement, you've nothing to worry about.
There won't be any clean-ups no matter how loud they yell.
- Who do we pay off to?
- Me.
And I pay off to the others.
From now on, we all are silent partners and we pay them a part of the profits.
We're not taking any partners we don't need.
- You may need them later on.
- What makes you so sure?
Because the town is tired of having a dirty neck.
And it may suddenly decide to wash it.
Unless we buy up all the soap.
Or do you know what soap is?
How about it, Jim?
It's his deal.
Alright, count me in.
Yeah, me too.
You mean I gotta take orders from him?
- That's it?
- Well, not me.
I got my place, and I run it the way I want.
I ain't had trouble, and I ain't gonna have any.
I ain't been bothered by the law in over a year.
It will.
I'll take care of the law.
And as far as you're concerned, don't try to make any trouble with the fire companies around my place.
Let me know if you change your mind, Spider.
Any other objections?
No, no.
Yeah, I have.
You nor nobody else is gonna cut in on my business.
What kind of business can you have to cut in on?
- Anymore?
- No. It sounds alright to me.
Well, gents and ladies, that settled it.
I'm putting Morgan in charge of the coast.
I'll tell you all about the arrangements next week.
Bat, why don't you come in as a partner with me?
You'll go a long way.
- I'm going further than that.
- Than what?
I'm gonna build a place that'll make this look like a dirty deuce in a stacked deck.
What are you gonna build it with?
With their money and Daley's.
But it's not gonna be anything like this.
I'm gonna cater to the swell, and they're going to pay.
You realize there are a lotta young blades in this town that we've been passing up?
With money in their pockets?
They won't be seen in the coast.
When they'll look at my place, they'll come in in droves.
What are you gonna call it?
The Bella Pacific.
Very good.
Let's have a drink, Bat.
- What do you have, Jim?
- 'Champagne.'
- It's good enough for me.
- Set 'em up, Harry.
This is the best suit in the house.
The latest from New York, sir.
- How much does it cost?
- Only $100.
We'll take it.
- But, Bat, this cost a $100.
- Well, what of it?
The best is none too good for us.
Put on the pants.
This way, sir.
Well, Mr. Morgan, here's the keys to the front door.
Well, I have no further use for that.
Fine bar you've got here.
Fine bar? This is the best bar west of New York.
Solid marble. There's
Mr. Morgan's Double Pisco.
Bat, looks like you were right about those society blades.
I tried to beat that case card once myself.
Or don't you remember?
Oh, hello, Burke.
You seem to be doing alright.
Yeah, I'm fine.
How's your business coming along?
You know how it's coming along.
My place was raided twice in the last week.
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.
You know, uh, Graber came here with us the other day.
Seems to be doing alright now.
Why don't you get yourself some sense and do the same?
I'd hold out if it just meant holding out against you.
But I can't buck the law and all the rest of 'em.
You can count me in.
And after this, remember to leave my place alone.
Oh, that's fine. I know we'd all enjoy having you for a partner.
Oh, Bat, Daley's in your office.
Wants to see you.
Oh, alright.
Well, uh, thanks again, Burke.
Yeah.
Hello, Jim.
What's worrying you?
Ford.
Oh, yes. I read it.
Making a racket again.
Yes. Bat, we better shut him up.
Well, he's in your end of town.
I've tried to handle him politically but he won't handle.
We've gotta get rid of him, Bat.
Well, don't call me in.
I like the guy.
It wouldn't work.
If you do anything you'll have the whole town on your neck.
No, that can be fixed.
Suppose he is challenged to a duel, and the duel's framed?
Oh, no. I don't want any part of that.
It's not what you want.
It's what I tell you to do.
Hmm, I see.
What you tell me to do.
You'd better think it over, Morgan.
You're not big enough to handle it, I'll get somebody who will.
Well, now you listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you something to do.
You let Ford alone.
Oh, you're going to make me, huh?
That's right.
I beg your pardon.
But could you tell me where Mr. Morgan is?
Why, certainly.
- Right this way, miss.
- Thank you.
The Old North Star.
We've come a long way since those days, Solly.
Where'd you dig it up?
I sent back east for it.
- A lady to see you, Bat.
- Well, send her in.
Uh, hello.
- I-I had to see you.
- Most certainly. Why not?
Oh, Ms. Barrat, uh, this is my friend, Solly Green.
- How do you do, Mr. Green?
- Nice to meet you.
A chair for the lady.
Solly's the best friend
I have in the world.
He did me good once, and we've been friends ever since.
All I did was give him a meal.
We just liked each other.
Don't need any help now. He'll be the biggest man in this town.
Alright, Solly.
Well...you know something?
You're the first person in this town that ever beat me to the draw.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
When I met you at the International
I decided to know you better.
'Of course, I thought
I'd have to go to you.'
I came here to ask your help.
I'm glad you thought of me.
Mr. Morgan, they've challenged
Mr. Ford to a duel.
- Who did?
- A man named Spider Burke.
- Oh!
- It's got to be stopped.
You're asking me to save Ford for you?
'I'm asking you to stop a murder.'
Well, it's good enough for me.
I promise you, nothing'll happen to Ford.
- Solly.
- You'll have to hurry.
- Where's the duel to be?
- Land's End.
- When?
- At sun up.
Solly, will you see Ms. Barrat to the carriage at the side entrance?
Mr. Morgan, I want you to know that I appreciate this.
Thank you very much.
Don't you think
I better go with you?
Oh, no. This is a job
I wanna do alone. Go on.
- Good luck.
- Don't worry.
We've got time for a couple of hours sleep before we start to Land's End.
Now let's get this thing straight first.
We'll give him his choice of weapons, knives or pistols.
No, we better make it pistols with this guy.
And we'll make it ten paces.
When we start the pace-off,
I'll turn on eight and shoot.
And you shoot too.
It'll make a good job of it.
I've ordered the carriage to be here in plenty of time to pick you up.
I'll be ready to go whenever it gets here.
Come on, Weasel.
You wait here.
Where's Burke?
In his room up at the head of the stairs.
I just dropped in to tell you
'you're not fighting Ford.'
Daley's orders.
You're taking orders from me.
McGhee, go down to The Tribune and tell Ford the duel is off.
- Burke is afraid to fight.
- Alright, Bat.
'Oh, please.'
Will you come here a minute?
Would you ask Mr. Morgan to come to the side entrance?
- Certainly, miss.
- Thank you.
Drive to the side entrance, please.
Bat, there's a lady at the side entrance who wants to see you.
Thanks.
- Mr. McClanahan, where's Bat?
- He hasn't been down tonight.
I gotta find him.
Burke's on a warpath and he's threatened to kill him on sight.
Don't worry. Mr. Morgan can take care of himself.
- Why don't you try his room?
- Thank you.
- Where's the boss?
- Boss go outside.
You're always surprising me.
I had to come thank you for saving Mr. Ford.
Why not take me for a ride and tell me about it?
Bat. Bat.
Oh.
- Oh.
- Bat.
Come here, Solly. Solly.
Solly.
Bat..
It's Burke.
It is.
He would have been proud of that.
I haven't had a chance to thank you for coming to Solly's funeral.
He'd have been proud of that, too.
You were very fond of him.
Yes. I was.
He was my friend.
- I-I've got to be going.
- Well, may I walk with you?
Y-yes, of course.
Seems a pity that people who have so much to live for have to die before their time.
My father and your best friend were both murdered all on account of that street along the waterfront.
No. The coast isn't entirely to blame.
Just the way things worked out for them.
They spent their whole lives trying to help others.
The only thing you get for helping others is a kick in the face.
You always appreciate what Solly did for you.
And he'd be alive today if he hadn't met me.
You've forgotten that you helped me.
No. I...I haven't been kicked...yet.
But you've been sheltered.
You don't know much about it.
- You don't think so?
- I know so.
I've been kicked around all my life.
I'd be on a boat in China today if I hadn't taken care of myself.
Everybody's looking out for number one.
And the only way to get ahead is by beating others to the punch.
- Dog eat dog.
- Yeah.
All that wouldn't have been built if the men who first came here had felt like that.
Someday, San Francisco will be a great city.
You oughta be helping build it.
I am.
No, you're not.
You're tearing it down.
Only to make room for bigger buildings.
I'm starting two next week.
You're hopeless.
I've got to go home.
- Maybe you can try again.
- To reform you?
Yeah.
It's no use.
I'm glad you decided against that so early.
Now, we can get on to other things.
- What?
- You and me.
We're gonna be more than friends, aren't we?
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
Can't you see?
No. The only thing I can see is you're the one person in town who means anything to me.
I want you to know that.
I want you to believe it.
When're you coming up here again?
- Tomorrow.
- About the same time?
Mm-hmm.
I'll see you then.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I think it's splendid,
Judge Stephen Crawford.
Perhaps opera'll keep the young blades up here
- instead of the Barbary Coast.
- You should be very proud.
You're giving San Francisco it's first grand opera.
You're making part of its history.
- If the season is a success.
- It will be!
I'm coming opening night just to see your triumph.
Now, you keep your eyes on the opera, young lady.
- It was your idea.
- Tupper.
- Has Mr. Ford come in?
- No, and we can't wait.
Will you give him that to print it tomorrow?
- Yes. I'll set it up now.
- Thank you.
Emma asked if we would drop in for tea before I take you home.
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.
I have another engagement.
- With Morgan?
- Why, yes. How'd you know?
Everybody in town knows.
You've been seen with him several times.
- And what do they say?
- Too much.
I've been wanting to talk with you about him.
Well, perhaps you should talk about him now.
Jean, I wouldn't intrude in any part of your life except that your father asked me to guard your welfare.
You cannot continue this association, Jean.
Morgan is from the Barbary Coast.
He's mixed up in every bit of its rottenness and evil.
He's part of it.
The leader of it.
The thing your father tried to help San Francisco destroy.
And you accept and recognize him.
Jean, you can't go back on what your father fought and died for.
- Have you met Mr. Morgan?
- Once.
Then, perhaps you shouldn't judge him, Stephen.
I know what he's done.
I can't defend that but it's probably the life and environment he's had.
I think there's a very worthwhile and human side to his character.
I can't understand you, Jean.
I can't understand myself sometimes.
But I reserve the right to choose my own friends.
Father always respected my ability to choose them and I think he would still approve if he were alive.
Oh, please don't worry about me.
Thank you, Ronny.
I'll send your tickets for the opera over tomorrow.
Please apologize to Emma for me.
Tell her I'm terribly sorry that..
Hello.
I-I didn't know you had arrived.
This is Mr. Morgan.
Judge Crawford.
How're you?
If you'll excuse me, Jean.
Certainly.
I'm sorry.
I don't think he likes me.
I gathered that earlier this afternoon.
- He was talking about you.
- Mm.
I can imagine some of the things he said.
He...he asked me not to see you again.
But you are going to keep on seeing me, aren't you?
Mm-hmm. I am.
Well, that's all that matters.
That's all that's meant anything since the afternoon.
I wasn't quite sure for a time because I..
...I thought that Ford was gonna be the lucky guy.
And I kept thinking of ways to get you away from him.
You know, I was in love with you then.
I am now.
There's never been any doubt in my mind.
About yourself?
I've been sure for a long time.
Hmm-hm.
Well, I guess that's the beginning and end of it.
No. No.
You're gonna marry me.
I can't lie to you, Bat.
I love you, but we can never mean anything to each other.
There's a world of difference between us.
Ideals, loyalties, everything.
We could never be happy together.
You won't change and-and live my life.
And you certainly won't live mine.
No.
Well, nevertheless..
...you're gonna marry me someday.
One moment.
I didn't care to make a scene there.
Go on.
Your presence among decent people is an insult.
I resent it. You belong in the Barbary Coast. Stay there.
From today, you keep away from
Miss Barrat or answer to me.
If you try to see her again
I will take the pleasure of shooting you down like a dog.
Good day.
A very good day.
- Yeah.
- Well, put a lock on the place.
- We're closing for the night.
- Why?
We're going to the opera.
My old friend, Judge Crawford, gave us a personal invitation.
He thinks the opera is very elevating.
What's the idea?
No idea.
Just the way I feel.
If the swells can come down here, we can go up there.
Give those to McClanahan and give these to Morra and distribute the rest. See that everybody gets it.
Okay.
McClanahan, isn't it?
Yes. They all look like they're from the Coast.
Who are those people?
Why, they're from the Barbary Coast.
They have a nerve coming here.
There's Bat over there.
Pardon. You dropped your fan.
- Checks.
- Huh?
- Check, sir?
- Checks?
I'll find my own seats.
Sit down, Belle.
This porch is occupied.
Nevertheless, we're gonna sit here.
- Come on, my dear.
- You'll apologize for that.
- For what?
- For insulting my wife.
I was not aware you had a wife.
Well...well, you'll apologize to Belle.
It'd be more fitting if you apologized to me for being here.
I am not accustomed to associating with the scum of the Barbary Coast.
And I'm not gonna have my wife sitting in the same box with..
- Take out the gun.
- I'll get that..
You're the doctor!
'It's too late. He's dead.'
Well, Morgan, this finishes the Coast.
You and your tribe are through.
Oh. Are we?
The public's not gonna forget this because I'm not gonna let them forget.
Alright, Ford.
Have it your own way.
- Crazy fool.
- Bat, please.
Of all the insane things to do gets himself into a theater filled with a thousand people and who does he pick out to shoot? A judge.
You've got to get him out.
You owe it to him.
I'll get him out. Just to knock his teeth down his throat.
Daley wants you to come over to the hotel.
- Why?
- I don't know.
He didn't wanna come here
I guess.
Bat, promise me you'll get him out.
I said I'll get him out, didn't I?
Well, I will.
Come on, McClanahan.
Regent's too good for him!
I ask, they put him in jail..
...in jail with his friends to watch over him.
But what Morra needs is hanging.
And if his friends object we'll hang them, too.
We've had enough of these gamblers and criminals.
We've had enough of murderers in our streets and our theaters.
It's up to us. It's time that we did something.
And I say, let's go to the jail and hang Morra.
Wait. Listen to me.
You all know me. You all know what I stand for.
I feel the same way you do about Judge Crawford's murder.
No one would be more satisfied to see Morra swinging from the gallows.
But don't do this thing.
Don't take the law into your own hands.
Don't cover yourselves with blood.
Morra is in Jail.
Yes, with Daley to take care of him.
Daley's sworn to uphold the law, and he'll do it.
I'll see to that.
Men, listen to me.
I'm with you in seeing that justice is done but this isn't the way.
No mob ever accomplished anything worthwhile.
We have courts and juries and judges.
Let them take their course, and justice will be done.
I promise you that.
I just came from the courthouse.
They've let Morra out.
- Let him out?
- Yes.
I promised them our courts and juries would give justice.
- Who was there?
- Bat Morgan, Belle and Daley.
Daley?
You've overplayed your hand this time, Daley.
How is that?
When a politician gets powerful enough to free a murderer
- it's time something was done.
- I wouldn't try anything, Ford.
I'm gonna blast you outta here if it's the last thing I do.
You're a cheap, corrupting politician who stands for everything dirty in this town.
I'm gonna dig up everything you've done and print it.
I'll put Morra back in jail and you along with him.
They took Ford home. He's in a very serious condition.
They don't expect him to live.
- What happened to Daley?
- He's in jail.
And that's the safest place for him until this blows over.
Keep him there.
Don't let the paper stop.
Keep after them.
Doctor.
Tupper.
Find the article my father wrote summoning the vigilantes
- Yes, miss.
- Print it.
Who do you want to see?
I just heard about Ford.
I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am.
Doesn't matter whether you're sorry or not.
Of course it matters.
I know what this means.
This is gonna change everything for us.
Nothing is changed.
We're right where we always were, on opposite sides.
And you're where you belong, on the coast.
You're a bit excited.
I don't think you're seeing things quite clearly.
I see things quite clearly.
And for the first time
I see and know exactly what you are not what I wanted you to be.
I told you once that I loved you. I'm ashamed of that.
Ashamed?
Don't you understand? All I was trying to do was get somewhere.. to climb up where we could meet on equal footing.
Climb up? Everyday you sunk lower and lower until you stand for everything that I hate.
You and you're kind have taken my father the judge, and now Ford.
I despise you.
I hope that I never see you again. Now, get out.
Murder has been committed in our streets.
And the murderers remain unpunished.
Vice and corruption flourish.
Our courts, juries, and judges have become a laughing stock.
The law has become a farce.
We're organized here to protect ourselves and save our city from further disgrace and ruin.
We've taken this course only because it's better to have vigilance with law..
...than a mob with anarchy.
I thought that at 51, we'd clean this city thoroughly.
I thought we'd never have to organize again.
It seems that I was mistaken.
But this time, let's do a better job.
When we disband this time let's make sure that we'll never have to organize again.
That's all gentlemen. Your captains will give your orders.
You're wanted at vigilante headquarters.
We've come for the prisoner, Daley.
They've come for you, Jim.
- The vigilantes?
- Yes.
Well, you're not gonna give me up.
Jim. There's a thousand armed men out there.
And you haven't got a friend in the crowd.
What about your police?
What about deputy sheriffs?
- They've gone over too.
- What about Bat Morgan?
His crowd will see me through this.
- I don't know.
- Open up, Mulligan.
- Don't let them take me.
- I can't stop them, Jim.
Come on, Daley.
Did you hear, they got Daley?
Mulligan couldn't stop them.
Yes, and Morra too.
Yanked him out of his flat.
- Where's that Morgan?
- I don't know. Have to look.
- We gotta find him.
- Come on, speak up.
- Did he run out on us?
- He don't know more than me.
Ain't seen Bat since this afternoon.
- You did meet him?
- You know better.
- What're you gonna do?
- What we did once before.
Let him have a fire.
We'll begin with the newspaper that started all this. Come on.
'Paul Morra, stand up.'
It is the judgment of the committee that you, Paul Morra are guilty of the murder of judge Stephen Crawford.
- 'Have you anything to say?'
- Gentlemen. You win. I pass.
James Daley, stand up.
It's the judgment of the committee that you, James Daley are guilty of the murder of Charles Ford.
Paul Morra, James Daley.
The committee sentences you to be hanged by the neck.
May God have mercy on your souls.
No, Coleman. No.
I did it, yes, but he.. it was in self-defense. You can't hang me. You can't.
That's the judgment of the committee.
Proceed.
- Double Pisco Punch.
- Yes, sir.
Where have you been?
- Walking.
- Do you know what's happened?
The vigilantes have taken both Morra and Daley.
Graber and the mob are gonna burn the town.
They're starting with the newspaper building.
- Is she there?
- I don't know.
Stop, stop, stop. Get back to the coast where you belong.
I'm sticking. Stop this trouble making for all time.
If you don't get back, they're gonna wipe us out.
Any little break you start here won't stop them.
Vigilantes are gonna be there in an hour.
If we don't get back to coast, they're gonna burn us down.
That's right.
Back to the coast.
We won't let them drive us out.
We'll fight.
- Come on, boys.
- Go on.
So far, we've done a good job.
Yeah!
Now, we're ready for the coast.
You take one detachment going through Curney Street.
We'll enter from this side.
Wipe that place clean.
Burn it to the ground.
And bring in Bat Morgan.
Yeah!
Forward men!
Yeah!
Here they come.
Every man grab a gun.
Barricade the doors.
And when they come down the street, fire at them.
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Come on.'
Hold it. Hold it, all of you.
All of you, listen to me.
Got all the guns from armory and loads of black powder.
- It's no use, Graber.
- They're coming. Let's go.
Wait a minute, halt, all of you. Listen to me.
We're not gonna fight 'em.
No use in fighting 'em.
- It'll just mean more killing.
- What's the matter with you?
- Afraid of a fight?
- You know better.
- Then, what's the idea?
- Because you're wrong.
There's no use in fighting them.
It'll mean more killing.
We've had enough of that.
Get out and save your skin before it's late.
Besides numbers, they've got right on their sides.
- 'You can't win.'
- You double-crossing rat.
It's Bat Morgan!
- The man's wounded.
- Take him to headquarters.
Yeah!
- You can't come in.
- I've got to talk to you, miss.
- It's alright, Ella.
- They've taken Morgan.
- Well?
- You've got to help him, miss.
- Sorry, it's impossible.
- If you talk to the committee.
To give him a chance.
You don't, they'll hang him.
They've got him.
They're going to try him.
You tell them what he did.
Saved your paper and kept the mob from burning the town.
He was shot trying to keep coast from fighting vigilantes.
- He was shot?
- Yes.
It is the judgment of the committee.
That you people be placed aboard the first ship leaving the city.
And we advise you not to come back.
Bat Morgan, stand up.
Are you ready for sentence?
Yeah. that you, as the ring leader, controlling power of the coast are responsible for the actions of the coast and the killings that followed.
'It's the judgment of the committee'
'that you be hanged by the neck until death.'
- 'God have mercy on your soul.'
- You can't hang him.
He's got to take judgment like the rest.
- He's guiltier than the rest.
- He's guilty of more things.
He's guilty of stopping his men.
They wanted to burn the city.
All but gave his life trying to save you who want to hang him.
When Mr. Ford was challenged to a duel, he stopped it because Ford didn't have a fair chance. That you all know.
Coast is hard. He ruled it according to its code.
When the crisis came, he acted according to his own code.
Like a gentleman.
You hanged Morra and Daley because they killed.
Bat Morgan has killed no one.
You're trying to stop murder.
That's why you rose and wiped out the coast.
But you'll be guilty of murder yourself if you take his life.
Please. Please, show him your mercy.
Gentlemen, after hearing
Miss Barrat
I have to ask for another ballot.
Remember, I once said to you that whenever you try to do the right thing, you..
...you always get kicked in the face?
Well.
I finally saw things your way and walked right into a hanging party.
- I-I'm sorry, Bat.
- Oh. I'm not.
I'd like you to know that.
There's something else I'd like.
Please don't be ashamed that..
...that you once said you love me.
I'm not Bat, I'm glad I said it.
Jean.
For your sake, we'll give him his freedom but he'll have to leave as soon as he's able.
Now, just a minute, Coleman.
I'm not anxious to be hanged.
I must speak in my defense though it hasn't been asked.
Won't do you any good. The coast is through. No place for you.
That's what they told me when I came here but I made one.
I made a place.
The only thing I'm guilty of is trying to make good.
Make good in my way. Which was wrong, I found that out.
But now...I'd like to go right.
With miss Berret's help.
You'd never get the smell of the coast off you.
You'd have no background.
- Background?
- No family, no connections.
He'd have me.
Well, Miss Barrat.
Since you feel that way we agree to parole him in your care.
Thank you.
- Got a job on your hands.
- Not much of a job.
I have faith in you.
You won't regret it.
Doctor, the captain told me we were in the South Seas now.
Right in the heart of them.
That's right, madame.
The South Sea islands.
The last hiding place of beauty and adventure.
That's what all the travel folders say.
I thought you'd been here before, and that you adored the islands.
Yes, I do in my own way.
What's that wretched-looking spot we're passing?
It's one of the South Sea isles.
Nothing like that is mentioned in the folders.
Well, it's a little in disrepute.
It was mentioned in all the folders once.
That silly-looking sand waste?
Has it a name?
It's the island of Manukura.
That was once the most beautiful of all the islands... that raised their little green heads above these waters.
The most beautiful and enchanting bit of paradise in all the world.
I always throw it a kiss when I pass it.
Excuse me, madame.
What happened to it?
It made the mistake of being born in the heart of the hurricane belt.
You've stolen a canoe.
Stealing is against the law.
You must pay the penalty for breaking the law.
You are sentenced to 30 days punishment.
When you have finished 30 days, you will know better than to break the law again.
I don't understand.
He says...
He's defending himself against the power of the French government and very ably.
Does he deny the theft?
No. He offers in rebuttal that there was moonlight.
An awful lot of it.
And his lady love says... she saw a gold fish in the sea.
My dear doctor...
I am as sensitive to the whims of love as the next man.
But as governor of these islands,
I cannot afford... to sit 'round admiring the quaint and the curious.
Thirty days, my good fellow.
It's not exactly my business, de Laage... but you've only been here a year.
Whereas I, indolent wretch... have spent a pitifully long time on these islands.
- I know these people.
- You're wasting your time pleading.
I'm not pleading.
I'm pleading for you... not this scoundrel of a canoe thief.
You're a sensitive man.
You'll do something to yourself if you govern these somewhat childish people... according to your ideas instead of theirs.
You'll destroy yourself.
That sounds very ominous. What is that?
Father Paul has sighted the Katopua.
- He's chattering in his belfry.
- Come along, Doctor.
You can complain about my tyrannical soul to Madame de Laage.
Your wife will like it if you let this miserable canoe-snatcher go.
As a homecoming gift!
Chief Mehevi, he's sentenced to
30 days hard labor on the coral reef.
My dear Doctor...
I am ready to give my wife and my friends anything I own in the world... except my sense of honor and duty.
A sense of honor in the South Seas is about as useful and often as silly... as a silk hat in a hurricane.
Marama!
- I think the ship never comes home.
- Me, too.
I think the wind never blows.
I feel like praying... for the wind that overturns the world to hurry the Katopua home.
I worry about everything when you're away.
About the wind, the waves.
Sometimes I worry the fish eat you up.
Me? You worry about me?
- Why I'm the best sailor in the world!
- I know.
- I'm the best swimmer, too.
- I know.
And tonight when we come out of church,
I'm the best husband in the world.
- I know, I know.
- Shut up. You don't know anything yet.
Eugene.
- Oh, Germaine.
- Darling, it seemed forever!
All my happiness went with you to France... but it's returned now.
O Heavenly Father... we thank Thee for the safe return of our loved ones.
Amen.
Your health, madame.
We certainly missed your civilizing influence.
Here's to your homecoming.
Your health, Doctor, and Father Paul's and yours, Chief Mehevi.
All our people are happy that you come back.
Thank you. Tell me, Father Paul... how's my husband been conducting himself in my absence?
Like a good governor.
- Has he fallen under the tropic's spell?
- No, madame!
He's been staunchly under the spell of honor and duty.
I don't suppose there's any use of my inquiring... whether my uncle answered my application to return to France?
No. He said nothing.
Farewell, old Cafe de Rostand for another year.
I'm sorry.
Yes. And in Paris, our good doctor would weep day and night... for his little half-drowned homeland... the island of Manukura.
Why, he's as deeply rooted in this place as I am, or Chief Mehevi.
My roots are parched, Captain.
We'll drink this one to Mehevi.
I brought him back the finest bridegroom in the islands.
Yes, I know. I see him jump from mast.
Who's that?
Terangi.
I'm delighted to hear the news. I didn't know he was marrying your daughter.
You've been too busy with your report cards to France.
The romance is known to every child in the islands.
I'm delighted.
Terangi is utterly charming.
He was delightful on the trip.
He'd hang from the top of the mast like a bird with wings stretched for home.
I hope you'll be able to leave him behind for one voyage, Captain.
He's planning on spending his honeymoon in a canoe.
It won't be a long honeymoon.
I'd as soon sail without sails as without my first mate.
The more I see these natives, the more
I think they're more bird than man.
Terangi can smell a wind before it's begun to blow.
He knows every rock on the sea bottom... and he runs a ship as if it were a pair of shoes.
I was saying that very thing to de Laage.
I wasted ten good minutes pointing out he's the governor of a flock of birds.
Not birds that should be put in a cage... but birds that should be allowed to flutter through the sky which they own.
With stolen canoes in their bills, you forgot to mention.
When are the nuptials to take place, Father?
The wedding will begin at sundown... and will continue until the entire native population is exhausted.
Wait a minute. I wanna give a toast.
My dear people...
I am very happy and I'm a little sad... because when I return to France... any day now...
I shall miss your happy faces.
But I leave with you my very, very dearest love.
And to Terangi... and Marama...
Terangi, I had a dream.
I had no dream. I slept.
Terangi, don't sail away on the ship.
Without me, the ship doesn't move.
It stands still in the middle of a wind.
Don't sail away.
I don't want to, but I smell a wind coming.
By noon, the wind will be good.
I dreamed that all the birds flew away from Manukura.
From Manukura?
Where did they fly to?
There's no place to go.
They flew away.
Did you dream there was a wind?
No. It was quiet.
Only the sky was full of birds flying away.
The dream's no good.
Because how could the birds fly away if there is no wind?
They only leave when the ifu mantui comes.
The wind that overturns the world.
The world is gone when you go away.
Stay here.
You're married a few days and already you're an old wife full of worries.
What are you worried about?
- About your going away.
- I come back!
- If something happens to the boat...
- I swim back. Where's my cap?
It's very funny what a difference a cap makes in the world.
In Tahiti, when I wear this cap, everybody is my friend.
You think I'm just Terangi who swam with you when you were a little fish.
In Tahiti, when I sit in a cafe with this cap on I'm the same as a white man.
Take me with you.
No, please. I like to, but I can't.
Please! I won't take any room.
I'll sleep on top of the mast.
You can hang me over the boat's side at night and pull me along with a rope.
Only take me. Please, take me.
Quiet, quiet.
What in blazes are you doin' aboard this boat, Marama?
Please, I go to Tahiti.
- How did she get aboard? You bring her?
- No, I come in a bag like a coconut.
What's wrong with going to Tahiti?
I never been. I go just once.
Listen, the longer you stay aboard, the further you'll have to swim back.
You have no reason to go to Tahiti.
Oh, yes. I buy a dress with a ribbon on.
And red shoes with high heels.
And a hat with a feather, and a petticoat with flounces.
And a doll that dances.
All right. You stay on board.
But we'll take Terangi's cap away and he's through being a first mate.
I can't have a first mate with a bride.
He'll be an ordinary sailor.
Scrubbing decks. Gimme that cap.
Oh, no, no. Don't take his cap.
No, Terangi, he won't.
Good-bye.
Hurry back.
Aloha!
I can't give you anything but love
Marama!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up, I said!
Clear out!
Get up when a white man tells ya!
Terangi, get back on the ship.
My warrant says the man's jaw was broken.
I don't care if his jaw was broken!
Pity it wasn't his neck.
I saw the whole thing, and my mate is not to blame.
If you're his witness, Captain, there won't be any trouble.
But he's got to be surrendered.
All right. Come on.
But I'm going along.
I'll see the governor about this.
I've spent hours, Governor, trying to find out why my first mate... is sentenced to six months in jail for doing exactly as you or I would do.
Your boy hits too hard.
Not hard enough. I saw the whole thing.
I even testified in court.
The sentence is unjust.
But surely six months in jail isn't unheard of... in a serious case of assault and battery.
Come, Nagle, it isn't a matter of life and death.
You don't know the Tuamotu natives.
They're not like your Tahitians.
They can't stand confinement.
There's something behind this. A matter of maintaining European prestige?
A native mustn't raise his hand against a white man?
Your boy not only hit too hard... but he hit the wrong man.
That rum-soaked bully.
Strange as it seems, he has influence at home.
As soon as he recovered consciousness in the hospital... he cabled the Ministry of Colonies.
So Terangi is made a victim of politics.
I'm afraid you're right, Nagle.
I sail for Manukura in three days.
You can't pardon him?
Later, perhaps. Not now.
I've done all I can.
You'll have to take your punishment quietly and cheerfully.
You hit too hard, man. That's all.
The next time you hit a man, take care not to break his jaw.
You're too much of a man to store up any bitterness.
Your berth will be waiting on my ship.
Time will pass quickly.
I'll explain everything to your wife.
Will you give her this?
Sure, I will.
Don't you worry about her.
Remember what I've told you.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll put him on the road gang.
Keep him outdoors all day.
He's going to take his medicine all right.
I hope so.
Wasting water, eh, convict?
The Katopua.
And wouldn't you like to be going home on her!
Come on, pick 'em up. Get movin'.
Captain Nagle!
Chappeli, coffee.
Captain Nagle!
I wouldn't have had this happen for anything, son.
It just hangs another year on your sentence. That's the penalty.
That's what I've got to go by: The law.
Lucky you didn't break from the inside.
That would've added five years.
Now you behave yourself.
We don't want to keep you here any longer than we've got to.
The long and short of it was,
I couldn't do a thing for Terangi.
How silly, how unjust.
- It's up to you.
- To me?
I fail to see in what way.
As governor of his island, you can ask to have him paroled in your care.
And much as I should like to do just that...
I don't think it wise to interfere with the administration of the law.
Oh, administration of fiddlesticks!
The man's absolutely right.
It isn't a matter of law.
It's political pull and injustice.
Just a minute. Let me explain the case a little less legally.
De Laage, our friend Terangi isn't just an errand-running islander.
He's the best loved of every man, woman and three-year-old child in Manukura.
You're not only allowing him to rot in jail, but offending your subjects.
And what's worse, you're hurting yourself.
Your concern for my soul has flattered me for some time.
I must ask you to concern yourself with my more physical ailments.
He means well, dear.
He's only saying what we all think.
I know he means well.
I know you all mean well.
But I am not the representative of well-meaning points of view.
I represent a civilization... that cannot afford to show confusion or conflict to the people it governs.
The law has spoken in Tahiti.
I must uphold that law.
Would it influence your sense of duty at all... to know that Mrs. Terangi is about to be a mother?
Really?
That's wonderful!
That puts everything in a different light. Explain to the authorities.
No. It puts me in a worse light.
Now I'm not only Terangi's persecutor,
I'm the oppressor of an unborn child.
I think it's unfair to appeal to a side of me that's very strong... but that simply cannot function as governor.
I understand you, de Laage.
Thank you.
And my heart feels sad for you.
Though six months isn't forever.
Terangi's young.
Let's make the best of it.
So easy to say, Father.
But I have to tell her.
Yes. He sent her a little gift.
Oh, I'll take it to her.
There's no need for you to put yourself out, darling.
Yes, there is.
In six months, it'll all be over.
He'll be back, and you'll both forget so soon.
Go away.
I want you to come with me and live in my house while you're waiting.
There's a lovely garden and you can sit...
I don't go to your house.
It'll be easier.
I don't want it any easier.
Terangi in a jail.
You're right.
It won't be long... because no jail can hold Terangi very long.
If it has a window, he'll fly away.
If it has water around it, he'll swim away.
And everybody will laugh at the jail that tried to hold Terangi.
They'll laugh.
It's another two years, Terangi.
Every time you try to break out, it's two more years.
Understand? Two more years.
That's two more years, Terangi.
He cannot possibly escape.
- You have jurisdiction over this case!
- I don't deny it.
You're the only man who can save him from this mad thing that's happening.
- He's broken the law.
- What law?
The law that condemned him unjustly to prison?
That refused him the simple rights of a human being?
I can't.
Eugene, don't be angry at what I'm going to say.
I love you. I know your heart.
Please stop. My feelings are my own.
I won't have them discussed.
Sixteen years in a cell with rats for companions! And for what?
For thinking himself greater than the law.
For breaking jail.
For defying authority.
Man alive! You can't do it!
You know what these people are, and Terangi's the best of them.
He'll not live in a cell! He'll die!
You're condemning an innocent man to death... out of a cold-blooded whim called honor and duty.
Will you listen to Mehevi? Perhaps the chief can think of something.
Tell him what you think would be just.
Excellency... the people in my island were all happy before.
Now they're very unhappy.
This is not good law or good justice.
You once asked me not to worry about your soul... but to concern myself with more pharmaceutical matters.
Well, I'm back on that worry.
You're not only condemning poor Terangi, you're condemning yourself.
You're condemning yourself to black nights and dreams of ugly remorse... to the betterment of a man who prefers to be a martinet instead of a human.
You'll see your guilt as a man written in every face in Manukura.
You'll walk as if you were dead among them, without a smile or a greeting... if you lived in these islands for 100 years.
It'll dry you up!
It’ll kill your heart.
I am doing my duty.
I come of a family that has administered my country's affairs for generations.
I understand how strongly your humanitarian feelings run.
And yours, Germaine, and yours, Mehevi.
Understand mine then. They run as deep.
There is no Terangi.
There is only a man who has set himself above and beyond the law.
It is not a question of justice or injustice to a human being.
It is a question of upholding the law under which these islands are governed.
I am not asking for anyone's smiles as my reward.
Take a good look, convict.
You haven't got fat Sam to deal with.
He wouldn't take my advice and now he's out.
And now I'm in.
And by all that's holy, you're in.
And you're gonna serve every day of your 16 years.
And if you ever want that iron off your leg... you're gonna break, see?
You're gonna open that ugly mouth of yours and act like a human being!
Get that door open! Hurry up!
Come on, you blundering fool!
Warden.
Did you ask the doctor over tonight for chess?
Yes. I'm sorry, he was busy.
And Father Paul?
He had a christening.
What's that noise?
I don't know.
There's no festival this time of year.
What are you going to do?
Gonna have a walk, take a look around.
I'll go with you.
Get your wrap.
I will.
Perhaps it's something nice, a native dance we haven't been told about.
Get your wrap.
Mehevi!
I heard this noise.
I came here to find out what it was.
The people are celebrating, Excellency.
- What are they celebrating?
- Their happiness, Excellency.
- What has given them happiness?
- Terangi.
- What about him?
- He has escaped, Excellency.
When did you hear this?
Who brought the news?
I have had no official report.
600 miles from Tahiti.
The drums have brought the news.
The birds have brought it.
Do you hear that wind?
It came on the wind.
What have you got to say to all this?
Is there any law against dancing and singing when the heart's happy?
As your governor, I demand what information you have.
Is he on this island? Have you seen him?
You don't have to see him.
He's a legend.
You can celebrate him like Bastille Day.
He's the soul and symbol of all these good people.
No cage can hold 'em.
They're the last of the world's afflicted race of humans... who believe in freedom.
Look at 'em dance!
There's the island's answer to your law.
How long have you known of his escape?
- The last voyage.
- Why wasn't I informed?
It was an official matter.
I saw no reason to interfere with the excellent official communication system.
Murder!
Did you know there was a man murdered by him?
He broke the bars that held him in a cage he didn't belong.
But murder!
I imagine this puts an end to the legend of Terangi.
There'll be no more escapes.
He'll be caught and sent where he belongs.
Sent to the fortress of Cayenne and stowed away in a dungeon... until he's dead and forgotten.
Dead and forgotten like any law breaker.
Murder and anarchy will leave no legend behind.
Father!
- What do you see, lad?
- There.
What is it? A log?
No. There's a man hanging on it.
Feel better?
Yes, Father.
And you came from Tahiti in that canoe?
Yes.
At least 600 miles.
Why did you come?
I want to go home.
They say you killed a man.
I don't know.
I hit him hard.
- Did you mean to kill?
- No! Only to go home.
You're only a few miles away now.
Before you tell, Father, let me go home for one day.
I have a daughter.
I've never seen her.
And Marama.
Tell me, Father, has she waited for me?
Yes, she's waited.
It's good to be alive... after being drowned.
How can I be your judge?
You've sinned, but others have sinned more against you.
You weren't meant for evil.
You were made to do evil.
How can I judge?
You won't tell, Father?
No.
We found you in the sea, we shall leave you on land... near to those who love you.
No, you owe me no thanks, my son.
This is between me... and somebody else.
Father, can I tell Marama that Terangi's waiting for her on Motu Tonga?
No need to. She's there.
Went there yesterday, fishing.
To Motu Tonga? He doesn't know it.
Why didn't you tell him?
What? And spoil their surprise tomorrow morning?
You young rascal, I'm ashamed of you.
Mama, I saw a man.
A strange man.
A strange man?
Why, Tita, there are no strange men.
Marama, I've come back.
I've been waiting.
Eight years. Long time.
You are the same.
You?
The same.
Who is that?
She is Tita.
Mine?
Yes.
This is what I dreamed of all the time.
I dreamed I'd see you again, and my child.
They'll find you and take you away.
They can't take this hour away, or this day.
They can only take away tomorrow.
I heard.
I have waited as long as I dared.
You must go now.
- They know?
- The island knows, but not de Laage.
Not yet. He will find out.
He will hunt you down.
De Laage?
Why will he hunt me?
What have I done against him?
His heart is black against you.
You must go tonight.
- Where, Father?
- Fenua Ino.
Fenua Ino. The forbidden place.
It is taboo. No one goes there.
No one will look there.
You will be safe there until you die.
Stay hidden till the darkness.
We will load my big canoe.
You will start when the island is asleep.
Gee, quite a wind coming up.
This is the worst I've seen or heard for a long time.
Like devils running around.
Can you imagine Paris in a wind like this?
All the silk hats blowing off, all the bouquets blowing away.
All the ashcans bouncing down the avenue.
I'm afraid civilization wouldn't look very pretty in a high wind.
I've missed you from our dinner table, Doctor.
Eugene's been pining for a game of chess for a long time.
So have I. You know...
Eugene and I have been having a feud.
- Cognac, Doctor?
- No, thanks.
Sort of a battle of souls.
Let's check our souls for tonight, de Laage.
Let's be Frenchmen, both of us.
You're not angry at the doctor, are you?
No, I'm not angry at anyone.
It's they who are angry with me, all of them.
Black looks and mutterings.
Father Paul! Why isn't he here tonight?
Praying for my soul, I suppose.
They love their precious murderer.
Let's forget Terangi, just for tonight.
Forget him? He haunts this island like a school of ghosts.
I can no longer sense what's going on.
I took a walk through the village today.
- There's something strange in the air.
- Strange?
Well, the wind gives the island a different smell.
No, not the wind.
The natives behaved queerly.
Some of them smiled at me.
Kept watching me and smiling.
I had a feeling something queer was going on behind my back.
Something strange. Hidden.
Important.
The only thing important that's happening in the village today... is that Mama Rua is dying.
Terangi's mother.
Afraid she's gonna die.
And Marama's sister's having a baby.
I play a kind of chess game... with the oldest gambler in the world: Death.
He takes Mama Rua... and I checkmate him with a baby.
I think I'll have another drop of cognac... just to keep the wind out of my bones on the way home.
I've never been on the island in a storm. Do they get bad?
I've heard tales of them.
Winds that blow the islands out of the sea.
But I think Manukura is pretty well anchored.
At least part of it.
The devil's abroad tonight!
We're all on edge tonight.
What are you doing, boy?
Answer me.
What are you up to?
What are you doing with the chief's canoe?
Stealing?
Stubborn, eh? Very well.
Come along to Father Paul's house with me.
Be careful with the sail.
- Excuse me coming at this hour, Father.
- You are welcome.
- I want your help.
- It's yours, de Laage.
- You know this boy?
- Yes. Mako. He's a good boy.
- He won't lie to you, Father Paul.
- Oh, no.
Ask him where he was going with that canoe.
Whose canoe?
A boat loaded with food.
Food being smuggled to Terangi.
He's on this island. He's being hidden.
He's waiting for the boy in that canoe.
Father, I didn't tell! I didn't tell!
Hear that? He confesses.
Captain Nagle smuggled him in.
I'd been waiting for that.
And you refused to come to my home tonight. Why?
Because you know. You were afraid to face me. You're guilty.
They're all guilty. The whole island.
I'll break Nagle for this.
Neither this boy nor Captain Nagle had anything to do with it.
Terangi was picked up at sea ten miles from here.
By whom?
You! When?
Last night.
You helped Terangi.
You, my own priest!
- I'm his priest, too.
- You helped a murderer.
I aided a man whose heart is innocent.
You betrayed your own government.
You've given aid to anarchy and bloodshed.
- I'll answer for it.
- You'll answer me, Priest.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He knows! You're in the presence of your own priest, boy!
You dare not lie. Where is Terangi?
Would you ask this child to betray someone he loves?
I'm asking him to tell the law what he knows.
The government demands information against the murderer.
There are stronger things than governments in this world.
Something deeper.
More real.
This child has that in his heart.
Though you tortured him, he wouldn't speak.
He shall pay for his silence.
And I shall bless him for it.
- I've never seen the barometer so low.
- Did you send my note to Captain Nagle?
Yes, he's waiting inside.
I'll come to the point at once.
I am commandeering your schooner.
- This wind is too strong to be out in.
- How soon can you be ready to sail?
- The weather's bad.
- How soon can you be ready to sail?
- Nagle's thinking of your safety.
- He's trying to frighten you.
I'm not trying to frighten anybody.
We can't find Terangi in this storm.
- It'll get worse.
- It'll blow itself out in 24 hours.
If I delay, it may be too late.
He'll get away.
We're in the track of a rising wind.
The barometer's falling!
- You must listen.
- I'll listen to one voice, my own.
De Laage, I told you you'll end by destroying yourself.
I'm ordering your schooner in the name of the government.
Take him along.
Go out in this wind, de Laage.
Maybe you'll find something more important than Terangi.
When you feel the might of the sea and wind, maybe you'll discover... there's something greater in this world than the French criminal code.
Terangi's out there.
He's paddling through this storm in a canoe.
Go chase him. Then hear God howl and laugh at you.
- Get your ship ready.
- I'll be ready when you are.
Oh, Eugene.
Look! What is it?
The birds. They're flying away, like your dream.
- Terangi, where are you going?
- Back to Manukura.
Look!
The great storm is coming, the wind that overturns the land.
Go to Tavi's store.
Get ropes. Anchor your houses.
Take to the trees if the sea should cover the land.
- Go quickly!
- Go!
- What's that?
- Either the wind or end of the world.
And me with a baby to deliver.
- Take her to the church.
- No. Surf boat! Surf boat better.
Surf boats? Are you crazy?
Sea will cover land. Surf boat better!
All right, take her to the surf boats.
Surf boats! And I commit suicide.
- You'll need me to help you.
- Everyone go to the church.
No! Sea rising. Carry church away.
No, the church is on high ground.
Come with me.
No, come to the boat!
Come on.
The reef!
It's breaking.
Come on!
Come on!
Father, will the sea rise and cover the island?
We're on the highest spot here, my daughter.
Even if the sea reaches us, the walls will keep it out.
The church! It's going!
Father Paul, come. The sea is breaking in. The walls are going. Look!
Take those who want to go.
I am staying here.
You will drown.
You saved me. Take my arm and let me save you.
- No, my son. Take madame.
- No, I'll stay here with you.
Take her back safe to the world that has wronged you.
Please, madame, go. Terangi, take her.
Yes, Father.
Those of you who wish to go, go now.
Those who wish to sing with me for the last time, stay.
Where is the child?
There.
Is it boy or girl?
You don't know! You haven't got it!
It's dead!
No, my daughter. It's here, alive.
It's a boy!
How many survivors, Doctor?
Is that all?
Germaine, my wife?
I wish it could've been me instead of her.
I gave you up as well.
How did you pull through?
We were at the edge of the hurricane.
You were at the center.
What is it, Terangi?
A canoe.
A war canoe.
Then Father Paul took your wife to the church. It seemed the safest place.
I'd have gone too, except I couldn't desert my patient.
That's the last you saw of her?
It grew so dark, you couldn't see the church from the reef boat.
But when that bell stopped ringing,
I knew what happened.
As soon as you can get your engine running, we'll make a search... for survivors.
I must make a report, list all dead.
I shall want all details.
Come with me to the ship.
The ship will find us. I know that.
The ship will come, and then they'll take Terangi.
Oh, no, Marama, no.
But I know they will.
Terangi knows it.
But I'll make them take Tita and me, too.
Be quiet, Marama.
It doesn't matter now.
We're lucky to be alive.
Katopua.
- Good-bye, Marama.
- Good-bye, madame.
Good-bye, little Tita.
God bless you, Terangi.
Captain!
Easy left!
Germaine.
My dear. My dear.
I thought I lost you, but I never gave up hope.
Germaine, forgive me.
Forgive you? For what?
For everything I failed to be since we were married.
I faced it all today.
I've nearly gone mad.
Take me back to the boat now.
I'm so dreadfully tired.
I know, dear.
- Where are the others?
- There are no others. Not a soul.
I was tied to a tree and drifted here alone. All the others were lost.
Let's go back to the boat.
Eugene, take me back to the boat!
There's something out there.
It's only a floating log.
You're right, Germaine.
It's only a floating log.

All right, tie her up.
Make her fast.
Pull her in, boys.
Leave those.
They don't even know where they're taking themselves yet. Get it moving!
Ask him.
Pardon me, my good man, but we're looking for the residency.
We better be careful. They probably belong to some fighting tribes in the interior.
Here, here, here. Go on, you blighters.
Off it. Go on. Off it, off it. The very idea.
That's the only language those poor heathens understand, sir.
Herbert Henry Rawlins, at your service.
Thank you so much.
We're looking for the residency.
Residency or resident?
Resident. Righto.
It so happens his nibs is at my employer's compound...
...checking out a shipment of wild animals.
Well, sir, how was merry old
England when you left it?
- Well...
- Yeah, a bit of all right, eh?
You, miss, how do you find your first go at Africa?
Grim enough, I suppose. But look at me, making you answer a lot of questions.
I'll bet you're just tired of talking. Well, anything you want to know, just ask me.
- Well, there was one...
- Oh, here we are.
Excuse me, governor. Two young people from home wanna see the resident.
I'm the resident.
Masters is my name.
How do you do? I'm Eric Parker.
- This is my sister, Rita.
- How do you do?
Miss Parker, you're not exactly a usual sight around these parts.
Nor any parts, for that matter, I should say. My name is Fry. Captain Fry.
No, you fool!
Can't have my pet ripped up by a common cat.
- Your pet?
- Yes, over there in that cage.
Like to see him?
He doesn't look like he needed protection.
Oh, no. He'd make short work of a common leopard.
Color of their hide seems to get into their dispositions.
- He's too valuable to be mauled, though.
- I'm terrified of him.
Even with these bars between us.
Don't you worry, Miss Parker.
I designed that cage myself.
Duralumin.
I'll guarantee it'll hold anything.
We won't keep you any longer from your business.
Well, it's nothing private, Captain Fry.
Rita and I are just looking for something called the Mutia Escarpment.
Is that all?
My dear boy, perhaps you'd like us to arrange a visit to the craters of the moon.
I don't know what you're laughing at, but
I assure you, it's a serious matter to us.
In Africa, the most serious matter is always the noonday sun.
Yes, it makes ladies and gentlemen talk a bit barmy-like.
Especially until they get a bit climaxed to it.
Since we seem to be so ridiculously green, perhaps you would point out what it is.
Well, first, the single approach to the Mutia Escarpment...
...is said to lie through the Gaboni country.
A cheery lot, the Gabonis.
- I've never seen one. Have you, Fry?
- No.
Although I've seen victims floating down the river...
...after the Gabonis finished with them.
- Bring some drinks, Rawlins.
- Yes.
Only the largest and most completely equipped safari...
...could hope to fight through.
And as you say, that's beyond the means of most people.
In the second place, from the native rumors of the escarpment...
...I should judge it quite impractical for even a large party.
They say it's like a long cloud in the distance.
Sheer cliffs 1000 to 1500 feet in height and running out of sight in either direction.
Bomba, limes.
But isn't there always a third place,
Captain Fry?
Oh, yes, I was coming to that.
In the third place, no safari native could be induced to disregard the juju.
- What's juju?
- Black magic, taboo, anything forbidden.
Oh, dear. Really.
When you've lived as long in Africa as Captain Fry, Miss Parker...
...you'll realize that there's a certain amount...
...of truth underlying all native superstitions.
What is the nature of this particular superstition?
- Well...
- A race of great apes. With a leader.
A very capable leader, too, with power of life and death over the entire jungle.
The oddest thing, according to these stories, is his color.
- His color?
- White.
Blimey. A white gorilla?
Do you believe this?
Well, I believe that up there, where no white man's ever been before...
...waits someone, or shall we say, something...
...mysterious and formidable natives fear.
A thing that doesn't want to be disturbed.
There you have it, Miss Parker.
Cliffs, savages and the taboo.
A combination nobody could beat.
But one man did beat it, Mr. Masters.
A white hunter named Harry Holt.
Oh, yes, I remember the fellow.
Claimed to have discovered the Elephants' Graveyard, didn't he?
Yes, Holt's real motive then was very much what ours is now.
Mr. Masters, we have reason to believe...
...that our cousin Jane is alive at this moment...
...above the Mutia Escarpment, living among the great apes.
There you are, governor. The monks have been known to carry off a native woman.
Yes, but the leader isn't an ape.
Now, Holt was quite clear on that point.
The leader is a man, a white man. And
Jane is staying there by her own wish.
Admitting this extraordinary story to be true...
...would you be good enough to explain...
...what you hope to accomplish even if you should find your cousin?
Well, you see, our father and Jane's father had a third brother, Uncle Peter.
He was extremely wealthy and rather difficult.
When he took it into his eccentric old head to die last spring...
...he left half of his fortune of nearly a million pounds...
...to the London University for the purposes of entomological research.
- Come again, miss?
- Bugs.
The second half he left to Jane, providing she was alive...
...and could be induced to return to civilization.
Otherwise, the bugs get the whole million.
And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin...
...you hope to profit to some extent.
Well, I've staked every penny
I've got on it.
And if we fail, it means, amongst other things...
...that Eric won't finish his medical studies.
Well, if you're in a position to adequately equip a safari...
...under the direction of a well-qualified man, Captain Fry, for instance...
But then, you heard Captain Fry's opinion of the whole enterprise.
If you and your brother care to join me...
...I'll be making safari for the Mutia
Escarpment at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Bomba!
- Captain Fry...
- Don't waste your time thanking me.
You'll need to get properly outfitted before you leave tomorrow.
Captain Fry, before we accept your very kind offer...
...would you mind telling us why you made it?
We'll say I need a vacation with just a touch of adventure thrown in. Just that.
We'll be ready at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Well, hang me.
The biggest blooming hunter in the whole blinking continent...
...turning himself into a glorified tourist guide.
And all for the sake of a dash of adventure.
Oh, come off it, governor.
What's the idea?
Gonna try and catch you that mythological white ape?
- You're right.
- Thank you.
You're right for the first time in 10 years.
We're making safari at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Knock down the steel cage and box it to go.
- Don't stand there like a...
- Fool?
- Right. Get going.
- Yes, sir.
Look at those.
I say, aren't they awful-Iooking creatures?
- We land here, Bomba.
- Yes, bwana.
Well, that's what I meant.
- Bomba, those four top boxes. Look alive.
- Yes, bwana.
But, Captain Fry, this place is a bog.
I'm sorry. I didn't choose it myself.
Get ashore, please.
Come along, Rita.
- Not that way, Miss Parker.
- Well, why not?
Ever chuck a stick into a hornets' nest?
That's our route.
The swamp will cover our tracks and it's the right direction, as far as I can judge.
Well, you'll get through all right,
Miss Parker.
Pretty squashy going.
Oh, well, I like paddling.
Eric, look.
Wouldn't shoot if I were you. They won't bother us if we don't bother them.
There's no sense in advertising our presence.
If it's all the same to you, Mr. Parker,
I'd like to keep it a secret.
- Look at them all. Isn't it amazing?
- This is certainly a hunter's paradise.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Oh, look at that lot!
They're handy little things to have about the house.
And all of those.
Oh, aren't they grand?
Captain Fry.
There's your Mutia Escarpment,
Mr. Parker.
All right, push them along, Bomba.
Stir them up with that kaibok.
Captain Fry!
Juju, bwana.
Oh, why not take a tip from their natural instincts, sir, and let the whole thing go.
- I mean, this is Gaboni country.
- Right.
Till I think of a way to push these boys, it looks like we'll stay here.
We camp here, Bomba. No tents.
Send one of the boys for water.
Why, you little...
What is it?
You pretty creature.
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry I was such a nuisance.
Well, I'd rather not have to do any more shooting while we're around here.
- Water yet?
- Water not yet, bwana.
Send another boy.
Gabonis. Get the men ready to move.
Still clear on the juju side.
We'll cross the river and make a run for it.
Get them together, Bomba.
Hey, we won't leave that. Quickly!
- What was it? An animal?
- Whatever it was, we should be grateful.
Grateful to the Gabonis too, I suppose, what's left of us.
We've got no choice now.
Get the men started, Bomba.
We're going up.
Men say no go, bwana. Men say juju.
All right, let them stay.
See how they like the Gabonis.
That was a close thing.
Blinking close.
Blimey. I wouldn't climb another step, not even to get up to heaven.
Maybe you're nearer than you think.
We camp here, Bomba. Tents.
We're not gonna make permanent camp here, are we?
The escarpment's a bit too big to comb end to end...
...for your cousin and her white ape friend.
So we shall have to devise some means to get them to come and visit us.
How on earth are we going to do that?
That's a matter to which I've given considerable thought.
I'll figure it out.
Supposing he does come and try and set his friends free...
...isn't he liable to be a bit unpleasant?
That's a question I shall better be able to answer by tomorrow morning.
- What do you say, Rawlins?
- I never spoke, sir.
I think we better turn in and give our little plan a chance.
- Yes. Good night, Captain Fry.
- Good night.
I'll just have a last look around with Rawlins.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Night, Rita.
- Good night.
- Is it ready?
- Ready as butter, sir.
If it's not sprung tonight, take it down by sunrise.
Yes, sir.
Governor? It was a very good idea, bringing in this cage.
All he has to do is to step in here to free this ape...
...the trap will spring and we have him.
- Rawlins, you're a genius.
Yes, sir.
- Captain Fry, do you hear what I heard?
- What did you hear?
Sounded like the cry we heard below the escarpment.
Don't you think what you both need most is a good night's sleep?
I shall have a gun tonight.
I don't want shooting.
I want to take him alive.
All right, my lad. Go on, laugh. You'll be laughing the other side of your face soon.
You're just bait.
That's what you are, bait.
Rawlins, catch it.
Well, that seems to work all right.
Of course, sir, you'll post sentries around here in every direction.
What, and scare him off? No. Bomba will watch at the north. You do the same here.
- By the trap?
- Yes. And if he comes...
...I don't want you to move or make a sound unless anything happens.
- Anything happens?
- In which case, send for me quietly.
You took the words right out of my mouth, sir.
- You can hide in the brush down here.
- All right, sir.
I suppose I'll be quite comfortable.
Captain, there are times when I sort of get a creepy feeling...
...that he knows all about us.
- Maybe he does, Rawlins.
- Yeah...
- Good night, Rawlins.
- Goodbye, sir.
Cheetah.
Cheetah.
- Captain Fry!
- Rita, what is it?
- He was here. I saw him.
- Which way?
There, I think.
- What's happened?
- He's been here. Bomba! Bomba!
Where's that fool?
These lashings have been cut.
Rawlins! Where's that idiot?
- What the deuce are you doing there?
- Oh, Captain Fry...
...I've had a horrible, horrible experience.
That huge monster attacked me and after a fierce struggle...
...he hurled me to the ground and stamped on me.
Next time I opened my eyes, he'd turned himself into a horrible, hairy ape.
Did he spring the trap?
No, sir. That was a precaution of my own, sir.
Bomba, get the boys and round up animals!
Tarzan.
Jane.
Tarzan, let go. I'm not awake yet.
What will the neighbors think?
- Hurt?
- I'm glad you woke me.
- I was having a nightmare. I was afraid.
- Afraid?
I dreamt I was back in London in a horrible, rushing taxi.
The radio was going and I was on my way...
...to play bridge with my three maiden aunts.
Thank you for being such a horrible, kidnapping monster and keeping me here.
Jane.
Oh, just a moment.
Before you start any more of your usual blarney...
...where were you last night?
- Swim.
- Nope.
No, we won't swim.
And don't try to change the subject.
You didn't get in this morning until all hours. And you were carrying your shoes.
- Swim, swim, swim.
- No.
Cheetah.
- Where did this come from, Tarzan?
- Swim.
Tarzan, please. I've got to know.
- People.
- Yes, I know. But white people? Where?
- Swim now.
- Tarzan, I've got to see them.
- No.
- Please.
No.
Please, Tarzan.
Stay.
Stay.
Oh, what a hideous monster it was, this.
It's a wonder to me that all the hair on our heads didn't go white during the night.
As far as his looks,
I thought he was rather sweet.
Sweet, Miss Rita?
Did you get a good look at him?
He was looking at me.
Mind you now, miss. If he'd have fought fair, I'd have had him.
Oh, yes, I'd have had him. But there
I was, with just my two hands to his four.
He had a big, heavy club in each of them.
And there he come, howling at me and waving them just like...
In dealing with animals, Eric, there's one thing to always remember.
We're their superiors for two reasons.
One's self-control and the other a gun.
Well, what's the matter with you?
- Where's Miss Parker?
- Oh, Captain Fry...
Come on, speak up, man.
- That man was here again.
- Miss Parker!
Oh, it's no good, sir. It's no good.
He's appropriated her, sir.
- Which way?
- Up.
Rita!
Bomba!
- Oh, we'll never find her.
- Brace up. That sort of thing won't help.
Help? He's probably carried her clear out of the country by this time.
Rita, where are you?
I'm up here.
Rita.
- Don't worry, I'm all right.
- Isn't that Eric?
Yes, of course it's Eric.
I've found her!
- Hello, Jane.
- Hello.
- Who's the other one?
- He's the man who brought us here.
- Oh, isn't this wonderful?
- Darling, I'm so glad to see you.
Will you stop talking and come down here?
Yes, we'll be right down. That is, we will be right down, won't we?
Tarzan, take Rita down.
- Jane sorry?
- I've never been so happy...
...in my whole life.
Tarzan!
- Eric.
- Jane, darling, it's really you.
Yes, and very much alive and quite well and awfully happy.
Rich too, I hear.
- Tarzan, this is my cousin Eric.
- My cousin Eric.
How do you do?
- Jane, this is Captain Fry.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
Feels so funny.
I haven't done this for ages.
Tarzan, this is Captain Fry.
Tarzan, Tarzan.
Captain Fry is a friend too.
He helped Rita and Eric to find us.
Friend too.
Oh, he...
He likes me!
- Hey!
- Please.
Well, that's the end of that gun.
I'm sorry, Captain Fry, but Tarzan has seen guns kill.
Well, I understand his point of view.
Still, there's the matter of how I'll protect my party.
That won't be necessary, now that Tarzan's looking after you.
Well, what about lunch?
We can't run around the jungle hunting our lunch with our hands.
No. You're to be our guest.
Rita, there's no use you camping out and being uncomfortable...
...while you've got a whole house.
- House? You mean that...
Oh, this little bird's nest?
No, I mean our townhouse.
We've got lots of room.
You'll be comfortable.
Tarzan made it.
I designed the kitchen myself.
- The kitchen?
- Hot and cold water.
All the latest conveniences.
Captain Fry, tell your men to break camp.
I'll show you the way.
- Tarzan, do the marketing.
- Market.
- Yes, food for all these people.
- Food.
- And hurry back.
- Hurry back.
Now, don't keep that up all night.
Me? I'm sleeping aloft.
I'm company, I am.
And don't go having none of them there nightmares.
Now, don't you let that roast burn.
Jane, we didn't come here just to make you unhappy.
We think you owe it to yourself to come back. Until you're quite sure.
I know. I think you came because you wanted me more than my money.
- Oh, but, Jane...
- Oh, I'm not ungrateful.
No, Rita can have all the silk stockings she wants.
Eric can have his career, an enormous yellow roadster to drive his girl about in.
- There is a girl?
- Oh, naturally.
I'd like to meet her.
- Eric, couldn't I just sign a paper or...?
- No, Jane.
I think Uncle wanted to leave all his money to his frightful museum.
You were a matter of conscience.
Otherwise, the will could never impose so many obstacles.
Of course, if Tarzan would let me go...
I must ask you to say nothing to Tarzan...
...until I've had a chance to tell him my own way.
I want him to know why I'm going and how soon I'm going to be back.
Jane, why not bring Tarzan with you?
- Back to London?
- Yes, of course!
If you like it, you could spend half your time here and half your time there.
No, Rita.
Out here, Tarzan's a king.
How do I know what he'd be back there?
Perhaps, at first, sort of a freak. And then, as he learnt more about civilization...
...he'd realize he was dependent on his rich wife.
He'd never tolerate that.
Or if he did, it might be even worse.
Oh, Miss Parker, this looks like your lord and master coming now.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- No, I meant, "How are you?"
- All right.
You were away so long.
Aren't they beautiful this year?
- Oh, and these are ripe too.
- Eat?
- As soon as we get some water, darling.
- Miss Parker!
Miss Parker!
- What is it, Rawlins?
- I don't think this animal likes me.
- Perhaps you're not using the right word.
- Oh, blimey.
No, that might be it.
Here, you.
Going up.
All aboard.
Oh, go on now, will you?
I'd do the same for you one day.
Alley-up!
Now, whatever you do, don't let go,
Ongali. Or whatever your name is.
Offhand, roast beef, I should say.
Make yourself useful in the kitchen,
Rawlins.
Yes, sir.
- Could I be of any service?
- Yes.
- Tarzan, show him how to get water.
- Water.
Now, this is very, very clever.
- Did all this come out of your own head?
- Head?
I mean the idea, not the water.
Water.
Oh, Cheetah, you might turn on that fan for a while, will you?
Dinner, everyone. Dinner.
- Oh, I'm ready.
- What ho!
Supposing you try and wait on us without getting your thumbs in the soup.
Here's my contribution.
Don't blame me if it's carrots.
It's not carrots. It's very good, even if I don't know the name.
Eric, stop it.
Now, Rita, you sit here, Captain Fry,
Eric, over there.
- Tarzan will carve.
- Is there anything Tarzan can't do?
Matter of fact, he's clever at almost everything.
Aren't you, Tarzan?
I say, look at the size of that roast.
No soup.
- Eat now.
- Oh, I second the motion.
You have some tribes on the escarpment?
Yes, indeed.
Awful savages they are too.
They must give you trouble, don't they?
No, the most powerful tribe of all...
...lives about a day's safari west of here.
But Tarzan is such a juju to them they leave us alone.
They don't even harm the animals.
But they'd be pleased if we were to clear off...
...and leave this whole hunting ground to them.
You don't have contact with the natives?
I mean, they don't speak any known language.
We leave them alone too.
But natives everywhere manage to understand each other somehow.
Yes, that's true.
Miss Parker...
Thank you, Cheetah.
No, now, greedy.
Here, take this outside.
Go on.
Her table manners aren't all they should be.
Oh, I'm very much obliged.
Yes, thank you.
Listen to me.
I want you to understand...
...that any attempt at familiarity is very much resented. Thank you.
- Miss Parker, I've been thinking...
- Hey, old Fry's been thinking.
It's no concern of mine, but I overheard you when you discussed it.
I've found a solution about what to do with Tarzan when you go to England.
- Please, Captain Fry...
- Go?
No, you haven't heard me out.
My idea is not to leave him.
Take him with you.
No need for him to be dependent. I'll offer him a contract that'll make him fortune.
- You mean, put Tarzan on exhibition?
- Nothing like that.
He could lecture on wildlife and handle wild animals as never before.
What do you say? Come to England.
You'll be a sensation.
Captain Fry, my cousin particularly wished that this shouldn't be mentioned.
Oh, I am sorry. I had no idea it was supposed to be a secret.
- Secret? Jane go?
- Hold on, Tarzan. This wasn't Jane's idea.
There's a paper at home that Eric and I must have signed.
Otherwise, we'll lose a lot of money if Jane doesn't help us.
- Money?
- Yes, Tarzan, money.
You know, to get clothes and food and...
Food, clothes...
...money?
- No, Tarzan, you don't understand.
- Money isn't that, it's...
- Of course he doesn't understand!
I hope he never does.
- Secret.
- No, Tarzan. No.
Jane go?
Jane people go?
Only if you're willing...
...not if it's going to cause you the least bit of unhappiness.
Tarzan!
Cheetah.
Tarzan, Tarzan.
Jane no happy?
How shall I tell you, darling?
I love Tarzan.
Tarzan is Jane's love.
Like the stars over the night, like the air to breathe.
Tarzan makes me alive, but Eric and Rita are my friends.
Friends, like rain at the end of the summer...
...like the wind moving the tops of the jungle.
I am yours. You are mine.
But I must help Rita. She is my friend.
Friend, as Tarzan was Cheetah's friend...
...to help her when she was in the trap.
- Trap?
Yes, trap.
No, darling, not a real trap...
...but just as strong, just as horrible.
Jane want go?
Don't you remember how you went when
Timba was in the pit the tribes had dug?
Jane want go?
Tarzan, believe me...
...when the moon has made safari three times...
...three times, and when she comes out of the river, big and round...
...and looks in on us here, she'll find us as we are now.
Together.
And my safari will be over forever.
And I will never go away again.
Tarzan...
...and Jane.
Understand?
Understand.
Bravo, Rawlins!
Now let's see you strangle a lion.
- I'm going with you.
- Jane, darling!
But first, I want today with Tarzan alone.
- We need that for saying goodbye.
- Yes, of course...
...but couldn't we go back to our old camp and leave this to you?
No, Tarzan and I have a little Garden of Eden up the river.
He's already gone there ahead to wait for me.
- I'll be ready first thing in the morning.
- Tomorrow morning?
- You wanted to get away, didn't you?
- That's right.
Of course.
Don't mind their laughing at you.
I was much worse than you are when I started.
Practice never made anybody perfect like he is, miss.
I believe you think more of Tarzan than all the others do.
Miss Jane, he's the finest gentleman
I ever knew...
...trousers or no trousers.
- Thank you.
Tarzan would be proud of that.
- I'd better get the natives started packing.
- No hurry.
- Hadn't I better get the cage down?
- No, I'm leaving that here.
There'll be no stopping for gorillas on the way.
We have no other use for it now, have we?
No, sir. But it's a very valuable piece of merchandise.
What you sent all the way to Birmingham for.
Go and see the boys have no thorns in their feet for tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
- And send Bomba to me.
- Yes. Bomba!
Captain Fry wants you.
Bomba, listen.
Out west where sun go down, great tribe.
For safari, one day.
Bomba move fast, half day.
- Take boy and find chief.
- How find chief?
You'll find him, all right.
What's the matter, you afraid?
- Bomba no afraid.
- Good.
Tell chief bwana send.
Bwana want chief for friend.
Bwana want warriors to get through Gaboni country.
Want spears, canoe, food.
Bwana great, good friend of chief.
- What bwana give chief?
- Tell chief bwana take away juju.
Take away great white ape.
Tell chief bwana send one white man, two white women for juju.
Well, get along there.
Yes, bwana.
You're sending Bomba on ahead,
Captain Fry?
Yes. It's always a good idea to scout out the country one intends to go through.
- Oh, that was lovely.
- Cold.
- Oh, it was not.
- Hot.
- It was just right.
- Just right?
Just right.
Tarzan, stop!
Tarzan, don't. I'm tired.
Tarzan, I'll fall on my face.
Cheetah!
Cheetah, stop it.
Cheetah.
Don't you behave yourself for one minute?
Go on. Go on home.
Go on home.
Yes, and it'll serve you right if she tells her mother everything that's happened.
Tarzan?
Tarzan?
Tarzan!
Very well, then. Doesn't make any difference to me where you are.
You see? I found you.
You can't get away from me.
I wouldn't squeal if this was the tallest tree in Africa...
...and there were 10,000 lions below.
I squealed.
- Jane.
- Darling...
...I love you so much.
Jane.
Yes, Tarzan. Forever...
...and ever.
Thank you, darling.
- You see chief?
- Yes, bwana. Chief say he do.
- Get spears, canoes, everything?
- Yes, bwana.
- Get the men together.
- Yes, bwana.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Jane, where's Tarzan?
He's not coming.
He didn't want to say goodbye.
Is there anything you'd like to get before we leave?
No. Nothing.
Jane, darling.
I know just how you must be feeling.
I'm all right.
Wouldn't you like to go and say goodbye...
...to your lovely little house just for a minute?
No.
I'd much rather not.
Miss Parker, join the main group with Rawlins.
I'll be on the right flank with a few men, and Bomba will be on the left.
We must take every precaution.
Cheetah.
Goodbye, Cheetah.
Look after Tarzan when I'm gone.
- You tired, Jane?
- At this pace?
Through the trees,
I could be back with Tarzan in an hour.
I'm sorry.
Isn't it odd we haven't heard from Captain Fry?
Yes, isn't it?
- Do you suppose we lost our way?
- Oh, no, miss.
No, if we had gone off a straight line, we'd have run into Bomba or Captain Fry.
On second thoughts,
I think I'll look around a bit.
Take good care of your sister and Miss Jane, sir.
- Why, Rawlins, you talk as though...
- Cheerio, sir.
Bomba?
You idiot, don't you understand you're heading the wrong way?
- Way.
- Why, you're barmy.
- Now, face about and join the rest.
- Bwana say go.
- You're lying.
- Bwana, he go.
Oh, he did, did he?
Now, suppose you just tell me what he went back for.
Bwana no say.
Well, I know anyhow.
Bomba, you can't do it.
Now, chuck Fry and, so help me...
...when we get home,
I'll give you a new 5 pound note.
I've got one.
So help me, I have, Bomba.
Bomba!
You can't go and help Fry put him in a cage.
Bwana, he say do.
Oh, he did, did he? Well, he won't!
You just wait until Tarzan comes leaping and roaring at you...
...and tear all your beast heads off.
Where were you going, Rawlins?
Captain Fry.
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Yes, we both seem to have strayed a bit.
- You were going back, Rawlins?
- Who, me, sir?
Oh, yes, sir. I was just going back to get something...
...what I forgot while I was packing, sir.
- What thing?
- What?
Well, you mean, what thing what I forgot, sir?
Well, come along, then.
- Oh, a locket, sir.
- Oh, a locket.
Yes, sir. A small, gold locket, sir.
Oh, it's very valuable, sir.
- A picture in it.
- With a picture?
Yes, sir. My mother, sir.
- Well, cheerio, sir.
- You've told me a dozen times...
...you were practically born in an orphan asylum.
Well, I was, sir. But you see, as orphans, sometimes, sir, we...
We like to have a picture that we can pretend that it's our mother, sir.
Oh, this one was a very jolly-Iooking old lady, sir.
Snow-white hair, sir.
I picked her up cheap, sir.
Fifteen bob at a secondhand shop in Whitechapel, sir.
I shouldn't go, Rawlins.
It might be dangerous.
Yes, sir. But all the same, sir,
I think I'd better go, sir.
It will be dangerous, Rawlins.
Yes, sir.
- Tarzan, I've got a message.
- Jane?
Yes. Bad news, I'm afraid.
I sort of hate to tell you this, but she's not coming back. Ever.
Tarzan, she couldn't tell you herself.
She asked me to tell you.
Oh, I'm sorry, Tarzan, but you see...
There's not much good talking, is there?
Goodbye.
Oh, Tarzan.
Do you know any remedy for a poisonous snakebite?
You know, snake.
One of my safari boys.
Where boy?
Thanks. I'll show you.
Bomba! Bomba! Here, you fools!
Use your spears!
That was very generous of you, Tarzan.
Oh, I'm...
I'm ashamed of myself.
- I'll tell the others.
- Others?
Well, after all...
Tarzan, try and not think too much about Jane.
- Jane.
- Well, you've a right to know the truth.
Jane knew about this.
I tell you, she knew about it!
Jane.
Jane want Tarzan in trap.
Bomba, we've got him!
Come out, you fools!
He's safe now.
Have Abdul tell the Hymandis chief we're on our way.
Tell him we've got great white ape.
Come on, get him up!
Captain Fry, isn't this rather an unusual way of making a safari?
- Unusual? In what way?
- With Rawlins back there all those hours...
...wouldn't an advance guard be more practical?
I have my own fussy way of doing things.
The boys seem to be nervous about being in a strange country.
Bomba! Push them along there.
Hymandis.
Bomba.
Keep your nerve, everybody.
Tell them want to see chief.
Stay where you are and don't let them see that you're nervous.
Bwana come.
Tell chief bwana glad to be friend.
Chief say glad bwana come.
Get him one of those bags of salt.
Tell chief give now spears, meat, canoes.
Tell chief bring white men, two white memsahibs for juju.
Tell the chief I've got the great white ape.
Chief say bwana no got white ape.
He got white ape.
Tell chief I make juju.
Chief say he make juju.
Tarzan!
Tarzan!
Timba.
Timba.
Cheetah.
Tarzan, I knew you'd come.
Don't move before Tarzan gives the signal.
- Did you hurt your arm, Rita?
- No, it's my leg.
- Tarzan, make a litter.
- Litter?
I'm all right, only a twisted knee.
Don't walk. It'll be just as quick to carry you on a litter.
Come on, Mr. Parker.
We'll hold them as long as we can.
- Hurting?
- A bit.
Captain Fry, come on.
Quick!
What did Tarzan mean by "ungatowa"?
We're escaping through the cave where the swamp makes smoke.
It's juju, forbidden.
They'll never follow.
This is the first time in Africa I haven't been able to see some sign of a bird.
Thank heaven we're out at last.
You can't let him do this.
Tarzan.
Well, haven't I the right to be heard?
Escarpment.
This is our way. The escarpment slopes gradually here.
There are no savage tribes, nothing to trouble you going home.
Going home.
How nice that sounds.
Tarzan.
Tarzan?
He's gone back.
Yes, of course he's gone. What are we waiting for? Let's get the men together.
- Bomba, safari.
- Bomba, wait.
We've hardly got time as it is to make camp before dark.
- We can't do this to you any longer.
- Rita, we've got to go.
We lied to you about going back.
You don't have to.
I appreciate what you're doing, but let's go.
My dear, it's true.
Can you still write, darling?
Because they'll accept your signature.
And that's all we're taking back with us.
Listen, there's something you've got to understand and try and forgive.
You see, we wanted to take you back to where we thought you belong.
"Civilization," I think they call it, but it's not for you.
And even if your coming back meant that I'd inherit the world...
...I couldn't forget the look in Tarzan's eyes when he thought he would lose you.
Stay here with your jungle flies...
...your funny little Cheetah and all the trouble she gets into and Tarzan.
You've got the grandest possessions that any woman can have.
Peace and comradeship...
...and perfect communion with a man who's devoted...
...to making your life beautiful.
Don't you ever lose it.

KING SOLOMON'S MINES--          
LIKE MANY OTHERS, WELL...       
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THEM.       
IN THOSE DAYS, AFRICA WAS A     
LAND OF MANY ROMANTIC LEGENDS.  
IT HAD A VAST,                  
UNEXPLORED INTERIOR.            
I WAS A HUNTER AND IT WASN'T    
UNTIL THE YEAR 1881             
THAT I LEARNT THAT THE MINES    
WERE A STARK REALITY.           
I SAY "WERE" BECAUSE THEY       
NOW LIE BURIED UNDER A MILLION  
TONS OF ASHES AND LAVA.         
AT THE TIME I'M SPEAKING OF,    
DIAMONDS HAD BEEN               
FOUND IN KIMBERLEY.             
MANY ADVENTUROUS SPIRITS        
FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD...  
    YOU'VE STRUCK               
 LUCKY AGAIN, RED.              
                     YES.       
 YOU CAN COUNT YOUR             
 MONEY TOMORROW.                
            I'LL HAVE 5 POUNDS  
             ON ACCOUNT TO      
             GET DRUNK WITH.    
         [Laughing]             
             GET YOUR BACKS TO  
             THE WALL, THE WHOLE
             BOILING LOT OF YOU.
             DON'T SHOOT, BOYS. 
             IT ISN'T A HOLD-UP.
                I'M JUST TENDING
                 MESELF AND THE 
            TREASURES OF ARABIE.
 CAST AN EYE OVER THAT,         
     ME BOY, AND SEE WHAT       
         YOU MAKE OF IT.        
             WHAT HAVE          
            YOU FOUND?          
         A HOUSE, CARRIAGE      
             AND PAIR FOR       
             ME DAUGHTER        
             AND THE LIFE OF    
             RILEY HEREAFTER    
                 AND EVERMORE.  
                    DID YOU EVER
                 SEE THE LIKE?  
A NICE PIECE OF                 
CRYSTAL, O'BRIEN,               
BUT NO DIAMOND.                 
    YOU DON'T                   
    MEAN IT?                    
I'M SORRY,                      
MISS KATE.                      
 THAT'S BAD LUCK,               
 PATRICK, BAD LUCK.             
             BAD LUCK NOTHING.  
             I WAS ONLY HAVING  
             A JOKE WITH YOU.   
                 COME ON, GIRL. 
[Donkey braying]                
         TRY AGAIN, PATSY.      
                 DEVIL I WILL.  
             I SPURN THE DIAMOND
         FIELDS UNDER ME SHOES. 
IF WE COULD ONLY GET            
TO THE COAST, I COULD           
GET A JOB TEACHING.             
         AND WOULD              
        YOU LIKE IT?            
         I WOULD NOT.           
                    [O'Brien]   
                    OF COURSE   
                 YOU WOULDN'T.  
             LISTEN, THERE WAS A
             MAN IN THE BAR LAST
         NIGHT FROM THE CONGO.  
         HE SAYS THERE'S        
         A FORTUNE IN IVORY.    
 THERE'S BEEN A FORTUNE         
IN EVERYTHING WE'VE TRIED,      
BUT IT WASN'T US                
 WHO FOUND IT.                  
FROM NOW ON, WE'LL BE DECENT,   
RESPECTABLE CITIZENS,           
AND WE'RE GOING TO THE COAST    
BEFORE I CHANGE ME MIND.        
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE WE?         
             LESS THAN A POUND  
             AND ALL OUR TRAPS  
            ARE IN THE PAWNSHOP.
 WHAT'S THAT                    
 YOU HAVE?                      
             FOR YOU, A GIFT I  
        BOUGHT TO CELEBRATE OUR 
         MAGNIFICENT DISCOVERY. 
         A SHAMROCK!            
                     FOR LUCK.  
                     IT DIDN'T  
                 COST A THING.  
         I KNOW WHAT            
            IT COST.            
 THERE WERE TWO                 
IN MULLIGAN'S STORE.            
 HERE'S THE                     
 OTHER FOR YOU.                 
             KATHY, ME GIRL,    
             THERE WAS NEVER    
            ANYTHING TO BEAT IT.
     WITH A BIT OF SHAMROCK     
    APIECE, THERE'S NOTHING ON  
     EARTH CAN HOLD US DOWN.    
     LOOK!                      
 GLORY BE TO GOD,               
STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN.           
ASK HIM FOR A LIFT              
TO THE COAST.                   
        IT'S A 5-WEEK JOURNEY.  
         IT'S A LOT TO ASK.     
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF           
AN IRISHMAN?                    
            IT'S A FINE MORNING.
                 [O'Brien]      
            IT'S A FINE MORNING.
         IS IT?                 
                     IT IS.     
                 ARE YOU GOING  
                 TO THE COAST?  
     NO, KITSFONTEIN.           
WELL, THAT'S ALL                
 ON THE WAY.                    
         WHOSE WAY?             
     OURS.                      
    WE WERE WONDERING           
IF YOU'D GIVE US A LIFT.        
            NO.

             HUNTER IN AFRICA.  
         THAT ENDS IT.          
IT DOES NOT.                    
MR. QUARTERMAIN,                
YOU NEEDN'T TAKE US             
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO,           
 BUT HERE'S SOMETHING           
 FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT IN      
 YOUR PRECIOUS SOLITUDE:        
 ME FATHER'S OWN SISTER         
 IS DYING IN KILKENNY           
 AND IF THEY NEVER MEET         
 THIS SIDE OF THE GATES,        
     'TIS YOU THAT WILL         
     HAVE PREVENTED THEM.

        AH, THE PRETTY CREATURE.
YOU STARTLED HER.               
                 MAYBE SHE KNOWS
                 THAT IN 10 DAYS
             YOU'LL BE AFTER    
                HER WITH YOUR   
             MURDERING GUNS.    
I'LL GET YOU                    
 A KNIFE.                       
 YOU DON'T                      
 LIKE HUNTING?                  
             NO, I DO NOT.      
         NEITHER DO I.          
     THEN WHAT DO YOU HUNT FOR? 
A LIVING. IT PAYS ME            
TO RUN HUNTING TRIPS.           
     I'VE GOT 2                 
    CLOWNS WAITING              
     FOR ME NOW.                
     THERE MUST BE A LOT        
     OF MONEY IN HUNTING.       
 I'VE BEEN THINKING OVER WHAT   
 THAT FELLA SAID ABOUT IVORY.   
                    HAVE YOU HAD
                 ANY EXPERIENCE 
             IN TRACKING GAME?  
HE ONCE TOOK PART               
IN A BADGER HUNT,

        YOU DON'T KNOW          
        WHAT YOU CAN DO         
         TILL YOU TRY.          
     WHILE YOU'RE TRYING,       
     YOUR POOR SISTER'S         
     PEACEFULLY PASSING         
     AWAY IN KILKENNY.          
    ALAN QUARTERMAIN, IT WAS A  
 LIE ABOUT ME FATHER'S SISTER.  
             I KNOW, I'VE MET   
             THE IRISH BEFORE.  
         I'M GLAD YOU OWNED UP. 
                     AND WHY    
                 SHOULDN'T SHE? 
                 SHE'S GONNA    
             SETTLE DOWN AND    
                 TEACH SCHOOL.  
         YOU'RE GOING           
         TO SETTLE DOWN?        
OF COURSE                       
I AM.                           
I SUPPOSE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING  
 IN THE IVORY TRADE IS THERE?   
 IF YOU ASK ME, THERE ISN'T A   
 PIN TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU.     
                 THERE'S A WAGON
             ACROSS THE RIVER.  
         NO. ANTELOPE           
            PROBABLY.           
 I'M SURE                       
IT'S A WAGON.                   
                     CAN'T BE.  
AND WHY NOT?                    
                THERE'S NOTHING 
                 ACROSS THAT    
             RIVER BUT DEVILS.  
                 THAT'S WHAT    
             THE NATIVES SAY.   
         IT'S UNEXPLORED LAND,  
         DESERT PROBABLY.       
IT MAY BE THE DEVIL'S,          
BUT I CAN SEE A WAGON.          
            COME ON!

            HE'S NOT            
         ABLE TO TALK.          
IT'S THE

 [Shouting in foreign language] 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,               
THEY'RE LOOKING                 
AFTER HIM.                      
     THE OTHERS RAN AWAY IN     
     THE NIGHT MANY DAYS AGO.   
     THE FEAR WAS ON THEM.      
        SURE, THE DEVIL.        
                HE FELL ILL.    
                WE COULD NOT    
             REACH THE NORTH.   
HELP HIM                        
BACK TO CAMP.                   
                I TURNED BACK.  
             HE DOES NOT KNOW.  
             LET ME GO ON.      
            OUT OF THE WAY.     
YOU CAN'T GO ON.                
YOU ARE ILL.                    
     DO I CARE IF I AM ILL?     
I DON'T KNOW WHERE              
YOU'RE GOING BUT--

    I'M GOING BUT I TELL YOU,   
     YOU CANNOT FOLLOW.         
         I CROSSED THE DESERT.  
        AFTER THE DESERT, I FIND
        KING SOLOMON'S MOUNTAIN.
         AFTER THE MOUNTAIN,    
    I FIND KING SOLOMON'S MINES.

THE MINES OF KING               
SOLOMON OVER THE DESERT.        
         IS IT TRUE?

     I KNOW HUMAN               
     NATURE WHERE               
 TREASURE'S CONCERNED.          
         WHERE'S THE HARM?      
         I RETURNED IT.         
AFTER TAKING A COPY.            
                 WILL YOU BE    
             SENDING THE MAP    
                 TO HIS FOLKS?  
AND PROVOKE                     
SOMEBODY ELSE                   
TO LOSE HIS LIFE?               
BESIDES, HE HAS NO FOLKS.       
        HAVE YOU LOOKED OVER IT?
     DO YOU THINK IT'S GENUINE? 
IT'S UNEXPLORED COUNTRY.        
NOBODY KNOWS.                   
     YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MAN    
         WHO MEANS TO KNOW.     
YOU'RE NOT GONNA                
TAKE THAT GIRL--                
                     WHAT DO YOU
                    TAKE ME FOR?
                 I'M HER FATHER,
                 NOT A MURDERER.
             I SHALL GO ALONE.  
        IN ALL ME LIFE, I MAY   
         NEVER GET ANOTHER      
         CHANCE LIKE THIS.      
OF DYING?                       
         OF FINDING AN EXCUSE   
         FOR HAVING BEEN BORN.  
     YOU'LL THINK ME A CASUAL   
        KIND OF A MICK, WHO     
     DOESN'T CARE A CRUST       
 IF I'VE A SHILLING IN ME       
 POCKET TO BUY A MEAL FOR ME    
    OWN FLESH AND BLOOD,        
     BUT IT'S THE WAY           
        WE IRISH ARE,           
            TO TAKE OUR TROUBLES
     WITH A SMILE IN OUR TEETH  
        WHILE UNDERNEATH,       
     THERE IS DEEP SHAME        
             IN ME HEART.       
DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW       
WHAT I OWE TO THAT CHILD        
 ASLEEP THERE?                  
 I DO KNOW AND HERE             
IS WHERE I MEAN TO PAY          
 THAT DEBT IN FULL.             
 WITH YOUR LIFE, HUH?           
IF GOD WILLS IT,                
 WITH ME LIFE.                  
     HOW DO YOU PROPOSE         
     TO MAKE THE JOURNEY?       
    HASN'T PROVIDENCE           
 SENT ME A TEAM OF OXEN?        
AND A WAGON, AND STRENGTH       
 AND PURPOSE TO CARRY ME        
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH?       
     YOU KNOW, O'BRIEN,         
 THERE'S ONLY ONE KIND OF MAN   
 THAT IS USELESS TO ARGUE WITH. 
     AND THAT IS?               
                 A FOOL.        
     EH.                        
     [Men speaking Kukuana]     
      INKOOSI,  OUR WAGON,      
             WHERE IS IT?       
         I'LL TAKE YOU ON.      
     AT LEAST YOU'LL BE SURE    
         OF FOOD AND A WAGE.    
                 KATHY, WAKE UP!
I DO NOT WORK FOR               
MONEY AND YOU DO                
NOT GO MY WAY.                  
     [Quartermain]              
         KATHY!                 
         ALL RIGHT.             
ALLAN QUARTERMAIN,              
 HE'S GONE AFTER                
 THE TREASURE.                  
                     I KNOW.    
     WITHOUT ME.                
     ME, WHO LAY DREAMING       
 OF THE WAY WE'D GO TOGETHER.   
        DID YOU EVER HEAR       
        OF SUCH A THING?        
         [Quartermain]          
            HURRY UP,           
        THEY'RE STARTING.       
 YOU'RE HEADING THE WRONG WAY.  
 AREN'T WE GOING                
 AFTER ME FATHER?               
                             NO.
         BUT--                  
            PUT ON YOUR BOOTS   
         AND GET INTO THE WAGON.
             I TOLD YOUR FATHER 
            I'D LOOK AFTER YOU. 
YOU KNEW HE WAS GOING           
AND YOU LET HIM GO BY HIMSELF.  
ALLAN QUARTERMAIN,              
WILL YOU TAKE ME AFTER          
ME FATHER, PLEASE?              
WE'LL LOOK FOR                  
THE MINES TOGETHER.             
AND WHEN WE FIND THEM,          
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR SHARE          
AND MORE, MUCH MORE.            
DOESN'T A FORTUNE               
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?           
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU WON'T         
TAKE ME IN YOUR WAGON           
I'LL GO ON ME OWN 2 FEET.       
    DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?   
                I DID.          
     THEN WHY DON'T YOU         
     SAY SOMETHING?             
             [Quartermain]      
            BECAUSE YOU'RE      
         NOT GOING TO DO IT.    
     THE  INKOOSIKAS  GOES      
     ACROSS THE RIVER.          
             YES, I DO.         
 WHAT BUSINESS IS IT            
     OF YOURS?                  
 THE  INKOOSIKAS  HAS           
 THE MAP. I GUIDE HER.          
     THE MAP'S IN MY WAGON.     
             NO ONE'S GOING     
         ACROSS THE RIVER.      
            KATHY, GET INTO     
             THAT WAGON.        
 GET INTO THAT WAGON!           
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?               
             I HAVE MANY NAMES. 
ONE'LL DO.                      
                     UMBOPA.    
WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?         
YOU'RE AFTER                    
DIAMONDS.                       
                 WHITE MEN CARE 
                 FOR DIAMONDS.  
THEN WHY DO YOU                 
WANT TO GO NORTH?               
MOVE UP.                        
         [Speaking Kukuana]     
        NOW, LOOK HERE, UMBOPA. 
     IF YOU WON'T TAKE SERVICE  
     WITH ME, I DON'T WANT YOU  
     HANGING ABOUT MY CAMPS.    
             [Speaking Kukuana] 
THAT FELLA'S                    
UP TO NO GOOD.                  
             ALLAN QUARTERMAIN, 
                I'LL NEVER SPEAK
            TO YOU AGAIN. NEVER!
I'M USED TO SILENCE.            
         [Shouting]

MY CLIENTS ARRIVED              
 LAST NIGHT.                    
IT'LL BE QUITE NICE             
TO HAVE SOMEBODY                
TO TALK TO.                     
PUT THE ENGLISHMEN'S            
GEAR IN HERE. WE'LL             
USE THIS WAGON.                 
     HOW ARE YOU,               
     QUARTERMAIN?               
         HOW ARE YOU, SIR?      
         I'M AFRAID I KEPT      
             YOU WAITING.       
                    THIS IS     
                 MISS O'BRIEN.  
        [Henry]                 
    HOW DO YOU DO?              
     DID YOU HAVE               
     A GOOD TREK?               
         NO, I DID NOT.         
                 DON'T MIND MISS
             O'BRIEN, SIR HENRY.
        SHE'S STRONG AND SILENT.
                 THE MAP IS     
                 IN THE WAGON.  
HOW DID YOU                     
 GET HERE?                      
          INKOOSIKAS  DOES NOT  
             FORGET HER PURPOSE?
             GOOD WILL INSISTS  
             ON HAVING HIS BATH.
     NO REASON FOR              
     BEING UNSANITARY,          
     EVEN IN AFRICA.            
QUITE RIGHT.                    
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU              
BOTH AT DINNER.                 
             YES. HOW DO YOU GET
             OUT OF THIS THING? 
         YOU BETTER ASK         
         SIR HENRY TO           
         TIP YOU OUT.           
 RIGHT.                         
                     NO, NO--   
                     [Mumbling] 
     SIR HENRY.                 
    SIR HENRY CURTIS.           
 SIR HENRY CURTIS.              
 WILL YOU HELP ME, PLEASE?      
 I'M IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE.       
MR. QUARTERMAIN WANTS ME        
TO SEND THE WAGON NORTH         
SO THAT THE BOYS CAN HAVE       
CAMP READY WHEN YOU ARRIVE      
BUT THEY WON'T OBEY ME.         
         MUTINY, EH?            
 GLORY BE TO GOD,               
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PIG.

             ROYAL NAVY.        
             RETIRED.           
             I'LL GO FETCH      
             QUARTERMAIN.       
    AH, NO.                     
 PLEASE DON'T.                  
I DON'T WANT HIM TO             
KNOW I'VE HAD TROUBLE.          
 WILL YOU                       
SPEAK TO THEM?                  
                 OF COURSE I'LL 
                 SPEAK TO THEM. 
                     BY THE WAY,
             I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
             STRONG AND SILENT. 
 YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE           
 MR. QUARTERMAIN.               
 HE'S A TERRIBLE LIAR.          
 GENTLEMEN, THE QUEEN.          
     GOD BLESS HER.             
 WITH YOUR PERMISSION,          
     I'LL LIGHT UP.             
             AND WITH YOURS     
         I'LL RUN OVER A FEW    
             OF MY PROPOSALS.   
             I TAKE IT YOU WANT 
                 TO GET A SABLE 
            ANTELOPE, SIR HENRY.
 IS MISS O'BRIEN OFTEN          
     AS LATE AS THIS?           
         SHE'LL SHOW UP         
     WHEN SHE'S HUNGRY.         
     SHE SEEMED TO ME           
     TO BE A CAPABLE            
        YOUNG PERSON.           
     HMM--YES, CAPABLE          
        OF ANYTHING.            
 SHE'D HAVE STOLEN ONE          
 OF MY WAGONS IF I HADN'T       
    KEPT ME EYES OPEN.          
         [Quartermain]          
         ANYTHING WRONG?        
        I TAKE IT IT'S IN ORDER 
         FOR SIR HENRY TO TELL  
             YOUR WAGON BOYS TO 
            OBEY THE YOUNG LADY.
        WITH THE RESULT THAT    
         YOUR WAGON IS NOW      
            PROCEEDING NORTH    
                 TO ESTABLISH   
                    A CAMP.     
BUT SHE TOLD ME--               
             MY BOY, I'M AFRAID 
             YOU'RE THE VICTIM  
             OF A WOMAN'S WILES.
WE MUST GO                      
AFTER HER.                      
             WE CERTAINLY MUST. 
             MY ONLY TOOTHBRUSH 
             IS IN THAT WAGON.  
 SHE HAS 3 HOURS START.         
 IT'LL BE 2 DAYS BEFORE         
     I GATHER A TEAM.           
 SHE TOLD ME THOSE BOYS         
     WERE MUTINOUS.             
 I'M AFRAID, SIR HENRY,         
 THAT IT'S MISS O'BRIEN         
     WHO IS MUTINOUS.           
                 WILL YOU HAVE A
             LITTLE MORE PORT?

         IN A STOLEN            
             WAGON.             
         AND WHAT'S LEFT        
         OF MY TROUSERS.        
         [Quartermain]          
         YOU'RE COMING          
         BACK TOMORROW.         
MEANWHILE, COMMANDER            
GOOD WOULD LIKE                 
HIS TOOTHBRUSH.                 
             YES.               
        IF YOU WEREN'T A GIRL,  
             I'D GIVE YOU THE   
         HIDING OF YOUR LIFE.   
         ASHAMED OF YOURSELF?   
    BUT I'D DO IT AGAIN.        
             READY TO           
             COME BACK?         
     I'M NOT                    
    COMING BACK.                
I MADE UP ME MIND               
TO GO AFTER ME FATHER           
AND I'M GOING.                  
     NOT IN MY WAGON.           
             I DON'T WANT YOUR  
             WAGON ANYMORE.     
     YOU CAN'T TAKE A WAGON     
     OVER THE DESERT BECAUSE    
    YOU CAN'T TAKE ANY OXEN.    
     WHY?                       
                    BECAUSE THEY
                 DRINK TOO MUCH.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?              
 I DID,  INKOOSI.               
         WHAT ARE YOU           
         DOING HERE?            
                     [Kathy]    
                 I BROUGHT HIM. 
LOOK, KATHY, I DON'T KNOW       
     WHAT THIS MAN'S            
    BEEN TELLING YOU,           
         BUT I GIVE YOU         
     MY WORD NO ONE CAN         
     CROSS THAT DESERT.         
             HOW DOES           
         THE  INKOOSI  KNOW?    
    I'M GONNA TRY.              
    I'M NOT AFRAID.             
THE  INKOOSIKAS                 
IS READY.                       
         I'M IN CHARGE          
     HERE. CLEAR OUT!           
     WAIT, WE CAN'T             
     LET THESE 2                
        GO ALONE,               
             BUT WHY            
         SHOULDN'T WE           
         GO WITH THEM?          
                GOOD SUGGESTION.
             SOLVES THE PROBLEM.
        I WON'T HAVE IT.        
            NOBODY'S ASKING YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED            
TO GO HUNTING.                  
             YOU KNOW, HUNTING, 
     FISHING, ANYTHING WITH A   
        LITTLE ADVENTURE IN IT. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MEN             
DIE FOR LACK OF WATER?          
THIRST, BURNING THIRST          
THAT TURNS TO PAIN.             
TORTURE, THEN                   
YOU GO MAD                      
AND THE SUN                     
KILLS YOU.                      
                     IMAGINATIVE
             FELLOW, ISN'T HE?  
                QUARTERMAIN.    
            I'M SORRY OUR TRIP'S
         HAD TO END LIKE THIS.  
     HOW DO YOU                 
     MEAN "END"?                
                 WE'LL BE AWAY  
                 FOR SOME TIME. 
                CAN'T ASK YOU   
             TO WAIT FOR US.    
 SIR HENRY CURTIS,              
I WAS ENGAGED TO                
TAKE YOU UPCOUNTRY              
AND TO BRING YOU                
BACK TO THE BEST                
OF MY ABILITY.                  
I HAPPEN TO BE A                
MAN WHO RESPECTS                
A CONTRACT.                     
I'M LINING                      
UP WITH THE                     
REST OF YOU.                    
                YOU'RE A GOOD   
            FELLOW, QUARTERMAIN.
ON THE CONTRARY,                
I'M A FOOL.                     
    HOW ARE YOUR FEET?          
                     ALL RIGHT. 
                 HOW ARE YOURS? 
         FINE.                  
     NICE ABOUT OUR FEET,       
            ISN'T IT?           
         ARE YOU REALLY GOING   
             ALL THROUGH THIS   
            JUST FOR DIAMONDS?  
 THE  INKOOSI                   
    SAYS SO.                    
     I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.     
         I'M ASKING YOU.        
     WHY IS                     
  INKOOSI  GOING?               
                 BLESSED IF     
                     I KNOW.    
                 YOU'RE NOT ONE 
                    FOR A BIT OF
                GOSSIP, ARE YOU?
         THE MOUNTAINS DON'T    
             SEEM TO GET ANY    
             NEARER, DO THEY?   
         NO, THEY DON'T,        
                 DO THEY?       
                 NO--NO, THEY-- 
                 NO, THEY DON'T.
                 FEELING BETTER?
 MUST YOU KEEP                  
 ON ASKING ME?                  
                     I NEEDN'T. 
 I'D SURE MISS IT               
 IF YOU DIDN'T.                 
 HOW LONG WILL                  
 THE WATER LAST?                
                 TOMORROW.      
     IF I--                     
 IF I DON'T GET                 
 ANOTHER CHANCE,                
 I'M SORRY ABOUT                
 EVERYTHING.                    
WHAT ARE THOSE                  
BIRDS UP THERE?                 
                     [Umbopa]   
ASSVOGELS.                      
THEY MUST BE TO LIVE            
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.           
                    WE CALL THEM
                 "THE BIRD THAT 
                 SMELLS DEATH." 
 HUH? OH.                       
 GOOD! COME HERE.               
                O'BRIEN'S WAGON.
                 GO BACK AND    
             KEEP HER TALKING.  
 FETCH THE OTHERS.              
             [Henry]            
         THAT'S THE LAST        
        RATION OF WATER.        
     HALF A BOTTLE EACH.        
THAT'S GOOD, I--                
I SEE BY THE MAP THAT           
WE OUGHT TO GET TO PAN BAD      
WATER BY MIDDAY TOMORROW.       
WHY'S IT CALLED                 
"PAN BAD WATER"?                
            BECAUSE IN 300 YEARS
         IT MAY HAVE DRIED UP.  
 OH...                          
             OH, I SEE, YES.    
         GO ON,                 
         DRINK IT.              
                 WHAT'S THE     
                 USE, CURTIS?   
        THERE'S NO POINT        
     IN HER SURVIVING US.       
         SAND! GO DOWN!         
                         RUN!   
        [Wind whistling]        
         [Wind howling]         
         I SMELL WATER.

             [Kathy]            
             NEARLY.            
     WE HAD MELONS FOR          
 BREAKFAST YESTERDAY.           
     WE DID.                    
     AND MELONS                 
     THE DAY BEFORE.            
     WE DID.                    
     I SUPPOSE WE'RE GONNA      
     HAVE MELONS TODAY?         
             [Both]             
             WE ARE.            
     DON'T THE BIRDS            
     IN THIS COUNTRY            
     EVER LAY EGGS?             
 I WONDER HOW                   
 FAR ME FATHER                  
 IS AHEAD OF US?                
                    YOU SURE HE 
                 GOT THIS FAR?  
         OF COURSE I AM.        
     PATRICK O'BRIEN HAS        
     ALWAYS DONE WHAT HE        
     SET HIS MIND TO.           
             WHAT DID YOU THINK 
            ABOUT IN THE DESERT?
 SAND, MOSTLY.                  
                    DID YOU EVER
                    THINK OF ME?
             YES...             
         YOU AND                
         THE SAND.              
        I'M GLAD OF THAT BECAUSE
     YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF  
     ME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.  
 AM I?                          
        I'M AFRAID YOU          
        CAN'T AVOID IT.         
         YOU SEE, WE'RE IN      
     UNINHABITED COUNTRY.       
 I HATE TO CONTRADICT           
     YOU BUT,                   
            THERE'S A MAN       
         BEHIND THAT ROCK--     
 SEVERAL MEN.                   
            THEY SEEM ANXIOUS   
             TO MEET US.        
             MUCH TOO ANXIOUS.  
     [Shouting in Kukuana]      
             WHAT'S HAPPENED?   
THEY SAY, "WHAT MANNER          
OF MAN IS THIS WITH THE         
BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS,           
"WHO GROWS HAIR ON

IT WHERE IT GROWS?"             
             [Speaking Kukuana] 
 HE'S TELLING THEM YOU ARE      
WHITE GODS FROM THE SKIES.      
     YOU MEAN, ON ACCOUNT       
            OF MY LEGS?         
            I NEVER THOUGHT     
         THEY WERE AS GOOD      
             AS ALL THAT.       
             [Speaking Kukuana] 
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE           
THAT BETTER IF HE'D

COME ON!                        
TOO BAD THAT WHEN               
WE GET TO A FORTUNE             
IN DIAMONDS,                    
THE MOUNTAIN                    
SHOULD DECIDE                   
TO SIT DOWN ON IT.              
                 IT DID NOT,    
                     THEN.      
                I'VE A FORTUNE  
             HERE IN ME POCKET. 
             THERE'S ENOUGH     
             HERE FOR ALL OF US.
DIAMONDS ARE NOT MUCH USE       
 WHEN YOU'RE TRAPPED            
 BEHIND SOLID ROCK.             
I DON'T WANT TO DEPRESS         
YOU ANY FURTHER,                
BUT I THINK THERE'S             
GOING TO BE AN ERUPTION.        
THAT FALL OF                    
ROCK, YOU KNOW?                 
VOLCANOES ARE                   
NERVOUS THINGS,                 
IT TAKES VERY LITTLE            
TO UPSET THEM.                  
         [Explosions]           
     IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,       
YOU'D BE QUIETLY SHOOTING       
     GAME IN THE SOUTH.         
                 AND THEN YOU'D 
                 HAVE GONE HOME 
     AND MARRIED SOME NICE GIRL 
    AND LIVED IN YOUR BIG HOUSE.
AND SLOWLY GROWN                
OLD AND FAT AND                 
DISAGREEABLE,                   
AND ENDED UP A FEEBLE           
OLD MAN WITH NO ONE             
SORRY TO SEE YOU GO.            
NO, I'D RATHER                  
DIE YOUNG.                      
                STRANGE, I USED 
                 TO HATE DYING. 
        I'D LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT  
     THINKING ABOUT IT, SCARED. 
     BUT WHEN YOU COME TO IT,   
     IT'S NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL. 
         [Rumbling]             
         [Explosions]           
                THERE'S ONLY    
                ONE THING I'M   
                SORRY ABOUT.    
             I'D LIKE TO HAVE   
             SEEN IRELAND AGAIN,
             THE GLEN OF ARMAGH 
             WHERE I WAS BORN,  
         WITH THE MOUNTAINS     
             RUNNING DOWN       
             TO THE LAKES.      
             WE WERE TO HAVE    
            GONE HOME NEXT YEAR.
                 YOU COULD HAVE 
                 COME WITH US.

         PUSH IT CLEAR.         
                     READY?     
                         RIGHT. 
         [Umbopa]               
            READY?              
                     THIS TIME. 
     IT'S GONNA ERUPT!          
                 STEADY.        
                GOT HIM?

WILL LEAD YOU

 AND AT TIMES, REMEMBER HOW     
     WE STOOD SHOULDER TO       
 SHOULDER IN THE GREAT BATTLE.

Hello. Hello.
I wonder what's holding them up.
Don't worry about that, Father.
We'll be going soon.
John, did you feed them hounds?
Yes, Grandpa, yes.
All right.
Now tighten her up, Son.
She'll take us where we're going.
Yes, but where are we going?
Now, Ma, they're thrashin' that matter out over there now.
Pa, they made you the leader.
Why don't you say where to go?
I'm only leader of the Missourians, Daughter.
There are families here from every state in the Union, I reckon.
Can't be waitin' on
'em forever, Dad.
No, Son.
They're holding a powwow over there now.
I'll just step over and see what they got to say.
Well, bless our wild heart.
If it ain't Breck Coleman.
How are you, Zeke?
Where at you been hidin' yourself for the last year, boy?
Been down Santa Fe way, Zeke.
Just drifted in.
And here's Windy Bill.
Looks like you've wintered through in good shape.
Well, Coleman, most times I winter through in fair shape.
This year, when the first grass showed, I'd only put on 60 pounds.
Say, Bascom, he maybe could tell us of a likely stretch of country.
Breck, could you sight us to a second
Missouri anywheres out yonder?
Sure. But it's a long, tough pull from here.
2,500 mile the way you'd have to go.
No, it's too far off.
No place is too far if it's what we want.
This is a land beyond Oregon.
There ain't no land beyond Oregon, mister.
West of Oregon comes the ocean, way it's been told to me.
This stretch is north of Oregon.
How many people settled on it now?
It's Indian country.
Except for the trappers, never a white man has left his track there.
Only one trading post in that whole country.
Who owns it?
A Missouri trapper owns it.
Hey, mister, will you tell me this...
Hey, hey, there.
Since you all elected me the he-coon of this outfit, let me do the talking.
It's everything a Missourian's heart could crave.
There's two snow-capped mountain ranges with peaks lost in the sky.
And between them ranges, men, is a great valley.
Lakes and streams everywhere.
Fish, you ask, and game?
There's salmon swarmin' up them rivers thicker than blackbirds in a cane patch.
Friend, will you undertake to lead us to that valley?
I'd like nothin' better, men...
But our trails fork here.
I've got business that calls me back down the road Santa Fe way.
What business do you follow, friend?
I'm a trapper.
Well, surely there's fur aplenty out in that land beyond Oregon.
Plenty.
But I gotta kill me a pair of skunks, back apiece on the road to Santa Fe.
Hey, wait, wait. Friend, how do you find that valley?
Wellmore here is sending a bull train clear through to old Tom Williams's trading post.
First time it's ever been tried.
String along behind them and, if they make it through, you'll find your valley.
And tell that great white mountain hello for me.
Good-bye, Zeke.
Well, thanks, boy.
Hey!
Hey, maybe he fed us a fairy tale.
Now don't be a pig, you know.
Howdy, Mrs. Riggs.
Land's sakes!
Well, you sure look fine,
Mother Riggs.
It's a long time since I've seen you.
You know, you always was a great hand to wander.
Yeah, I ramble around.
And how are the little twins?
Little? My lands!
Them girls has grown since you seen 'em last.
No!
Mm-hmm.
They in the house?
Mildred is. Elise went down to watch the boat come in.
I reckon I'll saunter in and surprise Mildred.
Oh, you sure will surprise them.
Well, Breck, I sure am glad to see you.
Well, you certainly have doubled in size since last I set eyes on you, Mildred.
You just must see Elise.
I'll surely see her before I leave.
There's the
Peensie Bell whistling now.
Ooh, look at the crowd.
Oh, look.
Okay. I guess it is important to have everything ready.
I have everything ready.
Well, Miss Cameron, we be landin' in a few minutes.
Got all your outfit together?
Most everything's ready,
Captain Hollister.
Listen, why don't you give up this plan and turn back?
Why, there's no place to turn back to.
Why, there isn't a home in all the South that wouldn't welcome the daughter of Colonel Cameron.
True. But we can hardly become perpetual visitors.
It's a tough proposition, girl, this pioneer life in a savage wilderness.
We realize that,
Captain Hollister, but we must keep the family together.
Honey Girl wants to stay with her sister Ruth, doesn't she?
Yes, I do.
And our brother Dave's almost a man grown.
Ruth is right, Captain. The Cameron tribe must stick together.
Say, you're just the fella I want to see.
I want to play some more of that shell game.
Have you got any more money?
Oh, sure I got some money.
Where'd you get that?
From my mother-in-law.
She lend it to me, but she don't know it.
Here, I'll meet you below deck.
Get along.
Don't forget.
I wait there for you.
Are you still determined to be a sturdy pioneer?
Quite determined,
Mr. Thorpe.
I've told you about my plantation in Louisiana.
It must be wonderful.
Miss Cameron, those lands and servants are yours, if you'll take me with them.
Why, I do thank you. But as I've said before, it's quite impossible.
Good-bye, Mr. Thorpe.
Now, if I win,
I'm going to keep it.
But if I lose, I give my mother-in-law half.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Here we are again.
Hello, Thorpe.
Well, Gussie, you want to see the elusive little ball under the shells.
There you are. Now it's bound to be under one of them.
There's one, there's two, and there's three.
Now we'll shuffle them just a little bit, just to confuse you.
And take your choice.
Now wait, I show you.
Here, I bet you two dollars.
Two dollars. Covered.
I always do that for good luck.
Now wait. I show you.
Now watch.
Ah, you see, Gussie, the hand is faster than the eye.
Better luck next time.
Oh, here. Who wants to buy my mother-in-law's stocking?
Gus!
Oh, there you are. What do you mean by spending my money?
But, Mama, I'm going to give you half.
Give me my money.
Give it to her.
Hurry UP-
Give me the rest of it.
Why, madam, that's my own money.
That's my money.
No, no, Mama.
That's his money.
Captain, I demand that that man give me my money.
Hand it over.
See, Mama? Didn't I tell you we would win?
Why, you big loafer! Get out of here!
Spending my life's earnings!
Now, Thorpe, you get off of my boat.
If you set foot on it again,
I'll put you in irons and land you at St. Charles on my way back.
Davey, I think I better go find Mrs. Riggs, that lady Captain Hollister told us about.
Come on, Honey Girl.
No. I want to stay here with
Davey and watch them unload.
Well, you take good care of her, Davey.
I will.
I'll be right back,
Honey Girl.
It's a nice place, ain't it, Mama?
It's terrible!
Look at the mud!
Well, listen, Mama, I gonna go see if I can buy a horse.
Come on. Come on.
I carry you over there.
I don't want you to get your feet wet.
That's it. Here we go.
Now you stay there.
I bring Abbie over.
Come on, Abbie. I don't want you to get your shoes all muddy.
That's it.
Come on. Here we go.
Oh, stop laughing, will you, Abbie?
That's it. Now you wait here.
I bring Mama.
Come on, Mama.
I take you over, Mama.
Come on, Mama.
Come on, Mama. It's...
Here! What are you trying to do?
But, Mama,
I want to carry you across so you won't get your feet wet.
You? I'll cross my own mud.
All right then, Mama, but let me help you.
That's it, Mama. Come on now.
Okay, step on that board, Mama.
That's it, Mama.
Ohh!
Say, I come right back.
Ohh! Oh, Gus!
Uh, Mrs. Riggs?
Yes, miss. That's me.
Well, I'm Miss Cameron. Captain
Hollister told me to see you.
Friend of
Captain Hollister?
Yes, lam.
Come right on in.
Oh, thank you.
Now don't tear your pretty dress on them logs.
Oh, it's nice and cool in here out of the sun.
Now you sit down, make yourself easy, and I'll brew you a cup of tea.
Oh, that's awfully nice of you, Mrs. Riggs. Thank you.
No! Wha...
Why, what do you mean by...
Oh, I thought...
Oh! Oh!
It was thisaway, ma'am, I thought you were someone else.
Wait! It was thisaway. I thought you were Elise, ma'am.
Elise?
Yes. Just thought
I'd surprise her sort of.
Did you indeed?
Let me tell ya.
If you'll light someplace,
I'll tell ya.
Oh!
Oh.
What is it?
You're as pale as a ghost.
Oh, it's nothing,
Mr. Thorpe. Really. I...
But there must be something wrong.
Oh, nothing.
Just an unpleasant occurrence.
I'm gonna explain that play.
There's nothing to explain.
But I'm gonna tell you anyhow.
It seems to me you're forcing yourself on this lady.
Is that how it seems to you?
How else can I take it?
It's nothing to me how you take it.
But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand.
Perhaps not. But if it concerns Miss Cameron,
I'll demand an explanation.
You will?
Then speak your piece.
Mr. Thorpe, will... Will you please take me to my brother?
With pleasure. I'll be looking for you shortly.
Well, I won't be hard to locate.
Hello, Honey Girl.
Hello.
Thank you so much,
Mr. Thorpe.
It's a great pleasure.
Just think. This wagon will be your home for the next six months.
And after that, a cabin in the wilderness.
My mind is made up,
Mr. Thorpe.
We're going with the settlers.
You know my brother David.
Yes.
Hello, Dave.
How do you do?
Howdy, DOV!
Hello, Zeke.
Howdy, Bill.
Hey, Jack, I been tellin' you about this here boy Coleman.
He can heave a knife into a mark so big every time.
I'll bet you a buffalo hide he can't heave it into that post back of ya.
Call the bet! Now here.
Show him, boy.
Bless our wild heart!
Oh, I've seen him do it a hundred times, eh, Bill?
That's another buffalo hide you owe me, Jack.
You remember, Bill, that time up, uh, on the Snake River...
Oh, I sure do.
Say, boy, I want to know about old Ben Griswell.
I hear the
Indians downed him.
Only it wasn't
Injuns downed him.
No?
Renegade whites done it.
How come?
He'd been wolf in' all winter.
Yeah?
Must've had $2,000, $3,000 worth of wolf pelts.
Oh, easy that.
He was hacked up and stuck full of arrows.
Looked like Injun work, all right.
The wolf pelts was gone.
If ever I find them hellhounds,
I'll sure make 'em hunt their holes.
Come on.
Lopez, who's that young buck over there with no hair on his face?
That's, uh, Breck Coleman.
He very quick with his knife.
Oh, where's he come from?
He come from the plains, the mountains.
He live with the Indians.
He can throw a knife through the heart in 20 feet.
He's the best shot in all this country.
He knows everything.
He'll know too much for his own good someday.
Yes. All right.
If old Ben had lived, he'd be going on about 72 now, wouldn't he?
Injuns never done this.
It was renegade whites.
And they've left their mark.
Oh, I'd say I do.
Say, Zeke, who was that he-grizzly that just went by?
Why, that's Red Flack. He's bullwhackin' for Wellmore.
He's gonna whack Wellmore's train clear through to Oregon.
You reckon you'll ever find out who downed old Ben?
It's just possible that a certain low-down coyote left his sign there.
Well, hello, Coleman.
Howdy, Wellmore.
I've changed my mind. I'll scout for that bull train after all.
Well, that's a ray of sunshine.
Shake hands afore you change your mind again.
Got a good wagon boss for the trip?
Red Flack.
A burly ruffian, but he can maul the toughest traitor on the plains into a pulp without even working up a sweat.
He can do that, eh?
Flack? Ha!
Why, he likes to do it.
But he can run a bull train.
Here he comes now.
Well, Wellmore, all ready to start?
Likely you two have met before.
Nah.
I reckon not.
Coleman's gonna scout for the train.
You understand, Flack, that he's to have final say in all matters dealing with the Indians.
Yes? Well, who's got the final say about bossin' this bull train?
He understands that you're the wagon boss.
Yeah. Another thing, another thing...
Am I supposed to be wet nurse to them woodenhead pilgrims a-crossin' the plains?
The more that goes along, the better it is for them and you in case Indians jump ya.
Well, all right.
All right!
Make it clear to him that I'm wagon boss.
Oh, he understands that, Flack.
He seems to be a right pleasant cuss.
He's a ruffian, but he's a real wagon boss.
Likely he is.
Must've done a big trade in wolf pelts this year.
Yes, we had a big trade with the wolfers.
Flack sell you any of these?
Flack? No. He didn't do any wolfing last winter, I guess.
What outfit did you buy the biggest bunch from?
Fella name of Lopez come in about a month ago with close on to
5,000 dollars' worth.
Lopez,eh?
I guess I don't know him.
I signed him up as a bullwhacker on the train.
You did, eh?
I'll see you next year.
Bring your scalp along back whole.
All right. Good-bye.
Is that so?
It certainly is.
I don't know whether they're gonna get through or not...
Windy, I'm gonna scout for that bull train.
Good.
Oh, Mr. Cameron, this is Mr. Coleman.
Howdy, Mr. Coleman.
How do you do, sir?
Uh, he can tell you more about that country where you're going, and what kind of an outfit you need than any man around here.
Thanks.
Windy, throw my bags in with yours and Zeke's, will ya?
All right, I'll do.
Tell Zeke I'm going along.
All right, boy.
Mr. Coleman, would you mind looking over my outfit?
Certainly not. Uh, we'll go have a peek at it. Where is it?
Right over there, sir.
Honey Girl, it's time for your history lesson, dear.
Now, uh, how many stars in the flag?
Twenty-six.
How many stripes?
Thirty.
Now, you know better than that.
There's 13.
And what do they stand for?
The 13 original colonies.
Now remember that.
Now, who discovered the Columbia River?
Here's our outfit.
Mr. Coleman, this is my sister Ruth.
Robert Gray.
Honey Girl, it isn't safe to be sitting in a rocking chair, when there are certain persons present.
I think you'll find we have everything.
Plenty of guns?
A rifle and a fowling piece.
How about ammunition?
Plenty.
One thing...
I don't see any barrel.
A barrel?
Yeah, you'll need a water barrel.
There'll be long stretches without water.
I knew we'd forget something.
I'll go get one.
All right.
What I was aiming to tell you was this.
When I came in...
The folks right next there had an extra one.
Oh, quick work, son.
Say, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take two barrels.
Suppose you go rustle another one.
I'll do that.
When I came romping into the Riggses' cabin, ma'am...
How's this one?
Oh! Well, that's fine.
Looks like barrels grow on trees around here.
Mr. Cameron, you better tell your sister to change that pretty dress.
She won't get very far in that.
Yes, sir.
Put on some traveling clothes.
Let's have a peek around here.
We have a trailer, in case we needed...
I like him better than Mr. Thorpe.
Honey Girl, we'll finish your history lesson.
Ah, I know how that is.
Well, you won't...
Thorpe!
Thorpe, you get back on the Peensie
Bell and make yourself scarce.
If you're here when the boat pulls out, the boys will certainly lead your pony out from under you.
Why, I had no intention of staying.
I'll be on the Peensie Bell when she leaves.
You see that you are.
My goodness. I don't know what
I'm going to do with you.
Well, I try again. Come on.
Here. Up you go. Up.
Oh, you stubborn jackass. I give you a "yab" in the "yaw."
I bet you "yump." Come on.
Up.
Hello there, Gus. What do you call that thing you got there?
Oh, his name is Jack.
Jack? Oh, yes.
But that's only half of it.
Well, see, he's only a half a horse.
Well...What's the matter?
Can't you get him up?
I don't know. I pull and I pull, but he won't come up.
Wait. Wait. I got an idea.
Say, what did you say to him then?
Heh! I told him a joke about my mother-in-law.
Gus!
Wait. Shh. Here she comes.
Gus, what have you got there?
This is my new horse.
I just bought him.
You bought him?
Sure.
Say, ya...
That wasn't me, Mama.
No, it was the mule.
That rum's for you and me, eh?
Ah, gracias.
Ahh.
Well, if it ain't Bill Thorpe, eh?
I always thought you was hung and planted years back.
No, my time ain't arrived yet, Flack.
Yeah.
Though it looks as though it might be drawing close.
Ah, how come?
Well, I've been promised a hanging bee
if I don't get out on the Peensie Bell.
And the captain promised me a necktie party if I set foot on the boat.
It's a case of nowhere to go.
Yeah. It appears to me you do your shooting by daylight, with too many people looking on, eh?
Well, long as you can't go and you can't stay, just what do you figure to do about it, eh?
Well, I've always been able to wiggle out.
Yeah. Appears to me as if you was born to be drowned, eh?
Come on, Zeke.
Get rid of that moonshine, and let's get out in the sunshine.
All right, big boy.
Hold your head up.
Don't leave me.
Yeah, so long, folks.
See you next year.
Yeah.
Are you just as handy with a gun as you was?
I can drive a nail at 30 paces.
Yeah.
Well, as long as you can't go, and you can't stay...
Wouldn't be a bad idea if you was to go along with me.
Well, that sounds reasonable.
Yeah.
Where do you happen to be headed for?
Well, anyways, it's out there, where there ain't no noose awaitin' for you, eh?
Hello, Breck.
Well, Windy, I trapped him with his jug down at Joe's.
Hey, Windy, here's the last you'll see of civilization for a long time.
That's worth tryin'.
Hey! Back up here, will ya? Back up.
I gotta finish that with Windy.
Hey, that's what you get for not drinkin' with me.
I'll drink at your next wedding.
Yeah!
Windy, uh...
Do some of them musical things, will you, with your mouth?
Ah, that's old stuff.
Dab, no. Something new.
Oh, well.
A coyote.
That's no coyote.
There's the stuff! Hey!
Hey, did you ever kill a dead Indian?
No, I never killed a dead one.
Before they was dead, did ya?
No. You see, the Injuns are my friends.
They taught me all I know about the woods.
They taught me how to follow a trail by watching the leaves.
And how to cut your mark on a tree so you won't get lost in the forest.
And they taught me how to burry in in the snow, so you won't freeze to death in the storms.
And they taught me how to make a fire without even a flint.
How could you do that?
And they taught me how to make the best bow and arrows too.
Did they teach you how to make papooses?
No, that's one of their own secrets.
Well, boys, I guess we better get going.
O God, our Father, as you sit on high and look down on us poor mortals, forgive our frailties.
I am about to lead these people into a wild and dangerous country.
Give me strength and wisdom,
0 God, to lead them through.
Where's my steps?
Mama, I got everything packed up in the wagon.
But how can I get into the wagon, you idiot?
Well, look, I show you. Look,
Mama, put your feets up on there.
That's it. Now wait. I lift. That's...
Up you go, Mama. That's it.
Now one more foot up. Now up, Mama.
Up, Mama. That's it. Up.
Wait, Mama. You're sitting on my head, Mama.
Please... There you go.
Get in. Get in, folks.
We're goin'.
Mount up. We're goin' now.
Get in there.
We're on our way.
Pull out!
Give us a song!
All right.
We're off, boys.
Sam's got a wooden leg below the knee
Sam's got a wooden leg below the knee
Whoa, mule!
Never mind! I walk there, Useless. Come on.
You want these sacks, don't ya?
Trade cattle.
Hyah! Hyah!
About time we were movin' on.
Yeah.
Willy!
Come on, Willy. Forward!
Ah, giddyap!
Ah, giddyap!
Ah, giddyap!
Hyah! Hyah! Move out!
Yeah! Yee!
You make me so tired!
Get over there!
I'm tired of this!
Fi!
Get up here!
Get along here!
Get in there!
Get on! Go on!
Howdy, Dave.
Hello, Coleman.
Oh, Miss Cameron...
Glad to see you took my advice about saving that pretty dress.
You look so nice in it, it'd be a shame to spoil it.
Looking for anyone in particular?
Honey Girl, a gentleman never comes to a lady's home when he isn't wanted.
Out here, this wagon's our only home.
Pony, that means us.
Come on, Useless.
What's the matter?
Come here, Useless.
Hey, there.
Whoa! Wait. Wait.
Whoa.
Get in...
Get in there.
Get in there!
Giddyap!
Whoa.
Come on. Get in there!
Come on, Useless.
This way.
Git!
Whoa.
Wait a minute, Useless.
Come on, Useless.
Come on, Useless. Come on.
What do you think of this fella Thorpe?
Ah, I've seen that there squawker somewheres afore.
Can't recollect just where.
He, uh, shoots a kind of a nasty look at you once in a while, boy.
We had a run-in the first day.
Yeah?
You know, he ain't no settler.
Nah.
And he ain't no bullwhacker.
Uh-uh.
Wonder what he come along for.
Aha! He come along, uh, 'cause of that, uh, Cameron girl.
I'm still mystified,
Mr. Thorpe, why you came here instead of returning to your plantation.
I've told you why I came.
I induced Captain Hollister, an old friend of mine, to put back to shore, and I followed you.
Yes, I know that's what you told me.
But I'm afraid you're a flatterer.
Oh! On my honor, no.
You got a chew of tobacco?
Hey, Lopez! Tobacco's gonna be mighty scarce later on.
Boy, I'm goin' back to old Windy
Bill and get a slug of "come on."
Your name's Lopez, eh?
Uh, Lopez, that's me.
You and Flack good friends, he tells me.
Ah, Flack and me been friends 12, 15 years.
You were out wolfing together last winter, eh?
No, no, no. Wolfing, she not good business. No money.
Then you didn't get many?
No, not much.
Funny. Wellmore said you sold him more furs than any other half dozen outfits.
No. He must have been talking about someone else. Not me.
Well, no matter.
See you often.
Ah, you rascal.
Flack.
Got a good bunch of bullwhackers, Flack.
That, uh, Lopez strikes me as a good hand.
Ah, you bet.
Lopez can pound them along.
You and him old friends, eh?
Who? Lopez and me?
Nah. I never see'd him till he signed on this trip.
My mistake.
Ah, Lopez.
I don't like this man Coleman.
Yeah?
If he asks after me, you tell him you never see'd me, till you signed on this trip.
You're too late.
Why?
He just speak to me, and I tell him we was old friends.
What?
What do you use under your hat instead of brains?
You need no brains if you got this.
Ahh.
Now you're talking sense.
Come on, you.
Come on. Giddyap.
Pick your partner and a-promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the ca...
Prepare to promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the call.
Now right in circles.
Take your partner and a-promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the call.
Maybe she won't, uh, talk with him, but she'll dance with him, eh?
It's a lovely dance.
On with the next and follow the call.
And a lovely night.
And a lovely girl.
Now's your chance. Go in and snag her away from him.
I claim the favor.
With pleasure, Mr. Thorpe.
Well, Zeke.
Hello, boy.
Thorpe just stole my partner and left me dancing with myself.
Yeah?
Say, boy, it just come to me a minute ago, where I seen that there Thorpe before.
Where?
Camped on the Cimarron with
Flack and Lopez. They're old friends.
Are you sure of that?
Dead certain.
So keep your eye peeled on him, son.
Oh, I'm tired. I think
I'll go to my wagon.
Why, certainly.
Let me take you there.
And to think this same moon is shining on my old plantation in Louisiana.
All it needs is a lovely woman to preside there.
Someday you'll find her.
I have found her, Ruth.
Oh, please, Mr. Thorpe.
Look, I've told you before that there can be no happiness without love.
But love will come.
Ruth... I'm really tired, Mr. Thorpe.
Do you mind if I go to bed?
Good night.
Good night.
We're getting into dangerous country, Flack...
So I'll be riding to the Pawnee villages to pick up some Injun scouts.
Yes? Well, you're likely to lose your scalp out there.
I'll bet you a couple of wolf pelts I bring it back with me.
How long'll you be gone, Coleman?
Three or four days, a week maybe.
Oh, back so soon?
I thought maybe you wouldn't be coming back at all.
And just why did you think that?
Well, after I sort of took the dark-eyed beauty away from you,
I thought you might be decamping.
Listen, Thorpe. I never quit a job in the middle of the road.
Oh, quite so.
Quite so.
But after the girl quit you in the middle of the road...
Say that again, Mr. Thorpe!
I know who you are now, and I know why you quit the Cimarron country too.
Oh, well. No necessity to have quarrels among friends.
Friends?
You threw too wide a loop.
Remember this, the three of you...
I'm not your friend.
Yeah. Well, you let him scare you stiff.
Not at all.
Only an idiot, you know, presses a quarrel, when the other man has a knife pressed against his middle.
Yeah. Good excuse.
Wolf pelts, eh?
What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.
It doesn't to me, but it does to you.
Yeah? Where'd you get that notion?
When he mentioned wolf pelts, you looked as though he'd rammed a knife in you.
Not exactly what I'd call a poker face.
Yeah?
Well, what of it?
Oh, nothing.
Only I'm beginning to understand why you don't like Coleman.
Bye, Windy.
And, Zeke, I'll be seeing you in the happy hunting grounds if not before.
Good luck, boy.
Bye.
Well, Miss Ruth, I got some good news for you.
What?
I'm gonna be away for a while.
I'm going scoutin'.
Well, isn't that dangerous in the open country?
Lord, no. I love it...
Especially now that it's spring and everything's so happy.
Why, there's trees out there, big, tall pines...
Just a-reachin' and a-reachin'...
As if they wanted to climb right through the gates of heaven.
And there's brooks, too, with the water smiling all day long.
But the part I like best is the night...
Lying out there beneath a blanket of stars, with that old moon smiling down on you.
And every time you look up, there she is, sort of guarding over you, like a mother minding her young.
Sometimes it's so beautiful that
I just lie there, listening.
Birds singing, brooks laughing, and the wind sort of crooning through the forest.
Like some great organ.
Oh, I've always loved it.
But I reckon I'm gonna be lonely this time.
You know, you can get sort of used to having somebody not like you.
And when they're not around, you miss them not liking you.
That's why I reckon
I'm gonna be lonesome.
But I'll be thinking of you.
Good-bye.
And you just take care you don't lose your scalp!
Zeke, is he leaving the train?
Yes, miss. He's riding out to Pawnee villages.
Well, how far are they?
Oh, nigh on a hundred mile.
Well, isn't that dangerous?
Well, he's likely to lose his scalp afore he gets there.
But once in the villages, he's safe.
So don't you worry about him, miss.
What... Why should
I worry about him?
I don't know, miss.
I don't know.
But seemed like as if maybe you was.
Oh, not at all.
He means nothing to me.
No. No, in course not.
Good night.
Good night, Zeke.
Hey! You got back here at last, eh?
Yeah. There's plenty of buffalo sign out here, so I'll be riding out to pick up fresh meat.
Ah, well, who's keeping you?
I'll see you at the river crossing.
Lopez! Lopez! Thorpe!
Pull up here. Come here.
You two have been waiting for your chance. Here it is.
Go out on a buffalo hunt.
Me? Nah.
I kill hundreds of buffalo.
Why should I go?
Ah! Get them cobwebs out of your brain!
He means, Lopez, we might find better game.
Watch him till he leaves the Pawnees, and then give it to him in the back.
Go on.
Hey, you pilgrims!
Come here! Come here!
Bascom?
Yes!
Bascom!
Yes.
I'll shove the horses and the cattle right on through.
Leave only the wheelers hooked to the wagons.
Once you take to the water...
Well, it's every man and critter for hisself, eh?
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Go on!
Mr. Flack.
Mr. Flack, how can I get my mule Useless across?
Well, uh, get your mother-in-law to ride him, eh?
Mr. Bascom.
Yes?
Mr. Bascom, you know,
I don't like that fella.
No?
He's the kind who will pat you on your back to your face, and then laughs in your face behind your back.
Yeah.
And another thing.
Yes?
If he had a mother-in-law like mine, he would never laugh.
The hunt was a great success.
We bagged our buffalo.
Hey.
Did you get your meat, eh?
Ah, good. Good!
Well, we'd better shove on off then.
Boots off.
I see you took a bath.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Is there... ls there a slug of whiskey?
No, I left my jug... I hid it in the Camerons' wagon.
By the way, where is my little beauty?
Well, she's, uh...
She's somewheres around.
Well, now that you've got her all to yourself, what do you aim to do with her?
I think I'll take her back and settle on my plantation.
Your... Your plantation, eh?
Lopez, he's hollered so much about that there plantation of his, he believes it hisself, eh?
What? The Señor Thorpe, he have no plantation?
Plantation! Ha!
All you got in the world is a dirty deck of cards and a crooked one at that.
Zeke.
Yeah?
Coleman's been gone two days.
Yeah. I've been kinda worried about that myself.
Eagle Tail says last time he seen him, he was headed for the train.
Well, another thing, the
Camerons haven't crossed yet.
No. I better saunter on down there and see what's holdin' 'em, huh?
Yes. We'd better help 'em across.
Yeah. Go on.
Well, I think we can...
We were just wondering what had become of you.
Where's your horse?
He stepped in a prairie-dog hole and broke his neck.
Come near breakin' mine too.
Are you hurt?
No. I was knocked out for a spell.
Here, I'll put these in your wagon and help you across.
Flack said we could only use the wheelers.
Flack said? What does he know about water?
He never took a bath in his life.
Shortie!
There's the Cameron wagon.
I'll go greet the little filly.
Greet, eh?
Well, Lopez and me will go greet a jug.
Whoa!
You take 'em from here on in, Dave.
It's shallow water.
All right, Breck. I'll go back and get my saddle.
All right.
Giddyap!
Come on, Shortie!
Come on!
Come on, Shortie!
Come on! Get up there!
Whoa! Whoa!
I was just coming over to help you.
Thank you.
We had the best of help.
Help? Who?
What's the matter, Lopez?
Seein' a few ghosts?
Me? No, no.
Drive on into the corral, Dave.
All right.
Giddyap! Come on there!
Get up there!
Pull on up!
I'll be seeing you three later about matters and things.
Why, hello, boy.
Howdy, Zeke.
Why, what happened?
Pony stepped in a dog hole.
Yeah? I suppose a prairie dog shot that hole through your saddle and into your horse, eh?
Natchie!
Who was gone from camp, Zeke?
Thorpe and Lopez come in during the night, and early morning, sent a wagon out for the meat.
Well, a nice mess you made of things.
Not at all!
Two hundred yards running is considerable of a handicap.
Besides, other days are coming.
Well, don't you fool yourself.
Here he is, here he is, here he is.
Flack, the Injuns been sending up smoke signals for several days.
Yes, well, I seen 'em.
I'll skirmish around with the
Pawnees for a few miles.
Well, go on. There ain't no one keeping you!
No, but you'd better keep
Thorpe and Lopez here.
Why?
I got a feeling that if either one of 'em leaves camp, they'll never come back.
What do you mean by that?
Just the way it sounded.
Hey, look there.
Look there, eh?
Injuns?
Lopez, fire a long shot at 'em.
No fire!
They're Cheyennes.
They want to palaver.
Ah, they look to me as if they're out for harm.
They will be if we take a shot at 'em.
That'll mean war. I'll go out and palaver with them.
Go on. Go on. Maybe so you no come back, huh?
Look how queerly his horse is acting.
Yeah. He's riding zigzag.
That's Indian sign that he wants to palaver.
There's the chief riding out to meet him now for a powwow.
Zeke! Bascom!
How.
This is Black Elk, an old friend of mine.
Do they mean peace or war?
Peace, if as long as we march straight through the Cheyenne country without stopping to settle.
Now that we're gonna be friends, they'll probably bring their families over here to beg.
So feed 'em well and treat 'em right, and we'll have no trouble.
All right.
All right. Fine.
No more trouble now.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Zeke, what's he saying about me?
He says that Coleman wants you for his squaw.
Yes.
Yes. And he says Flack or Thorpe will get you.
Flack or Thorpe? Why?
Yeah.
Well, Flack's got a lot of horses.
Miss Ruth, you shouldn't be riding out here alone like this away from the train.
Why not?
Because this is dangerous country and anything might happen.
You wouldn't care.
Care? Me?
Why should you care?
Listen, girl, if anything happened to you, it'd be like throwing my heart to the wol...
Oh, what...
Don't worry. It's Black Elk and some of his braves.
Coleman squaw.
Coleman squaw.
Well, he's saying that I'm your squaw.
Seems like that's what he's driving at.
Well, you tell him that you don't want me for your squaw.
I've never told
Black Elk a lie yet.
He knows my tongue is straight.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, it wouldn't be true if I told him I didn't want you.
It happens I do.
And you've no better taste than to tell me that before all these savages?
I'd tell you that in front of the whole world.
This silly joke has gone far enough.
Hey! Well, there's one down anyway.
Well, there's some more out there.
Let's go get 'em.
All right, here we go.
Here she goes!
That's it.
That's it.
Another one.
Get over there. Hey.
Hey, there. Go on.
Yeah. Hope we land in no trouble up ahead.
Help those...
Help them take this stuff, the ones that are going down.
All right.
Hold tight.
All right.
Ah, you should be fine.
Hang on, boy.
You take Honey Girl from here on down, Dave.
It's a little easier going.
Hold on.
All right, Breck.
Careful of her, Davey.
Now, Miss Ruth, you cling on to me.
Put your arms around my neck, Honey Girl.
A little tighter.
Just a little tighter.
Let him down.
Come on, men.
Hurry up
Hang on.
Let's take some in pairs.
Are you all right, Honey Girl?
It was a pretty bad place, wasn't it, Breck?
Yeah, but I sort of liked it.
Davey, let's see if our wagon's down yet.
Come on, Honey Girl.
Thank you, Breck.
Well, well, well, well!
So I've seen that gal with her arms around your neck at last.
Yeah, but she sure unwrapped them when she got on safe footin'.
Yeah.
You know, she don't care nothin' about me, Zeke.
Well, you can never tell how a woman feels by the way she acts.
They's all riddles, all of 'em, and you just gotta guess 'em.
And no matter which way you guess, you're wrong.
Looks like as if the way they're puttin' some of them outfits over there, they're a-gonna lose 'em.
Hold it!
Ha-ha! What did I tell you?
Let's get out of here afore they get a bead on us.
Hold it!
Zeke, did you hear that terrible crash?
Hear it? I seen it.
You did?
That was your wagon!
Oh. Was my mother-in-law in it?
No, she wasn't.
Oh, that's too bad.
What'd you say?
I said, "I am glad."
Lucky for you that I wasn't, you loafing hound.
What you mean?
Because I was with your wife,
Sarah, and she gave birth to twins.
Twins? Are they both mine?
Both.
Oh, Mama, are they boys or girls?
One of each!
Oh, Zeke, I am a papa.
 Mama, I am a papa.
Papa, lam a mama.
Yeah.
I got two for one.
Yeah. Let's drink to the happy event.
Wait a minute. There was two events.
I have two drinks.
Here, give me that jug. I'll take a pull at that myself.
Three more.
Hyah! Giddyap!
Whoa!
Well, who'd have guessed it?
If it ain't Breck Coleman.
Howdy, Jim.
Where'd you blow in from, boy?
All the way from the big river.
Flack.
How long are we gonna camp here?
Well, just as long as it takes to fix up the outfit.
Bascom, you tell them pilgrims of yours, there's 500 miles of desert ahead of us and them that don't like what's comin' to them, now's the time for
'em to turn back.
Yes, sir, that pork is nearly done right now.
Shank me off a snack!
Get out of there.
Fine piece of beef.
Ah!
Fetch it on over here.
I hate to see you at menial tasks.
If we were only back at my old plantation in Louisiana, you'd have a dozen servants to wait on you.
Let's turn back.
Turn back, Mr. Thorpe?
Why... Oh. Why, I...
Oh, Honey Girl, didn't I tell you to stay away from the fire?
Yes. And you told me not to be sitting in a rocking chair when Breck Coleman was around.
Hello, Coleman.
Howdy, Dave.
You shot these turkeys. Won't you stay and help us eat them?
No. Uh, I just had supper with the Bascoms.
Sorry, Breck.
Think I'll go hunt up old Zeke.
How many's that for you, Windy?
Number 84.
Well, here comes 85.
Hello, Zeke. Windy.
Hello, boy.
I smell turkey a-cookin'.
That's all I got was a smell.
Deal me a hand of them flapjacks.
That's the way it's done, Gussie.
My old arm's giving out. Now you try it.
I'll get a pail of water.
That's easy.
I can do that.
See, I've saw Zeke do that till he broke his arm.
Yes. And you know, someday my mother-in-law's gonna talk so much, she's going to break her "yaw."
Say, boy, I wouldn't let my mother-in-law boss me around like that.
Stand up to her like a man.
Face her down, boy.
Huh. If it was me, I'd tell her what was on my chest.
You got nothing on your chest but wind!
You old polecat.
I've just been talking with some trappers who've come out of the Southwest.
They say the country they call California is wonderful.
Yes, so I've heard.
Why won't you come with me to a land like that?
Are you going there?
If you'll come with me.
Well, what about your plantation in Louisiana?
Oh. Well...
If we like
California better, we could sell my holdings and buy vast lands out there.
Well, it's...
It's a compliment to offer me all that, but it can't be.
I must join Davey.
Oh, Dave.
Dave, come over here.
Black Elk here says that you and your sister were so good to him, when he come in to visit that he wants to give you all them ponies.
Well, that's kind of him, Zeke, but we couldn't take their horses.
Oh, of course you could.
They got hundreds of ponies.
He wants you to show him where to put 'em.
You go and throw them ponies in with your herd.
Why, Zeke, you lyin' old coot.
That Injun's buying Cameron's sister for Coleman's squaw.
Well... Well...
Well, why not?
So Coleman's buying himself a squaw, eh?
Zeke, you old whiskered Cupid, you!
I loathe the very sight of you!
What have I done now?
You've made me the joke of the plains.
Me?
Who else tried to buy me like an Indian squaw?
You put me to shame before them all.
Why, girl, you're imagining things.
Oh... Ohh! Ohh!
Zeke always told me women were damned funny.
Mr. Thorpe,
I've changed my mind.
I'll go with you to California if you'll go at once.
At once?
Why, yes, yes.
Uh, I'll make preparations immediately.
This is a fine state of affairs.
This man Thorpe isn't all he claims to be.
My mind is made up, Davey, and we're going to California.
Where's Flack?
Hey!
I just came in to tell you good-bye.
Uh, good-bye?
Where are you going?
I'm going to take my outfit and leave you here.
Uh, your outfit? All you got is one horse and two guns.
No, the Cameron outfit's mine now.
Oh, it is, eh?
Yes, we're going to California, so I'll bid you a fond farewell.
No, you ain't!
No?
Nah!
Why do you suppose
I grubstaked you for, eh?
So far, you've been a fizzle.
One try, one miss.
Oh, he's no longer in my way.
Well, he's in mine.
Well, tear him down yourself.
Oh, I'd like to kick him into pulp.
Oh, I'd like to break him in two like a...
Well, why not?
I don't mind fists or feet, or even a gun.
It's the way he throws that knife.
But why should I risk it?
Because you're a dead shot.
You're a-going to stick.
You're a-going to prove how good you are, before you leave the fort.
And if I don't?
Well, if you don't...
I'll tell that little filly there's a wide-open noose waitin' for you in every river town.
Thorpe, you do your job before you leave the fort.
Howdy, Henry.
How's things, Coleman?
Just fine.
Say,
Black Elk was telling me that all the Injuns in the West was gathering to keep you all from passin' through.
So they tell me.
Black Elk and the Cheyennes are going west to hold a powwow with the Shoshones.
Yeah, Black Elk tells me that it's almost certain that the Cheyennes will declare war later.
Likely.
Old Pete Rubideaux was asking about you a while ago.
Pete? Where is he?
Camped at the spring yonder with his new squaw.
I think I'll ramble down and see him.
Sure.
Say, Henry, will you put a new cap nipple on this gun?
Sure will, boy.
And a new trigger spring in the pistol.
All right.
I'll leave 'em with you while I go see Pete.
Be ready when you come back.
We are about to unite this loving and devoted couple in the holy bonds of wedlock.
Hank Ginnis, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
Abigail Vance, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
She does!
Hey, Flack.
Yeah?
You recollect how Coleman done told you that if Lopez here, or Thorpe done strayed off into the brush, they weren't likely as how never come back?
Sure!
He made some kind of a bluff.
What of it?
Well, uh,
Thorpe strayed out and he ain't a-never comin' back.
Hey?
No.
He's done gone back to his old plantation.
Yeah.
Well, you won't go to
California with Thorpe now.
Why not?
He and Coleman just met in the brush, and Coleman shot him.
Are you sure?
I heard the shot.
And I saw Coleman standing there over him.
It suits me too.
So he'll even do murder.
And so I pronounce you man and wife.
And may peace and happiness be yours.
There's been a murder!
There's been a murder!
A murder? Where?
Where, girl? Who?
Coleman met Mr. Thorpe in the brush and shot him!
That's a serious accusation, my girl.
Are you sure?
My brother saw it.
Men, we can't have cold-blooded murderers among us.
There's the man that shot Bill Thorpe down like a dog.
Lopez, go and get a rope.
Get a rope.
Yeah, get the rope!
And just who accuses me of killing Thorpe?
It, uh...
It was Miss Cameron.
Huh.
You, eh?
So you'd like to see me hang.
Listen to me, you.
This boy, Coleman, here just couldn't have killed Thorpe.
Why not?
'Cause he didn't have no guns on him.
He left his'n with
Dutch Henry to be fixed.
Coleman and Thorpe were at odds with the Cameron girl.
If it wasn't Coleman, who was it who shot Thorpe?
Since you're aimin' to know,
I'll tell you who done it.
Who?
I shot that skunk myself!
Coleman's a friend of his, men.
He's lying to save his neck.
What could Zeke have against a man like Thorpe?
You want to know that too?
Yes, I want to know that too!
Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.
I was camped out pretty close to you, and I heared that powwow you had with Thorpe.
Yeah? What are you driving at?
Just this.
When a man begins to do a lot of talkin' about hangin', he'd better make pretty sure as to who's gonna decorate the end of the rope.
Get my meaning?
Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me.
It's no affair of mine.
That's just what
I was a-thinkin'.
Huh.
And Coleman ain't gonna do no scouting, while I'm boss of this train.
I'm leaving him behind.
Coleman would never...
Ah, now, we're taking on a new scout.
Guess again, Flack.
I started with this outfit, and
I'll be with it at the finish.
Who says so?
I'm just telling ya.
I got two reasons.
One is I told Wellmore
I'd scout the train through.
The other is a little personal business I aim to transact at the end of the trail.
See if you can figure out what that is, Flack.
Coleman, the settlers are willing to push on.
We'll follow you.
What's this talk about Injuns?
It's true.
The Injuns are gathering to the westward to stop us from going through.
Injuns have never yet prevented our breed of men from travelin' into the settin' sun.
Go on. Lead the way.
Well, get your outfits together.
We're going.
Never mind what you see or what you hear.
Red Flack is still boss of the train.
Get her going!
Go on.
Let's pull out and follow!
Giddyap!
Hup!
Ho!
Fall in!
Nag, giddyap!
Get in!
It's no use, men.
She's all dried up.
Hey, them settlers is dyin' off like rats.
We're for moving on.
Come on, Lopez.
Boy, they're scattered back all across the desert.
We gotta gather 'em up and shove 'em along.
Old Charlie died, Coleman.
We raised him from a colt.
Tough, boy.
But we gotta battle it through.
Hyah!
Giddyap!
Giddyap, Toby!
Giddyap, Toby! Giddyap!
Giddyap there!
Giddyap, Toby!
Come on!
Come on!
Work 'em on through!
Whoa!
What's all this?
Injun signs!
Pull up! Pull up!
Pull up!
Pull up there!
Pull over!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Here's your gun, boy!
All right.
Get up there.
Come on! Come on!
Get in here! Hurry up!
Don't panic!
Looks like
Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke.
Yeah.
Now let's throw it into 'em!
Stop shootin', everybody!
Stop shootin'!
They're ridin' off.
When they wheel back on us, reload it up and give it to 'em!
Yes, sir!
There they go, boy.
There they go.
Ha! I guess we was just a little too much for 'em.
Father, our good friends have perished here at the hands of the savages.
Open your arms to them and care for our loved ones until we meet again on the other shore.
Amen.
Well, Zeke...
Ol' Windy's gone on another trail.
Windy, you and me was...
Well, you and me was, uh...
Oh, my baby!
My baby! Oh, no!
My baby!
Well, Zeke, I'm gonna trail the Injuns and make sure they go back to their villages.
So you scout the train ahead, and I'll pick it up in a week or so.
Bye, Zeke.
Bye, boy.
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap!
Get over there!
Giddyap, there!
Come on, boys.
Get a hold of that wheel!
Tough time!
Lopez! Lopez, get 'em in line!
Hey, sí!
Put the whip to them!
Hey!
Pull the trailers!
Giddyap there!
Get on Up!
Work 'em over!
Go on!
Get outta there!
Come on, Bob!
Get 'em movin' to the right!
Get over there!
Hey! Get over there!
Giddyap, boy!
Come on. Come on.
Giddyap. Giddyap.
There we go!
I wonder how long we'll be bogged down here.
I don't know. I heard there was three wagons already turned back.
Ma, let's turn back to Missouri!
Me? Turn back because of a little mud?
Say, Uncle, when did
Bascom women ever turn back?
Grandma, don't you and Ma know that Pa is only jokin'?
Ha! All right now.
Be powerful on it now.
Hyah! Hyah!
Go on there, Fanny!
Go on, Meg!
Go on there, Jennie!
Jennie, go on! Go on, go on!
Oh, we're stuck.
Gus, you idiot!
You see what you've done?
You've got my wagon up to the hub in mud!
What are you kickin' about?
I am sitting on my mule.
Oh!
But don't worry, Mama.
I think it's gonna clear up.
There will be no more rain.
Get up! Get up!
Throw that idiot...
Throw that idiot a rope and help him out of there.
Keep in line!
Get up here!
Take the settlers to the right!
Get over here!
Get up in there!
Come over here and hold on.
Giddyap there!
Keep it in line!
Get over there!
Get over there!
Come on, boy!
Giddyap there!
Keep it going!
Come on there!
Keep it going!
Here, Abbie.
Here's the water.
Mama,
I got good news for you.
Ah, you're always bad news to me.
Get on your long underwear quick.
Why?
Well, you're going in the snow up to your... Up to your... Your...
Way up, Mama. And hand me out my bear overcoat.
Well, Useless...
You're going someplace you won't want to sit down.
It's so cold, it'll freeze your hooves off.
You wait and see.
Think I'll go say howdy to the Camerons.
This is my best overcoat.
Well, I'd hate to see your worst one.
Hello, Gus.
Oh, hello there, Breck.
I'm certainly glad to see you back again.
What are you wearing the heavy overcoat for?
I'm getting all ready for that snow.
No, we won't be there for days.
Well, anyway, I'm going to keep warm by the camp.
Where's the Cameron outfit?
Oh, we left them four or five days back.
Left 'em?
Yes. All their horses give out. They couldn't go on.
Fifteen, 20 wagons. They all went back to the fort.
I hated to tell ya, son.
Zeke, why did you let the Camerons go?
Ah, not my doin', son.
Flack knows
I savvy Injun sign, so he sends me on ahead to scout.
And when I come back, they'd all dropped out.
If Injuns chance on those wagons, they'll kill the lot of 'em.
I'm afeard so, Breck boy.
The Way's clear ahead, Zeke.
You scout 'em.
Yeah.
I'm going back for the Camerons.
Good luck, son!
Giddyap, Jennie!
Well, Useless...
Giddyap, Jennie!
I don't know who smells the worse, you or me.
Go ahead there!
Come on. Here we go again.
Pull, Fanny!
Hello! Hello!
Huh!
I felt someway that you'd come.
I'd have been here a heap sooner if I could've.
Say, Dave, you'd better out off that trailer and throw everything into one wagon.
All right.
I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody and we'll see if we can get out of here.
After you left, old Zeke told me the truth about some matters.
Thorpe and Flack and all.
He did, eh?
Sorry I was so stupid.
Oh, don't worry, Miss Ruth.
Things did look sort of queer.
I should have known better.
Well, we all get off on the wrong trail once in a while.
We'll make it through all right.
Well, that's fixed.
Can I do something, Breck?
No, I guess not.
We oughta overtake those settlers in a week or so.
Here you are, Ruthie.
Take it.
We're goin' again, Davey.
Heave-ho.
Pull 'er there. Come on.
Come on there, Shortie.
What did I tell you, huh?
You wouldn't listen to me.
You wouldn't listen to me!
We're lost!
There ain't a man here that knows the pass over them hills!
We're for turning back!
Wait! Wait!
Follow me and I'll lead you to that valley that Coleman told us about.
Coleman, huh? He's the only one that knows the way out, and he's deserted us!
Sure, he quit!
If he was here, I'd shoot him down in his tracks.
Well, Flack, just when you gonna start this shootin'?
You're just in time, Coleman.
Did you find the Camerons?
They're over yonder.
What's the trouble here?
They're all against me.
They're turning back.
No, you're not!
We can't turn back.
We're blazing a trail that started in England.
Not even storms of the sea could turn back those first settlers.
And they carried it on further.
They blazed it on through the wilderness of Kentucky.
Famine, hunger, not even massacres could stop them.
And now we've picked up the trail again, and nothing can stop us!
Not even the snows of winter nor the peaks of the highest mountains.
We're building a nation!
So we've got to suffer.
No great trail was ever blazed without hardship.
And you've gotta fight!
That's life.
And when you stop fightin', that's death.
What are you gonna do, lie down and die?
No!
No!
Not in a thousand years.
You're going on with me!
The word is said, and we'll follow you.
Be ready to start at sunup!
Well... Well, he's turned up again.
Yeah, well, he'll down the both of us.
You've got to get him tonight.
But they can hear a shot at night.
Well, they can't hear a knife.
They all know this knife of mine.
Well, here's a knife they don't know.
No, no, no, no.
I afraid of that knife.
I know where you got it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh!
It will get us in trouble sure.
How?
Because a dead man's knife is bad medicine!
Here, just stop that drivel.
No.
Take the knife and wait for tonight.
There he goes.
Wait until he's bedded down, and then...
Give me a drink.
God bless my sister Ruth and my brother Dave, and make me a good girl, and take care of us.
Aren't you going to ask God to take care of Breck Coleman?
Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself.
You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez!
Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife.
Well, where'd you find it, boy?
Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.
Their having it makes it certain that Flack and Lopez did it.
No question about it, boy.
What did they do, Coleman?
Killed my best friend.
I been on their trail ever since.
That's a serious charge.
If you're sure, we'll call a settlers' meeting in the morning to try 'em.
You can call a settlers' meeting to bury 'em.
What do you mean?
That I kill my own rats!
They've jumped camp,
Zeke, and I'm off on their trail.
Breck, you can't leave us here!
You got to see us through.
He's right, boy.
Maybe so, the way you all look at it.
But those two men killed a man in cold blood, and they've got to pay.
It's not that I've got hatred in my heart, but that I'm the law out here, that's all.
And the law is justice.
Well, Zeke, I'll see 'em to the end of the trail.
But then I'm picking up a new trail here.
Get over! Get over!
Get over here!
Hah! Get over! Hah!
Get over!
Whoa, hah! Whoa, hah!
Whoa, hah!
Get over! Pull!
Yonder stands the great white mountain.
And down below lies the valley I've told you about.
Coleman, you have fulfilled our hopes.
Neighbors!
Friends!
It is fitting that we give thanks to the Almighty.
Our Father, we thank thee for leading us to this land of promise, for guiding our footsteps safely through the dangers of our pilgrimage.
In this valley of our dreams, we'll build our homes and serve thee, O Father.
And our children's children shall praise thy name.
Amen.
The way is clear ahead.
All gentle slopes.
So drive down, my friends, and settle it.
Lead the way.
Zeke will lead the way down.
Our trails fork here.
You mean you are leaving us?
There's a trail I've followed for over 3,000 miles now, and I'm headin' back to pick it up again and follow it to the end.
Coleman, you're the breed of man that would follow a trail to the end.
Thanks, Bascom.
Friends, we'll go on.
Boy, there's two of 'em.
Bad ones.
Now, I'm going with you.
No, Zeke.
You stay here and look after
Ruth and her outfit.
Breck, you're not leaving.
Yes, Miss Ruth.
I'm pullin' out.
They say you're going to hunt down Flack and Lopez.
That's what I aim to do.
But you can't do this awful thing...
Take two lives!
It's frontier justice.
Don't go, Breck.
Don't go!
It's a job
I've got to finish.
But don't you see?
It doesn't matter about them.
I'm afraid for you.
They'll kill you!
You're everything in the world to me, Breck.
I can't let you go!
I can't!
The thing has to be done.
Someday...
Somewhere...
Our trails will cross again.
Now, now.
Come, come, miss.
You mustn't be a-carryin' on thataway.
He's gone.
He'll never come back.
Now, now, you just mustn't do this, miss.
You'll have me a-blubberin' here pretty soon.
I'm a-tellin' ya that everything is going to be all right.
When spring comes in that valley, he'll be tracking back again.
I know that boy.
I know him.
Now, come, come.
Come on, Ruth.
Come on.
My legs are froze to the knees.
I can't get up.
Yes, looks as if you're done for, Lopez.
But, Flack, don't go away and leave me, Flack.
What? Do you think
I'm staying here?
Well, then leave me a blanket!
I'm frozen.
Ah, won't do you no good.
You'll be froze to death in an hour.
Flack!
It may help me.
Now get away.
Flack! Flack!
Flack, don't let me die alone!
Stay with me! Flack!
Flack!
Well, Lopez.
It won't be long before you have company.
Flack!
Yeah, Milt.
I got a hankerin' to trail on down into Mexico.
Old Bill Gillie done told me that them there black-eyed gals is just full of fire.
Zeke?
Yeah?
Zeke, you're not really leaving us?
Yeah, gal, I'm a-pullin' out. You is all nice and settled now.
And this here valley is gettin' altogether too civilized for me.
Whenever I get more than three or four families within a hundred mile of me,
I begin to feel kind of crowded.
That's not why you're going, Zeke.
No? Why else, gal?
Breck has never come back. You're going out to look for him.
Now, wherever that boy
Breck Coleman is at, he's a-lookin' out for hisself.
Now don't you fret about him.
Did you give away all your little puppies?
Why are you looking at that dress?
This is the anniversary of the...
The day that the wagon train left from Missouri.
Last time I had this on,
I was sitting in the Riggses' cabin.
In a rocking chair?
Yes, Honey Girl.
In a rocking chair.
Zeke, I reckon that's a panther.
Yeah!
It's a two-legged panther.
The only kind whatever gimme that Comanche yell as a signal.
We might just as well start to unpack.
What, ain't you going?
No use of going now.
He's only a bit up in the timber there, and he's a-headed this way.
Zeke, won't you stay over for the anniversary?
Yes, gal, I'll stay.
Aw!
And I just recollected, I got a little present for you.
Oh, Zeke, what is it?
Well, a young fella named Breck
Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up.
Where is it, Zeke?
I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.
You'll find it there.
Thanks, Zeke.
I'll go get it.
English - US - SDH
Carl Denham.
Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson!
Get out! I'll have you arrested.
That's my business...
Pretending to be the gas man.
- I'm supposed to...
- The very idea.
All right, Mr. Denham. It's only me.
I am sorry, Mr. Denham. He said he was the gas man. Had a card and everything.
Listen, Mrs. Hudson, as long as I am rooming in your house... if your own father comes to the door, don't you believe a word he says.
It's a pity the people in New York don't try and catch a few gunmen... instead of hunting a nice gentleman like you.
Is Mrs. Hudson there?
Oh, ho. That's the lady in the front room.
- Oh.
- Coming.
I'm from the news.
Is that so? Well, I've got news for you:
You're going to get out of this room so fast...
- No, I'm not.
- Ladies, no riots, please.
If people don't stop getting into my house under false pretenses...
I just want a story.
If I go back without it, I'll lose my job.
- Don't bother to pull that old line.
- You're big news, you know.
What, after a whole month?
That's time enough for New York to forget the World War.
The War was a long way off, but King Kong, the giant ape...
- ...was right here on the spot.
- So I've heard.
And you're the man that brought him here.
Kong is dead. But everybody's interested in you, too, Mr. Denham.
All those people that Kong killed and injured... all the property owners who are suing you for damages, and...
And the theater owners, and the men who put money in advanced publicity, and...
Say, are you telling me?
Why don't you let him alone? He hasn't dared leave the house for a week.
That's what I want, the personal reaction story.
You want to know what the captor of the late Kong...
- ...thinks about, eh?
- Yes.
I thought I had him safe.
Don't you suppose I'm sorry for the harm he did?
I wish I'd left him on his island.
Old Kong, I'm sure paying for what I did to you.
Mrs. Hudson, suppose we look out and count the gentlemen in disguise... who are waiting for me?
If I don't get out of this house pretty soon, I'll choke.
Hey!
Aren't you going to give me a story?
All right, tell my public that Carl Denham, the bright boy... who was going to make a million dollars out of King Kong, is flat broke.
Everybody in New York is suing me for something.
The only place I haven't heard from is the Bide-A-Wee home.
But, Mr. Denham, my readers want to know...
There's a newsboy and a peddler and a taxi driver out there.
I'll bet you a nickel they're all process servers.
- There's a man coming up the steps.
- Huh?
Why, it's Charlie. Let him in.
- Hello, Charlie, what do you want?
- Captain Englehorn send you this.
- Where'd you come from?
- All time, stay on ship.
- Cook for Skipper. Easy job.
- Mm.
Tell the Skipper I'll be over at the ship as soon as I can get out of here.
- What's matter? You scared to come out now?
- You said it. Much obliged, Charlie.
- Maybe you can get out through the basement.
- Come on. Let's try it.
Rags.
Bottles, rags.
You've got a nerve.
I got everything, lady.
And I buy everything.
Rags, bones.
Say, you fresh guy!
Mrs. Hudson.
Mr. Carl Denham.
Well, I'll be. Hello, Mickey.
- Hello.
- Have a heart, will you?
That's 15 of those things you've slipped me.
- I'm the best in the business, Mr. Denham.
- Well, what is it this time?
Steiner and Wayne.
Destruction of property by Kong on 39th street.
Shock, mental anguish, and sprained ankle to owner of said property.
If I don't get out of this house,
I'll bite somebody.
Listen, Mickey, I've got a date.
You've done your job.
How about helping me out-smart those other guys?
Mr. Denham, I'll give you a ride on my junk wagon.
You... Ha, ha. You mean to say you've got a wagon to go with that makeup?
Mr. Denham, I'm an artist.
Hey.
How did you get in there?
You can go from the roof to chimney.
Anthony St. Nick and Santa Claus.
Ooh. Commence.
Rags.
Bottles. Bones.
Rags. Hey, you can take off the tin hat.
You're safe now.
Where are you going, Mr. Denham?
Drop me at the nearest subway station, James.
You know, it's funny how anybody's troubles are somebody's gain.
I've been working steady since you got in this jam.
You've no idea how that cheers me up.
The boy who was going to make a million dollars.
Rags!
So that's the mess I'm in, Skipper.
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.
I guess next time you leave big monkey alone, huh?
Next time? Ha, ha.
Charlie must think Kongs are plentiful.
Well, Denham, now I'll tell you why I wanted to see you.
- I've got a plan for both of us-
- What is it?
Going to get a couple of megaphones and run sightseeing trips around the harbor?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Mr. Denham, I...
Mickey.
- One more summons and I'll brain you.
- No, wait, Mr. Denham.
I ain't got no summons. Honest. I ain't.
I come to tip you off.
- Did you follow me over here?
- No, I live over here.
My father-in-law said he saw you come in by the gates.
I feel very friendly to you, Mr. Denham.
You've kept me working pretty steady lately.
Yeah, sure, I know, I've been a big help.
Now, what's on your mind?
I heard this afternoon you're going to be indicted.
- What?
- Indicted.
- The grand jury's going to indict you.
- Let me out of this. I'm going crazy.
You take my tip and get out.
Summons is one thing and grand jury is something else already.
- They are going to put you on the stand.
- Stop it! All right, Mickey, much obliged.
- Now beat it, will you?
- All right. Such a fine customer.
Oh, Denham?
- Denham, I...
- What good is the grand jury?
What can they find out?
I brought Kong back here, he got loose, did a lot of damage... got killed, and that's that.
- What can I do about it?
- We can go to jail for 10 years.
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm in it, too, up to my neck.
Now, see here. This ship's still mine.
There are no attachments on her yet.
- They just haven't got around to you.
- That's a good reason for hurrying.
In three hours, I can get together a skeleton crew, enough to handle her.
Yeah, and we'll go yachting.
We can make some sort of a living carrying freight.
Take the East Indies.
There are hundreds of little ports there that no sizable ship ever goes to.
- I know that part of the world.
- What'll we use for money?
Well, I... I've saved up a little.
Enough to get us started.
- Yes, but...
- Come on, Denham.
You know, Skipper... you're pretty swell to be willing to take me with you.
- Is it a go, then?
- What?
To be off on this old ship again, out of all this?
Say, you bet it's a go.
Well, this looks like a hustling community, Skipper.
Suppose we can get any business here?
Better get some soon, or we won't be able to pay the crew.
Say, uh, how far is it to Kong's island?
1,753 miles.
Well, you're pretty glib with that.
You must have been checking up.
Huh? Oh.
I just happened to come across our old chart last night... and I was curious.
Yeah, sure.
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir.
Get that number two hatch off and break out the cargo.
That won't take very long.
If we weren't so short-handed,
I'd get rid of that man.
He's a troublemaker.
Of course, Wong Ho would have to ship his copra last week.
Well, let's see.
There's a couple of half-caste traders here.
We might see them tomorrow...
- ...and get a bit of a cargo.
- Look, Skipper. There's a show in town.
- I'll bet it's terrible.
- Don't be a crab, Skipper. It's a show.
We ought to see it.
- I want a drink and some dinner.
- There's plenty of time for that.
You don't mean to say you're going to miss the sagacious seals?
Don't you want to laugh and thrill with La Belle Helene?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Come, Bobby. Come, George.
Come, Fattima. In with you.
And now, La Belle Helene!
Sweet songstress who has appeared before all the crowned heads of Europe... will conclude the performance... with one of her most popular songs.
La Belle Helene!
Oh, I've got the runaway blues
I want to wander away
Oh, I've got the runaway blues today
Don't want to stay
I know that trains are going somewhere
And steamers are sailing the blue
They go, but baby, what do I care?
'Cause none of them's going to you
Poor kid.
- You know, she's got something.
- It certainly isn't the voice.
Voice, who cares? She's got personality.
Somebody'd show her what to do with it.
I hear the steamer whistle crying
Whoo, whoo
It's just an echo when I'm sighing
Whoo, whoo
You ran away and never told me
What for, what for
And now your arms will never hold me
No more, no more
I don't want the train on the track
Don't want the ship on the sea
Why? 'Cause they ain't bringing you back to me
Poor me
Thank you for your kind reception of our efforts.
And remember, another big show here tomorrow night.
Well, if that's your idea of a pleasant evening, I...
It's interesting, Skipper.
I'll bet you could take a kid like that... and put her over to the producer of a musical comedy.
- But not to the captain of a freighter.
- Ha, ha.
Father, is that man coming again tonight?
Yes, he is. Any objection?
Can't I have a friend drop in?
- He isn't a friend.
- Well, he's a white man...
- ...somebody to talk to.
- Somebody to drink with.
That's enough. Shut up now and go to bed.
You can't get away from here. No money.
How you think you can get away from here? Huh?
Your Dutchman will be here in a couple of days, won't he?
Dutch magistrate? Ha!
What do you think he'll do for you?
He don't care what happens to you and your rotten little show.
Not a rotten show.
I was ringmaster in the biggest circus.
Used to play Colombo, Singapore.
Sure, and you was rotten.
Who're you calling... Who are you?
- Rotten captain!
- You lay off me.
Rotten captain, lost ship.
Lost it on purpose, eh?
Tried to get the insurance...
- ...didn't you?
- Shut up.
Poor captain.
Lost ship, lost job.
Lost certificate.
Ah, dry up, you old tramp.
You're a tramp.
No certificate, no job.
You're no better than me.
And you just lay off my liquor, will you?
Give it back.
Father! Father!
Father!
Father, Father, tell me what happened.
Who did it?
Tony.
Tony, come down.
Tony.
Tony, please, come down.
Tony.
Tony.
- Tony.
- You'll never catch a monkey that way.
- Did you ever catch a monkey?
- Did I ever...? Ha, ha.
Lady, you'd be surprised.
They won't come back.
Oh, well, why should they?
Oh, uh...
I saw your show last night.
How'd the monkeys get away?
I had to let them out.
The tent burned.
Where's the man who owns the show?
He's my father.
He was hurt.
He's dead.
Well, what a tough break.
I'm sorry, kid.
My father used to be with World Wide.
- That's the biggest circus in the East.
- Yes, I know. What did you do?
I was in the ballet.
I wasn't very good.
What happened to World Wide?
Well, my father... Well, he sort of drank.
You know.
And...
They didn't want him anymore.
- So he started his own show.
- Yes.
Well, we just had a few monkeys.
It wasn't very good.
Say, that's no way to talk.
"I wasn't very good, the show wasn't very good."
Cut it out! You want to tell everybody how good you are.
Throw out your chest. Brag about yourself.
Oh.
So you're in the show business too.
No, I'm in the shipping business.
- I just put in with the cargo.
- Oh.
I thought maybe you had a show, and I could...
No, I'm sorry.
Well, I've got a date.
Are you going to be all right?
I mean, have you got any money?
Yes.
Well, keep your chin up.
I'll be seeing you.
Miss, I heard about your father.
- If I could do anything...
- You've done enough.
You killed my father.
Killed? Why, what...?
The tent caught fire.
My father was beaten over the head.
He wasn't burned.
What do you think the magistrate will say to that when he gets here?
You can't accuse me.
- You wasn't there.
- How do you know I wasn't?
Unless you were.
How do you know what my father said to me before he...?
Before he died?
He... What did he say?
The magistrate will be here in a few days.
I'll tell him.
You better be careful.
What are you going to tell the magistrate?
You can just wonder about that till he gets here.
- There isn't a pound of cargo for us here.
- What'll we do now?
Might pick up some business in the Banda group.
It's a dull life, Skipper.
We need excitement.
Carl Denham.
Don't you remember me?
- Nils Helstrom.
- Well, for the love of Mike. Helstrom.
Sure, I remember you.
This is Captain Englehorn.
Captain Helstrom. Sit down.
Say, do you know who this is?
The man who gave me the map of Kong's island.
And he wants to know if I remember him. Ha-ha-ha!
Have a drink.
So, that was your ship came in last night?
Mine and Denham's.
I heard about you in Singapore.
How you'd captured the biggest animal on earth and taken him back to New York.
Agh.
I'm down, Denham.
- Don't you think you owe me something?
- Ha, ha.
Well, sir, you certainly came to the right man.
- How about a 50-50 split?
- You mean that?
Sure, I mean it. I'll give you half of everything I made out of King Kong.
- How much would that come to?
- Well, let's see, 10... no, 11 lawsuits and the privilege of being indicted by the grand jury too.
- Ah. Then you're broke too?
- Broke? I'm shattered.
Well, then how about giving me passage on your ship?
- I want to get away from here.
- Where's your own ship?
I lost her on the Banka reefs.
- Tough luck. No job since?
- Everyone is down on me.
It wasn't my fault.
You know what those waters are like.
Will you take me to some port that isn't Dutch?
- What's the matter with the Dutch?
- I tell you, they're down on me.
I want to make a fresh start.
You realize how far we'd have to go to land you out of Dutch, uh... jurisdiction?
We can't run all over the Indian Ocean carrying one passenger.
Sorry, old man. Have another drink.
But, Denham, when you got Kong off that island... didn't you get the treasure?
- What?
- Didn't you find the treasure?
Find it?
Why, I never even heard of it.
- Say, are you kidding me?
- Why should I?
To tell the truth, I had an idea
I'd go and look for it myself someday.
You held out on me, eh?
How much do you know about this treasure?
Well, not a lot.
Dying native I picked up at sea...
You drew the map from his description, and he told you about the great wall.
Yeah, he talked about the treasure of the island.
Who put it there?
Why, the people who built the wall.
Yes, that might be.
Skipper, do you remember I said there wasn't a reason... on Earth for going back?
Look. The answer to a prayer.
We're off again.
Hello. I heard you were stopping here.
Felt a little worried about you.
Thought I'd better see you before I go.
- Are you going?
- Yes. Off tonight in a big rush.
- On your ship?
- Yeah, sure.
There isn't any other way to get out of this place, is there?
Oh, uh, here, you take this.
- Can't I go too?
- What?
- Let me go on your ship.
- Nix, kid, nix.
We're going on a long voyage.
We won't be putting in at any port where we could leave you.
Don't leave me. Please, take me with you.
I won't be any trouble.
I'll just sit on the ship.
I won't talk or anything.
Listen, kid, I can't. Honest.
Now, you take this money and buy yourself a passage on the next ship... that's going where you want to go.
- Go on, take it.
- Let me go with you.
Please. Please.
No, no, no, nothing doing.
Now, you take it. Sorry it isn't more, but that's the best I can do.
There'll be a schooner or something along pretty soon.
I can't take you, kid. You'll be okay.
You just make a plan and stick to it.
- All right.
- That's a good girl.
It's a pretty tough life, isn't it?
Well...
Good luck.
- Weather's made-to-order, Skipper.
- I hope it holds.
The next land we sight will be Kong's island.
Yeah.
That fellow Helstrom is getting too chummy with the crew.
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you call him down for it?
What's your opinion of Helstrom?
Well, he got in some trouble over losing his ship, I guess.
That's pretty plain.
He certainly was anxious to leave Dakang.
And he isn't at all anxious to get to Kong's island.
Have you noticed him when we talked about the time we were there?
- Think he's scared?
- Scared green.
Green now and yellow later on, eh?
- Does he expect us to go ashore?
- Why, sure.
He's got to have a bodyguard, hasn't he?
Say... do you know there was a dozen sailors killed on the last voyage he made here?
- Killed? By them animals?
- Yeah.
But, you see, Denham and the skipper came out all right.
But you don't have to worry.
There's plenty of rifles aboard.
If I was captain, I certainly wouldn't take my crew into danger.
- Hey!
- What?
Wha...?
Hey, Bill.
Where?
Hey, Connelly.
If you want me to, I'll give Helstrom a tip that he's too thick with the crew.
Go ahead. Bad for discipline.
We must be in Russia. Here comes the Committee of the Workers.
- Captain Englehorn.
- Well?
- Captain, I went down in forward hold.
- Well, what of it?
- Captain, I found something.
- What's the matter? Found what?
Holy mackerel.
- I just didn't have anywhere to go.
- All right, go back to your work.
This young lady a friend of yours,
Mr. Denham?
No. Well... yes. I met her, that is,
I talked with her in Dakang.
Look here, this isn't my fault.
I told her she couldn't come.
Well...
We can't take her back. Mr. Helstrom.
You ought to be beaten to a pulp.
You called me?
Yes, we have a passenger, and she...
You. How did you get here?
This is our partner.
I know him.
You do?
Yes, of course, you couldn't help seeing each other in Dakang, could you?
Well, here we are.
Just one big, happy family.
You take the words right out of my mouth.
You keep your mouth shut.
You promise me to keep quiet.
I won't promise.
You crazy brat. Denham's sore at you anyway for being here.
You try to make trouble between us, and he'll be off you for life.
Skipper's looking for you.
Say, I don't know what's the matter with you and Helstrom... but we're all cooped up together on this ship.
I didn't ask you to come.
You're here on your own hook.
No matter who you like or dislike... you've got to behave and be pleasant.
Understand?
Are you mad at me?
Not very.
It's, uh... This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
Mr. Denham.
- Mr. Denham.
- Yeah?
Skipper says get dressed and come on deck.
Okay. What is it?
Have we sighted the island?
Yes, sir, about two miles off.
- Say, it's a thrill coming back here.
- Yes, sir.
You had a pretty bad time when you were here before, didn't you?
Yeah, it's a pretty tough spot.
The natives will be glad to see us.
We did them a good turn once, and I...
What the...?
I'm warning you all.
You're crazy to do a thing like this.
We're not crazy enough to go to that island.
- What is it, Skipper? Is this on the level?
- It's real enough.
- Where's Helstrom? They get him too?
- All right.
Over that side to the lifeboat.
All of you.
So this is why you've been spending so much time in the foxhole.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We know what we're doing.
Come on, get over the side.
You can row yourselves to your blasted island and stay there.
Yes, and if those animals kill anybody, it won't be us.
Yes. Get going.
Because you pay us your dirty money, you think you own us.
You sweat and drive us, but you don't give us a living wage for our blood and sweat.
- When did you do all this sweating?
- You think you own us, body and soul.
- Oh, listen to reason.
- We've listened enough.
We've got the ship and we're going to keep it.
- Over the side.
- You're not going to shove this kid off too.
She followed you aboard the ship, she can follow you off.
Do you think I want to stay? I know.
Here's your chance to get rid of me.
- He killed my father.
- What?
He was a drunken old tramp.
I didn't kill him.
I know you did.
He said you'd be angry if I tried to make trouble.
Well, what a fine partner you've turned out to be.
Aw, pipe down. Get going.
Of course, you know what this will mean when you get caught.
Listen, I'll call the whole thing off now.
We'll turn back.
Sure, and be arrested for mutiny as soon as we reach port.
I'll give you my word I won't report you.
It's too late for that kind of talk.
We'll stick by what we've done.
Over the side and see how you like it.
I'll be seeing you again, I hope.
What do you think the chances are?
- Charlie, they throw you off too?
- No throw off. Get off.
Me no like them men.
- Cast off.
- Wait.
Aren't you going to give us any guns?
We've given you food and water.
You're lucky to get that.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Good boy, Charlie.
You cook now, you die pretty soon.
Row, you blasted bourgeois.
You got a nice day for it.
Now, then, go to your places.
Stokers below.
Bosun.
- Get that ladder up.
- What was that?
I said, get the ladder up.
Oh! And I promote you.
- You'll be mate now.
- That's fine. Who's gonna be captain?
I'm taking command, of course.
Clear the decks. Get back to work.
Do you think that we got rid of a good captain... so we could have a bad one?
We're through with captains on this ship.
He wants to be boss.
Let him go with the rest of the bosses.
Yo-ho!
Ha!
That's where all captains belong, over the side.
Bon voygee, Captain Helstrom.
Something tells me we've got a passenger.
Well...
How nice to see you again, under the circumstances.
Skipper, have we got to save him?
Hey, Skipper, when the natives see us,
I bet they'll throw a party.
Well, maybe not a party.
It's the chief.
Hey, did you throw that, you rat?
He says yes, he did, because his village is destroyed... and his people are killed, and it's all our fault for leading Kong inside the wall.
Well, tell him not to attack us.
Tell him we overcame Kong... and we're still big mates.
Come on, Charlie, shove off.
We've got to find another place to land.
What's the good of this?
There's no way out.
Well, it's the only place we've seen where we could get a foot ashore.
Maybe we can climb up someplace.
You stick with me, kid.
A fly couldn't climb out of here.
Yeah, here's a way out.
Wait till I take a look.
- Uh, captain, I...
- Huh?
- About that mutiny, I...
- The less said, the better, Helstrom.
We're all in a tight place together, and I don't think you'll let us down.
No, no, of course not.
Of course not.
- I didn't know that you came.
- You said stick to you.
Do you obey orders?
Why doesn't Denham come back?
We'd better go look for him.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Ha!
Look!
Well, if it isn't the little Kong.
He's stuck in the quicksand.
He can't get out.
I never knew that old Kong had a son.
Don't you think we ought to help him?
Well, how?
If we could get logs and things to him, maybe he could get out.
- Aren't you afraid of him?
- Yes, sort of.
Well...
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for him.
So am I. But I've got a reason.
Animals always know when you're trying to help them.
I don't believe he'd hurt us if he got out.
I suppose we're both crazy, but let's try.
Look out, Skipper, that's quicksand.
Skipper, there's a...
Skipper, believe it or not, there's a little Kong.
What? A little...
- How little?
- Well, just a little one.
- About 12 feet high.
- Good...
Well, what happened? What did you do?
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.
I felt...
Well...
I felt I owed his family something.
You really feel conscience-stricken about King Kong, don't you?
Whatever you do, don't mention Little Kong to Helstrom.
- He'd have a nervous breakdown.
- I'd like to break his neck.
We ought to go hunting and save our rations for emergencies.
This is cut right into the side of Skull Mountain.
My guess, that temple.
- Maybe big devil live in there.
- A temple?
Helstrom, suppose the treasure should be hidden here.
That certainly would be wonderful.
- You'd better come along with me, Helstrom.
- We'll meet here at sundown.
My go with Skipper.
Unh!
I'd forgotten you.
You'd better wait right here.
We'll all be back soon.
Do you think I'm going to stay here alone?
Well, all right, then, come on with me.
But be quiet.
And don't talk.
I thought tropical jungles were full of fruit.
That's what everybody thinks who's never been...
Look.
Well, we won't starve, anyway.
Good boy, Little Kong.
Say, can he scrap, just like his old man.
- Look, he's hurt.
- Huh?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was helping us?
Of course not.
You want me to believe he was grateful?
Well, he did save us, didn't he?
And how do we know what animals think?
Let's go and help him.
Are you game?
Yes, if you are.
Wait.
If you talk, very calmly... sometimes that keeps animals quiet.
- You frightened him.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
Was I too rough with him?
Poor old boy.
Baby Kong.
Yeah, some baby.
You're not a patch on your old man.
I must be completely cuckoo to be doing this.
Giving you a ﬁrst-aid treatment instead of running like blazes.
Guess it must be remorse or something.
You see...
I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with a gas bomb and then... carried him off to New York in chains.
I've been sorry for it ever since.
Yeah, you see, the poor old geezer got shot at the finish.
I guess if I'd left him alone... we'd all have been better off.
This is sort of an apology.
There you are, boy.
Two good deeds in one day for something that size... we ought to be caught up on our good deeds for a year.
I wish I had one of those coconuts.
I'll see what I can do about it.
Hey, look what you're doing, you big dummy.
I wish you'd be a little more careful of what you wish for.
Hey.
You better lie down and do your sleeping.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go to sleep.
I was helping you keep watch.
I have to keep watch of you.
That's the third time I've caught you.
Aren't you going to signal the others again?
Well, there's no use wasting any more ammunition.
They'd have answered those shots
I ﬁred if they'd heard them.
You better lie down.
Here.
Take my coat for a pillow.
- You'll need it.
- No, I won't. I'll keep the fire going.
There you are.
You're a grand little scout.
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess, kid.
You didn't.
I came.
Well, then I'm glad they wouldn't let you stay on the ship.
But I'm just another trouble.
You told me not to come on the boat.
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.
It's gone.
What fashion animal you call that, huh? I no like.
Here's your gun.
Well, that leaves only one shotgun among us.
It's light enough now.
We better go and look for Denham and the girl.
Mm. Heh.
- Well.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- No sign of the Skipper?
- No.
I'll fire one more shot.
Our guardian angel.
Hey, look.
I'm going to try and get into this place.
If you have no objections.
You're sure you don't mind?
Well, that's fine.
Listen, you attend to your business and I'll attend to mine.
Look! The treasure!
The treasure of the island!
I was expecting you.
Come on, baby.
We've found it!
Please, Little Kong, help us.
Hand it down.
Attaboy, Kong.
Stick to me, kid, and you'll wear diamonds.
Look at them.
Just look at them. We're rich.
We're all rich.
Well, what are you going to do with them?
Huh?
Yeah, I guess maybe a sailboat would be more useful.
Hey, put that down.
Hey, look out!
You'll shoot yourself, you half-wit.
Hey!
Hey, look out! You want to kill somebody?
Sure, you've fixed everything now.
You big rummy.
Do you think he's dead?
Denham.
That's the Skipper.
- What's happened? Where's your gun?
- It's broken, Skipper, but listen...
What? Both guns gone? We can't stay here. Let's go back to the boat.
Helstrom, the treasure, I...
You fool, there never was any treasure.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Then that was just a yarn you were giving me.
Of course. I had to tell you that to get away from Dakang.
Then there isn't any treasure at all?
Helstrom. Helstrom.
- He's going to the boat.
- Why, that crazy fool may take it.
Let's go after him.
I'm going back for the rest of the treasure.
Make sure of the boat.
I'll catch up with you. Hurry!
Earthquake!
My poor kid.
It doesn't seem to matter very much.
Stick to me and you'll wear diamonds.
Look.
Look.
Ship.
Ship.
Hello, kid.
What are you thinking about?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was saving my life?
Well, I'm sure he did.
Pretty soon, when we get back... you'll be saying goodbye to me, won't you?
Yeah.
What?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Well, you'll have plenty of money, kid.
We'll split the treasure four ways.
Couldn't you just split it... three ways?
How do you mean?
Well... one-third to the Skipper, one-third to Charlie... and one-third... to us.
Well, you said stick to you.
This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.

- Five and a half fathoms!
- Five and a half fathoms!
Five and a half!
That smooth spot between the two lines of breakers.
Yeah, I see it.
Four and a half, getting shallow fast!
Four and a half, getting shallow!
Four and a half. Steady!
George says three fathoms through passage.
Hey, Tinker, ease that mainsheet!
- How many feet in a fathom?
- Six.
Eighteen feet through the passage.
Yeah, and the ship takes fifteen of those.
Oh, three feet to spare.
Well, I forgot to bring my water-wings!
Good morning, St. Peter!
Three and a half fathoms!
- Three and a half!
- Draught, Skipper, how old's that chart?
Stand by everybody, we're going through the passage!
- Mind that jib, Chief!
- Breakers abaft!
Catch the swell on the right so we'll ride it through!
Here they come! Look out, Johnny!
We made it, we're over!
- Great work, Sir!
- I bet we didn't have an inch to spare!
You bet not!.
- Take the wheel, will ya?
- Yes, Sir.
Five and a half and getting deeper!
Great stuff, Kid, we're in.
- Made it by inches!
- Yep!
Yeah! Well after this I'll do all my yachting ashore!
Aw, you're always crabby, that's a sport.
Well, you can have it, I don't want it.
Say! You ought to get shock absorbers on this boat.
Sailors, come and get it!
Where have you been?
Now, now, now, now!
Women and children first!
Natives!
Look at these!
Yeah, pretty.
Hellooo.
Hellooo.
- What's that supposed to be?
- The call of the wild.
Hellooo.
- Johnny, you're outta luck, no blondes!
- Yeah, I know.
Oh! You don't suppose they're cannibals, do you?
Well, if they are, we'll feed 'em you!
Maybe they're not allowed to eat ham.
Don't do that, I'm sensitive!
- What do you call this place?
- Probably one of the Virgin Islands.
Heaven forbid!
Here, take this for bait.
Girls, come and get some Chester, pleeeease.
Johnny, here's the charm of the South Seas:
You cruise about and out of nowhere you tumble onto one of these little islands.
And you'll nearly always find the natives a happy and carefree people.
Yeah, I know
Fond of light wines and dancing.
Hey! Look!
Hello, Baby, got anything on for tonight?
I give you my heart's blood.
They want to play.
They may never have seen the glass.
This water!
Catchee!
My hat!
What else you got?
Boy, I never did like a hard clock anyway.
Here!
I've wanted you boys to get rid of these things for a long time.
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't throw those things overboard!
Oh, they have lots of clothes.
Say, Johnny, see that little girl over there?
- Here's a present for you.
- Give me that!
- Shark!
- Shark?
Shark!!
Get the rifle!
Submerged right there!
Hey! Don't shoot him, you might hit a native!
- Here! Give me a hand with this line!
- Okay.
Hey! Don't do that!
You'll tear his leg off.
Steady now! Cut him loose, quick!
Do whatever you have to do, but don't pull it!
What happened?
When the shark took the bait, your ol' foot got caught up in the rope and over you went.
How did I get out of it?
The line parted between you and the shark, looks like it's been cut.
Probably one of the natives.
Which one?
Go on, Sweetheart, I'm listening.
Sardines again.
- Not bad, eh?
- Perfect!
- I'm drunk again.
- Oh! I was just tired, I know.
Say, he must be the Big Medicine around here, eh, Skipper?
He sure is! That 's the guy that feeds the volcano.
- Feeds the volcano?
- Sure!
That's the way they keep the volcano quiet.
He feeds it.
- Throws it the fish?
- No, Sir!
They must be young and beautiful to please the volcano.
He wants us to eat.
- I can't make up my mind what I want?
- Got any straws?
What is this, a paper hanger's convention?
All kiding aside, Skippy, what...what is this?
It's poi.
- Poi?
- It's a poi.
- Poi or girl, I wouldn't like it.
- You like poi.
You remember the poi your mother used to bake!
Apple poi, lemon poi, rhubarb poi...
Oh! That kine of poi!
Well, here goes!
Aw! That's good!
That's beautiful, Mac!
Hello there!
Sure, I'm the guy.
Sure!
Boy, that's good!
I've eaten worse than this in the Waldorf.
Hey, Skipper, what is this?
It's octopus.
Octopus?
If something crawls and stabs at you tonight,
Hector, it's me!.
Ooh! It's got me, I'm an octopus.
Skipper, what are they sore about?
How you can certainly pick 'em, that's the King's daughter.
Yeah, that's all right with me.
Yeah, but it isn't all right with them, she's taboo.
What do you mean?
Well, you see, they have rules about such things in the Islands.
No one's supposed to touch her except a native prince.
They're very strict about it.
You're going to get your throat cut, Johnny.
Well, Johnny, it looks to me that the only out is for you to run for the job of Native Prince on the democratic ticket this fall.
It's funny, Mac, what the tropics'll do to a kid like Johnny.
I wish they did it to me.
You better keep you eye on him, Mac.
He's going native.
Ol' Devil Night's got 'im!
Ol' Tom-Tom done stole our Johnny away.
Don't you wish your were young enough to feel the way that that kid feels.
That's right, Mac
Not me, might keep me awake.
Say, did you see the expression on Johnny's face when that witch doctor was doin' all the...?
Say, what made that plant shrivel up like that, anyhow?
I blew my breath on it.
You little devil!
I'll get even with you!
You gonna let me see your face?
Hey Mac, what's happened to Johnny?
I can't find him... his bunk hasn't been slept in.
Hey, Skipper, is Johnny on board?
- I have't seen him, where is he?
- What's all the ruckus?
Johnny's not on the boat.
What are you grinning about, Mac?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I had a long talk with Johnny last night.
And he's decided to stay on the island and we'll pick him up on the way back.
- On the Island?
-Yep!
Aw, you're kidding, Mac,
Johnny's somewhere on this boat.
No I'm not kidding and, as a matter of fact, I think it's a swell idea.
I wish I'd done the same thing when I was a kid.
Why, this is ridiculous! Hey, Skipper, turn around, we're going back.
He'll never get out of there alive, those people are savages.
- Come on Skipper, let's go back.
- Come on! Turn around!
We're not going back, we're going on right as we are.
- Mac, are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad.
I think I know Johnny a little better than you fellows.
Matter of fact, I'm for him 100%, and I told him so last night.
So that's that!
Now, don't you boys worry about Johnny,
I packed his duffle bag and put in everything he'll need.
Let's see...hot water bottle, bicarbonate of soda, needle and thread, a box of toothpicks, tennis racket, golf sticks, a bottle of ginger ale...
Oh! And a ukulele.
Hey, Brat! What are you doin' here?
You're gonna cut yourself with that!
Hey there, Oscar, you have my boy's shirt!
What are you doing? Here, give me that!
You're gonna wreck all that.
Hey! What's going on around here?
What?
Hey, what's the big idea?
My, my, my...roses!
Hey, who thought this up?
I don't get you, Sister.
Oh, you want me to sit down.
Oh! Well, all right,
I'll try anything once!
I don't get you, Baby.
Oh, you want me to struggle with you.
Never on occasions like this!
Well, all right, but remember
I'm only pretending!
Ene-hu.
Ene-hu again!
Oh! Ene-hu more!
Seems we have company.
Come on baby.
We gotta make a run for it.
A happy carefree peoples... fond of light wines and dancing, huh?
What does it say?
You don't tell me.
Well, I'll have to consult my secretary before I can tell you about that.

What's that about Luana?
Oh, I see.

White man want you to stay here with him always.
Don't you understand, Luana?
I want you to stay here with me.

Untie the rope!
Where I can get a canoe?
I've gotta have a canoe!
A canoe! Don't you understand?
Oh, taboo, bunk!
I've got to have a canoe!
A canoe.
Here, you get me a canoe I give you this, it's nice and soft.

Practically perfect!
Oh! I see! Coconuts.
Oh, I'm afraid I get you, Sweetheart.
Do you wanna help me up?
Well, here it goes!
Oh, boy!
Here comes a big one!
Heads up!
Did it get wet?
Here comes another one!
Watch out!
Like it?
Right over home base! It's a great pitch! And he's out!
What?
Lovely!
Oh! Knife!
Knife, huh?
Knife!
-Knife. -Knife. -Knife. -Knife.
I'm glad you know how to do all of these things.
I'd be lost out here!
Spilled a little.
You spill it!
You're filling me.
You take a little now!
See how you like it.
Um! That's marvelous!
Kiss me!
Suppose I make you kiss me?
I'll teach you to run away from me!
Rain!
Say! I fell like a potato bug!
We can't run under these leaves every time it rains.
I've go to build a house.
House?
Yeah! A place to live in.
A shelter. You know, a place to sleep.
Oh, yeah! Well, that, too!
Let it rain, let it pour!
Well, do you like it?
Oh! Johnny!
Finish house, huh?
It's a palace, it's a castle.
Look, Whiskers, now you have place for sleep!
Hey, Nick! I didn't build that house for the goat, I built for you and me.
You do everything.
Yeah, I'm a great guy all right.
You happy?
And when the gang comes back,
I'm gonna take you home with me.
No, Johnny.
No!
Oh, why not?
Some day, Pele angry.
Tom-toms call,
I go.
You mean to the volcano?
I won't let you go.
You belong to me now, see?
If I not here here when
Pele calls, then Pele angry.
You too!
Volcano curse on you.
- You die, too.
- Aw! Now, thats a lot of hooey!
I'm not afraid of Pele and what the volcano curse can do to me.
And you're not gonna be afraid either.
I'm gonna take you back to civilization.
We don't have any crazy, superstitious ideas about volcanoes being mad at people and putting a curse on 'em.
Civilization?
Where is that?
Well, it's...that's not a place.
That's where things are happening, people are accomplishing something.
Did I tell you about the radio?
Well, all you do is sit there and turn a little dial, and all of a sudden, out of the air comes sound. Right where you are.
Isn't that swell?
Now, look, it's getting dark.
Now, if we were in
San Francisco, bingo!
I'd press a button..lights!
Oh, Johnny, but it is so nice in the dark.
Say, Luana, you certainly make civilization look silly.
But it's not, really!
It's great!
Gee, wait 'til you see it!
Market Street with all its traffic and lights.
People going to theaters. Hotels with grand, tiled bathrooms...
Hot water running into steaming tubs.
Restaurants where they serve grand food.
Parties, football games, dances.
Speed boats, airplanes roaring through the air.
Gee, Luana, civilization's...
You're a sweet kid.
Pele, Pele!
Johnny
Johnny!
Oh, Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Luana!
Luana!
Luana!
Luana!
Luana! Luana!
Johnny.
Luana.
Johnny!
Luana!
What are they gonna do to you?!?
What are they gonna do to you?!?!?
I make big sin, Johnny.
They give me to Pele.
Aw, you haven't sinned.
I loved you and you loved me, that's all there is to it!
But I taboo for white man, Johnny.
That's not true!
Oh, I caused all this.
I am happy, Johnny.
I happy you steal me away and we live together.
I happy you teach me kiss.
I happy you hold me.
I happy for everything!
It was best thing that ever come to me.
I thought I just had a yen for ya.
I thought this was only gonna be a lark!
Oh, but I love you, Luana.
I love you more than
I've ever loved anyone.
More than I COULD love anyone!
Thank you very much...Johnny.
What do you want?
Do you understand? What do you want?
Let her go! Let her go!
I'll give you anything you want.
Ships, knives, canoes, anything.
Only, but let her go, please, please!
Oh, Johnny.
What is it?
Whatsa matter, Luana?
What did he say?
Prince say now you come for me,
Pele angry.
Volcano curse on you!
Prince say you die...too.
Well, that's all right.
That's sort of as it should be.
No, that's wrong!
I sin, Pele God He angry at me.
No, Pele is no God, Luana.
He's only a hole in the ground.
There's only one God, Luana.
Oh, God, help us.
Get her out of this.
It's Pele.
"Our Father which art in heaven,"
"Hallowed be thy name."
"Thy kingdom come,"
"Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
They're coming for us!
I've got to kiss you, Luana!
Try! See if you can reach me!
Let her alone!
Oh, do what you want to me!
Let her alone!
Don't shoot anymore, Skipper
Wait and see what happens.
Quiet!
Yeah, that'll fix ya up, young fella.
And don't you move that arm!
That's a bad hole they put in you.
Why, hello, Luana.
Johnny...die?
No, no, no!
There is nothing to worry about.
In a day or two he'll be just as good as new.
No savvy, huh?
Johnny...well...one...two...day.
Understand?
Come here, come here!
Come on now, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Come on, you come up on deck with me.
Johnny...all right!
You come on now!
No.
How is he, Mac?
He's still feverish, but he'll put out all right.
Well, Fellas, what's the verdict?
Does she go with us or does she stay here?
I still contend that she won't stand transplanting.
You know, you take a girl that's been filled with superstition all her life, you can't suddenly adapt her to our ways.
Aw, for heaven's sake, you talk like some old Aunt Emma!
This is 1932!
She's a swell girl and I like her!
That Kipling stuff is a lot of hooey!
You're wrong, Chester.
That boy's whole life is wrapped up in his family.
Why, if he came home with a native wife, it'd break his mother's heart!
"For East is East, and West is West,"
"and never the twain shall meet."
Mac, what's the dope on the North and South?
Aw, shut up!
Oh, Johnny.
Pele not like you.
You take me away from him.
He mad.
He want you die too.
But I not let you.
I go to Pele.
He forgive...everything work right for you.
Luana...
- No.
- Yes, Johnny.
- Water.
- Water.
Water.
...a drink.
Water.
What do you want?
- What do you want?
- Something about Luana.
Hey, Skipper, find out what he wants!
Yes, Sir.
It's the old chief, the girl's father, he's come for her.
Well, you tell him he can't have her, that we're taking he back with us.
He says that the volcano curse has been put on Johnny, and unless the girl returns with them, Johnny will die, too.
My father right!
I go...please.
No, Luana, we're going to take you with us.
No, I go go back to my people.
I say goodbye to Johnny.
No, Luana...
We take you with us.
Mac, if I had that much courage, I'd...
Hey, Skipper, let's get outta here.
This place is getting my goat!
That's the most
I got is 3,000 bottle of crème de menthe.
You got things pretty much your own way now, haven't you, Louis?
Sure.
Everything is just fine.
That's good.
But Pete was saying just tonight...
He say that the South Side, she's get out of line.
I say, what are we gonna do with the South Side?
Let some of the other boys get theirs, too. I got all I wanted.
Johnny Lovo, he's talking about starting something.
Yeah?
He's looking for trouble, eh?
Johnny's very foolish!
Look at me.
A man always got to know whether he's got it or not. I got plenty.
I got house. I got automobile.
I got nice girl.
I got stomach trouble, too.
Better get some sleep.
All right.
Well, she was a pretty good party, eh?
Next week,
I'm going to give the party which the boys ain't never seen nothing like it before.
We'll have much more music, much more girls, much more everything.
Everybody, should say, "Big Louis, he sit on top of the world!" Eh?
- Goodbye, Louis.
- Goodbye, boys.
Take good careful of yourselves, eh?
- Bye.
- I see you some more.
Hello. I want
Lakeside 417, please.
Yeah, 417 Lakeside. Sure.
That's the wrong...
No, I want Lakeside 417.
Hello, Louis.
Hello.
How many of them?
All right.
Hello.
Copyboy here.
Copyboy!
That's rotten!
"Costillo slaying starts gang war!"
That's what I want.
I'm working on that angle now.
- I've got four men on it.
- Four?
You'll need 40 men on this story for the next five years.
You know what's happening?
This town is up for the grabs. Get me?
You know, Costillo was the last of the old-fashioned gang leaders.
There's a new crew coming out.
And every guy that's got money enough to buy a gun is going to try to step into his place.
You see?
They'll be shooting each other like rabbits for the control of the booze business!
You get it?
It'll be just like war!
That's it, "war."
You put that in the lead.
"War. Gang war."
Here come the coppers!
Hello, Rinaldo.
You coming along?
Where's Camonte?
- Hello, Guarino.
- Come on.
What's your hurry?
I'm getting a massage, too.
We'll finish that at headquarters.
Put your coat on.
I got lots of time.
Who wants to see me?
The Chief.
That kidney foot?
Never mind the jokes.
Come on.
Hey, how's it look in the back?
Very good.
Come on, you rat!
Come on.
"Tony Camonte, aliases Cabrone, Joe Black.
"Assault, carrying brass knuckles and sap, DW, disturbing peace.
"Street robbery on three counts, loft burglary, violation Volstead Act.
"Indicted for murder of Buck Kempner.
"Member, Five Point's Gang, came from New York, 1920.
"At present, bodyguard and strong-arm for Louis Costillo."
Bodyguard for Costillo, eh?
Pretty smart boy.
I suppose you didn't kill
Louis Costillo?
Who, me?
That's very funny.
Big Louis and me, we're like this.
Can I slap it out of him,
Chief?
I'll let you have him in a little while, Ben.
This fellow got ideas
I don't like.
Costillo hired you for a bodyguard.
Where were you at the shooting?
I was having my beauty sleep.
Where?
In a lady's house.
You want her name?
Phone number?
She's very nice.
We'll go into your alibis later.
You've been hanging around
Johnny Lovo, haven't you?
Lovo split with Big Louis.
What were you doing at Lovo's house last week?
Now listen, Tony,
I'm gonna give you a chance.
You play ball with me and I'll play ball with you.
Last night, you met Johnny in Spinelli's Barber Shop.
What did he give you money for?
Now listen, you.
What kind of mug you think I am?
I don't know nothing, I don't see nothing and I don't hear nothing.
And when I do, I don't tell a cop.
You understand?
All right, Guarino, you can have him.
Thanks.
Come on, Tony.
We'll take a look at the goldfish.
Here's Epstein.
Hi, boys. Hello, Chief.
All right, let's have it.
Writ of habeas corpus for the release of Tony Camonte and Guino Rinaldo.
- Who gave it to you?
- Flemming.
All right, gentlemen, see you later.
- Hey, I don't go with this guy?
- No.
Listen to me.
You've come into this town and you think you're headed somewhere, don't you?
You think you're gonna get there with a gun, but you're not! Get me?
You know why?
Because you got $1,000 bills pasted right across your eyes.
And someday you're gonna stumble and fall down in the gutter, right where the horses have been standing, right where you belong.
You got me all figured out, huh?
I've spent my life mixing with your breed and I don't like it. Get me?
You can hide behind a lot of red tape, crooked lawyers, some politicians with the "gimmes", writs of habeas corpus, witnesses that don't remember overnight, but we'll get through to you just like we got all the rest!
Oh, maybe me,
I'm different.
No, you're not!
Take your gun away and get you in a tough spot and you'll squeal, like all the other rats.
You're gonna get me, huh?
In your particular case, I'd give up a month's pay for the job.
Are you gonna see Lovo?
Yeah, right away.
Tell him to stay undercover.
I'll come up tomorrow.
Hey, what's this writ you got me out on?
Habeas corpus.
Deliver the body.
Can't hold you without booking you no matter what they think you've done.
That's a fine idea. Hey, you tell Flemming
I want lots of them.
- Hi, Boss.
- Come in, Tony. Glad to see you.
Hey, that's pretty hot.
Silk. Expensive, huh?
I see that
Epstein got to you in time.
Yeah. Nice little fellow.
He give them a writ of hocus pocus.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
He said you stay here till the heat's off. He said...
Hey. That's pretty hot.
That's Poppy.
Hey, Poppy.
Meet Tony Camonte.
Hi.
Mmm-hmm.
How are the coppers taking it?
Oh, I didn't pay much attention.
What about the newspapers?
Yeah, I bring them along.
The News has got the best story.
Pictures of you and one of me, too.
Where did they run it, in the razor ads?
Huh? Oh, that?
That's an old business.
You'll get used to that.
I got it in the war.
War with a blond in a Brooklyn speakeasy.
Some kidder, huh?
It takes a long time with the pinchers, eh?
You've got an office for this sort of thing,
Johnny. Why don't you use it?
There you are, Tony.
That's a bonus.
Hey, that's a nice feel.
That was a fine job, Tony.
Remember, that's only chicken feed.
You've stepped into big company.
You stick to me and do what I say, play square and you'll be walking around with lace pants and a gold hat.
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, I know.
Now, listen, I'm gonna cut you in on a percentage.
Give you a raise, double.
The South Side is rolling in jack.
All we gotta do is step in and take it.
Yeah, and have some fun with O'Hara, too, huh?
Who? Now wait a minute.
O'Hara's too big a guy to buck now.
There's lots of jack on the North Side.
Now, listen, you.
You let me think up the ideas.
I'll take care of that big hop in my own way when the time comes.
I say we stay out of the North Side.
I say we leave O'Hara alone and what I say goes!
Don't ever forget that.
- You're the boss.
- That's better.
From now on, next to me, the boys take orders from you.
Yeah, me and you, eh?
That's fine talk, Boss.
Here. Have a cigar.
There'll be plenty of work for everybody.
Costillo slowed down too much.
Yeah, and now he come to a dead stop.
Here, you better smoke one of mine.
That's pretty nice.
Expensive, huh?
I don't like cigar smoke in my room. Do you mind?
Listen, I'm gonna hold off that meeting with the boys a couple of days.
After Big Louis' funeral, it's better.
You know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
It don't look so good.
And I want you to send some flowers.
A cross of white carnations from me, see?
Yeah, and I send lots of purple, a bunch.
Big Louis he always liked purple.
Why don't you go and do it now?
You better make that meeting Monday.
Tell all the guys that want to run beer on the South Side to be there.
Tell them I'm gonna make a speech.
You know what I mean?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, goodbye, Poppy.
See you again.
She don't like anybody but me.
Mmm-hmm.
She's a very busy girl.
Expensive, huh?
Here, Little Boy.
Easy dough, huh, for just standing outside and listening to a gun go off?
- Cinch. When are we gonna get some more?
- We'll get plenty.
There's business just waiting for some guy to come and run it right.
And I got ideas.
We're working for Lovo, ain't we?
Lovo? Who's Lovo?
Just some guy who's a little bit more smart than Big Louis, that's all.
Hey, that guy is soft.
I could just see it in his face.
He's got a setup, that's all, and we gotta wait.
Someday I'm gonna run the whole works.
Remember, those monkeys on the North Side ain't so soft.
Oh, yeah? Say, they're satisfied, ain't they?
Why didn't they come and take Big Louis before we did?
Listen, Little Boy, in this business, there is only one law you gotta follow to keep out of trouble.
Do it first, do it yourself and keep on doing it.
- Where's Cesca?
- Oh, I don't know. She go out.
What do you mean?
Ain't she coming home for dinner?
Hey, I don't like that!
You tell her I want she should come home for dinner. Understand?
Sure.
I tell her lots of times.
"Come home. Come home.
Tony no like."
Still she don't...
That's a nice way
I catch you, huh?
What do you mean, "catch me"?
I wasn't doing nothing.
- You was kissing him!
- Sure. What of it?
- Well, I don't like it!
- You're missing lots of fun, Tony.
Listen. I don't want anybody kissing my sister, understand?
You're hurting my arm!
I don't want anybody putting their hands on you.
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm your brother.
You don't act it!
You act more like...
I don't know, sometimes I think...
I don't care what you think!
- You do what I say!
- Sure, and never have any fun.
"Never have any fun."
You call that fun, eh?
Running around with guys like that. That's fun!
Listen, you want real fun, huh?
Here.
How's that?
Gee, Tony, where'd you get it?
Never mind where I got it.
You just spend it, see?
You're swell.
Go on, get ready for dinner.
And remember, you do what I say.
No more fellows, understand?
What for you wanna give her money, huh?
Well, she's just a kid.
She wants to have fun.
Yeah?
Sometimes I think you crazy.
Cesca!
What for you take that money, huh?
- 'Cause I want it, that's why.
- Give it back!
It's bad money!
Tony no got it in no good way.
Gonna bring you lots of trouble.
What do I care where he gets it?
There's nothing wrong with his giving it to me.
Tony wants me to have a good time.
Oh, yes? You listen.
Tony no love you like he make you believe.
All of the time he smile on top, but what he thinks...
Oh, he's got lots of tricks!
He no give money to nobody for nothing.
He would to his sister!
Sister! Huh!
That make no difference.
To him, you're just another girl.
Someday, when he needs you, he mix you up in his business just like anyone else.
And he's gonna make you bad like him!
He can't make me do anything
I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my own life.
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah?
All of the time
Tony say like that.
Afterwards, he no belong to me no more.
He's no good! And now you start to be just like him!
No, I'm not.
Don't worry about me.
I'll get along all right.
Hey!
That's all right, boys.
Just changing the name on the door.
Meet the new president,
Johnny Lovo.
Hi, boys.
Where's Berdini,
Zeigler, Meehan?
Anybody see them?
I did. They ain't coming.
Is that all they said?
They said you could take a flying...
Okay, okay.
Now we know where they stand.
All right, you guys, I'm making a speech.
Here it is.
Big Louis gets a wad of dough and then he gets soft.
He lets you guys come into the South Side and run beer.
Well, I'm gonna change it, see?
You can still stay in but from now on you're operating the way I say.
Are you asking us or telling us?
I'm telling you.
We're gonna get organized and I'm gonna handle the works.
It's gonna mean twice as much dough for everybody and half as much trouble.
- You got something figured out, Johnny?
- Everything.
Not being able to get it's gonna make this town thirstier than ever.
Running beer ain't a nickel game anymore.
It's a business, and I'm gonna run it like a business.
Swell! We've been cutting each other's throats long enough.
There's 3,000 saloons on the South Side.
Half a million customers, figure that out.
Add up what they're gonna lay on the line every year for drinks and nobody in charge.
So you're going to be it?
Yeah, "it." That's me!
I make my own beer and I got my own trucks.
I don't have to go into business with nobody.
- Where you going?
- Who wants to know?
You sit down here! And don't interrupt the president no more.
All right, President.
- Well, are the rest of you guys in or out?
- I'm in.
What about Meehan?
Yeah, Berdini and Zeigler?
Why, they've been selling to 700, 800 joints between them.
Yeah? Well, from now on they're out.
Those joints buy from us.
Sure. If you try to sell at one of those places,
Meehan'll turn this side of the town into a shooting gallery.
Fine! Anything he starts, we'll finish.
You guys don't have to worry.
All you gotta do is to haul beer.
Yeah? Well, who's gonna stick his neck in those joints and get the orders?
My friend, Tony Camonte.
Yeah, I'm what he call a good salesman.
Hey, I start right now to get orders, eh, Boss?
All you can get, go to it.
Hey, dope, got a pencil?
Oh, boys. I don't write.
That's one.
Come on.
Come on, Little Boy, business.
- Ever eat at home?
- Once in a while.
You get all the samples here.
Here have your beer.
Hey, what is this?
Let go of me, will you?
What do you want? Let go!
- Say, what's the big idea?
- Sit down!
- Who're you buying your beer from?
- Meehan and Berdini.
- How many barrels a day?
- Three.
He's lying, Tony, he's been taking five.
Chiseler.
Well, you're getting eight now, see?
And you're buying from us. Johnny Lovo.
- But, listen. I can't...
- Sit down.
I can't use eight barrels around here!
I get you a hunk of soap, you take a bath in it.
- What do you paying a barrel?
- Fifty!
Well, ours is 65, it's better!
You get delivery tomorrow.
What am I gonna tell
Meehan and Berdini?
We'll take care of them, don't worry.
Well, that's order number one.
Now we get plenty more.
There's a system to these things.
How many barrels did you say you wanted?
Six.
Yeah? Well, you're getting 10.
You're getting a delivery tomorrow.
There's no use arguing with this joint.
Zeigler runs it himself.
Step on it.
Hi, Boss.
Lots of garlic.
Get me some, too.
Well, how's business?
You get some more orders?
Lots of orders. They all buy from us.
All we have to do is fill them.
Yeah, it's a good idea.
You better tell Meehan and Berdini.
Oh, them fellows, they retired from business.
They what?
What've you been doing?
You remember you say all they have to do is start something, we finish it?
- Well, did you?
- About an hour ago.
- You mean...
- Hey! Hey, kid.
- Extra here!
- Come here. Hey!
- Keep the change.
- All right. Thanks.
Here you are, Boss.
There's your South Side all nailed up in a box.
All nailed up in a...
Yeah. Well, you didn't get the lid on very tight.
- What do you mean?
- Look at that.
Come on. Hey, keep this hot.
We'll be back right away.
- You can't come in here.
- Come on, get out of here.
No, it's a private hospital.
You can't go...
Oh, what did they do?
- Hi, Poppy.
- Hello.
Hey, what's all the time biting you? You afraid of me?
Well, that outfit's enough to give anybody the yips.
Nice, huh? I got three more.
Different colors.
I see you're going in for jewelry.
It's kind of effeminate, isn't it?
Huh? Yeah. I got them in an auction. A bargain.
You sure are a funny mixture,
Tony.
That's the first time you smiled.
Yeah?
Well, how do you mean, you think I'm funny?
You just are, that's all.
What else are you doing with all your money?
I hear you're getting a new car.
Mmm-hmm. It's different.
It's got bullet-proof glass and a steel body.
And I got myself a new house, too.
Come up sometime?
Yeah,
I'll bring my grandmother.
No kidding. You come up?
Why don't you get yourself a girl, Tony?
Well, I'm working on that now.
Yeah?
Well, don't tire yourself out.
- Is Johnny in?
- Yeah.
He's mad, huh?
Hi, Boss.
When are you gonna learn that I am the boss?
Sure, you're the boss.
Then what do you mean by breaking up that
Lakeview joint last night?
Didn't I tell you to stay out of the North Side?
Now, listen, Johnny, it was easy.
Now, you listen to me, stupid!
That was one of O'Hara's places and you know it.
Didn't I tell you I wasn't ready for O'Hara yet?
It was a nice little order.
Fifty barrels a week.
I don't care if it's 50 a day!
What do you use to think with, an empty beer keg?
Just when we get this territory lined up and running smooth you step out and gum up the parade.
How do you mean, Johnny? I just sell a little more beer. Don't worry.
Don't worry? You know what O'Hara's liable to do now?
He'll send his guns down here on the South Side.
They'll move around like hummingbirds.
You're liable to get it and I'm liable to get it.
I know that hop. He's tough, see?
He ain't so tough.
Hanging out in a flower shop.
You afraid of a guy like that?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
Sure, you're not.
That's a crazy question, eh, Johnny?
- Come on, don't argue.
- Where you going?
To clean up after you, you mug, unless it's too late.
Look out!
It's Keach!
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello, this is Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's the name, please?
This is
Mr. Camonte's secretary.
Secretary, I told you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Secretary, you dope.
Secretary.
Okay, Boss.
No, no. I no talking on you.
I was talking on Mr. Camonte, that's my boss.
- That's...
- Hey, hey.
Get a name. Get a name.
What's your name?
No, no, I no wanna know what's your brother's name.
I wanna know what's your name.
Oh, you do, huh?
Listen, I come on over there,
I smack you right in the teeth.
- I get you, your brother...
- Hey, what's the matter?
That's no way to talk.
Talk nice.
Tell him to state his business.
Go state your business.
Who was it?
I don't know.
What do you mean,
"I don't know"?
Didn't I tell you always to get a name and write it down over here?
- Oh, Boss, I forget again.
- Forget again.
Hey, what are you writing there, huh?
I don't know.
I can't write.
Can't write? That's nice.
A secretary that can't write.
A secretary must be able to write.
Must be educated.
Get an education.
He cannot write.
Education?
That's your fault.
This Mr. Camonte's...
Oh, no, please, you're wrong.
I no hang up on you.
I thought you was through.
I told you before.
You have to write a letter.
You have to make...
Oh, you do, huh?
Let me tell you...
Shut up, you. You...
Hey, what's the matter with you? You crazy?
Listen, the last time
I tell you...
You pick yourself a nice one.
You get one for me?
Didn't have time.
Was there any trouble?
No, it was easy.
- How many were there?
- He was alone.
Hey.
Hello? Who is it?
I don't get...
Boss, I don't get the name.
Hello? Yeah?
Who? Oh, sure.
Sure, send her right up.
That's Poppy.
Hey! It's better nobody see you with this.
Hello, handsome.
Well, Poppy.
Hello, Tony.
They tell me O'Hara was killed in his flower shop this morning.
Had you heard that?
- Did Johnny send you up here?
- Johnny?
How do you like this place?
- Kind of gaudy, isn't it?
- Ain't it though?
Glad you like it. Come here,
I show you something nice.
Steel shutters on all the windows.
My own idea.
In case you have visitors you don't like, huh?
Uh-huh. That's right.
How do you like the view here, huh?
You see that?
Someday I look at that sign and I say,
"Okay, she's mine."
You think so?
Yeah,
I got a pretty good idea.
That's pretty hot.
Expensive, eh?
Yeah, come here. I show you something what's pretty hot.
How do you like this place, huh?
Come here.
Here's some stuff I buy.
Aren't they sweet?
Huh? You like?
I'm gonna get some ties made to match.
See, what I'm gonna do is wear a shirt only once.
Then I give it right away to the laundry.
A new shirt every day.
You're just gonna drive the women mad, aren't you?
Yeah. One of them.
Meaning me, I suppose?
Feel it.
Huh? It's got inside springs.
I bought it at an auction. It's a bargain.
Go ahead, sit down. Try it.
Yeah, it's all right.
You like it?
I thought you were Johnny's friend.
Sure.
I like Johnny, but I like you more.
Excuse, Boss.
Cops is downstairs.
All right, tell them to come in and sit down. I'll be right out.
Okay.
Hey, I don't wanna be caught here. This is a mess.
It's all right.
Don't get excited. It's easy.
Oh, great. Thanks.
Hey, Poppy.
After I get through with them, I'll meet you at the restaurant at 4th Street.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey, hey, go to the left.
Uh-huh.
- Hello, Guarino.
- Hello.
- You all alone?
- Yeah.
You're a cute fellow, coming here all by yourself.
You ain't afraid of me, huh?
No, nor 10 like you.
Come on, the Chief's waiting.
Hey, Angelo, call up Epstein and tell him that...
Hey, Little Boy, call up Epstein.
Tell him there's a kidney foot here taking me down to the Chief's office.
Tell him to come right down with habeas corpus, understand?
Hey, you know, I just hear O'Hara, he was met with a terrible accident.
- That's too bad, no?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Come on, come on.
So Camonte thinks he's going to run this side of town, now that he's got O'Hara.
- He's getting too big.
- Yeah?
He won't get any bigger.
We'll take him before he finds out about these guns.
Three hundred slugs a minute.
Get the rest of them unpacked.
How many we got?
Plenty.
There's a lot more coming.
O'Hara had them run in across the line last night.
We'll have the cops on our necks.
Forget it. They can't do anything about it.
There's no law against bringing guns into the state, and we can buy all we want.
- What a cinch.
- You said it.
Gaffney, listen, Camonte just left headquarters.
McGill's trailing him.
He's gonna phone.
Hey, you guys.
Load those guns.
You get the cars ready.
Stick the hearse in front of them.
Then to the South Side, and I want everybody.
- Now you hang onto that phone.
- Right.
Snap into it, now get going!
- Hello.
- Hello, Tony. Have a seat.
Hello.
Well, what took you so long?
The moxie, he was late with the habeas corpus.
Go on, order some food, will you? I'm hungry.
You know, every time I see you, you look better.
That's a cute hat.
- Please, my stockings!
- What's the matter?
Well, don't do that, Tony.
They're brand new.
- Hands off, eh?
- No, feet.
You know,
I know lots of girls.
I know redheads,
I know blonds, and all kinds.
They all like me.
Yeah, you're pretty good, eh?
I'm the best.
Are you gonna eat by any chance?
I'm not hungry.
Except for you.
You got something I like.
Yeah, I'm nice with a lot of dressing.
You work fast, don't you, Tony?
No. Say, I've been waiting a long time.
I'm crazy for you.
Everybody say,
"Tony Camonte, he's a big shot!
"He's got everything he wants."
Yeah, I got everything but what I want.
You understand?
Pardon me, telephone for Mr. Camonte.
Hey, dope, go see who it is and get a name.
Hello, this Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's your name?
I say what's your name?
This Mr. Camonte's secretary.
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear what you say.
That's too loud!
That's too loud! Talk lower!
Hello, please.
Don't be a fool, Tony!
What's the name, please?
I can't... Hello?
Hello, please,
I can't hear what you say.
Hey, that's O'Hara's mob.
I can't hear what...
I can't hear what you say.
It's too loud.
Hey, lookit!
They got machine guns you can carry!
If I had some of them, I could run the whole works in a month.
I'll get you one in a minute.
Hey, that's swell.
Look, it's little, you can carry it!
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Boss, there was too much noise.
I didn't get their names.
That's a dope!
Too much for him.
Bring him upstairs. Bring him upstairs.
That's all right.
The back door. The back door.
Hey, lookit.
They've been here too!
Hey, look at that. Come here.
Get me some shells, let's see if she works.
Hey, you. Call Fugatti, tell him we want three cars, right quick.
Hey, Johnny, look what I got.
You dirty murdering mug, you bumped off O'Hara!
Who, me? That's foolish.
You told me to stay out of the North Side. I stay out.
I've been home all day!
Hey, Little Boy?
Sure!
Sure!
Oh, so that's it?
I told you to lay off!
I don't hear so good sometimes.
You won't be hearing anything if you go on like this!
Look what happened to me.
They clipped me!
Lookit, Johnny, you can carry it around like a baby!
Shut up!
We gotta get organized.
This is only a starter.
They'll be back after us.
What do you mean?
We don't give them time.
We go after them.
We throw them Micks up for grabs.
Yeah? Well, when you're laying in an alley with your head blown off, maybe you'll learn how this business ought to be run!
Yeah? And who's gonna do that?
O'Hara's mob, Gaffney.
He's running it now!
He'll give it to you here, a pound of hot lead in the belly.
Make sure it's him, Johnny!
- Cars are here, boss!
- Okay. Hey, Little Boy, it's business.
You fix who goes in each car, understand?
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- To the North Side.
- Like I always knew someday.
- You can't do that.
What do you mean "can't"?
Who's stopping me?
I am. I'm giving you orders for the last time.
There's only one thing that gets orders and gives orders!
And this is it. That's how
I got the South Side for you and that's how I'm gonna get the North Side for you.
Some little typewriter, huh?
I'm gonna write my name all over this town with big letters!
- Hey, stop him, somebody!
- Get out of my way, Johnny, I'm gonna spit!
Come on, fellows!
Hey, Tony, take this along in case that bean shooter doesn't work.
Okay!
- Come on, Dugan.
- All right.
- Hey, you see what happened here, kid?
- I don't know, mister, but they said a big black car with side curtains, and a machine gun gave them the works.
- Oh, hello, Ben.
- Hello, Chief.
What do we gonna do about them machine guns?
What can we do about them?
There's no law against manufacturing them, just against having them.
If they can't get them in one state, they go across the border and get them in another.
These fellows bootleg machine guns like they bootleg booze.
Yeah, they better do something about that because with these toys to play with, what happened before will look like a tea party.
I know it. So you better put the screws on the 22nd Street freight house.
I hear they're bringing them in in fruit boxes.
Right.
- Get that guy's number!
- Somebody get an ambulance!
What's the matter?
What is this, a pinch?
No, just bringing you a valentine.
Don't you know it's Valentine's Day?
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Come on, line up, you guys.
Over there. All seven of you.
What's the gag?
Is the heat on?
Plenty!
Face the wall!
Put your mitts up.
All of you!
Here's Gaffney.
Gaffney, what do you know about this? Well?
Well, I was on my way here to the garage to keep an appointment.
- And I was late.
- Yeah?
And a car drives up and some guys pile out.
Two of them was cops, at least they was dressed like cops.
Cops! That's a new gag.
Then what?
Well, it looked like a pinch.
So I beat around the block till it was over, then he picked me up.
Yeah, lucky you were late.
Now, take a good peek and see what you missed.
Seven of them.
Lined up against the wall.
Mowed down, just like that!
They didn't have a chance.
Sit down, Chief, you're wearing out the carpet.
Yeah? I'm the only one left!
Thinks he'll get me, huh?
Fat chance.
Who's there?
McArthur from the Journal.
Let him in.
- Hi, Gaffney.
- How'd you find me?
Oh, we boys from the Journal always get around.
Yeah, anybody else know
I'm here?
Nope. It was just my own little idea.
Sit down.
You're going to stay for a while.
Well?
Can't get a thing on him.
We're right up a blind alley wherever we go.
And Gaffney's turned yellow, and he's hiding out.
- What about Lovo?
- Lovo is practically out.
He's as scared as Gaffney.
It's Camonte all right, but we can't prove it yet.
No, but we will.
- Say, Chief?
- What do you want?
- This fellow, Camonte.
- What about him?
A story.
Public's interested in him.
He's a colorful character.
Colorful?
What color is a crawling louse?
Say, listen, that's the attitude of too many morons in this country.
They think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods.
What do they do about a guy like Camonte?
They sentimentalize, romance, make jokes about him.
They had some excuse for glorifying our old Western bad men.
They met in the middle of the street at high noon and waited for each other to draw.
But these things sneak up and shoot a guy in the back and then run away.
- I guess you're right, Chief.
- Colorful.
Did you read what happened the other day?
A car full of them chasing another down the street, broad daylight.
Three kiddies playing hopscotch on the sidewalk get lead poured in their little bellies.
When I think what goes on in the minds of these lice, I wanna vomit!
- Ben?
- Yeah.
See if you can find Gaffney.
He'll probably get it next.
They got all the others.
Right.
Our organizations are opposed to your policy, Mr. Garston.
Your paper could be an influence against the gangster, yet you keep right on playing up his activities as front page news.
Murders, gang wars, killings, that's all we read about!
You're glorifying the gangster by giving him all this publicity.
You're trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him?
By keeping him off the front page?
That's ridiculous!
You're playing right into his hands! Show him up!
Run him out of the country!
That'll keep him off the front page.
In the meantime, you expect our children to read of nothing but outrage and murder?
That's better than their being slaughtered.
The city is full of machine guns.
Gang war in the streets.
Kids aren't even safe to go to school.
You want that to go on?
Certainly not! But what can private citizens do?
Even our police force can't stop it!
Don't blame the police!
They can't stop machine guns from being run back and forth across the state lines.
They can't enforce laws that don't exist!
Then it's up to the federal government to do something about it.
You're the government!
All of you!
Instead of trying to hide the facts, get busy and see that laws are passed that'll do some good!
For instance?
Pass a federal law that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery!
Put teeth in the Deportation Act!
These gangsters don't belong in this country.
Half of them aren't even citizens.
That's true. They bring nothing but disgrace to my people.
All right.
I'll tell you what to do.
Make laws and see that they're obeyed if we have to have martial law to do it!
The governor of New Mexico declared martial law to stop a bull fight, the governor of Oklahoma to regulate oil production.
Surely, gang rule and wholesale law defiance are more of a menace to the nation than the regulation of oil or a bull fight!
The Army will help.
So will the American Legion.
They offered their services over two years ago!
And nobody ever called on them.
Let's get wise to ourselves.
We're fighting organized murder!
That Sadie Thompson, she's a pretty smart girl.
What's a girl wanna hustle in a place like that for?
Yeah, it's raining all the time.
Yeah, that rain, that's pretty good.
That comes from a pipe, you know, just like a shower.
Them two fellows...
Hey, which one do you think she takes?
The guy with the collar?
Nah, he ain't so hot.
Hey, listen, them Marines ain't so hot, too.
Come on, I go take a smoke.
That's a fine show.
I gotta see more shows like that. You know, serious.
Ain't got no jokes.
I like a show with jokes.
That's a dope.
What more do you want?
Listen, this girl, Sadie, she's got what you call a problem.
This fellow with the collar, he's gonna...
- What's the matter?
- They found Gaffney.
Spotted him down at Frank's Bowling Alley.
He's got into a game.
- Yeah?
- It's a setup.
Take about an hour to get the boys.
I'm looking at a show now.
Listen, it's the last act now, see?
There's two fellows after a girl.
Well, she's called her name Sadie, see?
Now this girl, Sadie, she's been, what do you call, disillusioned.
We gotta do it now!
He's liable to slip us again.
He's the last one, Boss.
Come on, Tony.
That's too bad.
All right, come on.
Hey wait a minute!
Now, you stay here.
- You stay and see the show.
- Oh, Boss.
I gotta know which fellow this girl, Sadie, she take.
You stay here and find out, and then come and tell me.
It's all right, Boss.
The copper's gone.
All right. Come on.
Hey, Little Boy, you go around the back, up on the balcony, grandstand seat on Stanton.
Hey, Pietro, side door.
He may have friends, you never can tell.
Joe, I want you stand in the alley.
If he gets that far, you do your stuff.
You keep the motor running.
Bring the present. You stay here.
Come on, fellows.
Now we'll know what happened to that girl, Sadie.
Hey, Angelo, did she take the guy with the collar?
No, she climb back in the hay with the army.
Yeah? That's fine.
She's a smart girl, I think.
- Come on.
- What're you doing?
Not bad, huh?
Just watch this one.
- Hello, Tony.
- Hello.
That's pretty hot.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello, stranger.
Chair. Well, Johnny.
Well, you're looking swell.
I thought we were gonna see something of you.
Well, here I am.
Where have you been?
On a vacation?
I've been working.
Up on the North Side, eh, Johnny?
That's what the papers say.
Don't work too hard.
I just finish up tonight.
Now I play a while.
You got your own table,
Camonte.
What's that?
This is a table for two.
Well, maybe you get another table, eh, Johnny?
Hey, listen, you. Who do you think...
All right, go on.
Nothing seems to bother you much, does it?
Well, I get used to noises.
- Hello, Guino.
- Hello, baby.
Why are you always high-hatting me?
Go on, beat it!
I suppose you need an organ grinder to work with?
Tony's inside.
He see you in that outfit?
I looked pretty good from two stories up.
Am I different now?
Wanna dance with me?
Listen, you're Tony's sister, see?
Besides, you're only a kid.
I'm 18.
You like that music?
Now do you wanna dance?
No.
Afraid! Afraid of Tony's sister!
Why you...
Well, I noticed you stood there and watched.
Someday you'll find out you've been missing something.
Hey, how about it?
You and me, eh?
I thought you weren't dancing?
I've changed my mind.
I need exercise.
We show them something, huh?
I think you missed me, huh?
That's right.
We make up for lost time.
How do you wanna play, Tony?
Like this?
That's good.
You wait here.
I take her home myself.
- You can't.
- Shut up!
You'll be sorry for this!
Next time I catch you in a place like that again, I'll kill you!
You're telling me what to do?
I'll do what I want, same as you. Understand?
You listen to me!
I hate you!
Never mind what I do.
That's all right!
But you're gonna stay home.
Understand?
- I'm no baby! I can take care of myself!
- Yeah.
Running around with fellows, eh?
Letting them hold you like that!
Letting them look at you! Dressing up like that for fellows to see, eh?
What I do with fellows is my business!
Cesca!
- Mama.
- Cesca. What's the matter?
What did Tony do to you, huh?
What'd he do?
He hit me. He said he'd kill me and I wasn't doing anything!
I was only dancing.
That's all right, figlia mia.
No cry. All right, tell Mama.
Come on upstairs.
No cry, baby.
He hasn't any right to.
Just because I'm his sister he can't throw me around like that.
No, no, no.
All right, no cry, baby.
I tell you.
I tell you lots of times.
He hurt you. He hurt you.
He hurt everybody.
Pour a little on those tires.
Right.
That's got him.
Just shut up!
Get me some nickels!
Get me some nickels! Hurry!
Lakeside 1305.
Get me a drink.
Hello?
Hello, is this Jim?
Tony Camonte.
Is Rinaldo there?
No, Mr. Camonte.
He left an hour ago.
- Is Lovo there?
- Lovo?
No, he left, too.
Said he was going back to the office.
Bosworth 4503.
Hello.
Hello, Mabel?
Camonte. Rinaldo there?
Why, no.
He ain't been here.
Say, you know, I think that guy's giving me the runaround.
I've had a date with him two or three times...
Maybe he's going home to bed.
What are you talking?
- That tomcat?
- Try Maizie.
Maizie, that's right,
I forgot about her.
Hatfield 6401.
Yeah, 6401.
Come on.
- Hello.
- Hello, Maizie? It's Tony Camonte.
- Rinaldo there?
- Yeah.
For you.
- Hello.
- Hello, Rinaldo.
I'm at Pietro's. Pietro's!
Yeah, come right away.
Anything wrong?
Yeah, plenty.
Go get me a towel.
I thought you weren't doing anything tonight?
I'll be back later.
This is worse than being in love with a grasshopper.
It took you a long time to get here.
- Who done it?
- I don't know.
But I got an idea.
You just wait.
- How do you stand with Lovo?
- Huh?
- Come on!
- How do you stand with Lovo?
- Who's Lovo?
- That's good.
Say when.
That's enough.
You call Johnny Lovo at his office at 10 minutes past 2:00, see?
That's 10 minutes past 2:00.
You say that you're calling from the country now, see?
You're one of the guys that took me for a ride.
The car got smashed and I got away.
The car got smashed and I got away!
Yes, yes.
You think it was Johnny?
I don't know.
But we'll find out now.
We'll be there when Pietro calls.
And if it was Johnny, he'll stall, won't he?
- Sure.
- Let's go.
Open the door.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Tony, where you been?
What happened to you?
Yeah, look.
They spoil my brand new suit.
Who, coppers?
No, monkeys.
Never seen them before.
Somebody must have brought them in.
How did they get you?
They smashed my bus, took me for a ride.
Almost.
That's right.
You left the café alone.
You ought to know better than to do that.
Where were you?
I thought you always stuck to Tony.
Well, baby, I'm glad you got away.
I'd have missed you plenty.
I'll get somebody for this.
I knew you would, Johnny.
That's Poppy.
I don't wanna see her tonight.
I'll tell her you ain't here.
Wait a minute.
I'll talk to her.
Hello? Who?
No, there's nobody here by that name.
What? What?
Oh, ring off.
You got a wrong number.
You better have a drink, Tony.
You?
It's a lie!
I didn't do it!
I wouldn't try anything on you, Tony. We're pals.
Sure, we're pals.
No, no. I didn't do it!
You got me wrong.
Listen, Tony, I brought you out here. I worked with you.
You're the last guy in the world
I'd try to cross, you know that!
You wouldn't do anything to me!
Don't take me, Tony! Give me a chance!
You can have anything I got, anything!
All the dough you want.
Poppy! I'll let you have her!
I give you my word!
You can have Poppy, Tony! I'll tell her!
The boss!
No. Let me go away.
Give me a break.
I never did anything to anybody!
- I never hurt anybody!
- No.
You get somebody else to do it for you!
No!
Wait! Don't!
Tony, come back! Tony...
Oh, Tony.
What's happened?
Where's Johnny?
Where do you think?
Go pack your stuff.
Hey, come here.
Look at that.
Do you remember what I told you?
Tony isn't here.
He's out of town.
You're telling me?
Why did you hang up when I called yesterday?
Too busy.
The one on the end's kind of cute.
She ain't bad.
I should think you'd want something more like...
Like what?
Me.
Cut out that sort of talk.
You're only a kid.
I told you
I had grown-up ideas.
You're like Tony when you go after something, hey?
What would Tony say?
He'll be away for a month.
The big fellow's on his way from Florida.
Uh-huh.
Well, he'd better watch his step.
This town's entirely different than when he left it.
That new crowd down at the City Hall is looking for him.
The first crack he makes, they'll climb all over him.
Hand it to Hap. Tell him to play it for what it's worth.
You stay out here.
- Tony.
- Where's Cesca?
She get a place of her own.
She say to me, "Shut up. Mind your business."
Just like you say.
- Well, is she living alone?
- Yeah.
All the time that's what she tell me, but one day I follow her.
She meet a man.
They go in the house together.
I look and I see her name under the push bell.
See? See what you do?
Once I have a son,
I have a daughter and now...
Ma...
Where is the place she live?
236, Central Street.
What you gonna do? What you...
No, no, Tony, no!
Stop!
Central Street.
He was going downgrade
Making 90 miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
And they found him in the wreck
With his hands on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
It's a mighty rough road
From Lynchburg to Danville
And the track's on the three-mile grade
It was on this road
That he lost his average
You can see what a jump he made
Hello.
Hello, baby.
I'm so happy.
You're telling me?
You do love me, don't you, Guino?
You know I do.
Never stop telling me, will you?
I'm not like all the others, am I?
You're up there all by yourself, sweetheart.
We'll always be happy, won't we?
Hello, Tony.
Tony, I...
Tony, don't! Tony!
Guino! Guino!
Guino! Guino, speak to me!
Speak to me!
Guino, say something! Guino!
Tony, he's my Guino!
I love him.
We were married yesterday,
Tony! Really married!
We were going to surprise you!
Weren't we, Guino?
Oh, darling, speak to me!
He's dead.
He's dead.
He loved me.
Really loved me.
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me!
Stay away from me!
You're not my brother!
Don't you think I know?
Murderer!
He kills people!
He kills everybody!
He kills everything!
He's a butcher.
That's what you are.
You're a butcher!
You're a butcher!
Drive down to the house.
Come on, Boss.
Go on, beat it!
Get out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Mr. Comante's secretary.
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear you.
It's... It's Poppy, Boss.
I got her name.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Tony, what is it?
Tony, say something.
Tony.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
He did, eh?
Did you get the rest of them?
All right, let me talk to Duffy.
All right, Ben, here's what you've been waiting for. Camonte killed Rinaldo.
Put up a fight when they tried to take him and holed up in that steel fort of his.
Get him! Take Madden and his whole outfit.
I'll send you more if you need them.
Yeah, wait a minute, Duffy.
Don't lose any men. Block off the street.
Put your lights on and smoke him out away from his guns and he'll quit!
Get going. Hello, Duffy?
Yeah. Send those monkeys on in.
Tell Jake to stay put.
Tony! Quick, Tony, they're coming!
The police!
Cesca.
They're after you!
They're gonna get you, Tony!
Why didn't you shoot,
Cesca, huh?
Why didn't you shoot?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because you're me and I'm you.
It's always been that way.
Three of you fellows, go on that roof across the street there!
You two cover that alley back of the house.
- Right.
- Right.
Tony, what are we gonna do?
What do we do?
Come here,
I show you what we do.
Tony, they followed me! This is my fault.
I shouldn't have come!
What's the difference?
Your fault, my fault?
Just so you're here, that's all what matters.
Here, you load them, huh?
Sure I'll load them. I'm not afraid.
I'm like you, Tony.
That's the way to talk. You're not afraid, huh?
Come on, we'll show them.
Here, here. Put it here, Cesca.
Put it right here.
We'll show them something.
Hey, look at the monkeys there!
They think they're gonna get
Tony Camonte, eh?
Hey, Cesca, wait, I'll show you.
Look, Cesca, see?
Steel, all steel!
Solid steel!
No one can get in here!
Hey, Cesca, you and me, huh?
We'll show them!
We'll lick them all, the North Side, the South Side!
We'll lick the whole world!
Cesca!
Cesca!
Let me lie down, Tony.
I'm all hollow inside.
Cesca. Cesca, what is it?
Where?
It doesn't hurt, really.
Just put your arms around me,
Tony, just for a minute.
- Cesca.
- I won't be able to help you now.
Oh, you can't go away. I won't let you, you understand? I won't let you!
So dizzy.
Hold me, Tony.
Don't let me get scared.
Listen, you don't understand.
I'll be here all alone!
You can't leave me here all alone!
Why, Tony, you're afraid!
Don't be afraid, Tony.
You're all I got left!
Little Boy, he's gone! Angelo, he's gone!
I'm no good without you,
Cesca. I'm no good by myself!
Cesca!
Cesca!
They're out there! They wanna get me!
They're all there!
Cesca, they won't give me a chance, please!
- Cesca!
- Guino wasn't afraid!
Cesca, don't go.
Please, Cesca!
I won't let you go!
You hear, I won't let you!
You understand?
You gotta stay here, you hear me?
I don't wanna stay!
You're afraid.
Guino. Guino.
Cesca, please. Come back, you hear?
Come back, I say!
Hurry up with that gas.
That second window up there.
All right.
Cesca! Cesca!
Cesca!
I can't see!
Cesca!
Angelo!
Little Boy!
Cesca!
I can't see!
Break it down!
Stop! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, Guarino!
Lookit, I'm all alone.
I got no gun, see?
Give me a break, will you, Guarino?
Break? Who'd you ever give a break to?
Look at me. I got nobody.
I'm all alone!
Little Boy's gone.
Angelo is gone.
And my steel shutters, they don't work.
Shut up, Camonte!
Give me a break, will you?
Don't shoot!
You got me covered.
I can't do nothing!
I can't do nothing!
Give me a break will you?
Listen, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me.
I told you, you'd show up this way.
Get you in a jam without a gun and you squeal like a yellow rat.
Come on! Climb into this.
Wildebeest again.
I think we've seen about a million today.
Look, dear.
Poor darling hasn't even learned how to use his precious eyes.
Rhino.
What a spot for a hunter.
We'll be a hunter someday.
Right now we're too sleepy.
That's a baby.
Cape Town this time tomorrow.
Cape Town and mines and shares and people bowing and scraping.
But we wish we were never going to get there.
Don't say that.
- Superstitious?
- No, of course not.
Then forget about Cape Town and being
Lord Greystoke's favorite nephew.
- Let's enjoy ourselves while we can.
- All right.
Oh, dear, it's waked him.
I'll see if anything can be done about it.
- Is everything all right?
- Just rough air, Mr. Lancing.
This escarpment we're over is not on our map.
Our compass isn't behaving well, either.
- How do you account for it?
- I can't. All this is quite strange to me.
I'll try to get a radio bearing.
These air currents seem to be modeled on a dish of spaghetti.
The radio is dead.
I can't find anything wrong with it, either.
Doesn't that starboard motor sound funny to you?
Yes. Get back in your seat.
Fasten the safety belts, and I'll try to find an open space.
We're losing altitude, dear.
Hand me that blanket quickly.
We'll put him over with us.
Cheetah.
Stop now.
Tarzan, what on earth are you doing?
Why, it's a baby.
- Where did you get it?
- Cheetah find.
One just doesn't find babies in the jungle.
His parents must be frantic.
There, there, now.
- Jane will look after you.
- Jane want?
Want him?
Tarzan, you better go find those poor people.
- Eat first.
- That's right.
Where will we get him some milk?
I guess coconuts will have to do.
Hurry, Tarzan.
The poor little thing's hungry.
Tarzan eat now.
Tarzan, you go get those coconuts at once.
- Baby eat first?
- Yes, of course.
There we are.
First, we'll have a nice warm bath... and then we'll have supper.
And tomorrow, I'll take you back safe and sound to your father and mother... and I won't be a bit surprised if I just hate to give you up.
Hurry, Cheetah.
Careful, now.
Thank you, Cheetah.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
There.
We have your real mother to thank... for bringing so many of these wonderful things on the plane.
And look, she even marked these with your initials. R.L.
I wonder what that stands for.
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
One day, I'll take you out in the jungle, and we'll pick some flowers... and I'll show you the place where Tarzan laid her down to sleep.
At least we can be grateful when those savages found the plane... they didn't disturb her.
Poor dear. How she must have loved you.
Cheetah, stop it.
Now see that you turn on the charm...
because I don't think Tarzan approves of strange young men.
Tarzan, how clever.
Now say, "Thank you, Father."
- "Thank you, Father."
- Tarzan.
Isn't he adorable?
Tarzan, would you watch him for a minute?
- Watch?
- I have something to do in the kitchen.
Would you hold his bottle and see he doesn't choke?
Him no choke.
What is it, Tarzan?
Look, he knows you already.
- He's laughing at you.
- Baby hold.
- That's right. Hold him, baby.
- Baby strong.
Tarzan, he's been with us more than a week now.
- We've got to find him a name.
- Name?
Yes, like Tarzan, Jane, and Cheetah.
Baby's got to have a name, too.
If the Zambeles hadn't taken those men out of the plane... we might have found a clue to his real name.
Baby strong. Call Elephant.
Elephant, with a little nose like that?
Later call Elephant. Now call Boy.
- But that's not a name.
- Boy.
After all, I am his mother.
Tarzan, father. Call Boy.
Then go to your father, Boy.
And later on, he'll teach you all the things you ever need to know in the jungle.
Then look out, all you lions and tigers... and snakes and crocodiles and cannibals out there in the jungle.
The King has a son!
Boy, use both hands.
Tarzan, make him come down.
He'll break his neck.
Tarzan learn when boy.
Neck all right. Boy all right.
I'm always worrying about something, aren't I?
You know, before Boy came...
I used to worry that one day you mightn't come home.
Jane home, Tarzan come home.
I suppose just being perfectly happy makes me afraid.
She's wounded.
Guns. White people.
Where's she going?
She's going a long way to the elephants' graveyard.
- And she's leaving her baby here with us.
- Who'll take care of him?
Perhaps our Timba will adopt the poor little thing.
Remember she lost her baby in the river last year?
Leave him alone, darling.
You can play with him when he gets to know you a little bit better.
Boy, were you bitten?
- Boy all right.
- Now that he's growing up...
something like this seems to happen every time we take our eyes off him.
There's never a moment
I'm not afraid for him.
Tarzan, this life's all right for you.
Certainly it's all right for me, but for a child...
What's the matter?
Take Boy home.
Come on, Boy.
What was that?
Whatever it was, our friends, the Gabonis, have had enough.
- What was that, Mr. Sande?
- I think that was Tarzan.
Tarzan? What's Tarzan?
We better check our position with the photographs, Sir Thomas.
Never can tell when the Gabonis will get their nerve back again.
These pictures match the country, don't you think, Sande?
According to this, the plane's almost directly above there... on top of the escarpment.
We can take a look.
Camp here, Mooloo.
Hang on. Is this Tarzan a white man or a white ape?
He's white, at any rate.
According to Holt... he's absolute master of this whole escarpment.
All right.
They won't charge if we leave them alone.
What's that?
That's just an okapi, Mrs. Lancing.
Okapi? Never heard of it.
A very rare animal.
The old-time hunters used to think it was a cross between a giraffe and a zebra.
Looks it, too, in a way.
What is it, Mooloo?
- They found the plane!
- Come on.
No question it's their plane.
- Is there any...
- Not a trace. Clean as a whistle.
You certainly do what you undertake.
You brought us right to the place.
So all we need now is an affidavit from Mr. Sande here... to the effect that we've discharged our obligation.
Then we can go home and live in style for ever after.
It's my belief they survived the crash.
Otherwise, there'd be some sort of trace.
But if they were alive... surely we'd have had some word from them in the past five years.
Isn't it possible they're being held somewhere?
- Held?
- Yes, captive in some native juju hut.
- Magic and all that.
- It's most unlikely.
- But isn't it possible?
- Yes, it's possible, of course.
Then we'll go on searching as long as there's the least hope.
If only one of them is alive, we'll take that one back to England... no matter who tries to stand in our way.
Boys see tree devil, bwana.
Tarzan.
Looks like a warning against trespassing.
Which means that if we keep on... we're certain to meet the one person who may have definite news for us.
- We must look for him at once.
- No, don't take your guns.
How did your friend Holt say we make contact?
Tarzan makes contact himself when he's ready.
Good day, sir.
I suppose we ought to explain our intrusion.
- Go!
- Who are you?
Tarzan. Go!
But look here, we came all this way to find some white people...
- That's enough of that.
- Steady.
This is a precaution of my own.
Tarzan, wait!
- What's the matter?
- People.
Tell this creature he can't treat us like this.
My husband has learned not to trust guns.
- Your husband?
- Yes.
Yours?
Perhaps we should introduce ourselves.
We're from London.
I'm Austin Lancing, Mrs. Lancing... my uncle, Sir Thomas, and Mr. Sande, in charge of the party.
Hello.
No. These people are from my home.
Shall we go to my house and eat?
We don't want to put you to any trouble.
Nonsense. Of course we do.
We're famished.
Then you can tell me all about London.
We go.
I hope she won't give us ostriches to eat.
Nothing as elaborate as all that,
Mrs. Lancing.
I'm afraid at such short notice, there'll be nothing but fruit.
Evidently, one's ears become acute out here.
Nothing compared to Tarzan's, of course.
Mr. Sande's told us about your husband's marvelous instincts:
Like a wild animal.
- I didn't exactly say that, Mr. Lancing.
- Don't apologize, Mr. Sande.
Tarzan and I have a high opinion of wild animals and their habits.
I haven't often gone against Tarzan's instincts.
When I have, I've been wrong.
Get in. It's quite safe.
What a charming way to live.
Here we are.
- I say, all the conveniences.
- Yes, by George.
- Mother.
- Hello, darling.
- Your son?
- What a dear little fellow.
- What's his name?
- We call him Boy.
That's not his real name?
Say, "How do you do?" Go on.
- Cat's got his tongue.
- Hello, Boy.
- How do you do?
- That's right.
No cats up here.
No, nothing but lions. I know.
- Shall we go in now and get lunch?
- Splendid.
- Will you excuse me?
- Why, certainly.
Sit.
- Eat.
- Thank you.
Delicious. What's the name of these things?
Food.
You know what they're called, young man?
- Food.
- Dreadful savages, aren't they?
Eat.
I think I'll see if I can be of any help in the kitchen.
Something I can do?
You could get me an egg. They're in there.
- Just one apiece?
- I think one will be enough.
Thank you.
You must get pretty good hunting up here.
Lions with a jackknife, that's sport.
My dear boy, have your breakfast before Tarzan eats you raw.
Cheetah, turn on the fan.
I'm afraid your husband feels we're intruding.
- Not really.
- There's no real harm in us.
- Merely a search party.
- Search party?
But there hasn't been a safari here in years.
It wasn't a safari exactly.
The Richard Lancings were flying to Cape Town.
As a matter of fact, it's five years since they disappeared.
A while ago, we found their cracked-up plane outside of our camp.
They're inquiring about some friends, Tarzan.
You say they were relatives of yours?
Yes, the man was a second cousin.
A nephew of the late Earl of Greystoke.
I may say a favorite nephew.
Am I to understand that you have some news of our relations?
Tarzan, will you take Boy for his swim?
I don't think he can be interested in this.
Please, Tarzan.
- Come, Boy, swim.
- Swim.
Well?
They and their pilot never reached Cape Town.
Oh, my dear.
When we got to the plane... we found evidence that the natives had been there before us.
- The Gabonis?
- No.
There's another savage tribe up here on the escarpment... the Zambeles, off to the southwest.
It's their custom to use their male victims in a horrible sort of magic.
Tarzan and I found the girl and we buried her where she's safe.
But the men were gone.
I understand why you didn't wish to speak of it before the boy.
I suppose we'll be starting back tomorrow.
All right. How about getting past the Gabonis?
I'll put you on a way...
that won't take you through the Gaboni country.
That's very obliging of you.
Our cousins had a child with them.
We buried the child with his mother.
Our entire family will be very grateful to you.
I can show you the grave now, if you'd like.
Thank you. Whenever it's convenient.
We shall be about here for a day or two.
- Wouldn't you like to see it now?
- Yes, why not?
Might I say goodbye to Boy and Tarzan before I go?
Please, not today.
He's been so difficult and not behaving.
- Shall we start?
- Yes.
Poor young Richard's wife.
Everything to live for:
Youth, health, wealth.
A splendid young husband and a little son.
- It was a son?
- A son?
I believe so.
What a future that child would have had.
My brother Neville's will left everything in trust for 20 years to come.
Not a penny for the next of kin until
Richard has been definitely proven dead.
Which explains our touching family interest here.
Sir Thomas makes this sound too sordid, my dear.
Naturally we'd have given anything to have found them alive.
We'll never forget what you've done here.
We owe you and your husband more than we can repay.
Roughly €1 million, split three ways.
Oh, then it's all right, then.
I'm so glad. I mean, that we were able to do what we did.
I'll come to your camp at dawn tomorrow and put you on your way, just as I said.
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Goodbye and thank you.
- My love to the boy.
- Goodbye.
Well, we're rich.
Uncle Tom doesn't seem especially thrilled.
Under the circumstances,
I'm sure you'll forgive me for not gloating.
We'd better start packing for tomorrow.
Coming, Uncle Tom?
No. I think I'll stop here for a pipe or two.
Really, he's becoming more and more impossible.
What harm?
Boy, no!
Boy, no!
Tarzan say no.
Look out, Boy.
Boy bad.
Don't be a silly ass.
Just a gift for the boy.
Tell him it's from the old gentleman.
I wish that awful thing would stop.
No dinner, thank you.
Have the boys ready at dawn, and no thorns in their feet.
We shan't be leaving here tomorrow.
- I beg your pardon.
- That boy...
Eyes I seem to have looked into before.
Even the shape of Richard Lancing's chin.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
That child's your second cousin.
And, by George, my grandnephew.
No, it can't be possible.
Austin, you knew it all along.
Yes, and Sande knows it, too.
Don't you, Sande?
I really don't see how it concerns me.
There's an established custom in dealing with those matters.
Established custom?
If it's ivory the party's after... the hunter in charge usually gets
10% of whatever they bring out.
Very well.
I suppose we'll have to let it go at that.
You can count on me, then.
Perhaps I don't quite follow.
We're all going to keep absolutely mum.
The boy will never know who he is or how we robbed him.
Blood doesn't mean much to you, does it, Austin?
I'm not rich enough to afford sentimentality.
Supposing I consent to all this... and supposing even that Mr. Sande...
doesn't one day take it in his head to blackmail you... what if some other party should get up here and stumble over your secret?
It's confounded risky, but we got to face it.
But, darling, there needn't be any risk if we bring the boy back with us.
Bring the boy with us?
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you see?
If we're his legal guardians... won't we administer everything?
Of course that Tarzan brute will fight.
Perhaps she may listen to reason.
We'll surround the place in the morning, then go in with guns.
Maybe we'll catch him asleep.
There's one thing you both seemed to have overlooked.
At the guardianship proceedings...
I shall testify that your intentions are not only unsympathetic... to my grandnephew's best interests, but hostile to them.
Downright dangerous.
- Is that quite final?
- Not quite.
I'm going to have a little chat with Tarzan.
Yes, Mr. Lancing?
Sir Thomas seems to be in for a bout of fever.
I'm afraid we'll have to confine him to his tent.
Post two of your best boys... to see that he doesn't slip out during his delirium.
I suppose, Austin, there's a cad in every family.
Obviously you're ours.
I'm for bed.
I'm exhausted, too.
We need the men at dawn.
We're taking the little fellow at sunrise.
- They'll be ready.
- All right.
Good night.
What the deuce is the matter here?
Boy say white devil come back.
Boy say two devils.
Where's my gun?
- Tent.
- Idiot, I just looked there.
Someone was in my tent.
What's my camera doing there?
Look, the plate's been exposed.
Come on. It might've picked up something.
That boy saw the devil all right.
He's cleverer than you are, Austin.
He knew you wanted the boy before you knew it yourself.
If he thinks we're beaten as he's got the guns... he'll find he's too clever for his own good.
Look.
Watch Sir Thomas.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Aren't you ready?
I believe you know we can't possibly start.
Why? Did something happen?
Stop, please.
You sent him here last night.
Tarzan was here?
Not a gun left. He stole every one of them.
Tarzan stole your guns?
He wanted to make sure we'd be helpless...
when we came to ask you to give up the boy.
Then he must have known all the time.
Perhaps now we can start being honest with each other.
Where is Sir Thomas?
He's ill. He's got a touch of fever.
I'm sorry.
I think we need him badly just now.
My dear, I know your heart must be breaking.
Why should it be?
When Tarzan and I took Boy out of the jungle... we gave him life as truly as though we'd been his real parents.
He's ours.
Your legal rights can't touch us up here.
We aren't going to give him up.
My dear, I hope it isn't a question of anybody's legal rights.
It's the boy's rights we must all think of now.
Certainly. We're putting aside our selfish interest in all this.
Do you want him to grow up a jungle savage?
In England, he'll be educated to the responsibilities of his great position.
You don't want to stand in the little chap's way.
When he's old enough, he can decide that for himself.
How can he decide about something he's never seen?
Aren't you forgetting that every hour out here, he's in dreadful danger.
Tarzan's here. He watches over us.
Can Tarzan guard against fever?
There isn't a hospital or a doctor within 1,000 miles.
We'll love him just as you do.
And when he gets used to his new life, we'll bring him here for a visit.
Let me think.
Go!
Give us our guns back and we will go.
He says he's thrown the guns in Garuva Grotto.
Come.
Ropes will get us down.
No, under those falls the water's 50 feet deep.
Nobody can get them now.
Tarzan will get them for you.
No.
Go!
No, Tarzan, these are Boy's people.
Tarzan father. Jane mother.
People want Boy.
Go!
You can't expect us to go with nothing to defend us. It's murder.
Go!
That's Boy, and he's in trouble.
Look out!
Boy, darling, are you hurt?
- Is he all right?
- Just a few scratches and bruises.
- Sande, get that first-aid kit.
- Boy all right.
- Sande, get the safari boys.
- No, please wait.
Give me a little time.
Come on.
She seems to be convinced.
She may be. What about him?
Suppose we leave that to her for the present.
Such a tired little boy.
And I don't wonder.
Good night.
They were right, you know.
Right?
We've got to let them take him.
If we love Boy... we've got to let him go.
- Jane, stop!
- I won't stop. I've got to say this.
I know what it's like back there.
You have no way of imagining the things that civilization can give him.
Things we never could give him here.
And he'll be safe, Tarzan. Safe.
Oh, darling.
Help me to give him up.
Sleep now.
Is there nothing I can say or do that'll change your mind?
If I ask you to do it because you love me?
No. Boy stay.
Jane, sleep.
I've been thinking and thinking.
It would be like taking their lives if we send them back without their guns.
- Give them back to them, Tarzan.
- People take Boy.
I've thought about that, too.
We'll go now while they're still asleep... and in the morning, when they find their guns... you and I and Boy will be gone.
And they'll never find us, and they'll go away.
- Boy stay here?
- Of course.
Give them their guns, Tarzan.
Tarzan get guns.
We'd better hurry.
It's almost dawn. The birds are awake.
Go.
Your knife.
Come.
Tarzan, I know you'll never forgive me, but I'll be back for you.
Then, if you want to send me away, I'll go.
Good as new.
Lucky they were well-greased.
- Is he still down there?
- Just as she told us.
Not making any attempt to get out?
He doesn't seem to be moving at all.
Just the same, I wouldn't trust him.
Funny, I've seen trapped animals take it just like that.
Sorry this was necessary.
Not at all.
I've been quite comfortable.
Understand, Uncle Tom.
Any heroics now will put me in a very awkward position.
She's made the decision.
What more have I to say?
Why, hello, Boy.
We appreciate that this is very difficult for you.
- Can we start now?
- Yes.
- Get the boys ready, Sande.
- All right.
Mother, where are we going?
Mr. And Mrs. Lancing are going to take you on a lovely long trip.
Won't that be fun?
But where's Tarzan?
He'll be coming soon.
There's Sir Thomas.
Looking very well, too.
Quite well, thank you, under the circumstances.
You will look after the boy, won't you?
I couldn't let him go under any other circumstances.
Send him home, darling.
All right, Sande, we're starting. Look alive.
The route seems plain enough.
It branches further on.
Don't turn. You don't know I'm here.
My poor girl, you've done a mad thing.
Boy's in the worst possible hands.
Be careful, for heaven's sake.
They're watching.
My nephew and his wife only want Boy's fortune.
There's nothing now they'll stop at.
Tarzan has to be set free.
I'm going to make a run for it.
They're watching every move you make.
I'll try to drop back.
All right.
Stop where you are.
You've killed him.
I didn't bargain for this.
You're in this as deep as we are.
Mother, I want to go home.
Yes, darling. We're going back.
Come, dear.
This is the right way. Come on.
The right way back to Tarzan?
Not that he worries us, now we got our guns.
This looks like the trail.
Why don't we keep straight on?
But that way goes through the Zambele country.
- Zambeles, huh?
- Yes, I told you about them.
They're the tribe that took
Boy's father's body from the plane.
- Can't you see she's lying?
- Come on.
I'm telling you the truth.
- You can't go that way.
- Come on.
- Come here.
- Leave him alone.
Ouch! The little beast bit me.
What are you doing to him?
Darling, did they hurt you?
For his own sake, you better control that brat.
Come on.
Come on, darling.
What's that?
That used to be a full-grown man.
Perhaps we'd better turn back.
We haven't got a minute to lose.
Get the men started.
- The Zambeles.
- Run for it.
We have no chance.
Let them take the guns.
No, you can't.
Don't move, anybody. Just keep calm.
Tell him I want to speak to his chief.
Come, bwana.
Don't you worry, Mother.
I won't let them hurt you.
Boy, listen.
If you were out there in the jungle...
could you find your way back to Tarzan?
Of course I could.
It's further than you've ever gone alone.
How can I get out, Mother?
Look.
You think you could get through there?
If he can, I can.
- Tarzan will be so proud of you.
- No, it's better if we all stick together.
Boy's getting out of this place now.
He hasn't got a chance.
He'll have his chance.
Now, Boy, listen carefully.
- Next time you hear that shout, be ready.
- Yes.
And you're not to stop for anything until you're far away in the jungle.
And more than anything else, don't look back.
No matter what you hear.
Don't you worry, Mother.
Tarzan and I'll come back to get you.
Yes, darling, I know.
Yes, Mother?
- Will you promise me something?
- Yes.
Will you promise me that as long as you live... you'll never forget... forget the things that Tarzan has taught you?
No, I won't forget.
And when you see Tarzan, tell him that...
Tell him from me...
I expect when he sees you, there won't be any need to tell him anything at all.
- Are you ready, Boy?
- Ready, Mother.
Remember what I told you:
Fast as you can and don't look back.
Go.
Clean away. Did you see him?
Just like Tarzan.
Before I go, please listen.
I know now how right you are.
Boy belongs here with you.
Don't ever let him go.
Go now.
Please try to forgive me.
Later on, you'll know that I...
Jane not go.
Jane not die.
Jane all right?
Yes, darling.
Everything's all right now.
There they are:
Refugees from Anshan, or what used to be Anshan before General Yang rode through it.
And who is
General Yang?
Why, he's the warlord of this province, and a swell guy to do business with.
But why does he want to destroy his own towns?
Oh, because they refuse to pay their taxes.
Well, I should think those people would learn how to obey the law, rather than suffer this.
Ah, these people have no nerves, no feelings.
They're used to suffering.
But they can't get used to paying.
Excuse me, Madam.
You got a match,
Colonel?
No,
I don't smoke.
Colonel.
Refuse me a match, will you?
But I haven't a match.
And those people didn't have the pennies to pay General Yang.
Think it over.
He's cute.
What is his name?
Sam.
How does he keep cool in this hot weather?
Room 26.
Stay there, Sam.
I bring you greetings from Mr. Wu, General Pen.
I'm O'Hara.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara.
You startled me at first.
I didn't expect him to send a foreigner.
Well, he thought I'd have a better chance of getting through.
Mr. Wu is very wise.
With his help, we will rid the province of Yang and his locusts.
Riding through,
I didn't see much left for Yang to plunder.
The bark on trees, perhaps.
And that is why he has made so many short, desperate raids the past months.
His ordinary soldiers are deserting by the dozens for the lack of rice.
His ammunition is so little, it is distributed chiefly among his personal guard.
Dear O'Hara, this is the time we have waited for.
Here is the money.
Mr. Wu gave you instructions?
To the "T."
To which, allow me to add,
I am ashamed to say,
"Be careful."
Not only for the love we bear you, but for the sake of that money, and the guns it will buy.
I'll get through.
It is of my opinion that
General Yang would sacrifice half his personal guard for that belt.
Which is to say, he would give his arms and legs for it.
You don't advise the train from Pengwa?
No.
Wait for the plane in Pengwa.
It will be arranged.
Good.
And even there,
General Yang has special agents.
So be careful and only by plane.
Mr. O'Hara.
From the time you close that door, until the time you deliver that money to Mr. Wu in Shanghai, the fate of the people of this entire province is in your hands.
I'll get through.
Must be a very careful job.
I can do it.
Why all the secrecy?
'Cause the man O'Hara is here in Pengwa.
General Yang says-
I know.
I've done those jobs for him before, all kinds.
General Yang knows he can trust me.
Your shot, Judy.
Your daughter has beautiful form,
Mr. Perrie.
Don't worry about her.
I got it all straight, see, so you don't need to worry.
I'm to get this O'Hara on a train, and then leave the rest to you.
He's got something
General Yang wants, huh?
Yes.
Money for an opposite side with which to buy guns.
For this reason, care must be exercised.
Also for the reason the General himself needs guns badly.
Hmm.
O'Hara by any chance a cock-eyed fellow?
No. American.
Staying at your hotel.
I'll point him out to you later.
Well, you know, it won't be easy to get a man like that on a train when he wants to go by plane.
A beautiful woman does it very easy.
She's high-spirited, don't worry.
Wait for me,
I'll be back.
I'll wait.
Now, Judy.
Judy.
Please, Judy.
No. No. No!
All right.
I'm not luring men to their death on trains, a man I never saw.
Judy.
Open this for me, will you?
What good are these pills?
I don't know.
Someone said they were good.
Who?
Someone.
I can't remember.
I've had so many doctors.
This is no place for us,
China.
Isn't it, Pete?
A man ought to die at home, a Christian death.
L- I've waited months for a chance to make enough to leave.
Now it's possible.
Oh, please don't come back to that again.
If you'll help, it's possible.
Well, maybe it doesn't mean much to you.
You never saw America.
But if I have six months to live-
You want to live it there.
New York. Nyack.
L- I'd get a house on the hill looking over the river.
Oh, it means so much, it does.
L- I want to sit there.
There's boats.
They go up and down the river.
You can't do this to me, Judy.
You're me, my kid.
It's six months, then you're free.
You can do what you want then, but help me now.
Oh, what's the use?
You've been playing me for a sucker for as many years as I'm old.
Will you do it?
Sure.
Sure, I will.
Why not?
Don't feel like that,
Judy.
I don't feel any way at all. I...
Just leave me alone, will you?
Maybe someday there will be a law to abolish the blues.
Something big, like an amendment to the Constitution.
For all of us.
O'Hara is now on the train, from the other side.
Can you beat it?
He's afraid.
Don't blame him.
Goodbye.
He's on.
Any cigarettes?
Be careful,
Judy.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yang's stopping the train at 8:00.
See you after then.
See you tomorrow.
Boo.
He remembers me.
Did you expect me?
What are you doing hiding behind doors?
I live here till tomorrow.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Do you like me,
Judy?
I wish you hadn't come.
Do you?
Like you?
Yes.
It's comfortable.
"Cozy," said the spider to the fly.
Preparations?
Lots of things on the ground don't like me.
For instance?
Well, uh...
There are certain busy Lizzies who scoot around taking potshots.
At you?
Mmm-hmm.
But the train's moving.
Sure, the train's moving, and it's nighttime and we're alone.
And I like the lady and she likes me.
Judy, you've got me by the throat, and I'm telling you, whether it's dopey or not.
Judy.
Don't do that.
No?
You don't want to do that.
That's what you say.
What do you think of that,
Sam?
Come on.
You know, Judy, uh,
I'm not one of the anxious boys.
You're a good guy.
I can wait.
Wanna hear something funny?
I'm crazy for a laugh.
I'm scared. Afraid.
Because of me?
Yes.
Well, I'm a man of infinite patience.
Sure.
You have a whole lifetime ahead.
It was only the mail.
Why are you so jumpy?
I told you, lots of things on the ground don't like me.
Why do they make those attempts on your life?
A certain honorable tootsie roll named Yang thinks he has the right to control the lives of tens of thousands of poor Chinese.
How?
Military dictatorship.
Taxes.
You put, he takes.
You protest, he shoots.
A heartbreaker, a strike breaker, a head breaker.
Altogether a four-star rat.
And what do the poor ones say?
Me. That's where I come in.
They're preparing underground.
They need good guns and ammunition.
You'll sell to them?
And, naturally, your Yang doesn't care for that?
You uttered a profound mouthful, lady.
Why do you risk your life, O'Hara?
What do you get for it?
Money? Fun?
Here's my life in a few lines:
Ran away from an orphan asylum at 14.
Sold newspapers on the street and got pretty good at ducking blows.
A life of opposition, you'd call it.
Then I boxed for a living, you know.
Didn't like smacking other kids around, so I quit.
Dock walloper for a year, road construction, then I joined an aviation outfit.
A bunch of us came over here in '29 to fly planes, and some of the fellows are still flyin' planes and dropping bombs on the same people
I'm working for.
You ask me why I'm for oppressed people?
Because I've got a background of oppression myself, and O'Haras and elephants don't forget.
What's better work for an American than helping fight for democracy? Do you know?
No, I don't.
But do you believe all that?
That's like asking do I believe I'm alive.
I hope to spit, I believe it.
If I believed like that in anything,
I'd do a dance.
Why do you look at me like that?
Can't I look?
Can't I kiss you?
Ask my mother.
Mrs. Perrie, may I kiss your daughter, huh?
Thank you.
What did she say?
She said it's okay.
Very soon, Herr General.
Isn't that marvelous?
They're playing hooky from a padded cell.
Look at him.
You're full of jokes, aren't you?
Why not? I don't meet a good girl in 10 years, and you expect me to be dumb.
So eat your cabbage and don't stick pins in papa.
Dinner and hurry it.
Quiet, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Not very.
You're pretty delicate.
Waiter.
Oh, hello, O'Hara.
Hello.
Who's that?
A Shanghai journalist.
Writes on an
English-speaking paper.
You can buy him for a bag of salt.
How you been?
Fine.
Chiseler.
What's the time?
My watch has stopped.
Ten minutes to 8:00.
Can I tell you something?
Something I can write down in my diary?
Why won't you be serious?
Why? What for?
The Lord made the world in six days, and on the seventh...
Oh-oh. The moles are working underground.
Don't go out there.
Why not?
You're in trouble.
Am I?
They're waiting.
Who is?
I say, do you know what it is?
Cloudburst.
I'm a newspaperman,
General Yang.
With newspapermen, me all the time gentle.
Caught yourself a public enemy, huh?
That's a fact.
Very bad man, et cetera.
Mind if I tell our readers?
No, I don't mind.
Also print my picture?
Sure.
Front page stuff.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nice friends you got.
Don't blame me for this, young man.
I'm a plain passenger on the train.
Sorry what they're doing to you.
Awful, but don't blame me.
Good, I won't have to remember your face.
Come on, Sam.
Greetings.
Breath purifier?
Thanks. I have got a bad taste in my mouth.
What's on your mind,
Yang?
General Yang.
General Yang, Sam.
Very sweet.
Aw!
Sad.
Mr. O'Hara, you are a big bother on me.
Looks pretty black for you from where I sit, Yang.
Real opposition begins.
The old days are through.
For my money, sweetheart, you're sitting on a porcupine.
Mr. Buddha.
That's a fact.
That's the only way they ever leave me.
They do shameful thing, lose face, then kill self.
Someday even they'll get wise, your fanatics, and cut you down like the rice is reaped.
Huh!
My guards faithful.
Stay with General Yang until each one himself becomes General, and I biggest General of all 12 provinces.
Yang Incorporated, merchants of war with 12 dummy partners, huh?
I don't like you to interfere.
Why you help my enemy, hmm?
I'd do anything I could to give you a kick in the pants.
To my jaundiced eye, you're a social disease.
I don't like your disposition,
I don't like your friends,
I don't like your politics, and I don't like your hat.
Your faithful dozen may stick to you, but you're still a small noise at the end of a parade.
Mr. O'Hara seems so little interested in his life.
You'd take chances, too.
I have a great destiny.
So have I, but mine is tied up with millions of people.
Yours is tied up with yourself, and the power of machine guns.
Your belief is in your own very limited self.
Mine is in people.
One day, they will all walk on earth, straight, proud.
Men, not animals, with no fear of hunger or poverty.
That's not so bad to die for, sweetheart.
The time has come when even, even peasants dare to laugh in the face of officer and General.
Pal, my nose bleeds for you.
Give me the money.
Couldn't Wong find it?
He's saying no money in your place.
Cough up, Sam.
Give me the money.
The eight characters of destiny are against you.
No money tonight.
Eight characters say you are a liar.
Come and get it.
Fight?
Give me.
All right.
This is the money.
You don't have to worry an iota.
I'll take it right to him.
Uh, Brighton.
That's his name?
Yes,
Brighton.
He is waiting at the Mansion House,
Shanghai.
And
B- R-l-G-H-T-O-N.
Now I got it all in my head, every word of it.
No mistake?
Oh!
General Yang never forgets mistakes.
Say, am I honest or am I not?
After all,
I...
I keep Mr. O'Hara for now.
Maybe his Shanghai friends make trouble, et cetera, maybe.
You're a running dog.
Thanks.
Very good man.
Teaches my men discipline and how to make war.
We will float down the river to Shanghai together, me and O'Hara.
Pick up ammunition also together.
Two days from now, we arrive.
If Mr. O'Hara's friends make trouble, if I don't get ammunition,
Mr. O'Hara don't arrive.
No hummingbird can fight 15 wolves,
Mr. O'Hara.
Now, was that so terrible as you thought?
The Mansion House.
Mr. Brighton.
Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
I'm Mr. Brighton.
Thank you.
No news?
No.
I am very worried.
Something is very wrong.
Drink hearty, my friend.
Oh, no, you don't.
You can't get away with that.
I won't even drink this drink.
You're trying to get me drunk, so I'll wait here for your man O'Hara.
But I won't.
Now, look here, Woozy.
Don't you know
I can't lay around this harbor with that load of guns?
Any minute, the gitchie-witchies are liable to hop on us and we're sunk.
What do you think
I'm doin'?
Waitin' till the kids get out of school to sell them lollipops and pretzels?
No, it's munitions.
It's illegal.
Plenty guns.
Plenty bullets.
Plenty noise.
And you, none of your philosophical remarks.
Get me, Chennie?
Is he comin' or not?
No philosophy.
Have a drink, my friend.
Oh! Take the wax out of your ears.
Don't you hear me?
You can't get me tight.
Mr. Brighton, it is no such intention in my mind.
But we are expecting an information from Mr. O'Hara this morning.
What was in that wire you got?
Oh! Smart, very smart.
Well, you get six more hours and then I sell to the first comer.
That's what was in that wire.
Get me?
Got you.
You forget the glass.
Oh.
I'll be under that moose head and a stuffier piece of stuffin' I've never seen.
"I'll be glad when you're dead"
"You rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead"
"you rascal you"
Detestable man.
Who is it?
Don't know.
Thank you.
Pete.
What?
Where are you going?
I'll be back.
Where are you going?
Down to the bar... for a tonic.
No more bets on the ponies?
Now, Judy, have I got money for bets?
I don't know.
Have you?
I surely don't understand your attitude.
Pick up that shipment for Yang, first thing.
Of course. Of course.
Of course. Why, of course.
Well, I must say, what a funny world where a man's own daughter don't trust him. I must say.
No one mistrusts you, Pete, but I just happen to be worried about that O'Hara boy.
So please be careful.
Sure.
Oh, you dog.
Oh, you dog, you.
What are you looking at, banjo eyes?
He drink for three days now.
Who is he?
Name Mr. Brighton.
Oh! Mr. Brighton?
Yeah.
Waiting for somebody.
He got plenty money.
Say he go to hard-knock university.
Every morning, he eats two double lamb chops.
Also has two sisters live in Washington, D.C.
His favorite song:
"I'll be glad when you die, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad"
"When you're dead, you rascal you"
See?
I found this sign on the floor, Mademoiselle.
Thank you.
My foot.
I am Wu, Mademoiselle.
And?
I bring to Mademoiselle the greetings of the house.
A custom here.
Good brandy?
Yes.
Our four-star is better.
Brandied duck is with us a house specialty.
I never eat brandied duck.
Very friendly on the stomach.
Like our small creature here.
You have him long?
Two years.
Call him.
What?
Mademoiselle, call the animal to you.
What for?
Call him.
Maybe if you call him with name.
Maybe if you say to him,
"Sam."
What do you want?
Where is O'Hara?
Who is O'Hara?
Mademoiselle, you are indelicate.
You do not know him, nor the creature here?
Your Mr. O'Hara was taken off a train last night.
General Yang do it?
Yes.
What else?
I don't know what else.
What do you mean?
You don't know more?
No.
The animal was left behind.
You're sure nothing more? Please.
Why should I lie?
Mademoiselle has already lied once.
Who in the world are you to demand the truth?
A great friend of O'Hara.
And what's that got to do with me?
Shanghai is filled with dangerous persons,
Mademoiselle.
Be careful.
Of what? Do you-
You will be watched.
You like to fish?
It bores me.
Why are you so very much interested in my country, my, uh, people?
How many times before you buy guns for people of my province?
Maybe I fix you so you really don't talk.
Interesting idea, no?
Yang, that money was the bitterly earned personal property of 500,000 oppressed people who want your heel off their collective neck.
They trusted me with it, and I failed.
If I live to ever look them in the face, it will be with far greater difficulty than facing you.
Do I make myself clear?
No.
I'm saying, bring on your fires and your devils.
You've already done all you can to me, or I've done it myself.
Mr. O'Hara has so little regard for his life.
He sounds, sounds almost like Chinese.
That makes me a candidate for your guard, don't it?
No. You are too much interested in women.
That's a fact.
You eat fresh fish tonight.
Thanks.
When we arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, maybe fresh fish eat you.
Hmm, thanks.
When does she sail?
Midnight tomorrow.
I'd like to book two bedrooms and a sitting room.
Two bedrooms and-
It's for me and my daughter.
Oh, yes, Mr...
Uh, Martin. Martin.
Mr. Martin.
Peter Martin.
Peter Martin.
I'll pay you now, cash.
How much is it?
Was the name Martin, did you say?
Yes, Martin,
Peter Martin.
Midnight tomorrow,
Mr. Martin.
Seems everybody in these parts have two names.
Have they?
That one is either a thief or a liar.
Really?
He gave a fake name.
I've seen it by the initials on his wallet.
How are you on pears?
24 hours more, and still no news.
I shall lose my mind waiting.
The boy must be dead.
Has the girl made any moves?
In 24 hours, nothing suspicious.
"I'll be glad"
"When you're dead, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
Believe me,
Mr. Chen, it's lucky if more complications do not set in.
Oh, where are you coming from?
Down the bar, having a drink.
Down the bar? Why?
What's the matter?
Headache.
Oh.
You've been looking awfully worried these last 24 hours.
Well, knock on wood, huh.
Everything's shipshape.
We'll be out of here by midnight.
We're on our way, huh?
What's that for?
Shh.
Who's that?
I don't know.
A fat man.
How did he get here?
He sneaked in, looked through your bags.
Better open up, brother. Who are you?
I was inside when he came.
He didn't see me.
I can make an awful racket, maybe break down the door.
You wouldn't like that disturbance, would you?
Better call the police, Pete.
No, no!
Open up.
Judy, don't get excited.
Judy?
What's the matter?
Nothing, nothing.
We don't know who he is and-
Where's your gun?
In my bag.
Stand back.
Come out of there.
Put down your popgun.
Who are you?
I'm the angle man.
W- what?
When you're in trouble,
I work out the angles.
We'll find an angle,
Brother Perrie, and, uh, Miss Perrie,
I might add.
And what's all that supposed to mean?
Well, from the General to the specific, you're on a very interesting project.
No one here knows what you're talking about.
Now you get out.
We'll have the police on you in 10 seconds.
Get out.
Now, I'm not the smartest man in the world, brother, but I'm not the dumbest.
You send for the police.
Yes, you do that little thing.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Judy, this man's a big imposter of some sort, a- a faker...
He's gonna share some money with me.
What money?
That's what
I came to find out.
Oh, come on, get out of here.
You admit you don't know what you're talking about.
But your father, he knows.
Just look at him.
He needs a friend.
A bird's-eye-view man like me that knows the town, all the back alleys.
Get out!
You have it in your power to stop me from leaving,
Brother Perrie.
Pete?
One final word,
Brother Perrie.
If you were thinking of escaping with a large sum of money, and you know you are, it'd be absolutely fatal not to insure yourself with a man like me.
Oh, excuse me,
I forgot to introduce myself.
The name is Leach.
And I want one-third of it.
I shall be downstairs in the bar.
And I shan't consider it an imposition if you should call on me when you need me.
Judy-
I don't want one trembling word out of you, not one.
All I want to know is what you're doing with those Yang funds?
Shh.
Don't duck, Pete, answer my question.
You can't frighten me.
I won't give it up. Not a cent.
You'll have to. I'm not gonna let the O'Hara boy get killed.
I don't care if he does. Here are the tickets.
We're going to the States.
You mean you are.
I'll get there.
In a coffin.
Judy, help me, please.
Not this year.
Judy, don't you see, it's for you.
I can't use all this money-
Oh, stop that.
Think about buying what you want-
Are you picking up that shipment or not?
Are you?
No.
What are you going to do?
Get out of my way.
You won't tell anyone?
Won't I?
No. Because that would be patricide.
Killing your own father.
You couldn't do it, Judy.
But you're murdering O'Hara.
You can do that.
It doesn't mean the slightest, dumbest thing to you that I haven't slept for two nights because of him.
Oh, it's nice to talk about "patricide" and "poor father," but that
I'm crazy about the boy doesn't make you wink an eye.
Do you care about him or me?
Do you care about me a nickel's worth?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Will you tell him?
I might.
You wouldn't dare.
Maybe you're wrong.
Or right.
If I were the heroine of a novel,
I'd know what to do.
Pull a plane out of one sleeve, a fat checkbook out of the other, get the Marines, and put the situation well in hand.
But this is a simple girl, my lovey-dovey Pete, one of the nameless legion that always gets stuck.
Yes, your black-hearted daughter is up a dead-end street.
Useless, dumb.
But if you laugh at him or me, I'll
I'll have your life.
Take it with my own hands.
The General say you go.
Do you want to die?
Show me how to get out of here.
Ah.
Mademoiselle plays a very nice game.
May I join you, Mademoiselle?
Certainly.
Come along.
I regret,
Mademoiselle.
Really, really?
What is it?
I feel like a bag of broken glass.
Chen.
It's not serious.
I will do it myself.
Get some hot water, some iodine, some bandages.
His clothes are in my rooms.
Well, you may as well start from the beginning.
What happened?
And that's the story in a nutshell.
I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara, for everyone.
We can never trust you again.
I don't expect it.
You were lonely, huh?
Yeah, if you want to put it that way.
In our cause, my friend, there must be a minimum of loneliness and a maximum of care.
Well, what next?
Next is to find the girl.
I'll find her and give her the works.
What is the good, to give the works?
She knows who
Yang's agent is.
Mmm-hmm. Well.
I'll grab her and make her cough up.
We'll have to work fast.
Yang won't waste a minute now he's here.
One thing is in our favor.
Yang's agent has not yet contacted Mr. Brighton.
No?
No.
He has private plans, it seems.
No, he...
It's that dame.
Huh? Well, maybe you're right.
There was some guy, some little guy.
Shanghai's a big town.
I don't know where to start looking for her or him.
I suppose you'll kill her if you see her or him.
In half.
Huh.
Mr. Chen?
I think maybe we will soon have that money again.
Hey.
What are you trying to pull?
O'Hara's here.
Calm yourself, calm yourself, my friend.
I think maybe we soon fix everything.
Lay down, Sam.
I know it's not my right to say it, but I'm glad you're alive.
Save your breath because anything you say goes in one ear and out the other.
What are you going to do?
You make the recommendation, you're so talented.
You started to beat me up.
You might continue where you left off.
I might kill you, that's a possibility.
Yes, it is.
First,
I want some information.
Answer precisely and to the point.
Who employed you? Yang?
Yes.
When they took the belt off me, they gave it to a man.
Who was he?
L- I don't know.
A little fellow with a gray face, sick-looking. I don't know.
Don't waste my time,
I'm warning you.
I'll tell you whatever I can.
And don't give me that whiskbroom stuff.
Brushing me off.
Is it necessary to shout?
Where's the dough?
Listen, lady, you can be broken in little pieces.
Little pieces, very easy.
What's funny?
You think I care, but I don't.
That's what's so funny,
Mr. O'Hara.
I could kill myself for almost next to nothing.
Try carbon monoxide.
They say it's pretty good.
O'Hara, O'Hara, you're such a fool.
Sit down.
And this is the girl I loved with vitamins A, B, and C.
Why are you so hard like that?
Where's the money?
I wouldn't tell you if I knew.
You can't intimidate me.
This is Shanghai, a public hotel.
You were doing illegal work, running guns. You fell.
You were so busy giving me a rah-rah talk, you couldn't see before your nose.
You want to speak to me, speak as a person or not at all.
Not at all is good enough for me.
There's no money here.
I didn't ask you.
The pig they made this out of was luckier than you're gonna be before I get through.
You gotta listen to me.
I want the cash.
I had nothing to do with it.
You didn't get me on the train?
Against my will.
Let me explain.
I know. You're working a brother through school.
Please, if-
Or an old, sick father needs care.
Let me tell you, dreamboat, don't think
I fell for you.
A tree with a flower on.
I'd have fallen for that, the way I felt.
A fish on a dish would have gotten me.
You don't have to justify yourself.
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
I'm sorry you won't listen.
You're licked.
The money isn't here,
Mr. O'Hara.
Your gun won't help, and your brawn won't help.
And your big mouth won't help.
When I'm finished here, we'll talk about places where it might be.
Unless Yang gets here before we're clear.
He's at anchor, three miles out, personally.
He is?
I speak good English.
O'Hara, the money isn't there.
Where is it?
Is Yang here?
Where do you suppose
I came from, the sky?
Are you being tricky?
You heard Yang say he'd pick up the shipment himself.
Suppose you got that money, most of it, what would you do?
Would you let the person go who had the money?
Maybe.
And give him a bonus?
This is no bargain counter.
It is for you.
I'd have to ask.
Who?
Wu.
Then do it.
A $1,000 or $2,000 bonus.
You mean it?
I mean it.
Who's in there?
Where?
Behind that door.
I don't know.
But if I were behind it,
I'd keep it locked.
Don't you come in here.
Pete!
Stay out, now.
Wait!
Stay out, I tell you!
Who is he?
My father.
He's dead.
Get your hand fixed.
I'm sorry.
He's Yang's agent.
I'll have to get my belt.
You'll get your money.
I'll get it now.
Get out.
Please get out.
I'm sorry.
What must I do to ask you to leave me alone with this tired old man?
Do you want me to call the police?
No, even if you could.
Do you want me to scream and be heard?
I must get my belt.
Try your room.
I'm not sorry for him.
He took a job.
He knew what it involved.
I'm sorry you had to get into this mess.
I said it before.
You can't do this kind of work and die in bed.
It was my life or his.
It's got me nuts, too.
I like people too much to shoot, but it's a dark year and a hard night.
Come on.
I'll have to take whatever he's carrying.
Don't make me go in that room.
All right.
You stay here and have your sorrow out alone.
Hello.
Looks like you, uh, murdered a man, brother.
Miss Perrie, take his gun from him.
Miss Perrie, take his gun.
All right.
Now throw it on the bed.
That's right.
Now, may I recommend care,
Mr. O'Hara?
Look before you leap.
And you, too,
Miss Perrie.
I may be fat, but I'm agile.
Now may I recommend our next move?
Evidently, you may.
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.
The money isn't on our dear dead brother.
Now, every impulse of my carnal nature says to stay here and continue the search.
But every impulse of my intellectual nature says to move the luggage and all out of the approaching
Yang's wrath.
Am I, uh, understood?
Well, do it.
Oh, no, no, no.
You do it.
Mr. Wu. Call him.
Hello.
Ask Mr. Wu to come up.
Take a seat.
And you, too.
Not so good.
Better luck next time.
Don't try it again.
Now, sit down where you were.
Don't move.
Fatso was sucking around for a little nectar.
No time to waste.
Did you find anything?
The girl knows where it is.
Who is he?
Her father.
You kill him?
Yeah.
Watch him.
Bring the body here.
Fats will help.
Now, you stay here with Miss Perrie.
And you come with me, my freelance friend.
But perfect, positive quiet.
You hear me,
Fats?
I hear.
I will come back.
I was holding the fort,
General, but they nailed me down.
Yes? Who are you?
I heard they was going to rob you, so l-
Very nice.
Find Mr. Brighton.
Bring him here.
Gentle.
O'Hara!
He's got another one there.
Where is
Mr. Perrie?
Miss Perrie, where is Mr. Perrie?
Dead. Killed.
In there.
Man who killed Perrie, take money.
Give me.
Don't talk? Nobody?
I leave my men here to search, and we, all good friends, go on my boat.
Maybe then somebody talk what this is all about.
Take baggage, too.
It looks like
I'm the original boy that took the watch apart and couldn't put it together again.
He don't shake hands no more.
Example of what sometimes happens.
My man Wong here, uh, uh...
Expert.
Yes.
Very expert.
Can make painfulness many, many ways.
See?
Big chop, little chop.
And person die very slow.
Your friend Mr. Chen die too fast.
So you don't forget?
Hmm?
Now, which dog hide bone?
Miss Perrie, perhaps.
Now you tell me where is the hiding place?
I don't know,
General Yang.
That's the plain honest truth.
My man Wong, expert.
Expert.
She told you 50 times, she don't- Shh.
Shush your Aunt Susie.
The water around here is jammed with gunboats.
And you'll have one on your tail any minute.
Optimist.
Yes.
Optimist, O'Hara.
Got fog. Got night.
But there will be a day.
Oh, plenty day, but you'll never see it.
You, you, and you, you all die because destiny don't fail me.
I looted 12 cities, killed many thousands, make great commerce:
Silk, rice, and opium.
Got big, great friends.
I am Yang.
Would somebody please be good enough to hide
Mr. Chen's face?
Let's put him up there.
Well?
Do you want me to tell Yang, or will you?
Tell him what?
Where the money is.
Do you know?
Lady, this is no time for games.
But I don't know and that's the blank, flat, honest truth.
Didn't you tell me in your room at the hotel you'd make a deal?
Didn't you tell me that...
You certainly knew where it was then.
I thought my father had it on him.
That's the truth?
That's the truth, and may I be permitted to exercise the prerogative of the outsider?
Now, may l-
May I make a suggestion before he wakes up?
Sure, but if you're gonna suggest chocolate,
I prefer vanilla.
This is how
I see it.
A girl is good for nothing, and she knows it.
The only bright spot in her life she can remember is when she once won a prize in school.
That's all right because it only involves the girl's life.
But then she begins to get good people in trouble, perfect strangers, like you're in trouble now, and Mr. Wu.
It sounds like the speech that got you that prize.
Well, I don't care.
Even if
I got off this boat,
I don't know where
I'd go or what I'd do.
I've got a good, solid chunk of anguish in me as it is.
Why don't I tell Yang
I know where the money is and that I'll tell if he lets you off the boat, and Mr. Wu.
You would do that?
Why not?
It won't cost me anything, as the saying goes.
Except your delicate little life.
Who's that a loss to?
Me, myself, and I?
Don't be a fool.
Don't you be a fool.
Let her do it, O'Hara.
Do you want this girl to kill herself?
She got us here, didn't she?
You think Yang will fall for that stuff?
He might.
Otherwise, it's finished.
I'll call him.
O'Hara!
This young lady is about to present a lie to Your Excellency.
She's going to tell you she knows where the money is and reveal its hiding place if you will release her comrades.
You make decide?
Yes, and it's no lie.
But you'll have to release
Mr. Wu and O'Hara before I tell you.
I don't care what you do with him.
You make bargain?
Yes.
I don't take a chance.
If Miss Perrie knows, we'll find out quick.
We'll take Miss Perrie deeper in the ship.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara like her.
Very sad.
Too bad he never kiss her.
Yes. Too bad.
Maybe now make kissing before Miss Perrie go because maybe he don't like her when she comes back.
Can I tell you something?
Sure.
Maybe we're through here and because we're through,
I want to ask you something.
Ask or tell?
Ask first, then tell.
Why did you pick me up in Pengwa?
You needed the dough?
My father, he wanted to get out of the country.
Honest?
Yes.
I would have helped you before now, if I could.
Why?
Look, Judy, life at its best isn't much of a bargain.
Someday it may be different, not now.
It's a series of dumb accidents.
Now you're a great guy, you scratch your finger, blood poisoning.
What are you trying to say?
Look, you kicked out one of my lungs on the train.
You were properly sore.
All over.
I don't feel like that now.
I'm trying to say you're wonderful.
That makes me a sap,
I know, but it doesn't make any difference one way or the other now.
You know I'm wonderful, too.
You are.
Judy Perrie, darling, we could have made wonderful music together.
We could have worked and made ourselves a circle of light and warmth.
O'Hara,
I am so lonely for you.
Hey.
Where's my whisky,
Rastus?
Oh, dummies, huh?
Oh, I see.
I asked you for a drink, and that's your answer.
Tough guy, huh?
Make me a prisoner, will you?
Ah! Go away.
What are you doing?
Yeah, put that tomahawk away.
Where's my whisky?
The Herr General sends his regrets, we have no whisky aboard.
Ah, what kind of house is this?
Ain't got nothing to drink.
There must be whisky in those bags.
Hey, what goes on here,
Sambo? What is this?
What did you say?
Do you see this?
Well, now you don't.
What's in these?
When I want something,
I want it when I want it.
Well, that's fine.
Why didn't
I think of that before?
Well, well, well.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Sit down.
That's American money, and no Chinese can-
Sit down, please.
All right, I heard you,
I heard you.
All right.
There's more here in the bag.
Get out of my way.
So the drunk fool found the bone.
Everybody please come outside on deck.
What's happened?
General Yang wishes to converse with you.
He's got our telephone number.
Do so immediately!
He's stabbed.
If he isn't dead in 20 minutes, it will be a miracle.
He's our only chance.
Yang?
This is something
I never expected to see.
Who chopped you?
Miss Perrie knows all the time where money is.
We found it in her father's bag.
He hide good.
Now, I must kill all of you.
But the General promised if he found the money, we should go free.
Huh.
Am I free?
Slowly here, my life fall out, fall out in my hand.
You make me so much trouble, you die one by one.
Yang, I asked you who chopped you up, and you didn't answer me.
Don't argue with him, Wu, because he's sore at the world, and who blames him?
It's easy to see that his own guards betrayed him, knifed him.
Huh! What a laugh that will be.
Boys and girls will dance in the streets when they hear how the great Yang was killed by his own men.
Lie, lie. You hear me? Lie!
Drunk fool Brighton make accident.
Tell it to Sweeney.
Even if it were true, where was your guard when it happened?
Where were your tootsie boys who were supposed to give up their lives for you?
My men are faithful.
How do you know?
My men die for me, okay.
They're alive and kicking, while your singing days are over.
When you die here, they'll feed you to the sharks.
Then they'll go where another General will give them rice and put silver in their pockets.
They will not return.
What's to stop them?
They will be dead.
Who will kill them?
They lose face.
They shoot each other.
At whose command?
My command.
You must think we're out of a nuthouse to believe a story like that.
They have sons and wives.
You see answer.
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, he understand Chinese.
"Men, do not forget this happening," he says.
"In the temples of Peiping
"and in the sing-song houses of Canton they will laugh at Yang and his guards", he says.
"Only if they are not afraid
"to ascend to the Dragon with him, can they hope to wipe out this shame", he says.
They are agreeing to die with him.
My men faithful.
That's the most marvelous thing
I ever saw in my life.
Excellency, you are to be commended upon the integrity of your guard.
But, uh, might I make a little suggestion?
What about giving the order for my release?
White flesh dies.
Also Mr. Wu.
One by one.
Oh yes, yes, I know, I know.
And very just, too.
They deserve it.
But what about me?
You know, just me?
Thank you, Excellency.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry, but you understand.
You know, self-preservation.
Go.
But, Excellency, you misconstrue me.
Go.
Excellency, you misconstrue me.
Excellency!
Excellency.
Shut up.
General Yang,
I'm thinking of you.
Yes.
You're a brave, great man, and so are your guards, but who will know it if they die with you?
Who's left to tell the story?
Excellency, let me go, let me go!
Yang, what will your enemies say?
They'll say river pirates assaulted you, or Nanking surprised you in the night.
Your enemies will never know the glorious death that was yours and your men's.
What did he say, O'Hara?
What did he say?
Yang, listen to me.
Such great honor should not live in a closet.
It needs the open air and daylight.
Your enemies must not laugh at the memory of General Yang.
Coolies must not laugh.
Peasants, old men, women must not spit on your name.
You can't do this to me.
I won't die.
Someone must be left,
Yang.
Someone who has seen this last, glorious page in the history of General Yang's life.
Yang, listen to me, before you fall asleep.
Yang, before you fall asleep.
O'Hara, O'Hara!
They'll find out the truth.
How? If you stop all our mouths, who will be left to speak tenderly of Yang?
No one, I tell you, no one!
O'Hara!
You'll tell the story, O'Hara?
Yes, I will tell it. Yes.
Of your greatness and the obedience of your men.
Gentlemen in clubs will hear it.
Crowds at the dog races will talk of your guards.
Shanghai diplomats will know it.
Gunboat captains will tell it by radio.
O'Hara, O'Hara!
Every great paper in the world must tell how Yang's guard went to death with him.
The London Times,
The New York Times.
You think we'll get pictures in the papers?
Everywhere.
Because these are not things that happen every day.
You want I let you go?
Let us go.
Us?
All of us, to see no stain or blemish is left on the memory of Yang.
Will it be worth it?
Don't lie?
I swear, this is one true thing.
That's a fact?
Yes. Yang, before you fall asleep.
Yes, yes, help, help.
Oxford.
You will see.
I am a big man.
He was a talented man, but very, very corrupt.

Why do you make so many trips between Stockholm and Paris?
For business.
How long has this business been going?
Three years. Since January 1915.
What is the business? o o o oo
M o oo ooo
I suppose you might class this as ammunition for the Stockholm front.
These are the loveliest things we've ever had in the shop.
They're French. Paris.
At least you can claim a success at something.
Something that even a German brain can appreciate.
Madam, am I to be insulted like this?
Is it a crime to be German?
It's worse. It's a vulgarity.
Colette, I will not have this quarrelling.
- I don't want French women here.
- Ha.
Nor German women.
I want saleswomen. Ring for Anatole.
Filthy. Anatole, have you swept up this morning?
Assuredly, madam.
Anatole...
What can one do with a broom as bare as the behind of a burgomaster's baby?
Show it to me.
- The broom.
- Certainly, madam.
And take this.
We're going to the Countess Lindström.
My hat and cape, please, Maude.
You see, madam?
Yes.
I can see that it must have taken a lot of hard work to reduce it to this condition.
Get your cap.
Perhaps I should render more satisfaction with a mechanical sweeper such as are used in the better shops.
- Is the Countess ready for me?
- Will you go right in, please?
Thank you.
Good evening, gentlemen.

Very good, Madeleine. Anything else?
My bill.
Mm.
Madeleine, you're a very charming young woman, oo o oxo o x
Charming young women are when they give you something you can't get from anyone else.
Oh, if it were only for me, I wouldn't cavil.
Ah, Major, if it were only for you, I wouldn't charge. ut I'm responsible to Headquarters.
And I'm responsible to my partners in Paris, who are risking their lives and mine.
- All right, I'll send a cheque.
- Thank you.

Philip Dupree, Sergeant.

Hello.
- How are you, my dear Muller?
- Very glad to be back, General. oxoc o Wo, o
I got seven days' leave in Paris.
Good. And then?
That's all.
Where were K124 and 5?
I wish I knew.
I have a strong notion that I was under observation myself.
Our system needs drastic reorganisation, especially in the neutral countries.
Slesser, you take over Copenhagen, and understand this - you'll be judged by results.
And for Stockholm, we need the best man we've got in Section 8.
Is that so?
- Doctor Muller, you are a physician?
- Yes.
You've come to Sweden for the German medical service.
To look after our prisoners returning from Russia.
You signed an undertaking at our consulate in erlin to refrain from any political activity.
Certainly.
It's my duty to remind you of that undertaking, and welcome to Sweden.
Thank you.
Good morning.

You're welcome in Sweden, but only so long as you refrain from any political activity.
I came to Sweden because
I want to refrain from any political activity.

- Yes.

Very.
If you would just look at these.
You can stay in Sweden as long as you respect our laws.
- Next, please.
- Thank you.
Porter?
Watches, clock s, toys, cigarettes, liquor - anything to declare?
Only my intention to finish this.
SkåI.
Can you tell us what a Russian girl would say if you kissed her?
- Yes.
- Or a Dutch girl?
- Of course.
- That's too easy.
Could you tell us what a razilian girl'd say?
- Certainly.
- Ha, that's where we've got you.
Why? Why, why? Lupita? Who's Lupita?
Get her, get her, get her, yes.
Shall I come up?
No, ob, I'll be down in a minute.

There you are.
- He's doing it again.
- What?
Writing down what a girl will say when he's kissed her.
Go orn kiss hnim

Come on
Not bad, but you need practice.
There you are.
"You're short of practice. "
You might at least introduce us.
- Lupita, aron Marwitz.
- Goodbye, aron.
Don't be discouraged.
Oh, You eautiful Doll
Hello, ill. What are you laughing at?
The bloke in the bar just pulled a most amazing stunt.
And what was it?
He writes down in advance what any girl will say after he kisses her.
- Does he get it right?
- Every time.
- Oh, come on.
- How on earth could he do that?
There are probably only about a half a dozen things a girl of that kind will say. ut how does he get the right one?
I imagine he writes them all down on slips of paper, and fills his pockets before he comes out.
OrnE two six martirni dry
Liar, cheat, trick ster
- Look, the cheat.
- Here's another one.
- Give it to me.
- Think you can fool Lupita?
"What do you charge for lessons?"
- "More, please. "
- "You've done this before. "
"I wish you'd teach my husband. "
What have you to say?
Let's dance.
How did you find me out?
- It was Madeleine.
- Madeleine? Who is Madeleine?
One of your crowd?
Oh, no she has a shop, very chic.
Look, there she is.
Dancing with the English boy.
This is one of the times
I'm sorry I left that arm in France.
You're doing pretty well with the one you've got.
- Oh, thnat's Madeleine?
- Mm-hm.
Was I engaged as an engine driver?
No. Do I get an engine driver's wages?
Huh, assuredly not.
Come along, clumsy.
Who are you to give me orders?
She can't help it, Anatole, it's her German blood.
I happen to be Viennese.
Same thing in waltz time, sauerkraut.
Frogspawn.
Gertrude, Colette, I will not have my shop turned into a beer garden.
I'm sick of the French.
I never want to see a German again.
Then I'd better go.
Oh, no, please come in.
I was only trying to prevent my shop being turned into a battlefield.
- What can I show you?
- Oh, just a bag.
Gertrude, show madam a bag, will you?
Whnat kirnd of a bag madam?
Arn EvErnirng bag
That'll do, Anatole.
How about this, madam?
It's one of the nicest we have in the shop.
Karh do you hikE thnis?
Charming.
Ah, lie there, you roaring beast.
That's the dress, the shoes, stockings, hair ornament, and the bag.
They match the bag beautifully, madam.
Dress, shoes, stockings, hair ornament, and the bag.
This way to our fitting room, please.
You have marvellous saleswomen.
- They do their best.
- They are better than that.
A girl comes in for a bag, and goes out with the whole shop.
A girl who goes out shopping with a man means to have the whole shop.
How much do I owe you? y the way, why did you give away my little trick last night? ecause you claim to know such a lot about women.
Do you?
Enough to realise I know nothing about them.
Which means that you've had a lot of experience.
Oh, a lot. ut what does it amount to?
1,2T5 krona.
I brought you a very good customer today.
He doesn't care how he spends his money.
Oh, one has only to look at madam to see that.
You won't give away my next trick so easily,
I promise you.
Send the things to the Grand Hotel at once.
Certainly, madam.
Au revoir, Madeleine.
Karl, I have bought everything I want.
Have you?
- And shut up You cannot teach me manners.
- I am afraid you are right.
Arnd whnat is morE my fathnEr was a Brazihiarn GErnErah
Shush
- You don't believe that, I suppose.
- I do, I do.
Oh, no, you don't. You think I am lying.
Will you please convince the lady outside?
Go on, call me a liar. Go on, say it.
You daren't. All right...
Get out Go to your shopkeeper.
That's the first sensible thing you've said.
May I tell you how very sorry I am for what happened today?
Oh, don't apologise.
We keep a shop, and it's open to everyone.
Plain women, or dazzling beauties.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And if you could ever take pity on a lonely man... dorn't haughn at mE
Dine with me.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You would be doing a great kindness.
I live in a desert.
Packed with dazzling beauties.
Excuse me.
Hello. Is that you, ob?
Tonight at T.0, at the Grand?
No pity?
I'm sorry.
All right, ob, at T.0.
All right, Madeleine, you're an angel.
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- She's from Maloja.
Her father's farm was destroyed to make way for Swiss frontier defences.
I'll double-check all that when I get to London.
She's a sweet thing, and I hate to suspect her, but she's got a lot of German friends.
She's got a lot of French friends, and one or two English friends.
Yes, I know. That's what's got me guessing.
SEE whnat you carn firnd out at thnE ChnErry Orchnard
Anatole, how much longer am I to wait?
What do you know about him?
Karl Marwitz.
A traitor to the Fatherland. A deserter.
Court-martialed during absence.
Cashiered.
Sentenced to death.
Funny, he doesn't look that type.
What makes you think so?
- Instinct.
- Feminine instinct?
Professional.
- What do they think at the Cherry Orchard?
- I haven't enquired.
Will you?
Selling? uying. Know anything about Marwitz?
What do they say about the Swiss girl?
Plenty. It'll cost you 50.
Page.
Take this to aron Marwitz's room.
Here it is again.
What's happened to the aron?
Hm, you may well ask.
I've never seen such a change. ow do you mEarn chnarngE?
Change of habit, that's what I mean.
It used to be all girls with no clothes.
Now it's all clothes with no girls.
Pity.
Nice.
- I'll have this one for my collection.
- You can't. Oh, no.
They've just arrived from Paris. Madame will want to show them to our best customer.
- I am your best customer.
- Oh, no, you're not.
Now then, will you pack this one...
...this one... and this one for the Countess Lindström.
Yes, madam.
That's all very well.
- What's left for me?
- Everything else in the shop.
All right. Pack it up.
Karl, this nonsense must stop. uying things you don't want as an excuse to come here.
- You won't come out with me...
- I won't sell you anything else.
- That means you forbid me to come here.
- Precisely.
All right Madeleine, I lose.
No, Karl, you win.
- Tonight?
- All right.
I have a feeling I shall be sorry for this.
- Colette, tell Anatole I'm ready, will you?
- Yes, madam.
You're a shrewd one.
No, I don't claim to be any cleverer than the next man, only the next man's always a bigger fool than I am.
Now then, lazybones, you've got to go out with these frock s.
Frock s? What do they want frock s for?
Fig leaf was good enough for Eve, and she was the first lady in the land.
Gertrude, I've forbidden the aron to buy another thing, so mind you're firm with him.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I knew she'd put a stop to this one day.
Well, no lady would ever accept presents from a man anyhow.
Of course not.
Oh Oh, my favourite scent.
Well, every woman has her price.
And what might that be?
Phew This is an expensive shop.

And each little star above you, dear
Is tired of hearing it told...
Coffee, please.
Coffee, please.
You've got a successful rival.
Oh?
The gallant aron.
Is that all?
That's all. What did you find out in London?
Nothing definite. ut I've got a call to make.
Hello.
Hello, give me the police.
Are you still sorry you came out with me that first evening?
Yes. That's why I've been out with you
1 evenings since.
And you've discovered all the secrets of my dark soul.
- Sugar?
- Two, please.
Go on, tell me how bad I am.
It is easy to touch your pocket, but difficult to touch your heart.
True.
Manners good.
- Milk?
- Thank you. lack.
Intentions - lamentable.
How true.
When you're with one woman, you're thinking of the next.
You've never been simple, sincere, loyal or faithful to any woman in your life.
Go on.
- Isn't that enough?
- You've forgotten my most important asset.
What's that?
That you love me.
Why are you trying to resist?
You won't succeed.
How do you know I won't? ecause I tried... but I couldn't.
I want to take you away.
Away from your friends, your business.
No time for anyone but me.
You want to take everything?
And give everything.
And share everything.
Mustn't you, if you marry?
Madeleine Goddard, you're wanted at police headquarters.
You identify the man?
Do you know anything of his life?
Only that he was a most faithful and devoted servant.
Quite, in business hours. ut you had no reason to suspect him of pro-German activities?
How could I?
He hated them.
Some interesting German correspondence was found on him, however.
Let me see, Miss Goddard.
You are Swiss, aren't you?
Yes. h supposE you hnavE dEahirngs withn a good marny GErmarns dorn't you?
I have clients of all nationalities.
And yet you had no idea that the faithful and devoted Anatole was a spy?
- She's already said...
- Silence, please.
I beg your pardon.
Is it necessary to distress the lady any further?
I'm sorry to press the question, but I must have all the information you can give the court.
Willingly, but I can only tell you that I've lost a friend.
Thank you. That is all for the present.
- Do you know who did it?
- Possibly someone from the Cherry Orchard.
It's terrible.
Something much more terrible has happened.
It was all lies.
What?
- Your information about the counteroffensive.
- ut there was an attack.
Yes, and our army stopped it, but it stopped the wrong attack.
ThnE rEah ornE camE irn arnothnErpart of thnE hirnE whnErE our troops hnad bEErn withndrawrn thnarnks to your irnformatiorn
Your partners in Paris are either incompetent, or working for French counterespionage.
That's impossible.
- What do you think went wrong?
- I don't know, but you're going to find out.
You go to Paris.
No, Doco o
You forget what happened here tonight.
It's suicide.
It's duty.
- ut I'm Swiss.
- You're a member of our organisation.
You know what that means.
What are my orders?
You will find out what's gone wrong with our organisation, and what has become of K124 and 5.
You'll get detailed instructions in due course.
You leave tomorrow by the Gothenburg boat.
You will be getting her another porter.
The Grand Hotel, please.
Is that the Grand Hotel?
Can I sp...
Hello, hello?
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
The boat train leaves in half an hour, doesn't it?
Yes, aron.
Thank you.
Madeleine Goddard, will you step this way, please?
Please sit down.
What made you come to France again?
Er... for business.
Wat bts ss?
There were difficulties with my firm. Cottin.
What difficulties?
W t r prcs ar too g, v foor art
- Couldn't you write?
- I did, without much success.
Madeleine Goddard, you go to Paris under escort. You are under arrest.
- Are your sympathies with France?
- No.
- With Germany?
- No, I'm a neutral.
There's a German secret service in Stockholm?
- Yes.
- ow did you krnow?
Well, everyone knows.
There's a French and ritish one too.
Have you met anybody belonging to the German service?
I may have. One never knows in Stockholm.
You had an employee called uh...
Anatole ergen.
- I had.
- Was he a member of the German service?
The Swedish police seem to think so.
- ut you never knew?
- No, I never knew.
Very well.
You will remain under arrest for the moment.
My business house may be anxious.
- Would you send a word to Maison Cottin?
- That can be arranged.
Thank you.
Ah, Madeleine, how was the journey?
- Any submarines about?
- Oh, the usual number. And how's Paris?
- Oh, the war, you know.
- Monsieur Cottin.
Oh, Madeleine, my dear,
I'm delighted to see you.
I've got lots of new models to show you, and I'm sure that all our little differences can be quite easily smoothed out.
Nice calm trip?
Well, the weather was calm enough.
Usual hold-ups, you know.
Yes, not very pleasant travelling in wartime.
So glad to see you. I'm afraid your reception was hardly what at you had a right to expect.
Oh, I don't know. I...
The Medaille Militaire.
The highest award that France can give one of her soldiers.
Your Excellency, I...
That represents the real feelings of a grateful country.
It'll be in my safekeeping until the day comes when you can wear it.
And may that be soon.
Why did they send you back again?
They say my partners in Paris are either incompetent, or working for the French counterespionage.
I should prefer them to think we are incompetent.
Do they know about K124 and 5?
That's what they've sent me to find out.
Firing squad?

Uhn hnuhn hrn thnE cErntrah post officE
Poor soul.
- Your Excellency, forgive me.
- Forgive you for what?
Don't send me back to Stockholm.
We need you.
Haven't I done enough?
Too much to fail us now.
I can't face it, I can't.
After three years of misery, to pretend, to cheat, to lie - it's degrading.
Is it because of Marwitz?
What do you know about him?
Only that he has been taking up a great deal of your time.
All right, I'll meet you halfway.
Make this one last effort, and you can come back to France for good.
- And what is the last effort?
- Find out who's the head of Section 8. ut isn't it Doctor Muller?
I don't know.
There's another German in Stockholm that I'm rather interested in.
This is for your information.
You must think me a prize fool.
- You do the ritish Intelligence an injustice.
- At least I shall know who's who in Stockholm.
Well, now you know, please forget.
I've already forgotten
Madeleine Goddard's name.
Everybody's Doing It Now
- An entree?
- Côte de veau napolitaine avec des pois.
And the sweet?
Pot de creme au chocolatine.
- Half an hour.
- Very good, aron.

- We've started cocktails.

I'm afraid not.
In confidence, some officers arrived this evening from Siberia, prisoners of war going home.
What of it?
They haven't seen a girl for three years.
All right, Karl,
I know your shop girl came home today. ollinger '06. ht's a bEar it's a bEar it's a bEar
WhnErE?
To your everlasting love that didn't last three week s.
- ut it did.
- Yes, please.
To your marriage vows, which are forgotten. ut they are not.
Then why are you looking at me as if you'd never seen me before? ecause I'm not sure I have.
Yes, please.
Stopped by a submarine, arrested, grilled by the Paris police, and there you sit, this slip of a girl, looking as if it were all in the day's work.
What of it?
You frighten me.
- I suppose I'm a coward.
- Nonsense.
What have you been doing while
I've been flirting with death and destruction?
Oh, trembling for you, and wondering what I should do when you return.
And have you made up your mind?
I told you I was a coward.
- Prisoners of war?
- Yes, from Siberia.
- Oh.
- Who is it?
One of my best friends, Otto von erndorf.
Hello, Otto.
I read that you were a deserter.
You...
M A N Wat's rog, Otto?
Wat's t attr r?
- Gentlemen, please.
- Ask him if you want satisfaction.
- Gentlemen, please.
- That's all right.
Orchestra. Please, orchestra.
What did you run away for?
Why spoil a perfectly wonderful evening?
There's a greater force than all the armies in the world - stupidity. did you warnt a pubhic brawh?
I wanted to see you kill that man.
Oh, Madeleine
Kill a decent boy on his first night out after three years in Siberia?
Come, Madeleine, where is your sense of humour, hm?
Well, at least I've succeeded in convincing you that I am a coward.
You have.
Good night.
Very well, if that's how you feel.
Good night.
- Karh?
- Hm?
I think you're the bravest man who ever served his country.
That's very sweet of you. ut how do I serve my country?
As a deserter?
As head of Section 8 of the German Intelligence.
When did you find out?
Tonight at the Grand Hotel.
And why do you tell me? ecause you must know that I am in the German Service too.
I know more than that.
I know that you're not Swiss, you're French.
I know your name isn't Goddard, but Montdenis, and I know that you have outwitted us for three years while you were serving your country...
...as I served mine.
Thank God.
No more lies.
Thank God.
And now I want you to take me away.
Away from my friends and business, from everyone but you.
That's my dream.
Where shall we go?
A villa on the Mediterranean, near Nice.
That's France and I'm German.
There's Switzerland.
How shall we get there? y walking down the trenches, and getting out at the end?
This is a lovely spot.
Hm, right in the middle of the revolution.
Here it is. o Go
The bluest blue in the world.
And the mountains are reflected in the water, and the music of the cowbells floats across the meadows.
And the guns roar day and night.
So, this is the end of the dream?
That's the end.

Gentlemen,
Captain Von Marwitz is the head of Section 8.
SchnaffEr
Schaffer, you will go back to erlin tomorrow, and report for duty.
These are your orders, and you'll have to be quick and clever.
- ob, I need your help desperately.
- Yes, I was warned you might.
It's all right, Miss Goddard.
I went with you to Paris.
Well, what's happened?
- I found out who's the head of Section 8.
- Who?
Von Marwitz.
He'd found out who I am too.
- The devil he has.
- Oh, ob, I must get away from here.
You remember what happened to the others?
Don't you worry. We'll get you out of this.
- How about going into hiding?
- Impossible.
There's nowhere in Sweden where they wouldn't find me.
M o o o No
Same thing.
- ThnErE's rnot a sirnghE phacE
- Shush, don't talk.
Faber? That gang wouldn't fancy coming into conflict with the Swedish police.
- Last thing they'd care to risk.
- It's all right.
You're going to be as safe as a church if you do as I tell you. Now, here's the programme.
- Cognac.
- Evening, gentlemen.
- We're buying.
- What?
0 men and women, tomorrow morning.
What for?
To go shopping.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.
Good morning. Will you come this way?
Move fast, but not till everyone's inside.
- They should all be in now.
- What about the cars?
- They'll be outside the shop.
- Right, let everybody be cheerful, a gay crowd.
And above all, no trouble with the police.
Who put the sale notice on the window?
Hello, hello, hello?
Hello, hello?
This way, Madeleine.
Your customers are waiting for you.
There's a dress in the window.
I want you to let me have a look at it.
- Madeleine Goddard?
- Yes.
Come with me.

Someone denounced her as a French agent.
The police arrived and arrested her.
Hm.
That means she'll sail from Gothenburg.
See to it.
You can unlock the door when you're outside the three-mile limit.
What are you doing there?
Oh, 12.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
I want to see your passengers, Captain.
Come with me.
- You can't do this.
- This is a neutral ship.
And this lady's a non-combatant.
She has a Swiss passport, but she's not Swiss.
She is a French citizen, and a member of the French Intelligence.

I'm sorry.
I can't entertain you after all.
I've got to hand you over to our destroyer.
Take Captain Marwitz to the destroyer.
What are they going to do?
They're not going to shoot him?
M oo o, o oo oo o oo o
He'll be interned for the duration.
Karl?
I'll be waiting.
I can't hear you.
I'll be waiting.
These hills here are full of Apaches.
They've burnt every ranch building in sight.
He had a brush with 'em last night.
Says they're bein' stirred up by Geronimo.
Geronimo?
How do we know he isn't lying?
Ah, he's a Cheyenne.
They hate Apaches worse than we do.
Clear the wires to Lordsburg.
That's Lordsburg now, sir. They seem to have something very urgent to tell you, sir.
- Well? Well, what's wrong?
- The line went dead, sir.
- What do you got there?
- Only the first word, sir.
"Geronimo."
Whoa! Whoa! Steady, whoa!
- Well, so long, Buck!
- Nice trip, Buck?
- Oh, so-so.
- Got the payroll for the mining company?
- Yes, sir. Right here in this box here.
- Good. Give me a lift here, Jim, will ya?
Jim, I'll pay ya that two bits when I come through.
- Okay, partner.
- Hey, now, you kids get away from that wheel.
Well, sir, we run into a little snow up there.
'Tweren't bad, though, but you fellas better prepare for a good frost.
Passenger out for Tonto.
You'd better get out and stretch your leg -
I mean, your limbs, ma'am.
We're gonna change horses here.
- Is there a place here where I can have a cup of tea?
- Well, yes, ma'am.
You can get a cup of coffee at the hotel across the street there.
- Thank you, driver.
- Uh, you look a little peaked -
- I'll be all right, thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.
Why, Lucy Mallory.
Nancy.
- How are you, Captain Whitney?
- Fine, thanks, Mrs. Mallory.
Why, whatever are you doing in Arizona?
I'm joining Richard in Lordsburg.
He's there with his troops.
He's a lot nearer than that, Mrs. Mallory.
He's been ordered to Dry Fork.
That's the next stop for the stagecoach.
You'll be with your husband in a few hours.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you, Lucy.
Sit down, darling. We'll have a cup of coffee.
You must be tired from that long trip.
- Who is that gentleman?
- Hardly a gentleman, Mrs. Mallory.
I should think not.
He's a notorious gambler.
Hello, Mink! Hidee, Frank!
Well, Marshal, I'm looking for my shotgun guard. Is he here?
Out with the posse, Buck, trying to catch the Ringo Kid.
- Ringo? I thought Ringo was in the pen.
- He was.
Busted out?
Well, good for him.
My guess, the Kid's aimin' to get even with them Plummer boys.
It was their testimony sent him to the penitentiary.
Well, all I gotta say is that he'd better stay away from that there Luke Plummer.
Why, gosh, Luke's run all of Ringo's friends out of Lordsburg.
The last trip there, I seen him hit a rancher on the head with the barrel of his gun... and, well, he just laid it wide open like a butchered steer.
- You seen Luke Plummer in Lordsburg?
- Yes, sirree.
Hmm.
You boys take care of the office for a couple days.
I'm going to Lordsburg with Buck.
Gonna ride shotgun.
Oh, gosh, if I could learn to keep my big mouth shut -
Here's the payroll, Mr. Gatewood.
Ever since I opened this bank,
I've been trying to tell those people... to deposit their payroll six months in advance.
It's good, sound business.
Good business for you, Mr. Gatewood.
Well, there's your receipt - $50,000.
And remember this - what's good for the banks is good for the country.
Now, now, now, my dear lady -
Good riddance to bad rubbish!
Get out and stay out!
I'm keeping your trunk
'cause you ain't paid your rent.
"Is this the face...
"that wrecked a thousand ships... and burned the towerless tops of Ilium?"
Farewell, fair Helen.
Doc. Doc, can they make me leave town when I don't want to go? Do I have to go?
Dallas, don't you go makin' no fuss.
Do I have to go, Doc, just because they say so?
Dallas, I've got my orders.
Don't blame these ladies. It ain't them.
It is them!
Doc, haven't I any right to live?
What have I done?
We're the victims of a foul disease called social prejudice, my child.
These dear ladies of the Law and Order League are scouring out the dregs of the town.
Come on.
Be a proud, glorified dreg like me.
- You get going, Doc. You're drunk.
- Two of a kind.
- Just two of a kind.
- Take my arm, Madame la Comtesse.
The tumbril awaits!
To the guillotine!
Oh, wait till I get my badge, girls!
I'll join you!
If ever you go East, brother... come out to our house for dinner.
No one in all Kansas City, Kansas, sets a better table than my dear wife, Violet.
- Jerry.
- Yeah, Doc.
Jerry, I'll admit, as one man to another... that, economically,
I haven't been of much value to you.
But... suppose you could put one on credit?
If talk was money, Doc, you'd be the best customer I got.
I'm leaving town, Jerry.
- Honest?
- Yes, old friend.
And I thought you might, out of memory of our many happy -
All right, Doc. Just this one.
Thank you, Jerry.
Here's a man goin' on the stagecoach with you.
- He's an Easterner from Kansas City, Missouri.
- Kansas City, Kansas, brother.
To your health, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman.
My name is Peacock. I'm a -
He's a whiskey drummer.
A what?
Well, well!
How are you, Mr. Haycock?
- Peacock.
- Don't tell me, sir.
I know, I know.
A familiar name and an honored name.
I never forget a face or a friend.
Samples? Hmm!
Ahh! Rye.
Well, Brownie!
- Blackie! Belle! Bess!
- Giddap!
Well, lookee here.
Got a pretty good team there.
Whoa! Back up.
Come on in.
Yeah. Back it up.
Got my favorite team there, Slim!
Yeah, Buck, they're all good and fresh.
They'll take you right there.
I want five dollars, Henry!
Certainly, my dear. Certainly.
What is it to be this time, my dear?
A pair of shoes -
I want to pay the butcher.
Dinner's at 12:00.
Don't worry, my dear.
I'll be there.
I've invited the ladies of the Law and Order League.
All -
All aboard for Dry Fork...
All -
All aboard for Dry Fork...
Apache Wells, Lee's Ferry and Lordsburg!
- I'll take that, Dallas.
- Oh, thanks.
In you go, Dallas, and a pleasant voyage.
Leave your baggage, Doc?
Thank you.
Thank you, my friend.
Curley, my shingle.
Carry it with honor.
- I'll take it, Doctor.
- Oh, no. No trouble at all.
No trouble at all.
I'll carry it on my lap.
Here we go.
Here we go, Reverend.
Mrs. Whitney, you're not going to let your friend travel with that creature.
She's right, Lucy. And besides, you're not well enough to travel.
It's only a few hours, Nancy.
I'm quite all right.
But you shouldn't travel a step without a doctor.
There is a doctor, dear.
The driver told me.
Doctor? Doc Boone?
Why, he couldn't doctor a horse.
Lucy darling, you must be very careful.
Take good care of yourself.
- Watch that step now.
- Lady folks ride facing forward, please.
There you go.
- Pleasant journey, Mrs. Mallory.
- Thank you. Good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Bye!
Like an angel in a jungle.
A very wild jungle.
What are you doin', Hatfield - talkin' to yourself?
You wouldn't understand, cowboy.
You've never seen an angel... nor a gentlewoman... nor a great lady.
I raise, gentlemen.
Well, so long, Buck! So long, Curley!
Nice trip, boys!
- So long, kids!
- Wait a minute! Hold it there, Buck!
Cavalry comin'!
Steady, girls!
Captain Sickels asks if you'll deliver this dispatch in Lordsburg the moment you arrive.
- The telegraph line has been cut.
- Sure.
We're going with you as far as the noon station at Dry Fork.
There'll be a troop of cavalry there, and they'll take you on to Apache Wells.
From Apache Wells, you'll have another escort of soldiers into Lordsburg.
But you must warn your passengers that they travel at their own risk.
- At their own risk?
What's the trouble, Lieutenant?
- Geronimo.
- Geronimo? Well, then I ain't go -
- Will you sit down!
Of course, the army has no authority over you gentlemen.
- If you think it's unsafe to make the trip -
- This stage is goin' to Lordsburg.
If you think it ain't safe to ride along with us...
I figure we can get there without you soldier boys.
I have my orders, sir, and I always obey orders.
Did you all hear what the lieutenant said?
Yes, we heard.
Well, me and Buck are taking this coach through, passengers or not.
Whoever wants to get out can get out.
- It's -
- Courage. Courage, Reverend.
- Ladies first.
- Oh. Excuse me.
How about you, Dallas?
What are you tryin' to do, scare somebody?
They got me in here.
Now let 'em try to put me out.
There are worse things than Apaches.
If you'll take my advice, ma'am, you won't take this trip.
My husband is with his troops in Dry Fork.
If he's in danger, I want to be with him.
You see, brother,
I have a wife and five children in Kansas City.
Then you're a man. By all the powers that be, Reverend, you're a man.
- All right, folks.
- Marshal!
Make room for one more.
I'm offering my protection to this lady.
I can shoot fairly straight, if there's need for it.
That's been proved too many times, Hatfield.
All right, get in. We're late.
- May I trouble you to move over, sir?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
Close the door.
- Aw, Curley, we shouldn't -
- Get going, Buck!
Bessie! Brownie! Bill!
Farewell, ladies!
- Sweetheart! Come on now, girl!
- Good-bye!
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Room for another passenger?
- Sure is, Mr. Gatewood.
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- That's right. Just got a telegram.
Had to stop to pack this bag.
Oh, I got it in.
Hyah, hyah! Sassy! Blackie! Brownie! Bill!
Yow!
All right, Brownie.
Queenie, steady, girl.
Good boy. Get along.
If there's anything I don't like, it's drivin' a stagecoach through Apache country.
Funny catching Gatewood outside of town that way.
I just took this job 10 years ago so I could make enough money... to marry my Mexican girl, Julietta, and I been workin' hard at it ever since.
Bonnie, get over there! Ho!
- Marriage?
- Well, certainly.
My wife's got more relatives than anyone you ever did see.
I bet I'm feedin' half the state of Chihuahua.
Sweetheart! Ho!
That seem funny to you about Gatewood?
Yeah, and then what do I get to eat when I get home in Lordsburg?
Nothin' but frijole beans. That's all.
Nothin' but beans, beans, beans.
Bessie! Brownie! Blackie girl!
Yow! Get along!
Excuse me, ladies.
Close quarters.
Warm today.
Your wife made it warm for me, Gatewood.
She was chairman of our farewell committee.
Fine-looking bunch of soldier boys back there.
Always gives me great pride in my country... when I see such fine young men in the U.S. Army.
Anybody know where they're going?
Brother, aren't you aware of what's happened?
Happened?
I - I don't follow you, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman. I'm a -
My friend's a whiskey drummer.
We're all gonna be scalped, Gatewood.
Massacred in one fell swoop.
- That's why the soldiers are with us.
- He's joking, of course.
Oh, no, he's not.
Oh, dear, no. I wish he were.
It's that old Apache butcher, Geronimo.
Geronimo - nice name for a butcher.
He's jumped the reservation.
He's on the warpath.
Geronimo? Why weren't the passengers notified?
Why wasn't I told?
- We -
- We were told, Gatewood.
Yes.
Weren't you told when you got that message from Lordsburg?
Oh, yes, yes. Y-Yes, of course. I - I forgot.
Steady now! String out! Sweetheart!
Now, doggone it, they're bringing up her grandfather... all the way from Mexico to live with us.
I can't figure out how he got that message.
- Who? Her grandfather?
- No, Gatewood.
Sweetheart!
- Said he got a message.
- Sweetheart!
- Telegraph line ain't workin'.
- Sweetheart.
Hold it!
Whoa! Steady! Ho. Ho.
- Hey, look, it's Ringo.
- Yeah.
Hello, Kid.
Hello, Curley.
Hiya, Buck! How's your folks?
Oh, just fine, Ringo.
- Except my grandfather came up -
- Shut up.
Didn't expect to see you ridin' shotgun on this run, Marshal.
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- I figured you'd be there by this time.
No. Lame horse.
Well, it looks like you've got another passenger.
Yeah. I'll take the Winchester.
You may need me and this Winchester, Curley.
Saw a ranch house burnin' last night.
You don't understand, Kid.
You're under arrest.
Curley -
- Everything all right, Marshal?
- Everything's all right, Lieutenant.
- Hope I ain't crowdin' you folks none.
- The more, the merrier.
Bonnie! Brownie! Blackie! Hyah!
Hyah, Bessie!
Ain't Ringo a fine boy?
I think so.
You're just smarter than a trade rat.
You knew all the time he was goin' to Lordsburg.
Hey, reckon what he meant he saw ranch houses burnin'?
- Apaches.
- Oh, Apaches.
So, you're the notorious Ringo Kid.
My friends just call me Ringo.
Nickname I had as a kid.
Right name's Henry.
Seems to me I knew your family, Henry.
Didn't I fix your arm once when you were, oh - bucked off a horse?
- Are you Doc Boone?
- I certainly am.
Now, let's see.
I'd just been honorably discharged from the Union army... after the War of the Rebellion.
You mean the War for the Southern Confederacy, sir.
I mean nothing of the kind, sir.
That was my kid brother broke his arm.
You did a good job, Doc, even if you was drunk.
Thank you, son.
- Professional compliments are always pleasing.
- Yes, they are.
What happened to that boy whose arm I fixed?
He was murdered.
Put out that cigar.
You're annoying this lady.
Excuse me, madam.
Being so partial to the weed myself...
I sometimes forget that it disagrees with others.
A gentleman doesn't smoke in the presence of a lady.
Three weeks ago, I took a bullet out of a man who was shot by a gentleman.
The bullet was in his back.
- Do you mean to insinuate -
- Sit down, mister.
Doc don't mean no harm.
- Hiya, Pete! Hi, Joey!
- Hello!
Be careful of old Bessie up there now.
Take it easy.
Hold it steady, girl.
Prepare to dismount!
Take a look and see if there isn't a stone bruisin' that hock down there.
If it isn't my old friend,
Sergeant Billy Pickett!
- Well! How are ya, Billy?
- He's fine, Doc, and mighty glad to see ya!
Great heavens to Betsy! Didn't figure on no stagecoach comin' through... with them Apaches raisin' Cain.
I was just telling Billy to hitch up the buckboard so we could get the young ones in -
Wait a minute! You mean to say there are no troops at this station?
Ain't no soldiers here but what you see.
But my husband, Captain Mallory -
I was told he was here.
He was, dearie. Got orders night afore last to join the soldiers at Apache Wells.
- That means we gotta go back.
- I can't go back!
Driver, you started this coach for Lordsburg, and it's your duty to get us there.
And it's your duty, young man, to come along with us!
It's my duty, Mr. Gatewood, to obey orders.
I'm sorry, sir.
Well, if the soldiers go back, Lieutenant, that means we all have to go back?
My orders are to return from here immediately, and I can't disobey those orders.
I think we can get through all right, Curley.
Oh, now, don't egg him on, Kid.
I'm drivin' this here outfit, and, well, if the soldiers go back, so am I.
I call this a desertion of duty.
I'll report you to your superior officer.
If necessary,
I'll take the matter up with Washington!
That's your privilege, sir, but if you give us any trouble here...
I'll have to put you under restraint.
Now, don't lose your temper.
Don't lose your temper.
I'll tell you how we'll settle it. We'll take a vote.
Inside, everybody. Come on, Buck.
Oh, Curley, I don't wanna go to -
Now you girls set yourselves down.
I'll get you something to eat.
Now, folks, if we push on, we can be in Apache Wells by sundown.
Soldiers there will give us an escort as far as the ferry.
Then it's only a hoot and a holler into Lordsburg.
- Well, that old mare, I don't -
- We've got four men can handle firearms.
Five with you, Ringo.
Doc can shoot, if sober.
I can shoot?
I can shoot?
Now, Miss Mallory, I - I ain't gonna put a lady in danger without she votes for it.
I've traveled all the way here from Virginia.
I'm determined to get to my husband.
I won't be separated any longer.
- What's your vote, mister?
- Well -
Where's your manners, Curley?
Ain't you gonna ask the other lady first?
Well, what do you say?
What difference does it make?
Doesn't matter.
I vote that we go on. I demand it.
I'm standing on my legal rights.
What do you say, Hatfield?
Lordsburg.
Four. You, Doc?
I'm not only a philosopher, sir.
I'm a fatalist.
Somewhere, sometime, there may be the right bullet or the wrong bottle... waiting for Josiah Boone.
- Why worry when or where?
- Yes or no?
Having that philosophy, sir,
I've always courted danger.
During the late war, when I had the honor to serve the Union... under our great president,
Abraham Lincoln... ah, and General Phil Sheridan... well, sir, I fought 'midst shot and shell and cannon roar!
- Do you want to go back or not?
- No!
I want another drink.
That's five.
How about you, Mr. Hancock?
It's Peacock.
I'd like to go on, brother.
I want to reach the bosom of my dear family in Kansas City, Kansas, as quickly as possible... but I may never reach that bosom if we go on.
So, under the circumstances -
You understand, brother -
I think it best we go back with the bosoms -
I mean, the soldiers.
One against. Well, Buck?
- I want -
- Buck says aye. That's six.
I'm voting your proxy, Kid.
You go with me.
Ain't nothin' keeping me out of Lordsburg, Curley.
There sure ain't.
Well, folks, that settles it.
We're going through.
Sit down, folks, and eat your grub.
Come on, Buck. We'll change them horses.
- But, Curley, ain't we gonna eat? Ohh!
- You can eat later!
Here you are, folks.
Here you are, folks.
Food's on the table. Help yourselves.
You got a long ride ahead of ya.
You ain't drinkin', Billy.
Sit down here, ma'am.
Thanks.
May I find you another place, Mrs. Mallory?
It's cooler by the window.
Thank you.
Looks like I got the plague, don't it?
No. No, it's not you.
Well, I guess you can't break out of prison and into society in the same week.
Please! Please.
You're ill, Mrs. Mallory.
No, it's just that I -
I'll be all right.
You've been very kind. Why?
In the world I live in, one doesn't often meet a lady, Mrs. Mallory.
Have you ever been in Virginia?
I was in your father's regiment.
I should remember your name.
You're Mr. Hatfield.
That's what I'm called, yes.
- Why do you look at me like that?
- I'm just tryin' to remember.
Ain't I seen you someplace before, ma'am?
- No. No, you haven't.
- Hmm.
I wish I had though.
I know you.
I mean, I know who you are.
I guess everybody in the territory does.
Yep.
Well, I used to be a good cowhand, but... things happened.
Yeah, that's it.
Things happened.
And now they'll take you back to prison.
Not till I finish a job in Lordsburg.
But you can't.
You're going there as a prisoner.
All aboard for Apache Wells, Lee's Fer -
All righty, folks, the horses are changed.
We'd better get going.
- And Lordsburg, maybe.
- All right, get going, Ringo.
Mrs. Pickett, tell Billy the buckboard is all ready. Let's get going.
All right, Marshal, we're ready.
- Come on, folks, let's move.
- My compliments to your husband.
Thank you.
I still feel that we ought to go back with the soldiers.
We've got to hurry if we wanna be there by sundown.
Bridesmaid! Baby! Yow!
- What'd you say?
- Nothin'.
Well, why don't ya say somethin'?
A fella gets nervous, sittin' here like a dummy, nothin' to think about but the Indians.
You say something! You've been sitting there all day talking without making any sense!
All right, I'll say somethin' that makes sense.
If I was you, I'd let 'em shoot it out.
- Let who?
- Luke Plummer and the Kid.
There'd be a lot more peace in this territory... if that Luke Plummer was so full of lead he couldn't hold his liquor.
I ain't sayin' I don't share your sentiments, Buck.
- But you're a born fool.
- Well, I know that.
In the first place,
Luke would kill the Kid in a gunfight.
In the second place, if Luke did get shot, he's got two brothers just as ornery as he is.
Nah, the only safe place for Ringo is in the pen, and I aim to get him there all in one piece!
Well, I'll be doggoned if I didn't do you an injury, Curley.
- I figured you were after the reward.
- Reward?
Why, the Kid's old man and me was friends.
We used to punch cattle together.
Besides, I could use that 500 in gold.
- Bridesmaid!
- Uh-uh! Steady!
Steady, girl!
Bridesmaid! In line!
I can't get over the impertinence of that young lieutenant.
I'll make it warm for that shavetail!
I'll report him to Washington!
We pay taxes to the government, and what do we get?
- Not even protection from the army.
- No.
I don't know what the government is coming to.
Instead of protecting businessmen, it pokes its nose into business.
Hmph!
Why, they're even talking now about having bank examiners.
As if we bankers don't know how to run our own banks!
Why, Boone, I actually had a letter from a popinjay official... saying they were going to inspect my books!
I have a slogan that should be blazoned on every newspaper in the country -
America for Americans!
The government must not interfere with business!
Reduce taxes!
Our national debt is something shocking!
Over $1 billion a year!
What this country needs is a businessman for president!
What this country needs is more fuddle.
- What?
- Fuddle!
You're drunk, sir!
I'm happy, Gatewood.
Boo!
How come you're taking this road?
It's gonna be cold up there.
I'm usin' my head.
Those breech-clad Apaches don't like snow.
Maybe you'd like to - to sit next to me.
I - You could put your head on my shoulder.
No, thank you.
How are you feeling, Mrs. Mallory?
Is there any water?
Driver! Canteen, please!
Just a minute, Mrs. Mallory.
Haven't I seen this crest before?
Isn't this from Greenfield Manor?
I wouldn't know, Mrs. Mallory. I -
I won this cup on a wager.
- Oh.
- How about the other lady?
Thanks.
Sorry. No silver cups.
This is fine.
No.
Please, Doctor.
Yow, girls!
Whoa, steady. Ho.
Howdy, Chris. Seven hours from Dry Fork.
Pretty fast drivin', amigo!
Get the folks a bite to eat, Chris, while we change horses. We're pushing on to Lordsburg.
You come without soldiers?
Oh, we weren't a-scared.
We didn't see one Apache, did we, Curley?
- Where's the cavalry, Chris?
- Uh-huh. Where's the soldiers?
There ain't no soldiers.
- Huh?
- Soldiers have gone.
Where's Captain Mallory?
Where's my husband?
Where is he?
You're his wife, I think?
Yes. Where is he?
Did he go with his men?
Si, señora.
Little what you call it - scrimmage with the Apaches last night.
Soldiers take Captain Mallory to Lordsburg.
I think he get hurt maybe.
Badly?
Si, señora.
I think so.
Mrs. Mallory, I'm awfully sorry.
If there's anything I can -
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Marshal! Come here! Quickly!
Come on, Doc.
Let's go, Doc.
- Poor woman.
- A sick woman on our hands!
- That's all we needed!
- I feel kinda sick myself.
We're in a fine fix, my friends.
It's a fine country we're living in.
The army has no right to leave a public place like this undefended.
Looks to me like the army's got its hands pretty full, mister.
- Have you a wife?
- Si, señora, I think.
- Call her.
- Yakima! ¿Dónde estás?
Ringo, go in the kitchen and get some hot water, lots of hot water, please.
Yes, ma'am. Hey, Chris!
¿Dónde la cocina?
Aqui está, Kid.
A fine member of the medical profession.
Drunken beast.
Coffee.
Give me coffee.
Black coffee.
Lots of it.
- More! More! More!
- Ain't it enough, Doc? That's four.
- Blacker! Stronger! Keep it comin', Curley!
- You'll have it coming out your ears in a minute.
Drink it down, Doc. Go on.
Drink it down.
- Get it down.
- That'll make you feel better.
All right, Doc.
Isn't that drunken swine sober yet?
- He's doing the best he can!
- Well, hurry!
- Shh! Está malo.
- Tinhorn.
- How you feeling?
- Fine.
Thanks. Again.
Sit down here, Doc.
Keep the fire going, Chris.
- Plenty of hot water.
- Si, señor. Si.
Savages!
That's my wife, Yakima. My squaw.
Yes, but she's - she's savage!
Si, señor.
She a little bit savage, I think.
Ándale pronto. A calentar agua.
A la enferma, pronto.
Something funny about this.
That woman's an Apache.
Sure, she's one of
Geronimo's people, I think.
Maybe not so bad to have Apache wife, eh?
Apache don't bother me, I think.
- All right, Doc?
- All right.
All right, Dallas.

Ringo!
It's them vaqueros!
They've run away!
Yeah, with the spare horses.
Them coyotes give me the creeps.
It sounds li -
Well, it sounds just like a baby.
Black eight.
It's a baby.
It's a little girl.
It's a little girl.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Why didn't somebody tell me?
How's Mrs. Mallory?
She's going to be all right.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
- Did-Did you know?
- Why -
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Don't do that.
Dr. Boone.
Come on, boys.
Three cheers for ol' Doc Boone.
- Hip, hip -
- Quiet.
- Well, we oughta be -
- Quiet.
Mrs. Mallory.
Oh.
Kid, I know why you want to go to Lordsburg.
I like you. I know your pop.
He was good friend of mine.
If you know who in Lordsburg, you stay away, I think.
You mean Luke Plummer?
Luke, Ike and Hank - all there together.
I saw them.
- Are you sure of that, Chris?
- Sure. I can tell you the truth.
- I know.
- Thanks.
- That's all I wanted to know.
- You crazy if you go.
I think you stay away, Kid.
Three against one is no good.
You oughtn't to go too far, Miss Dallas.
Apaches like to sneak up and pick off strays.
You, uh, visitin' in Lordsburg?
No. No, I have friends there.
And maybe I can find work.
Say, look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
- Why don't you get away?
- I aim to - in Lordsburg.
Why Lordsburg?
Why don't you make for the border now?
My father and brother were shot down by the Plummer boys.
Guess you don't know how it feels to lose your own folks that way.
I lost mine when I was a kid.
There was a massacre on Superstition Mountain.
That's tough, especially on a girl.
Well, you gotta live no matter what happens.
Yeah. That's it.
Look, Miss Dallas, you got no folks.
And neither have I, and, well... maybe I'm taking a lot for granted, but -
I watched you with that baby... that other woman's baby.
You looked, well -
Well, I still got a ranch across the border.
And it's a nice place, a real nice place.
Trees and grass, water.
There's a cabin half built.
A man could live there... and a woman.
Will you go?
But you don't know me.
You don't know who I am.
I know all I want to know.
Will you go?
Oh, don't talk like that.
What are you doing out here, Kid?
Stick close to the reservation.
Curley! Oh, Curley!
Oh! Curley! Curley!
- What's wrong, Chris?
- My wife, Yakima - she run away.
- When I wake up, she was gone.
- The way you come busting in here, you'd think -
- Whoa.
- Excuse me, Kid.
Come busting in here, you'd think we were being attacked.
- You can find another wife.
- Sure I can find another wife.
But she take my rifle and my horse.
Oh, I never sell her.
I love her so much.
I beat her with the whip, and she never get tired.
- Your wife?
- No. My horse.
Oh.
I can find another wife easy, yes, but not a horse like that.
Mala Yakima.
I knew that woman was a thief, by -
What's the matter with you, Gatewood?
My valise! Where's my valise?
Which one of you have got it?
Here it is. I was usin' it for a pillow.
I didn't think you'd mind.
I thought I told you to keep your hands off my things!
Yes, sir.
That squaw of yours will find some Apaches and bring 'em back here.
My wife's people don't bother me, I think.
Well, they bother me, I think.
Chris, is this bar open?
Sure, all the time, señor. Si.
Good.
Here you are, Doc.
Well, what are we wasting time for?
Let's make a break for it.
- We've got a sick woman to think of.
- Do you want her to stay here and be butchered with the rest of us?
- Why don't you think of somebody else for once?
- Do you realize who you're talking to?
Easy, easy! Quiet, boys. Quiet.
We ain't been butchered yet.
But you're right.
We'd better get going for Lordsburg as soon as we can.
Might be a good idea, Curley, if, uh,
Doc took a look at the patient.
Yeah, and Little Coyote.
You'll join me, Doctor?
No, thanks.
Morning.
Well, you're looking pretty chipper.
Hmm. You're up early, Dallas.
She didn't go to bed, Doctor.
I'm afraid she sat up all night while I slept.
Oh, I slept a lot in the chair.
Well, anyway, it was nice to stay awake and hold the baby.
Hmm. Well, we've got to get you to Lordsburg, Little Coyote.
That's what the boys christened her last night when she squalled - Little Coyote.
- How do you feel?
- Fine, thanks. A little tired.
- Doctor, do you think my husband -
- Never mind him.
The best medicine he can have is to see you two safe and sound.
You just make up your mind you're gonna get there.
- I have made up my mind.
- That's the stuff.
- I am going to get there.
- You need strength, so get all the rest you can.
Dallas, do you suppose you can fix up a little broth?
- She has already.
- Good.
How about making some coffee for the boys?
Now you get some sleep, Mrs. Mallory.
And don't look so proud.
I've brought hundreds of those little fellas into the world... once upon a time.
And the new one was always the prettiest.
Doc.
Ringo asked me to marry him.
Is that wrong for a girl like me?
If a man and woman love each other, it's all right, ain't it, Doc?
You're going to be hurt, child.
Worse than you've ever been hurt.
Don't you know that boy's headed back for prison?
Besides, if you two go into Lordsburg together... he's going to know all about you.
He's not goin' into Lordsburg.
All I want is for you to tell me it's all right.
Gosh, child, who am I to tell you what's right or wrong?
All right. Go ahead.
Do it if you can.
Good luck.
Thanks, Doc.
- Ringo -
- Well, Doc?
Oh, both doing nicely.
She's a real soldier's wife, that young lady.
Good, good.
Then we can leave immediately.
Well, not for a day or so if you want my professional advice.
What do you mean a day?
Stay another day? Why?
Where were you when the stork came last night, Gatewood?
I refuse to allow Mrs. Mallory to travel until she and the child are out of danger.
What do you mean danger?
Aren't we in worse danger here?
I don't wish to intrude.
But I've had five children.
I mean, my dear wife has.
And much as I dislike discussing it, in this hour of our trial...
I - I believe the doctor's right.
Spoken like a man, Reverend.
I say we ought to leave here before the
Apaches find us. That's common sense.
I wish you were 10 years younger,
Gatewood.
- Don't let my white hairs stop you -
- Now just a minute!
Quiet! Quiet!
- Now, Curley, I haven't said a word!
- Will you shut up!
Now, if we argue this thing out right, we can get somewhere.
Let's all sit down and talk sensible.
Come on, Buck. Sit down.
There's a young woman in the kitchen making coffee.
She needs help.
Thanks, Doc.
Say, Kid.
How old were you when you went to the pen?
Oh, I was... goin' on 17.
Mornin', ma'am.
Morning.
I, uh, laid awake most of the night... wondering what you'd have said if Curley hadn't busted in.
Guess you was up kind of late too.
I could hear you moving around.
You didn't answer what I asked you last night.
Look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
There's a horse out there in the corral.
Curley won't go after you because he can't leave the passengers in a fix like this.
I gotta go to Lordsburg.
Why don't you go to my ranch and wait for me?
Wait for a dead man.
You haven't got a chance.
It was three against one when the Plummers swore that you killed their foreman, got you sent up.
It'll be three against one in Lordsburg.
Well, there's some things a man just can't run away from.
How can you talk about your life and my life when you're throwing them away?
Yeah. Mine too.
That's what you're throwing away if you go to Lordsburg.
What do you want me to do?
Would it make us any happier if Luke Plummer was dead?
One of his brothers would be after you with a gun.
We'd never be safe.
I don't want that kind of life, Ringo.
Well, I don't see what else I can do.
Go now. Get away.
Forget Lordsburg. Forget the Plummers.
Make for the border, and I'll come to you.
- Do you mean that?
- Yes, I do.
Will you go with me, Dallas?
Oh, I can't leave Mrs. Mallory and the baby.
I'll come to you from Lordsburg.
I swear it.
Well, I oughta have a rifle and -
I've got one. Right here.
- I got it last night when they were all asleep.
- You mean you thought of this last night?
Yeah. Don't ask any more questions.
Not now.
Aw, gosh, Curley, there ain't no Apaches behind us.
Aw, gosh, Curley, there ain't no Apaches behind us.
We can still go back to Tonto.
- No! I insist we go on to Lordsburg.
- What do you think, Chris?
Geronimo between here and Lordsburg - with my horse, I think.
- ♪ My horse has gone ♪
- No, Doctor. Oh!
♪ She has gone astray with the sun - ♪♪
Quiet, Doc.
This is a serious matter, ain't it?
My dear Buck... if I have only one hour to live,
I'm going to enjoy myself.
Doctor, I don't begrudge you my samples, but I think -
Now you hush! I've stood enough of you.
Now this is a serious problem, and I'm the only one that's talkin' sense.
- Now, Curley, if -
- If we can get across that ferry, we'll be all right.
Question is, what are we gonna do about the lady and her baby?
Dr. Boone has settled that for us, sir... and I demand respect for his professional opinion.
Hatfield.
Ringo.
Ringo!
Ringo!
Hurry, Ringo.
- Ringo!
- Hurry!
- Bye, Dallas.
- Good-bye!
Ringo! Don't stop! Go on! Go on!
Keep riding!
Ringo, go on! Go on!
Curley! No! Let him go! Stop it!
You don't need them, Curley.
- I ain't gonna run away.
- I'll say you ain't.
Look at them hills.
- Apaches.
- War signals.
Hurry up, Marshal!
What's - Why don't we start?
Come on, Bridesmaid! Yow! Yow!
Nice girls! Yow! Go!
Hey, Curley, why don't you take the cuffs off the Kid?
- He's mighty handy with a gun.
- You drive them horses.
- I'll take care of the Kid.
- Oh!
Can't you drive any faster?
You thick-headed lout!
We've got to make that ferry.
A man works all his life to get ahold of some money so that he can enjoy life... and has to run into a trap like this.
A trap, brother? You mean the Apaches?
There's been no sign of them.
You don't see any signs of them.
They strike like rattlesnakes.
If you hadn't insisted on waiting for her, we'd have been across the ferry by this time.
You talk too much, Gatewood.
Your threats don't faze me, Hatfield.
You're nothing but a tinhorn gambler.
How would you like to get out and walk?
You can't put me out of a public conveyance.
Now, now, gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Take it easy, Gatewood.
We may need that fight before we get to the ferry.
You wouldn't be much good in a fight, you jailbird!
Oh, leave the Kid alone. He's handcuffed.
Gentlemen, please.
Let's not forget the ladies, bless them.
Let's have a little Christian charity one for the other.
Well, folks, we're coming in to Lee's Ferry now.
Lordsburg - next stop!
Nice girls! Get along! Get along!
Curley, look. Look at the ferry.
It's burnt too.
Hatfield, stand guard over there.
Where's the army?
What are the soldiers doing?
Curley, what can I do?
- Are they going to let Geronimo burn and pillage the whole country?
Ringo, I need you. Will you give me your word you won't try to escape again?
I'll give you my word - till Lordsburg.
- Get in the coach with them women.
- I gave you my word.
- Ringo, don't!
- Dallas.
Buck, drive into the river up to the hubs.
Brownie! Bessie! Bridesmaid!
Come on, girls! Hah! Get down!
Move out! Ho!
Whoa, Duchess! Come on, baby!
Come on, girls. Steady now.
Look out, Curley.
Kid, take your suspenders and cross-tie them wheelers.
Sorry about the saddle, Kid.
- Ready, Kid?
- All set.
- Ready, Buck?
- All ready, Curley.
Here we go! Here we go, Buck!
Hyah! Hyah!
Just sit quiet, folks.
You'll be all right.
Come on, girl. Ho, Bridesmaid!
Come on, baby! Good girl!
Ho! Steady, Duchess! Steady there!
Attagirl!
Honey child!
Easy now. Ho!
Good girl. That's a girl!
Whoa!
Ho, girl! Take it!
♪ All aboard for Lordsburg, Lordsburg ♪
- Hey, Curley.
- Yeah. What?
You think I ought to charge
Mrs. Mallory's baby half fare?
Sweetheart!
Well, we'll soon be in Lordsburg.
Uh, sorry I flew off the handle, Hatfield.
My apologies, Doctor.
No hard feelings, I hope.
All in all, it's been an exciting, very interesting trip.
Has it not?
Well, now that the danger's passed, Mr. -
Peacock.
Ladies and gentlemen, since it's most unlikely... that we'll ever have the pleasure of meeting again socially...
I'd like to propose a toast.
Major...
Gatewood...

Yow! Yow, girl!
Yow! Yow! Yow!
Giddap! Ho! Ho!
Hurry up, girls!
I warned you about this - this danger!
But you wouldn't listen to me!
Gatewood, will you shut up!
I've got a patient here!
No, you can't stop me.
Let me out of here, I tell you!
- Will you shut up!

Yow! Yow!
Curley! More ammunition!
Do you hear it?
Do you hear it?
It's a bugle!
They're blowing the charge!
If you see Judge Greenfield... tell him his son -
- Thank heaven you're safe, Lucy.
- Where's Richard? Is he all right?
Oh, he's all right.
Don't you worry.
- It isn't a bad wound.
- We'll take you to him immediately.
Where's the baby, dear?
I'll take the baby.
Dallas.
If there's ever anything I can do for -
I know.
Orderly.
It's the Ringo Kid!
Yeah!
Hey, Curley! How are you?
Aces and eights.
Dead man's hand, Luke.
Ringo Kid's in town.
Yeah. Drivin' the stage.
- Mis hermanos.
- Si, patrón. Un momento.
Cash in.
Easy now. Easy. That's right.
Good-bye, Miss Dallas.
If you ever come to Kansas City, Kansas,
I want you to come out to see us.
- Oh, thanks, Mr., uh -
- Peacock.
- Hello, Buck.
- They got here all right.
- You got through all right.
- All right, folks, you're here.
All right, folks. You're all right. Unload.
Here you are, Doctor.
Will you sign this?
Well, Lordsburg.
Thank you. And you, Doctor.
There you are. Thank you.
Well, Kid.
Curley, how long will they give me for breakin' out?
Oh, about another year.
- You know where my ranch is?
- Yeah.
Will you see that she gets there all right?
Dallas.
Yeah.
This is no town for a girl like her.
Will you do it?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
How are ya, Marshal?
Get my man through all right?
I don't need them.
If you don't want to lose your prisoner, Sheriff, you'd better take care of him yourself.
- What's your name, mister?
- My name is Gatewood. Ellsworth H. Gatewood.
Oh. Gatewood. You didn't think they'd have the telegraph wires fixed, did you?
You thought you escaped.
We got our banker!
Can I meet you back here in 10 minutes?
I gave you my word, Curley.
I ain't goin' back on it now.
No ammunition.
I lied to you, Curley.
Got three left.
Come on.
Good night, Kid.
- Is this where you live?
- No.
I gotta know where you live, don't I?
No. Don't come any further.
It's all been a crazy dream.
I've been out of my mind just hopin'.
Say good-bye here, Kid.
We ain't never gonna say good-bye.
Could I have that?
Give me the shotgun.
Shotgun!
Luke! Luke, please don't!
Well, Kid, I -
I told you not to follow me.
Dallas.
I asked you to marry me, didn't I?
I'll never forget you asked me, Kid.
That's something.
Wait here.
Uh -
Ringo said he'll be passing this way in... six or seven minutes.
Come on.
I'll take that shotgun, Luke.
You'll take it in the belly if you don't get out of my way.
I'll have you indicted for murder if you step outside with that shotgun.
We'll attend to you later.
Don't ever let me do that again.
Luke.
Luke.
Hey, Billy! Billy, kill that story about the Republican convention in Chicago and take this down!
"The Ringo Kid was killed on Main Street in Lordsburg tonight!
And among the additional dead was" -
Leave that blank for a spell.
- I didn't hear any shootin', Ed.
- You will, Billy. You will.
Hank missed him - at four feet.
Ringo. Ringo.
Ringo.
Ready, Kid?
Thanks, Curley.
Curley's gonna see that you get to my place across the border.
Well, good-bye, Dallas.
Good-bye.
Maybe you'd like to ride a ways with the Kid.
Please.
- Yea! Yea!
- Yea!
Well, they're saved from the blessings of civilization.
Yeah.
Doc?
I'll, uh, buy you a drink.
Just one.
Martial...I was just gonna apply for a job.
Its all right son. My deputy just gone down there with all the men we need.
What's all the trouble, Martial ?
Who is he ?
Boys, get that man. I want him.
Wait a minute. I will get him.
Watch this fella.
Well Martial, I guess you got me ... but I was not mixed up with that gang
...I was trying to help you.
-You darn fool.. I noted.
I just wanted to talk to you when you lead out.
I got a job for you and it ain't fighting fire with others.
Say, I been looking for a fellow that can shoot, ride like you for months.
Think I am going to let you get away ?
No Sire...
Take a look at this.
-What's wrong with that ?
-Nothing maybe .. it might be funny to me that every time this gang organizes Rodeo
...their own men win all the first prizes.
Once it begins to look like an outsider was going to win, he gets sick.. two or three has even died from it.
-cannot arrest them for that, Martial.
-no, maybe not.
... but its mighty peculiar ... that when all these outsiders fall fall off from them tough horses suffering from snakebites. I tell you it ain't natural. what do you want me to do, get snake bit ?
No, my idea is for you to trail over there and sign up for the Rodeo.
I will come along after and do some private investigating.
...while you work in on the gang. cause you don't have to know me when we get there.
-what do you say to that son ?
-sounds great to me.
-when do we start ?
-right away. this game is getting pretty hot for us.
If we are tiring the law to figure out something crooked with this whole Rodeo business they will start investigating.
Now I will decide when we make our next clean up right here in Dalton. head for the border... before something happens we will stick up the next stage of the mine grab the rodeo receipt, and clear out. you are right spike. they acted mighty suspicious when that fella died over the boulder
-when do we start ?
-Tomorrow.
Dolores will board the stage, down at sagebrush and give you boys a high sign when the money is aboard women passengers as a stage crew ain't liable to fight much anyhow
.well, well Cramer. meet my new deputy John Weston.
I want you to paddle west with the shortcut trail the one that leads to Dalton. save him a whole days journey, if he had to go on the way over the desert. give him a horse. I will see that another is sent to you.
-sure thing.
-you better get going then, right now. the trail starts outside the corral, cant get off of it. then you go 14 miles straight through the mountain that will drop you right out of the timber on the main stage road that leads to Dalton.
Howdy Miss Carter, going home for the big round up ?
-Oh yes! I promised Dad that I will be there.
-I bet, he will be mighty glad to see you.
I will be glad to see him too.
-Pardon me. Do you mind if I sit on this side?
-Well, certainly not. Its quiet alright. looks like we are getting some help from back there. you sure got us out of the jam, that time stranger. nice riding. you don't happen to be going to the Dalton Rodeo... do you ?
-Yes I am.
- Well tie your horse on behind and ride in with us. thanks, I will do that. that was very fine of you to come to our rescue.. Mr.. ....
Weston Mam.
John Weston from Utah.
I came over for the rodeo ...
...I saw your distress signal from the top of the ridge.. when I saw all those men riding behind,
I thought I better come down and investigate.
-My distress signal ?
-it was mine.
I saw the men coming and waved for help. that was kind of an unusual place to expect help, wasn't it ?
-I saw you on the ridge.
-Oh, I see.
-Are you going to Dalton mam ?
-Yes, I am Margaret Carter.
...my father is Judge Carter. president of the county news bank of Dalton...
I want you to meet him when we get there. he will want to thank you too.
You see the bank had a large shipment of money on this stage.
Yeah. there were about 50 of them. but this fella from Utah comes along single-handed and knocks them all off the horses.
I have never seen such riding. can you tell me where I can find Weston ?
-Just went in the bank there, Mr. Carter.
-Thank You.
Hello Miss. Carter.
This is Mr. Weston.. the man who saved us from the bandits.
Mr. Weston. my father ...Judge Carter. mighty fine piece of work, young man.
I hope you are staying in Dalton.
-Yes. I am going to enter the rodeo.
-that's fine.
Drop into my office after you get settled.
I like to have a talk with you. thank you, I will be glad to.
-you cant blame me if your men cant take care of him. she is right. just out-smarted you that's all.
I don't like the looks of it. he came up behind us and took the boys off there horses. he said he will enter the rodeo.
-we are going to have to take care of him. he is liable to spoil our plans.
-hey, young man.
-hello Judge.
-come in.
- thank you.
Miss Carter !
- How do you do ? as justice of the peace of this township,
I have been doing a little investigating. and it appears to me that this rodeo gang ain't just not exactly on the level. if it ain't, we are going to need all the good men we can get on the side of law and order. it would be mighty disastrous son, if anything happens to this rodeo. nearly all the money in this valley is tied up in it.
... so we just got to keep it honest. you mean to say that these people have tied up all the money in the valley on a proposition put on by outsiders ? yes, every cent. they think that it will bring people and prosperity to Dalton. and they are all mighty proud of this little valley. that's why I am offering you the job of Deputy Sheriff.
I figure, that with a man like you representing us they wont dare to pull any of their tricks. well, I appreciate your confidence in me Judge, but I couldn't accept. it will interfere with my plans.
- plans ! what plans ?
My plans to enter the rodeo, tomorrow.
- Oh ! I see. Well I am sorry young man... so am I judge.
Good day Miss Carter.
- I am afraid I was talking to the wrong man.
- I think he is nice.
Ladies and Gentlemen ! it gives me great pleasure to announce the first annual Dalton rally roundup. two days of Bronc riding
... consisting of riding, roping and horsemanship featuring Dynamite, the only unridden horse in the play better be careful son. many of them have lost their lives making up with this thing.
Oh, I don't think they will try anything today. by tomorrow, I may have this thing figured out for you
I hope so, but I still say you ought to be careful. next on the program, ladies and gentlemen .. will be the trick roping contest. featuring Jack Hollister. the next event ladies and gentlemen will be the roman standing race. next ladies and gentlemen we introduce the world-renowned holder of all championships
...Cheyenne Kent and the cub roping contest. let her go ! new record in this contest, ladies and gentlemen..
Kent's time was 15 seconds flat. its a brave try but Kent's record still stands. however we have a dark horse with us today.
A man from Utah will try his luck. let him loose ! a new world record, ladies and gentlemen! the man from Utah rode and tied his cub in 14 seconds flat. that one got away!
...better luck next time... that's 3 events taken in a day, the one from Utah ! he looks like holding to me. yeah! we got to do something about it.
I don't want to pull anything too rough unless we have to.
Kent, you take the boys up into the cabin and Dolores will get him up there. just work over him gently. leave that for us.
-are you ready ?
-let her loose.
Dolores, the young girl that you met on the stage was in the gang from the beginning. play up to her and see what you can find out.
I will meet you in the saloon tonight. that concludes today's event, ladies and gentlemen.
Don't forget, tomorrow is the big day.
-Oh, you were wonderful.
-thanks Miss. that means lot coming from you.
I like you to come to the house for dinner tonight.
I told father that maybe you can get you to reconsider the offer. we need somebody like you.
Oh, Mr. Weston. It was wonderful the way you win today. my brother is a big Rodeo star also. and he would like to meet you.
..wont you come now ?
- well .... I ....
Yes. goodbye Miss. Carter!
I will see you tomorrow.
-here they come Kent !
-you boys get out at the back. this is my brother, Cheyenne Kent.
-how do you do Kent.
-pleased that you have accepted our hospitality.
-sit down, Dolores will fix us a drink.
-thanks.
I must say that I watched your show today and thought you were great. well you did some mighty fine work yourself.
-full on !
-no thanks. I don't drink well, here's looking at you ! well Weston, tomorrow is the big day now that you would ride in with us. he got away ! we have to go tell Boss about this. and he will be plenty sore. hey sheriff, the gang just jumped me up at the Spanish woman's house.
I got a hunch that if you go up there, you can pick up some of the gang that were mixed up at the stage coach hold up yesterday. yeah ? well you don't get look to me like that you have been in any fight you don't get me out of here on no wild goose chase either.
I am staying right here to guard this money.
-suit yourself.
-oh Utah! I got some prize money for you..
-that's a lot of money there judge ?
-yeah. we are doing pretty well. taken in 8.000 dollars today, and expecting more tomorrow. we will have close to 30.000 dollars in this bank, by tomorrow night.
30.000 dollars,
- you are taking an awful chance, aren't you ?
I am still guarding this bank, young fellow. pardon me Sheriff ! thanks judge. hello Miss Carter !
Hey Buddy ! ain't you the whooper snapper that won most of the events out there today ?
-I wont appraise it that way.
-sit down. hey, you look like the young fellow that won the belt at Cheyenne, last summer. no that was my grand dad.
I have been nosing around. seems to me that we will have to give this fellow Burton. after what you have done today, he will probably be glad knowing you. get on the bar and make a bet on yourself you lookie up. well alright! if you cant fix him off, then I have to buy him off. if you are wrong with your work
I will use my brain. that boy put it over on you twice. fine bunch you are. guess who is just talk out there. he just came in.
-fine, I will take care of him right now.
-what it will be ?
-wanna place a bet? a 1000 dollars, on Weston to win. he is on 1:2. favor. that's right but its an easy 500.
Beg pardon ! you are Weston aren't you ? my name is Burton ...
...I am head of the rodeo committee.
-I would like to talk to you privately.
-certainly Burton.
I want to apologize for the little over incident that my boys had with you. they thought you were somebody else. they found out their mistake and they are sure sorry.
...I would like to have you meet them. fact is I like to have you join up with us Weston. you will never get into the big money in this game unless you play with a gang.
I guess you know what I mean.
- well it sounds good to me.
I have always heard that you have to be on the inside
...to be anything. what's your proposition? just this, right now you are 1 to 2 in favor. that means you are going to win on a 1000 dollars bet, 500 dollars. seems for you to do is to let me place 2000 for you on Kent's 2:1. and if you should be off form tomorrow and Kent wins, you stand to make 4.000 dollars. now that's a lot better than 500 dollars isn't it ?
- I am glad that you are right. that's fine, I am glad that you can see it our way. come into the back room.
I want you to meet some of the boys. boys, Weston here is going to join up with us.
I want you all to treat him right.
- Weston meet Cheyenne Kent.
- I think we have met before.
-signore Weston, we will see a lot of each other, now that we are friends.
I am kind of agreeing at this racket,
I suppose there are a lot of things over this rodeo business that you can tell me.
-well Boys, see you later. so long Burton. -so long.
-well just make that 2.000 on Weston. see boys, it just takes a bit of brains to handle a guy like that. yeah.. how do you know that he wont cross yourselves ? well, if he does then we can still get him with the needle. we are cleaning up all this after this one anyhow.
-what did you make out son?
-you had the right hunch Martial.
Burton is the brains in the gang alright.
I placed the bet like you told me ... he made me a proposition to join them outfit.
-did you accept ?
-sure, I accepted. he took me right in to introduce me to the rest of the gang. I met them all.
Burton told me that he place 2.000 dollar bet on Cheyenne Kent for me. and if I should lose the event that
I was entered in, I stand to win 4000 dollars. so I don't think that we have much to worry about them, till I start to winning. and then it may be too late for them to get organized.
I don't know son. strikes me, you better be mighty careful. remember what happened to them the other fellas. this gang tough bunch when somebody crosses them.
I don't want to see you take down with snakebite. you get anything out of the Spanish woman ?
-no, she wouldn't talk much. she took me up to that shack on the hill and introduced me to Cheyenne Kent. she said, he was her brother. and before I can get into some understanding.. the whole gang jumped me and I had to curve myself up fast and walking.
I didn't get you into this job to get yourself killed.
-you got any ideas how they work the snakebite proposition ? not yet, but figuring from their past performances
I  cant do much till the bronc riding. that's one of the last events tomorrow. so I will have till the end to figure it out. and besides its going to take them sometime to get wise that I am not gonna lose this rodeo.
- never forgive myself if anything happens to you.
- nothings gonna happen
-come on lets turn in.
-tomorrow is the big day.
I want to announce in time that the high man from yesterday's events was the man from Utah.
...Cheyenne Kent is the runner up. and it looks like a close race. in the events for today, the contestants will contest riding, roping and bull dogging, ending in a thrilling demonstration of horsemanship. and both the man from Utah and 
Cheyenne Kent will try their luck on Dynamite. may the best man win ! and for the first time ladies and gentlemen..
...you will see the Indians from the Daltons reservation... Zaenìte let her go. they are sure going to give it to you today. do you think you got it doped out..
I don't know for certain, but I gotta good hunch
- you better not take any chances.
- its the only way to get the dope on them say, you got that snakebite medicine.
- sure, plenty of them.
- that's what I will try here take this out there with the needle. what are you thinking about son ? on my mind, I think I got this thing figured out. come on I am on the next event. next is the bull dogging ladies and gentlemen watch closely, this is going to be good
Cheyenne Kent will try to keep bulldogging record. let her go. his time was 13 second, the best so far.
John Weston, the man from Utah is next up.
I got to leave Mergeree. the receipts are in by now.
I have got to take them over and put it in the vault. that was another one from the man from Utah folks. he beat the best time by 2 seconds. or 11 seconds flat. we got to stop that guy right now. if he wins the bronc riding we are licked. when that double crosser comes up for the bronc, you boys get the needle. and make it strong .. and now get going. ladies and gentlemen Cheyenne Kent will attempt to ride Dynamite. unridden for 3 years. let her go.
- everything all fixed up for me boys ?
-its all yours ! maybe I better sit into one saddle myself to make sure. you will find everything alright. ladies and gentlemen, the man from Utah will try his luck on Dynamite. ride him cowboy ! just a minute. let him loose. man from Utah on Dynamite ! that guy is wise. he found out about the needle and now he is riding the bronc. we better get moving. we clear out the bank and get over the line.
-what about me ?
-that's for you to figure out. he rode him ladies and gentlemen. he rode him ! what a ride.
-Senor Weston !
-what's the matter ?
Barton and his boys are holding up the bank and they have left us behind.
-put up your hands !
- well sheriff.. I ... robbery and murder eh ? well you didn't get away with it.
I thought you acted kind of suspicious last night when you were looking over that money 
...and tried to get me out of there.
-but.. Sheriff ! save your breath young fellow. just a minute sheriff...
...I am United States martial that young fella was working for me. we were after a gang of rodeo crooks and you almost let the biggest one getaway. now I gotta organize a posse and go after him. nice work son, come on boys take him out. boy you got them red handed. that's not all, here's enough evidence that can send that gang up for murder. whenever anyone interfered with their rodeo plans they stuck one of these needles. dipped in snake venom in the saddle. that's how the men died and why we couldn't prove any of them....
...I knew there was a mystery about this bunch. by jolly, it took you to figure it out. well you see Miss Margaret, its like this, he had to play up to that gal
...so he can get in with the gang. well, in that case I will have to forgive him. say young fella, how about the deputy sheriff job ? sorry judge, but I cant accept.
-it will interfere with my plans
-plans .. what are you planning now ? well dad, he promised to stay away from these beautiful seneoritas...
...and we got to plan our honeymoon. so long judge.
MAN: Chandu the Magician.
MAN: In the three years that thou has dwelt among us... thou has conquered the atma of the spirt... and found thy reward in the powers proclaimed by Shiva.
Thou shalt look into the eyes of men... and they shall be as straw in thine hands.
Thou shalt cause them to see what is not there... even unto a gathering of 12 times 12.
My son, I proclaim thee one of the sacred company of the yogi... and bestow upon thee the name of Chandu.
Thou hast done well, my son.
To few indeed of thy race have the secrets of the yogi been revealed.
To you, my teacher, I express my thanks.
- What more can I learn?
- Nothing, now. The world needs thee.
Go forth in thy youth and strength... and conquer the evil that threatens mankind.
I have gazed in the crystal, and I've seen the forces of death and destruction... rising from the brain of a madman.
Look.
- CHANDU: Who is this man?
- YOGI: This man is Roxor.
YOGI: Last of an ancient family that lived in Alexandria.
He has built a home in the rock temple of Madu... that stands on the great cliffs above the third cataract of the Nile.
But why am I appointed to fight this man?
It is fate who has chosen thee for the task, my son.
And because no man fights so well as when he is protecting his loved ones... fate has thrown thine own family in the path of this human monster.
Look.
CHANDU: Dorothy... my sister.
YOGI: Yes. Her husband has brought his family to Cairo... so that he maybe near his friend Roxor.
YOGI: This man, Robert Regent... has a secret of enormous power.
CHANDU:
Yes. For years, my brother-in-law... has worked to perfect a death ray strong enough to destroy whole cities.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
- He's never found it.
YOGI:
This death ray in the hands of Roxor...
Means an end to goodness...
An end to all that is noble... all that is sane.
Can't you do something?
Surely the police must be able to find some trace of him.
Oh, please telephone me as soon as you have any news at all.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Mother. Mother, you mustn't worry.
- I'm sure we'll hear from Father soon.
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Mother? Look at the letters I found.
- Where did you get them, Betty?
- In the laboratory.
- You didn't go out there in the dark now?
Oh, Mother, how could anyone be hanging around the garden in this sandstorm?
I thought I might find some clues in them.
But you mustn't go outside again.
Why? Did you see something?
Tell me. Did you bolt the door when you came through?
I... I don't remember.
- What did you see, Mother?
- Nothing, Bobby.
It may be foolish, but I thought I saw a face peering in at that window.
Oh, Mother, let's go away from here.
We can't, dearest. Not until we have some news from your father.
- (CLATTERING)
- Listen!
I thought I heard a door close.
- What's that?
- (EERIE RINGING)
Well, what's the matter?
Don't you recognize me?
- Oh, Frank! (SOBBING)
- There, there.
Now, don't cry. Don't cry.
I've come here to help you find Robert.
- Uncle Frank, do you know about Father?
- Yes, dear.
- Do you know where he is?
- I want to talk to you alone, Dorothy.
My, my, Betty Lou, how you've grown.
And Bobby too. But he's too big to kiss.
Sure. We're grown up pretty nearly,
Uncle Frank... so why can't we stay and hear what you know about Father?
- I'll tell you everything later.
- There's something I want to know now.
What was that bell that rang just before you came in?
That was an astral bell.
It tells you when a yogi is near.
- You're really a yogi now?
- Mm-hmm.
And when I hear that bell, I know it's a warning from a yogi that danger threatens.
- (HOWLING)
- What's that?
DOROTHY: It's only a pride of dogs down by the river.
"Now that I know your plans, no money on earth...
"could persuade me to sell you the secret of the death ray.
"If you try to approach me again,
I shall denounce you to the authorities.
I'm convinced you are a madman and should be dealt with accordingly."
Do you know whom this letter was intended for?
- No.
- Roxor.
- Roxor?
- I'm sure of it. Robert's his prisoner.
- Where?
- That I don't know.
I tried to communicate with his mind, but the crystal revealed nothing.
He must be...
- Dead?
- No, no.
Just probably drugged, that's all.
Unconscious.
Robert Regent, I'm calling you. Calling!
You see? It's useless.
Calling him has no response.
(SCREAMING) Help!
Let me go! Stop it!
- Who sent you here?
- Roxor.
- Where did you see Roxor?
- At the wine cellar of... (INDISTINCT)
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
- ## (MIDEASTERN)
- (CHATTERING)
I wish to see Roxor.
The effendi is speaking with a friend and may not be disturbed.
He will see me.
Tell him it is Princess Nadji.
MAN: Bring the princess here.
We must not let her find you here, Abdullah.
I don't know yet whether she is to be a friend or an enemy.
If she proves to be an enemy,
I beg you let me deal with her.
Why? Do you hate the princess Nadji?
I hate her.
Yet I want her more than
I've ever wanted any woman before.
Very well, Abdullah.
If Nadji opposes me... and you serve me well... there shall be a new slave in your harem.
ROXOR: Come in.
Let me have your cloak.
Then I may not feast my eyes on your lovely figure?
- Why have you sent for me, Roxor?
- Why?
To offer you my friendship.
- Well, here we are.
- Yes, but how are we going to get in?
You're not going in.
You're going to stay here and watch.
But it'd be much more fun to go in with you.
Listen, Bobby, in case anything happens to me... your mother and Betty Lou will need a man to protect them.
Stay here.
You have the word, brother?
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
But my people are happy and contented.
The great dams have multiplied our crops a hundredfold.
What if I destroy those dams?
- What?
- Yes.
I can do it with one blast from my death ray.
Then where will your people be?
More than a billion tons of water will sweep down on them... drowning them like rats.
The greatest flood since the biblical deluge.
So, unless my people join in making you a modern pharaoh... you will annihilate them.
Pharaoh.
I shall be greater than any pharaoh.
Civilization and all its works shall be destroyed.
Men shall return to savagery... following only one supreme intelligence... me.
You see, you're my prisoner.
Every man in this house is my servant.
- You can't keep me here.
- I shan't try.
You are to be sent to a friend of mine as a present.
Did you call me, master?
Take this woman through the tunnel to the river. A boat is waiting.
Come!
Come, Nadji, quick.
- Chandu!
- (MOUTHS WORDS) Come.
What's the matter with you?
Stop them! Stop those two!
After them!
Stop them!
- Everything aboard, Ahmed?
- Yes, effendi.
Very well.
Mother, is she a real princess?
Yes, Betty.
Uncle Frank says she's descended... from a long line of ancient Egyptian kings.
- And are we really going to her palace?
- No, Bobby.
- We're going to her dahabieh.
- Her "daha" what?
Oh, Bobby, don't you know that's a houseboat?
And the princess says we'll have to travel all night by camelback.
Won't that be great?
Wasn't it strange that chance should have sent you... to look for Roxor just when
I needed you most?
It wasn't chance, Nadji. It was fate.
I mean, it was, uh... It was fate that brought me in front of that door.
At first I didn't recognize you.
You see, it's three years since last we met.
- Remember?
- Yes.
Those days in Paris...
I've thought a lot about them.
I know.
In the yogi monastery, there's a pool... where you can see the face of anyone who's thinking of you.
And did you see my face in it?
If you would have looked in it, you would have seen mine much oftener.
Mother, do you think the princess can help us in finding Father?
I don't know, darling, but Uncle Frank says we'll be much safer... as her guests than if we're left here alone.
Well, I shouldn't be frightened anywhere with Uncle Frank.
Oh, look. There are the camels.
El Mahafi, are you ready to leave?
Yes, Princess, and tomorrow's sun will see us there.
Cush. Cush.
You bloomin' idiot.
Don't you understand plain English?
Voulez-vous cush?
Oh, why don't you kneel down when I ask you to?
Aw, I wish I had it.
- Miggles!
- Captain Chandler.
(CHUCKLES) That's all right, Miggles.
Don't salute me, and don't call me Captain Chandler.
We're out of the army now.
What are you doing in that funny-looking getup?
Nursemaid to a blooming camel.
Oh, I'm so happy I met you, Captain.
You've gotta get me out of this.
You've gotta give me a job.
I'll work for you for nothing. After all,
I was a good orderly, wasn't I, sir?
Are you still drinking, Miggles?
Well, sir... (COUGHS)
Changin' the subject, do you still do your magic tricks?
Oh, much better ones. Look at me.
Now look behind you.
- Aaah!
- (CHUCKLING)
Take off your hat.
- Why, you dirty little snoop.
- Who, me?
Oh. Oh, he can talk.
- Oh, take him away.
- (CHUCKLES)
- Make him go away.
- That's all right. He's only in your mind.
Oh, don't tell me I'm going balmy.
He's gone!
How would you like to take a very dangerous trip with me?
Sure. You know me. I love danger.
All right, then. Come on.
Oh, thank you, Captain. Thank you.
Every time you get drunk you're going to see that little fella.
- Understand?
- I understand.
So help me goodness, governor, this is the finish.
When a man starts to see things like that...
- Well, it's time to quit.
- Okay.
- You all right, Princess Nadji?
- Yes.
Miggles. Behave.
I can't thank you enough, Nadji.
Now that Dorothy and the children are safe...
I'll be free to find Robert.
I think I can help you.
- You, Nadji?
- Yes.
Roxor has been seen by some of my people... near the ruins of Madu.
Where are they?
- On the third cataract.
- How far is it?
Not very far.
My boat can be there in 24 hours.
Go straight to Roxor and inform the master... that the princess and the foreigner are on their way to rescue Regent.
Tell him I will see that the white man gets no further than the houseboat.
And now, tell me.
Have you married since I saw you last?
No. That's one feat of magic that requires a beautiful assistant.
- But you've been in love?
- All the time.
(LAUGHS) I might have known.
There are too many charming women in the world.
Not too many.
Oh, now, don't misunderstand me, Nadji.
All the time in love, but always with the same woman.
Do I know her?
You should.
She was a present to your father and mother on your birthday.
(LAUGHS) You're never serious, are you?
Never so serious as now, Nadji.
Tell me. Have you found someone?
Even if I had, my life belongs to my people.
You know, you told me that three years ago.
You think I'm foolish, don't you?
No, dear. Just very, very young... and making an unnecessary sacrifice.
Sometimes I think so too.
Hello.
You have a visitor.
His name is Abdullah.
He's been coming here very often lately.
Oh. I see.
For the white man.
It is Roxor who commands.
NADJI: I'll order some refreshments.
Ali? Some wine.
- You must be choked with sand and dirt.
- You're right.
I love the looks of the desert, but I hate the taste of it.
I thought I'd pay you a surprise visit.
- I'm afraid I'm rather in the way.
- No, not at all.
But unfortunately, my boat is starting at once.
And is the gentleman I just saw making this romantic trip with you?
Romantic is hardly the word.
With a woman as lovely as you are, Nadji... it couldn't be business.
You have a strange way of paying compliments, Abdullah.
Who is this friend of yours?
He is called Chandu.
Chandu.
Beg pardon, Captain.
Is this where the danger starts?
Not yet.
- (RINGING)
- That's funny. A telephone way out here?
That's strange.
You haven't told me yet.
Why are you going up the Nile?
- You know Roxor?
- Ro... Roxor.
Oh, is he that crazy scientist who lives in one of the rock temples?
Yes.
No, I've never met him.
Is he the man you're going to visit?
I understand that Roxor has discovered... many valuable relics of the 12th Egyptian Dynasty.
Wait.
Drink.
Go on, drink.
CHANDU: This wine is... is poisoned
CHANDU: Robert Regent, I'm calling.
Robert Regent, I am calling.
Robert Regent, where are you?
Look. Look!
The crystal's clearing at last.
NADJI: The great rock temple at Madu.
CHANDU:
Roxor is trying to build a huge death ray.
It's Robert. He's still alive.
NADJI: Roxor is there.
CHANDU: Robert hasn't told him the secret.
NADJI:
Oh, he'll torture him until he does.
CHANDU: That's your servant...
The man who gave us the poisoned wine.
Roxor is punishing him because he failed.
NADJI: Chandu, this man is heartless.
Roxor will kill him.
Not as long as he has any hope of forcing Robert to give up his secret.
What was that message the Arab just brought?
I don't know.
Nadji, you say you know the way to this temple?
Yes.
- (MOANS)
- Quiet, Miggles, quiet.
Oh, Captain!
Quiet, Miggles. Quiet.
Miggles, stay here and keep watch.
Yes, Captain. I can manage.
(GASPING) Captain! Captain!
Captain! Captain!
(MOANING) Captain!
Captain! Captain! Captain! Aaah!
Captain! Captain! Captain!
- Captain!
- What's the matter? What's happened?
One of them bloomin' stone idols hopped off his perch and ran away.
- And he pinched my hat.
- You've been drinking again, have you?
So help me, it's true. I swear it on the heads of me unborn children.
Captain! Captain!
Look!
- Chandu!
- Fear not, Princess. You are to live.
But you will see your friends die.
(MOANING) Oh, Mother.
Before we die... accept my blessing.
MAN: Open! Open!
- A fiend!
- A fiend!
Halt!
My will shall be your will.
Now I command you. Take me to the effendi Professor Robert Regent.
- He is not here.
- Speak the truth.
- The master has taken him away.
- Where to?
To the secret market of Bab Doukkala.
There, unless he speaks, he will see his daughter sold as a slave.
- What does it mean?
- It means that Roxor can do nothing... by threatening Robert, so he's kidnapped Betty Lou. Come!
Miggles.
(MOANING) Oh, Captain.
Miggles.
Oh, governor, take away those snakes.
Come on, Miggles.
Pick up your gun. Pick up your gun!
(GASPS) Take it away! Take it away!
Take it away! Take it away!
Never another drop, so help me.
Are you ready to tell me the secret of the death ray?
No.
You still may change your mind.
Never.
- Father! Father!
- Betty Lou!
My child.
What are you going to do with her?
That depends on you.
Will you tell me the secret of the ray?
- No.
- Take her to the block.
- ROBERT: No! No!
- No, no, no! (SOBBING)
- Don't!
- Father!
- (SOBBING) Father!
- ROBERT: Don't take her!
- Don't!
- Please stop! Father! Please!
Let her go!
You shall stand at that window and see her sold.
Help me, Father! Don't!
Let me go! Father, help me!
Kill me.
Kill me if you will, but let her go.
Courage, Betty Lou.
It's not too late to save her.
No. Whatever happens to me or mine,
I'll never tell you.
ROXOR: Get out!
Master! Master!
- (CHIRPING)
- Master! Master!
Allah, save us!
I saw the gold with mine own eyes!
This is magic!
Allah be praised!
Stop that man! Run after him!
Run after him!
Guard!
Abdullah!
Guard!
- Why didn't you hold him at the gate?
- He never passed the gate.
When these hands tried to seize him, there was nothing there but a burnoose.
That one.
- GUARD: The devil!
- (ALL SHOUTING)
Now I know who is fighting us.
Chandu... A man who has at his command the wizardry of the East.
- What is his power?
- Ah.
Hypnotism, nothing more.
Is there no way through which we can attack him?
Yes, one.
Samson's strength was in his hair.
Chandu's strength... is in his eyes.
Mother, here they are.
- Oh, Betty!
- Bobby!
- Oh, my poor child.
- Mother, dear, please don't worry about me.
It was dreadful to see Father like that, his face drawn with agony.
- So desperate!
- Don't. I can't bear it.
CHANDU: Now, Dorothy, don't worry.
Please, Frank.
Can't something be done to save him?
I'm going right back after him, dear, as soon as I get fresh horses.
There, there.
- Miggles, be ready to leave in half an hour.
- Yes, sir.
We're going to the rock temple.
All right, sir.
The rock temple, I think he said.
This calls for another drink.
Walking idols and guns that turns into snakes?
This certainly calls for a drink.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who? Me?
What for?
- For seeing things again.
- Now, go on. Hop it.
Is that a nice way to behave?
I thought you was a gentleman.
And I thought you were a gentleman too.
We were both mistaken, weren't we?
Don't you talk back at me.
I'm not talking back at you.
You're talking to yourself.
Miggles, aren't you ashamed of ourselves?
Every time you drink that liquor, you're not yourself.
If you're not yourself, how am I to know who I am?
If you're not you and I'm not me, then who are we?
Neither of us. Miggles, behave.
All right. I give in.
I'll never touch another.
- Nadji, why this costume?
- I'm going with you.
- No.
- But I might help you.
No, darling.
That last trip was too dangerous.
I couldn't risk losing you again.
At least I can go as far as the oasis.
Please.
If anything happened to you, Nadji, dear... do you think I could ever forgive myself?
Do I really mean so much?
- More than so much.
- (COUGHING)
- The horses is here, sir.
- Nadji.
No, thank you. You'd better order a horse for me, Miggles.
- That's all right. You can have mine.
- Miggles!
What's the matter with you?
You seem nervous.
Well, it's...
It's all this excitement, sir.
Could you fix it up for me, so I could have a drink without seeing anything?
You haven't had one all day?
No, sir.
All right, Miggles. You may have one then.
- Here's to you.
- To you, Miggles.
As I said, sir, here's to you.
Oh, go and take a good swim!
Be careful. This is tear gas.
If you break it, it'll blind you.
CHANDU: Well, here we are.
- Dear, keep yourself hidden.
- Don't you worry about me.
You have more important things on your mind.
Never anything more important than you,
Nadji, dear.
Sometimes I wonder if you really know the meaning of danger.
I do, darling. I do when it concerns you.
You know, I'm not a bit afraid... when we are together, and you speak to me like that.
When you look at me like that, nothing else matters.
Be careful. If not for your own sake... then for mine?
A bargain.
And you, darling, be careful... for mine.
Take no chances.
Chandu!
Ride, Nadji! Ride away quick!
(GASPING) I'm helpless.
Roxor was right.
Your magic comes from your eyes.
- Chandu!
- Bring him to Roxor!
DEATH RAY WORKER: Only Regent can do it!
Well done, Abdullah.
Now I'll have my revenge on Chandu.
Yes, but that doesn't tell you how to operate your death ray.
No?
You followed Regent's plans in building this elaborate machine... but he still withholds the knowledge to release its power.
Regent was near to breaking when he saw his daughter on the slave block, wasn't he?
Yes.
If Roxor threatens his wife and children... what then, Abdullah?
In a few hours, his whole family will be here.
How?
In that cell, he's now writing a letter to them.
MAN: Effendi!
- Is the letter ready?
- Where's Roxor?
He's not here.
If you'll take it to my family, they will reward you.
It's only a letter of farewell.
- The letter will be delivered, effendi.
- Thank you.
Now look, Abdullah.
For the wife of Robert Regent.
ROXOR'S HENCHMAN:
For the wife of the effendi.
- Are you sure that's really from Father?
- Look, darling, it's his writing.
Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if we really could save him?
We must save him. I'll get ready.
But, Mother...
There's no need for you to go.
This is a man's job.
- But there's no man here.
- Well, how about me? And Miggles?
- How's that, sir?
- I was just reminding Mother you're a man.
Does she have to be reminded?
If I could only get this bandage off my eyes.
- Oh, if I could only help you.
- Oh, Nadji.
Nadji, what a fool I was to let you come with me.
Don't say that, Chandu.
If these are to be the last hours of your life, I want them to be mine too.
If I could only get you out of here, see you safe once again.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
I feel so much closer to you now than ever before.
Oh, Nadji, I can't think of losing you... now that I've found you again.
Tell me, if all this hadn't happened... would you have left Egypt, gone with me?
You had only to ask, and I'd have followed you anywhere.
If this is the end, Nadji... let me hear you say "I love you."
I love you.
And I love you.
Well, Chandu, we meet at last.
It isn't quite as you planned though, is it?
Remember this, Roxor.
That the best laid plans of men sometimes go astray.
What do you mean?
I mean that my will is stronger than yours... that it will conquer you.
- That's a lie!
- Is it?
Then why are you afraid to look me in the eyes?
I'm not afraid.
Your eyes would have no effect on me.
Then take off this bandage!
If I were alone, I would.
But these silly natives, they believe your tricks.
You're afraid, I tell you.
Take the bandage from his eyes.
Take it off.
Stop! Stop!
Don't let him fool you.
Get rid of him once and for all.
You're right. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
You can't do that!
- You can't bury him alive!
- (CHUCKLES)
Why not?
It was a favorite punishment among the priests of Isis who built this temple.
No!
You'd be far better off to kill him.
Why?
Yogis have been known to remain buried for days.
ROXOR: Yes.
But not underwater.
No!
- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- No!
No!
- Roxor. Roxor!
- Why are you calling him?
I'll tell him how to work the machine.
Robert, you mustn't!
You said it would mean death to millions.
I'm going to, I tell you, if he'll let you and the children go.
We won't go!
We won't save our lives at such a cost.
Hmm. Why, it's a family reunion.
Let them go, Roxor.
I beg of you, let them go.
There is a way out of this cell, and I'll show it to them.
But not while you are in there.
Just let me stay here.
I don't care what you do with me.
Now, look.
Mother!
ROXOR:
I told you there was a way out, Regent.
That is a river down there... where your friend Chandu has gone.
Have mercy, Roxor!
Stop!
Close it! Close it!
- Will you tell me now?
- Stop!
Mother!
Mother! (WHIMPERING)
- (SCREAMS)
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stop! Stop!
- You'll show me how to work the death ray?
Yes. Yes.
How far will the beam carry?
- Halfway around the world.
- Ah!
Hurry, hurry!
Is it ready?
- (WHISTLE)
- Yes.
Back to his cell.
At last.
I'm king of all.
That lever is my scepter.
London, New York, Imperial Rome...
I can blast them all into a heap of smoking ruins.
Cities of the world shall perish.
All that lives... shall know me as master and tremble at my word.
Paris.
City of fools.
Proud of their Napoleon.
What will they think...
- when they feel the power of Roxor?
- (BOOM)
And England... with its sacred traditions...
Its king. Its triumph... its... its navy...
- will be helpless.
- (BOOM)
They shall bow before me in worship.
Me... Roxor.
- (BOOM)
- I will destroy the dams of the Nile.
And its roaring floods shall sweep down upon... hundreds of thousands... drowning them like rats!
Roxor, the god... whose hand deals death!
Stop! I command you!
Take your hand from that control.
No, you don't frighten me.
You can't move that lever.
I'll move it now!
And you're standing right in the front of the ray.
Your hand is powerless to move, Roxor.
It's a lie.
And you shall be the first man for the ray to kill.
I have come out of a coffin from the depths of the Nile.
My will brought me here... and that will is stronger than yours.
You are helpless.
- No!
- Drop your hands.
Now, stand there.
- Don't move.
- ROBERT: Chandu!
Dorothy! Robert! Are you safe?
Are you all right?
ROBERT: There... It's over... there.
I've doubled the speed of the generator.
The voltage is mounting.
The ambient's at white heat.
The machine will explode in a moment.
- Get out of here, quick!
- Not that way, Frank!
I'm all right. Hurry!
For years I've wanted you, and now I've got you.
- You beast!
- There's no use fighting.
Nadji!
Nadji! Nadji!
Nadji!
Chandu! Look out!
Nadji! Na...
- Captain!
- (BUZZING)
Chandu! Chandu!
- Where are they?
- Let's go.
- Are you all right, Nadji, dear?
- Uncle Frank! Uncle Frank!
Children! Dorothy!
- Thank heaven you're safe, Frank.
- That was brave of you, Robert.
You set the machine to destroy even your whole family... rather than give it to Roxor.
Aaah!
Help!
LITTLE MIGGLES: Where can we get a drink?
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Come on.
Come in.
- Sir Lionel Barton, sir.
- Oh, yes, show him in. Show him in.
Come in, sir.
Well, Nayland, what's up?
Well, Lionel, before we go into that,
I want to ask you a very funny question.
- Do you love your country?
- Oh, yes.
All through the war and the Depression and the high taxes and the low rents.
I shall never love another.
Well, Lionel, the British government is asking you to risk your life again.
- Oh, very well.
- All right then.
After you leave here, you're going to the British Museum to meet some friends of yours.
You're going to ask them to join you in an expedition to go to the edge of the Gobi Desert and hunt for the lost and buried tomb of Genghis Khan.
How the deuce did you know all that?
It's my business to know things.
Lionel, you must find that tomb.
We can't allow for any failure, and you must be the first to find it.
Why all the hurry?
- You know Fu Manchu?
- Yes.
He's trying to find it, too.
Oh, I didn't know he was an archaeologist.
Oh, no, he's not.
He's insane for power.
- What do you expect to find in that tomb?
- Records, the golden plate with the threat of Genghis Khan to return, the golden mask he wore and the famous golden scimitar.
Exactly. Of course, in your hands, these things will be merely interesting archaeological specimens to go into the British Museum.
But should Fu Manchu put that mask across his wicked eyes and take that scimitar into his bony, cruel hands, all Asia rises.
He'll declare himself Genghis
Khan come to life again, and he'll lead hundreds of millions of men to sweep the world.
And that, my friend, is what you have got to prevent.
You must find that grave. You must be the first to find it, and you must bring those pretty things back to England.
Of course it's genuine.
Don't you know that the Equus polydactylous, Anchitherium,
Coryphodon, Equus sivalensis:::
But you forget, Equus asiaticus, Equus przewalskii,
Equus lebii, Equus chenensis, Hipparion and...
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Sir Lionel not here yet?
No, Von Berg. It's a funny time to call a meeting.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'd hoped to have a long talk, but something's come up that's altered my plans slightly.
Fairgyle, I want two of your men. My two old friends, Von Berg and McLeod.
- Another expedition?
- I was just getting bored with London.
- Can I have them?
- I think you have them already.
Where do we go now?
Well, perhaps I can best answer your question by first telling you that I think I've discovered the buried tomb of Genghis Khan.
- What?
- This can't be so!
Frankly, Barton, I don't believe it.
You always dreamt of this dead raider.
Carnarvon made his dream come true.
Think of what he found in Egypt.
I don't care what it is. I go with you. Where do we go?
I'll show you.
We move secretly.
So it's a toil over these mountains into this valley here.
Then up again and over this range of hills, and right here, on the edge of the Gobi Desert, that's where we camp.
Now, I want you to understand the truth.
From the moment we start, we're in great danger.
There's a fanatic in the East, Dr. Fu Manchu.
- And we have to beat him.
- A Chinaman beat me? He couldn't do it.
Thanks, old friend.
Then we meet again on Sunday to arrange all details.
Get away by Monday.
Thank you a thousand times.
I think I can promise you some great acquisitions for the museum.
That'll be fine, Barton, fine.
Well, good night. Thanks once again.
See you on Sunday night, Doctor.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Terry, I just don't think
I can stand this any longer.
Steady, Sheila.
A whole week not knowing whether he's alive or...
I say, do you know where
Commissioner Smith is?
- We've been waiting nearly 20 minutes.
- No, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Vernon.
Sheila, sorry I'm late. I was detained.
- Hello, Terry.
- Hello, Nayland.
I brought Terry along.
Have you heard anything?
If I knew anything, I'd tell you.
Excuse me.
Sit down. Sit down, Sheila. I'll be with you in just a moment.
Sheila, you've got to be very brave.
Oh, Nayland, I won't believe my father's dead.
No, no, no, neither will I.
I've just come from a conference with Von Berg and McLeod.
Fine chaps, those men. Depend on them.
Oh, come to the point. You're keeping something back from me.
Sheila, did you ever hear of a Dr. Fu Manchu?
Yes, I've heard Father speak of him to the men.
I remember I couldn't sleep at nights thinking of the terrible...
Nayland, don't tell me that man has anything to do with this.
That my father has been taken by...
You know what they say about him in the East, his cruelty, his unspeakable tortures.
- Nayland, he'll kill him, I know!
- Oh, no, no, Sheila.
- I know he won't do that.
- What does he want of him?
Well, he wants the secret about the tomb of Genghis Khan, and, naturally, he turned to your father.
Oh, I know.
You think they can make him talk.
They can't. I know him better than you.
- She's right, sir.
- I hope so.
They have ways in the East of shattering the strongest courage.
That's why McLeod and Von Berg have agreed to carry on with the expedition, to finish the job of getting to the tomb before Fu Manchu.
- I'm going with Dr. Von Berg.
- Sheila, that's no place for a woman.
Oh, I know. You think I'll crack under it, but I won't.
My father would hate me if I did.
I know much more about the tomb than they do.
I know where it's located.
I can save them days.
Don't you see? Every second counts.
- Sheila.
- It's no use.
- Sheila, I protest.
- I tell you it's no use. I'm going.
The Englishman is here.
Send him in. And tell my daughter I want to see her.
Send him in.
- I want to know the meaning of this.
- Sit there.
You'll answer my question.
Sit there.
Can you remember much of what has happened in the past week, Sir Lionel?
I was attacked in the British
Museum, drugged, of course.
I think I was under the influence of drugs for days.
Then I was in a plane. Now I'm here.
You're Fu Manchu, aren't you?
I'm a Doctor of Philosophy from Edinburgh.
I'm a Doctor of Law from Christ's College.
I'm a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard.
My friends out of courtesy call me Doctor.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Well, Three Times Doctor, what do you want of me?
I have sent for you to make your fortune.
What good are these relics of a dead warrior to you?
Oh, our English people like to look at them on holidays.
Are they worth a million pounds to you?
My dear fellow, I can't sell what I haven't got.
But you will tell me where they are, for money, I mean.
Not for anything in the world.
- Did you send for me, my father?
- My daughter.
Explain to this gentleman the rewards that might be his.
Point out to him the delights of our lovely country, the promise of our beautiful women.
Even my daughter. Even that for you.
Fu Manchu, I'm not for sale.
You've read about this, Barton, the torture of the bell. It never stops.
Minute after minute. Hour after hour. Day after day.
Seems harmless, doesn't it? Just a bell ringing.
But the percussion and the repercussion of sound against your eardrums will soften and destroy them until the sound is magnified a thousand times.
You can't move. You can't sleep.
You will be frantic with thirst.
You will be unspeakably foul.
But here you will lie day after day, until you tell.
You'll be hanged!
Oh, Himmel:
Much more of this, and I won't have no hands left.
Why, we haven't even started, Doctor.
Just wait till we get in the tomb and start to dig out the jolly old skeleton himself.
We've been lucky at that, Von Berg.
We haven't been bothered by any curious Chinamen.
Quite right, Mac, and I hope the same good luck continues when we find it.
If we do.
Aren't you hungry?
Just nod your head, and I'll feed you.
Do you want it? Well?
But I won't talk.
I won't talk.
Doctor! Doctor!
- Mac, I believe I've hit it! Look.
- Let me see.
Come on. Come on, everybody, dig.
Oh, look!
The seal of Genghis Khan!
- Sheila! Sheila!
- Shovel.
He'd be proud of you,
Sheila, mighty proud.
Oh, hurry.
Sheila, it looks like it runs over this way now.
Hurry. Hurry.
Hurry. Hurry.
Rest and quiet.
Now for a nice, long drink.
I forgot to tell you it was salt.
Fiend.
Barton.
Barton.
- Fresh water.
- No.
- Fresh food.
- No.
- And a bath.
- No.
- Sleep.
- No.
- Sleep, Barton, sleep.
- No.
- Day in, day out, sleep.
- No.
Now, tell me. Tell me.
No. No.
- Well, who goes in first?
- Terry. He found the slab.
All right. Age before beauty.
It's all right. Come on.
Think of it, Sheila, we're the first to enter the tomb of the great Genghis Khan.
It's overwhelming. I can hardly believe it.
It just staggers my imagination.
Aye, and you're standing in the first unplundered tomb of a king that died nearly 700 years ago.
Look. Solid gold. Enough to pay a king's ransom.
And sealed with the seal of Genghis
Khan. Terry, give me your knife.
Remember the curse on Tutankhamen's tomb?
All the people connected with it died soon after its opening.
That's a lot of bosh.
Silly superstitions.
They would have died...
What's it say, Doctor?
"May the curse of the
Gods descend upon him
"and his forever
"who dares enter herein. "
I don't like to mar the beauty of these doors, but I have my orders.
It's got to be done.
- Mac, give me the ax.
- I'm afraid of this.
- Afraid of what?
- That curse. Those hideous faces.
Now, Sheila, pull yourself together.
Your father would have done the same things if he was here.
Mac, save those pieces.
- The greatest fighter of them all.
- Yeah.
As powerful in death as he was in life.
Countless hordes still worship in his name.
- Well, come on, let's go to work.
- Righto.
You know, I have a feeling that the sooner we get these relics in the hands of Sir Nayland, the sooner we'll have news of your father, Sheila.
Look out, Terry.
Oh, that's all right, darling.
Just a friendly little tarantula.
I have brought you here for great tidings.
I am the most unfortunate of men.
I have no son to follow me.
Therefore, in shame, I ask you to receive a message from my ugly and insignificant daughter.
Speak, my daughter.
I have seen a vision.
The prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
Genghis Khan, masked in his plate of gold, bearing the scimitar that none but he could ever wield comes back to us.
I've seen a vision of countless hordes swarming to recapture the world.
I've seen the victorious.
I've heard the shouts of the dead and the dying drowned by the victorious cries of our people,
"Genghis Khan comes back.
"Genghis Khan leads the
East against the world! "
- Well, Mac.
- Well, it's my old friend Smith.
Nayland! This is a surprise.
- Sir Nayland!
- Hello, Terry.
- He's looking fine, isn't he?
- Yes.
Oh, Nayland. What of my father?
We'll talk about that later, Sheila.
Take her in the house, Terrence.
- Wait a minute, darling. I'll strike a light.
- No, no, don't. Don't do that.
Bring all that stuff in here as quietly as you can and stow it over there.
Oh, Nayland, please, please.
Tell me about my father.
Nothing. Nothing yet.
Pretty inadequate report, isn't it, Sheila?
- What are we going to do?
- I'm doing everything I can.
We can't find Fu Manchu, although we do know he's around here and very near.
So if I can get all of you and this stuff out of the country, then I can deal with him. He'll show his hands.
Well, look, Nayland, if you think he's around here, why do we have to leave the country until we find him?
Young man, your business is to obey orders.
And I'll have you all out of the country by tomorrow,
- every one of you.
- Oh, why?
Because I'm worried. I don't like the looks of it.
Why can't we have a little light, Nayland?
Because this house has got to appear empty as it has been for months.
It's our only safety.
- So understand. No lights.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Miss Sheila, off to bed with you.
Come along and I'll show you where your room is.
They all open off this courtyard, and yours is here.
So, this is what we've been fighting for.
- Aye. That's what we came for.
- Yeah, that's it.
And they believe in a bauble like that.
Will we ever understand these Eastern races?
Will we ever learn anything?
Well, we'll have to take turns watching this thing tonight.
McLeod, you take the first four hours.
No, I'll stay up all night. Then
I'll know everything's all right.
All right.
- But I'm going to lock you in.
- Aye.
- Good night, Mac.
- Good night.
Terrence, open the door.
- Good night, McLeod.
- Good night, Smith.
Terry!
McLeod.
Mac.
What's happened?
He was black.
Black.
But he didn't take it.
He didn't...
For as much as the Almighty
God with his great mercy hath taken unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Amen.
Amen.
I don't want to be abrupt, but we've got to get down to brass tacks.
Now, understand, no one leaves this compound today.
You travel tonight.
But we've been traveling for days without rest.
- We can't do it, Nayland.
- You must.
So, Sheila, you go to your room and sleep until I call you.
Have no fear. We're watching over you.
You get all the sleep you can.
Von Berg, you better get some rest also. Terry, you take the first watch.
Bolt that door, Terry.
See here, Nayland, we're done in. Exhausted.
We can't go tonight.
Why, think of Sheila.
She's the one I am thinking of.
Do you suppose for a moment
Fu Manchu doesn't know we have a beautiful white girl here with us?
He wants the sword and mask. Suppose he takes them?
- Suppose he takes Sheila also?
- I hadn't thought of that.
We're in the enemy's country now. And a wise enemy.
We're fighting a thing we can't understand with everything against us.
That's why you've got to get Sheila and those relics
- into a place of safety tonight.
- I understand.
- You really think he knows about Sheila?
- He knows everything.
He knows every move we make.
His spies are all around us.
I can't even trust our own coolies.
Someone's watching us. I can feel it.
Now, just pull yourself together, laddie.
Pull yourself together.
Got a revolver?
- Yes.
- Good.
I'll go out and look over the camels and pick out the ones
I think are fit to make the dash tonight.
Don't you go in that tower room. I'll be back in a moment.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
- Good afternoon, my friend.
- Well?
A message from my master, Dr. Fu Manchu.
I just want to know one thing. Is Sir Lionel alive?
But what makes you think not?
- Does that mean that he's dead?
- But of course not.
My master's quite excelled at surgery, and a little accident...
What's your message?
My master would very much like a certain sword and mask.
I don't think so.
Your fiancée is very fond of her father, I believe.
- I'm thinking about that.
- Terry!
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Is it nothing to know that your father is well?
- Oh, where is he?
- Fu Manchu's got him.
No! Is he all right?
Look out, Terry. This may be a trick.
There is unfortunately a certain amount of evidence to the contrary.
Oh, it's not your father's. It's a cheap trick to try to scare us.
- Perhaps you would like other evidence.
- No. That's enough.
Terry, wait.
I shall expect to see you with the sword and mask
- at the shop of Goy Lo Sung.
- Where is that?
In the street of the dragon, half a league to the north.
Otherwise, I'm afraid if your father does return, he may not be in the best of health.
- Where are those things?
- Oh, Sheila, we can't.
- Where are they?
- Wait a minute, dear.
Don't you see it's betraying the whole expedition?
- I'm going to that place.
- Oh, you couldn't. You can't.
Oh, Terry, don't you see?
If it were someone you loved. My father, who'd do anything for you.
- I know, dear. But listen to...
- Terry, if you won't go, I'll go myself.
You can't let them do this to him. You can't let him suffer.
We'll get the sword back somehow. Nayland will manage.
Nayland would do this himself. Anyone would.
You mustn't say a word to Nayland.
- But you are going?
- Yes.
- You're Fu Manchu?
- Please sit down so that we can enjoy your visit.
Now, tell me.
What can one so poor as
Dr. Fu Manchu do for you?
You know why I'm here.
This is the sword and mask of Genghis Khan.
Your messenger said that if I brought you these, you'd release Sir Lionel.
Release? Why, my dear young friend,
Sir Lionel is my guest, not my prisoner.
But if I could see the sword and mask.
Genghis Khan.
What are you going to do?
No.
- You trick Fu Manchu?
- That's the sword we found in the tomb.
Lies, you cursed son of a white dog! I'll flay you for this!
I tell you, I didn't know. Those relics were found in the tomb.
- The whips!
- Listen to me!
I tell you, I didn't know that sword was a fake.
I swear to you I didn't.
The whips!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Let him down.
Untie him.
Follow me.
He is not entirely unhandsome, is he, my father?
For a white man, no.
May I suggest, however, a slight delay in your customary procedure?
- You have further need of him?
- I have.
He shall still be the means of discovering for me where they have hidden the sword and mask.
And for that purpose
- you will...
- Precisely.
I can't stand this. I don't see why they're not here.
- Patience, my dear. We must wait.
- I won't wait. I can't.
I can't imagine where Terry's gone.
Sheila, you sure you don't know?
I've told you I don't know.
- I don't believe you.
- Nayland.
I'm sorry, Sheila, but why don't you tell me the truth?
I can't.
No! Let me go to him.
My father. Let me go!
No! No, let me go.
I gave her enough of this so she'll sleep till morning.
She should have told me.
- I might have saved her father.
- Why did Fu kill him?
Reprisal.
He found out that the other sword was a counterfeit.
- It was a fake?
- Yes.
I had it made from an old engraving
I found in the British Museum.
That's why I left at a later date.
I intended to use those relics to buy Sir Lionel from Fu Manchu.
- I would have brought him back alive.
- What will he do to Terry?
Nothing, just now.
He realizes that I have the genuine sword.
You changed them the night McLeod was killed.
Yes.
Sheila said that Terry had gone to the Bazaar of Goy Lo Sung.
As I remember, that's the sing-song shop in a place known as the House of Ten Thousand Joys.
- You are going there?
- Yes.
I'm sure that it leads to Fu Manchu.
And, Von Berg, if I don't return in 24 hours, you take that mask and sword and Sheila to Peking.
And don't come looking for me.
And don't pay any attention to anything you hear about me or from me till I get back.
And don't you let her out of your sight.
I understand. Good luck, my friend.
I'm going to need it if I meet Fu Manchu.
See something? Here.
Here.
Ming Dynasty.
Ming. Ming.
- Too small.
- Small?
More big? I get.
No.
What I really want is a little comfort. A little rest.
Pleasant dreams, perhaps?
No. No can do. Not for white man.
Understand. Honorable.
Follow me. Come.
Come.
Come.
Nice bed, sir.
Waiter.
You can load? Nicely dream.
The slightest move will send a bullet crashing through your stiff British spine.
Are you in the habit of shooting your enemies in the back?
Put your gun away.
You may turn around.
Now, that's better.
Now we can talk like gentlemen.
- Now, what do you want?
- You know what I want.
I want Terry Granville, and I want him alive.
- Really?
- Where is he?
At the moment, he's being entertained by my beautiful daughter.
Rot!
Would you like to see him? Talk to him?
- Yes.
- Permit me.
Is this a friend of your family's?
It's not wise to insult your host, Sir Nayland.
If it were not the easy way out, I would kill you now.
If you please.
No. Permit me.
My most modest daughter.
Sir Nayland Smith of the
British Secret Service.
- Terry, Terry.
- Nayland.
- What have you done to this boy?
- Practically nothing, as yet.
What are you going to do to him?
Merely inject a drop of serum into his blood.
- That will either kill him or drive him mad?
- Neither.
The injection of the serum will make his brain mine.
In other words, he becomes a reflection of my will.
He will do as I command exactly as though I were doing it.
- So much better than hypnotism.
- I see.
Another of your Oriental tricks.
In the name of the British government,
I demand the release of this boy.
British government?
I will wipe them and the whole accursed white race off the face of the earth when I get the sword and mask that will call the teaming millions of Asia to the uprising.
- And he will bring them to me.
- You'll never make him do that.
Wait and see.
Why, my dear Sir Nayland Smith,
I will show you the sword myself just before I dispatch you to your cold, saintly Christian paradise.
See that he is quite comfortable, for the present.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- I'm not afraid of your poisons.
- Not poison.
This serum, distilled from dragon's blood, my own blood, the organs of different reptiles, and mixed with the magic brew of the sacred seven herbs, will temporarily change you into the living instrument of my will.
You will do as I command.
I am only going to give you the very smallest amount which will pass off in a short time, because I want you to be your very self when I hand you over to my gentle daughter.
You will think as I think, see as I see, and do as I command.
Doctor!
Dr. Von Berg.
Dr. Von Berg.
- Who is it?
- It's I, Terrence. Open the door.
Come in.
Oh, Terry.
Terry, my darling, I thought you were never coming back.
What have they done to you? You look so tired.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm back. I'm here.
Terry, dear, you seem dazed, as if you'd been drugged.
Terry.
What?
Where's Sir Nayland? What about him?
He's all right. He's waiting for us in Nankow.
- Nankow?
- But you must get into bed, Terry.
- You need sleep, dear.
- No.
No, we must leave at once.
He's waiting for us.
- He wants us to bring the mask and sword.
- He? Who? You mean Nayland?
Yes. Yes, he's taking us to Peking. Tonight.
Oh, that's impossible. He would never leave in this storm.
He says we must leave.
He says the storm gives us our best chance.
But, Terry, why didn't
Nayland come with you?
- Yes, he told us to wait.
- He's preparing a secret escort to Peking.
That's why he sent me.
He says we're to bring only the mask and sword.
Well, he must know what he's doing.
Sheila, you go and get dressed.
- We leave at once.
- No.
Close that door. Keep Terry here.
I can't explain it,
- but there's something I'm afraid of.
- Afraid of what?
I don't know. This just isn't Terry.
Of course it's Terry.
Come on, get dressed,
Sheila. Come on, Terry.
Terry. Hold it, listen to me.
You're not yourself.
I know you're not.
Oh, please, don't go tonight, I beg of you. Wait until morning.
- He can't wait. Come on.
- No.
- No, Terry. I'm afraid of you.
- Come on.
I don't understand. Terry. I'm afraid. I don't understand you, Terry.
You're all changed. Please, I'm not going. I tell you, I won't go.
Come on, Terry.
He wants you, Terry. Go on.
He's waiting for you. Go on.
- There it is.
- Give it to me.
Oh, don't.
- Stop.
- Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor!
Terry.
Look, Sheila, that isn't Terry.
- It's an evil spirit.
- He's possessed. Possessed.
Fu Manchu, I want to tell you that the British government...
Silence!
It is my pleasure to show you how I entertain my guests.
You, Miss Barton, will be taken to the room of the golden peacock, where you will be prepared for a sacrifice to our Gods.
And you... You, my dear
Doctor, will follow my slaves to the room of the slim silver fingers, where I am sure you will be more than comfortable.
And at sunrise tomorrow, as my chieftains are assembled in the temple below, you two and your compatriot,
Sir Nayland Smith, will have the pleasure of entering your Christian heaven together.
It will be your honor to be the first white martyrs to perish at the hands of the new Genghis Khan.
I congratulate you.
Listen, you...
Terrence, do something. Help,
Sheila. Help! Do something.
You hideous yellow monster.
You've got your cursed sword and mask. What more can you want of us?
- Do you want to destroy us all?
- Yes.
This is only the beginning. I will wipe out your whole accursed white race.
Oh, no. Terry!
Terry. Look at me. Listen to me.
It's Sheila. It's
Sheila talking to you.
I love you, Terry. You've been sick.
You've been through a bad dream. A bad dream, Terry.
But you're going to waken.
You're going to waken now.
My darling, they can't hurt you.
You belong to me. You're mine. I love you, Terry.
Put your arms around me. Put your arms around me, Terry.
Darling.
Sheila, Sheila.
Sheila.
You silly little fool. Lying to yourself. Believing that you had his love, when he was only drugged by this beast!
- You failed. Both of you.
- Take them away.
You... Listen, Sheila, I know what they did to me.
I love you. Always remember that. I love you.
At the third stroke of the gong, have the slaves take her to the temple.
- Great honor is yours, Miss Barton.
- I am ready.
Oh, my child, you must not be impatient.
Great as I am about to become,
I still cannot hasten the course of the sun.
- Will it be soon?
- Very soon.
From here I shall go to the altar, where, if the Gods are good, the divine image of Genghis Khan will hand me his sword as a sign that I am his true successor.
And am I to be allowed to see my friends again?
I am afraid you would not entirely enjoy what you saw.
- Is Terrence...
- It seems that my daughter has conceived a romantic interest in this young man.
She's having him taken to the laboratory to await further injections of that interesting serum, which, as you may have noticed, will make him her more-than-willing slave, until, of course, she tires of him.
Men of Asia, our skies are red with the thunderbolts of Genghis Khan.
They rain down on the white race and burn them.
The sacrifice to our Gods!
Would you all have maidens like this for your wives?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Then conquer and breed.
Kill the white man and take his women.
Give us the sign!
Our war eagles scream.
The splendor of the world is yours.
Here it is, and that's the machine.
See what's beneath it.
Von Berg, this should send out a million volts.
It will. I saw it.
Terry, you hurry. Get to Sheila.
We'll cover you with this.
In the blood of Shiva's bride,
I baptize this sword.
Are you sure it's necessary, Nayland?
Father would so much have wanted to have it in the museum.
I'm very sorry, my dear.
As much as I respect your father's memory, we can't afford to take any chances.
There may be other Fu
Manchus in the future.
By golly, after all that's happened,
I wouldn't be surprised to see the hand of that fellow Fu Manchu get out of the ocean and grab it.
I don't think there's much danger of that.
Well, Genghis Khan, wherever you are, here's your...
Did you hear it?
Dinner is served. Dinner is served.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
You aren't, by any chance, a doctor of philosophy?
Law?
- Medicine?
- I don't think so, sir.
But are you sure?
Oh, yes, very sure.
- I congratulate you.
- Thank you.
Dinner is served. Dinner is served.
Well, as I was saying, wherever you are, Genghis Khan,
I give you back your sword.
"Now, in Injia's sunny clime,
Where I used to spend my time
"A-servin' of 'Er Majesty, the Queen
"Of all them black-faced crew
"The finest man I knew
"Was our regimental bhisti "
Detail, halt!
What was that all about?
They are pilgrims, sahib, going home to the hills.
They beg to follow us for safety.
Tell them not to fall too far behind.
Detail, walk. March!
Jadoo, the sun is going down.
Expect we'd better bivouac at Elephant Rock, as usual.
Yes, Markham sahib.
I don't like it, Mitchell.
I don't like it. Silence is unhealthy.
No word from Markham in 48 hours.
Blast it, an officer and his patrol don't vanish into thin air.
- Telegraph just got through, sir.
- Good.
What have you got?
Wires apparently down for the last two days.
I thought it was something like that.
Emergency signal, sir.
Why doesn't he go on?
Wire's gone dead, sir.
I don't like this.
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.
Higginbotham.
Find Sgts. MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, and bring them here.
That's a bit difficult, as they're all on leave.
On some mysterious mission, they said.
It'll be a mystery if they come back right side up.
Bring them here at once.
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?
He's busy.
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.
- I didn't know the map was a swindle.
- You and your emeralds.
You ought to be put in a padded cell.
If we'd found them emeralds, we could've left the army... and lived like dukes. See?
That's the fellow that sold me the map.
Just a minute.
Let me take care of him, will you?
Take your hands off that man.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
Speak up, MacChesney.
Speak up!
We were swindled, sir.
- We?
- Who swindled you?
We don't want to make any charges until we have further proof.
Further proof?
You practically wrecked a village.
You surely didn't do that,
MacChesney, without proof?
Sir, we had our suspicions.
Suspicions of what?
Come on. I've no time to wheedle the story out of you.
We bought a map.
Go on.
From a private in a certain Scottish regiment, sir.
No, I did it. I bought the map myself, sir.
Now, listen. Don't you try to shield your friends, Cutter.
And it won't do you two any good to hide behind Cutter's generosity.
Out with it. A map of what?
Of Lake Singali, sir.
Yes, sir. And the privilege of diving into it to our heart's content.
Diving for what?
- For emeralds, sir.
- A barge full, sir.
According to the information I bought, it was sunk in the year 241.
I can hardly believe it.
Ballantine, a man of your intelligence...
MacChesney, at your age...
They was the spoils of a maharajah, sir.
Thank you, Cutter. That will be sufficient.
As for you two...
I ought to take away your stripes, not only for insubordination... but for idiocy.
Sheer, childish, soft-brained idiocy.
But fortunately for you,
I need all three of you at Tantrapur.
We're going out on a job, sir?
Of the most vital importance.
You leave for Tantrapur... with a detachment in the morning... to repair the telegraph and keep it open.
Left turn! Left wheel, quick march!
Left wheel! Attention!
Eyes forward!
Party, halt!
Sergeants, dismount!
Cold.
Stale.
I don't mind saying the whole thing fair gives me the creeps.
Creeps or no creeps, we've got to get in touch with the Colonel.
We can't until we get them poles up and this wire strung.
Naik, detail 10 men for guard duty.
The remainder will pile arms and prepare for work.
Halt!
Gunga Din, water.
Gunga Din, bring water!
Bring water!
Whoever's been playing tricks with this village is blinking clever.
I couldn't find a trail or a single footprint leading in or out.
So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?
- Salaam, sahib.
- Who are you? What are you doing?
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.
Last night a band of dacoits raided this village, looted my shop... and stole off with my poor wife and six children.
The children are looking bonny.
Come on, everybody, in the other room.
Go on, get up. On the double.
Get in there. You heard me!
Quick! That's right. Go on.
That's better.
- What's that?
- Trinkets, sahib.
Only what I could save from my pitiful stock.
- Worth hardly a few annas.
- Go on, open them up.
Who are these playful subjects here?
I don't know, but young Toad Face there seems to be leader.
Get them all out of here.
Come on, get out of here. On your feet.
Hold them there.
Naik, detail eight men for escort duty.
Bring them here on the double.
Listen, you.
What became of Burgess sahib?
- Come on, spit it out.
- He can speak, but he won't.
- He doesn't know.
- Here.
You never saw one of these things before, did you?
It's for growing daisies, isn't it?
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
- No, sahib.
What became of these people here?
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.
We'll take them back with us and let the Colonel put them through the mangle.
No. Will not go with the white sahib.
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.
By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling.
Never mind the second chorus. Come on.
Party, form a square!
Under cover, everybody! Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.
Close the gates.
Climb the wall, everybody!
Come on, men, on the roof!
Look out, Mac!
Take cover behind the wall.
Volley firing. Ready?
Ready? Get set. Fire!
Here you are, Cutter.
Get in there. Come on.
Ballantine, come up!
Let's go.
Here's a present for you.
Bal, catch!
Come on, let's go!
Charge!
Everybody under cover!
Get behind the wall. Come on. Hurry up.
- Panee, Sergeant sahib?
- No!
How did you get here?
You're a funny bloke, Din... but I'll admit you're a good bhisti.
- Could be first-class soldier, sahib.
- Don't make me laugh.
Get to the river!
- Come on, you savage, over you go.
- Over you go.
All right, give me that.
What's the matter, Bal?
You've been woolgathering ever since we crawled out of the river.
- You know, my time is up on May 14.
- What of that?
You can sign on for another nine years, can't you?
Make a man out of him.
I'm leaving the service.
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.
I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business.
- Married!
- Tea business!
Why, you're mad if...
March to attention, everybody!
Let's march in in good style, men.
- Fall in up there.
- Left, right, left.
Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately.
Yes, sir.
Party, right wheel!
Halt! Left face!
Sergeants to the front!
The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir.
Eight killed, three wounded.
Otherwise all correct.
Very well, Sergeant. Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately.
Very good, sir.
Party, dismissed!
- Identical, Mitchell.
- Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe.
It's incredible, but that's what happened to Markham.
I'm afraid they've done away with poor Burgess, too.
There's been none of this for 50 years.
Thuggee. That's what it is, Mitchell.
What's Thuggee, sir?
A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed
50 years ago.
The Thugs were the most fiendish band of killers that ever existed.
There were at least 10,000 in India, and they murdered 30,000 people a year.
Thuggee was practiced from the Himalayas to Ceylon.
The order was religious and worshipped
Kali, the goddess of blood.
The Thugs were stranglers, weren't they, sir?
Stranglers. They dug the graves of their victims in advance.
Mitchell, we must stamp this out immediately.
The Lancers will scour the country west of Tantrapur...
- you will search the regions to the east.
- Right.
- What do we do, sir?
- You're dismissed, Ballantine.
MacChesney, you and Cutter will leave tomorrow with a stronger...
Ballantine, you're dismissed.
You and Cutter will take a stronger detachment tomorrow... into Tantrapur, to finish your work.
Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch with you at all times on either flank.
Keep your eyes open for Thugs.
Ballantine would be a great help, sir.
If I may remind you... the three of us have always brought off things very well together.
Yes, sir. He's indispensable.
Ballantine's leaving the service in six days.
He's getting married.
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns? Something like that?
When the parson says, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"... couldn't you give him a roar, sir?
You know what I mean?
Higginbotham will replace him.
Dismissed.
- Tommy, I've got you back again.
- And I've got you.
I'm here to stay, forever and ever.
Forever and ever.
That's horrible.
- She's charmed him like a snake.
- The siren.
Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.
Me, neither.
I can't stand it.
Me, too.
Left! Right! Center!
As you were!
Company, attention!
Right turn!
Two paces forward. March!
Head up, chin in.
Get those thumbs behind the seams of your trousers...
Get them back.
Lower that left shoulder an eighth of an inch. That's much better.
Otherwise you're looking very regimental, Din.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- Was salute satisfactory?
- That's the idea... only you want these fingers to fan the eyebrows, more like this.
The breeze from them fingers ought to almost blow this eyebrow off.
Now try it again.
Very good, indeed.
That one almost blew your turban off, didn't it?
Very regimental, Din.
Keep them at it, Subedar sahib.
They may need it.
Tell the Subedar to drill the men till sundown.
- Where did you get the bugle, Din?
- Please, sahib, I find when nobody looking.
Don't you know that's very naughty?
Please, sahib, don't take away.
Bugle only pleasure for poor bhisti.
Thank you, sahib.
- Sahib care to hear new call?
- Not now.
Very regimental, Din.
Company, attention! Company, dismissed!
Let me see your tongue, Annie.
I'd like to try it, Sergeant sahib.
Very old Indian remedy.
All right, go ahead. But be careful.
If anything happens to her, I'II...
Understand? Cry my eyes out.
No, sahib!
Very little bit goes very long way.
Gulp it down quick.
Then you won't taste it.
I know. You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you?
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.
There. Be a nice girl, now.
Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy.
If Daddy took a spoonful first himself,
Baby might do a patty-cake for him.
This is delicious.
This is...
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.
You ain't so stupid as you look.
That's better.
Annie, don't ever worry me like that again.
There you are, you two.
I've got letters for both of you.
There. Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.
Look what it says here.
"Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure...
"of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a"...
What's that?
"...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine.
"8:00 p.m. Friday." That's tonight.
I worried so about you, dear, while you were away.
Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur.
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
- No, I haven't, have I?
I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires.
Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that.
I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped.
Tommy, you're so marvelous.
That's all there is to it, I suppose.
On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney.
His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck.
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.
If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub.
Save some for the elephant.
Destroy the evidence.
- Stand guard, will you?
- Yeah.
Never mind that, Sergeant. Stand easy.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Evening, Stebbins.
- Good evening, Major.
- How are you?
No formality.
We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck.
That's very nice of you, sir.
I'll bring Emmy to you.
- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir. Very jolly, sir.
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?
Is that punch?
Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill.
Nonsense. Stebbins is famous for his punch. Have a spot?
Rather.
Excuse me, sir.
I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir.
Too watery, sir. Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach.
- We'll be the judge of that.
- Wait, sir. There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
There it is, sir. It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him? Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame? There he goes.
Come along, Mitchell.
I think we'll forget the punch.
Tommy, you know we have
Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition.
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service.
One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment.
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much. It's just as well.
- The army's no place for sentiment, I says.
- That's right.
Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.
Hello, Higginbotham.
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?
I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you.
I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better.
- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?
- Thanks, Cutter.
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.
I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement.
Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie?
We can look after that, old boy.
Take a plunge into this punch.
Punch? That stuff's for drummer boys and old ladies.
- Not that stuff.
- That would knock a horse down.
Swill that down, me boy... and you'll think all the Thugs in India is a bunch of missionaries.
That's right, Bert.
That's a funny thing.
The punch tastes all right.
It's all right.
Bert, how about having another drink?
To the new comradeship, Mac and you and me and the regiment forever.
- That's it, Bertie, my boy.
- I'll drink to that.
All right.
Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham... the finest soldier since
William the blooming Conqueror.
Down the hatch, boys!
Which of these two do you prefer?
I don't know. Try them both.
One for each window.
Don't be silly, darling.
It's as much your problem as it is mine.
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.
My den?
What's this, Sergeant?
Buying a trousseau?
We're buying curtains.
I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business.
Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy?
I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us.
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...
Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss.
I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain.
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?
Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!
- Tommy.
- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss.
Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back.
Don't cry, darling.
Goodbye.
This is May 9.
I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together.
Now come on.
- Pardon me, madam.
- Fall in!
Your petticoat's showing.
Ek Number! All's well!
Do Number!
All's well!
Teen Number! All's well!
Chaar Number! All's well!
Paanch Number! All's well!
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?
Shake a leg with that pole.
Come on, get it up there at the double.
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.
Blast them Thugs.
Why don't they come and give us a good fight?
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.
Come on, hurry up, I told you.
How can we get a nice little war going?
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs?
What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again?
Annie, get your back into it! Hurry up!
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
You can't work 24 hours a day, you know.
In another 24 hours, my time will be up.
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
Get it up, hurry up.
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.
A brilliant bloke like him, too.
Cutter, we got to do something.
Come here.
- What now?
- Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something.
Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension.
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.
Go on.
Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off.
Have you started after this buried treasure again?
Just a minute, Mac. This one ain't buried.
According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open.
According to Gunga Din, eh?
I thought he might have been at the bottom of this.
What's the idea of this lushing?
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!
Just a minute.
MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say.
You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you?
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right. Just a minute.
It's as easy as parting your hair.
We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind.
MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument.
Cutter, I'm warning you.
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?
I'm sick of it! Now shut your trap.
- You mean you won't go?
- No!
And if you mention gold temples again to me...
I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel.
Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice.
I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down.
All right, I'm going alone.
Wait a minute!
Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission.
Give me that bottle.
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.
But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition.
I'm an expedition. Out of my way.
Cutter, sit down before I throw you down.
Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you.
Goodbye forever.
Stand back.
I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move.
Out of my way before I split your jaw.
- Cutter, I'm warning you.
- Come on, put 'em up.
Come on, out of my way.
I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do.
Come on, put 'em up.
I'm afraid I have to do it.
Sgt. Ballantine.
- What?
- Come here.
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up. I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too.
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din. What's up?
Tonight, when everyone sleep,
Din go back again.
- See gold.
- You did?
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?
Bhisti cannot carry whole temple.
- Whole temple?
- Din see it. All gold.
Here, now.
We've got to get out of here now.
Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with.
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.
Is this satisfactory, sahib?
Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
Go on, get something big. Jaldi!
Up, Annie. Please, Annie.
What are you doing, Din?
A large tool you asked for, sahib.
Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me.
Work for me. Get me out of here, Annie.
Come on, Annie. Be a good girl.
Whoa, Annie! Just the bars!
Alert the guards!
- Wake up!
- What?
The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?
Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie? They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?
- Couldn't see.
- Where did they go?
- The hills.
- Sound assembly.
Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me.
MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks...
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!
- Very good, sir.
- Steal Annie, will they?
I'll break every Thug's back in India!
Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?
Yes, sahib. Here is the bridge, sahib.
- Is this bridge safe?
- It's safe, sahib.
Safe? What do you mean, safe?
Make her stop that.
She's making me nervous.
Get out of my way.
It's no time to do a thing like that!
Annie! Take your foot off.
Annie! Take your trunk off.
Annie, please go back!
That's gold, bugler.
Look at it, bugler.
That's yours and mine.
Archibald Cutter, the blooming duke, look at me, and Rajah Gunga Din... pouring diamonds out of that there blinking water bag.
Bugle will be very satisfactory.
Come on, Din. The world is ours.
Kali. Sahib, come quick.
Thugs, lift up your faces... to the light that shines from Kali's throne.
Brothers in Thuggee... we are the friendless of this earth.
Every man's hand is against us.
We have been kicked, spat upon... and driven to the hills like wild things.
My father was a Thug, and he was hanged.
His father was blown from a cannon's mouth.
And what of your kinsmen, your fathers and their fathers... and their fathers' fathers before them?
My brothers, a new day is at hand.
I have read the omens, and they are good.
Three nights ago, a jackal screamed upon the left.
Another answered from the right at once.
What does that mean, my brothers?
It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs...
Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years.
Let the neophytes and their teachers draw near.
Where are the stranglers?
Give them their strangling cloths.
Give them their burial picks.
Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us.
Rise, our new-made brothers.
Rise and kill.
Kill, lest you be killed yourselves.
Kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali. Kill!
It's them all right, Din, the whole blinking lot of them.
Very bad men.
The Colonel's got to know.
You must get there, Din.
The Colonel's got to know.
The Colonel? I run quick.
Since mighty roast beef
is an Englishman's food
It accounts for the freedom
that runs in his blood
For generous living
Does it do all good
Excuse me, mates.
Oh, the roast beef of England
And, oh, the old English roast beef
Sing us a song, will you?
You're all under arrest.
The whole bunch of you.
And you, too. You know why?
Her Majesty's very touchy about having her subjects strangled.
I can't waste any more time.
Come on, wrap up your gear.
You're coming with me. Hurry up.
Guruji.
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.
Vile dog.
For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son.
You shall grovel, I say!
Look here.
I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen.
Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride.
Take him away!
In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants.
Beats counting sheep a million miles.
What do you mean, elephants?
This ain't elephants.
This is Annie, my Annie.
I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army.
What the blazes is this?
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
Higginbotham,
I could just fall on your neck.
I got a better neck than mine you can fall on.
That's a good one. Hello, there!
Tommy, hello!
How wonderful of you to meet us.
I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me.
- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney.
- Good morning, Miss.
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.
Cutter will be very pleased about this.
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!
Sit up straight there!
Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?
Walk march!
Forward!
Party, halt!
Sgt. Ballantine, take charge.
Go inside, dear. I'll be right with you.
All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon.
- Naik, what about this?
- He just came back, Sergeant sahib.
Come here, you.
Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this.
Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter?
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.
- Line up a firing squad.
- Please, sahib.
You stole the elephant, didn't you?
Answer me!
You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...
Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?
- Yes, sahib.
- That's all! Take him away!
You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time!
Wait a minute, Mac. Where's Cutter?
Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?
- They catch him.
- What's that? Who?
In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter.
Who's they? Priests or what?
Very bad men. They'll give him torture.
Go help, quick.
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
And you'll run back just as quick, too.
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing! I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right. We'll go together.
- No.
Tommy, what's the matter?
Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out.
Don't worry, I'm not taking him.
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
It says here,
"Thomas Anthony Ballantine...
"is restored to the rank of citizen of Great Britain...
"and his duty to Her Majesty's service is over and done with."
Try and keep me out of this.
I'm saying goodbye, Bal, and I wish you luck in the tea business... and your matrimony both.
Wait a minute, Mac.
Wait right here. I have to talk to him.
- But he said you can't go.
- He'll change his mind.
- I won't let you go!
- Darling, I have to go. I owe it to Cutter.
- He's saved my life time and again.
- You don't love me.
Do you want me to go through life remembering that I ran out... on one of my two best friends?
After what they did to Higginbotham, and dragging you up here again?
That's just the way of showing their friendship.
I hate the army, I'm through with it, but friendship, that's something else.
But we're wasting valuable time.
You have to understand. I'll be right back.
- I want to talk to you.
- You? I don't want to argue...
I'm going if I have to shoot you and go alone.
You know as well as I do why you can't go.
If anything happens to you,
I'd be in a fine mess.
Your girl would prefer charges.
- She wouldn't.
- I don't trust her.
There's only one way I'll risk it.
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.
When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers.
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?
You're getting clever again.
Do you want me to get kicked out of the army?
All right, I'll sign, but on one condition.
That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through.
You don't trust me.
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing with that in your pocket?
I always carry one. In case.
No, you don't.
Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand? Shake on it?
Hurry up.
Excuse me, miss.
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition.
- Yes, sir.
- If we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail.
- Come this way.
- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins.
- I'm going, Emmy. He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.
Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding? Be reasonable.
You didn't sign anything?
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.
We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy.
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.
- Fun? You want to go.
- Darling...
- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!
- Right, sir.
He called you sergeant.
Why? You're not in the army.
It's just an old habit, hard to break.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married?
You'd rather be with him.
Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army?
- I didn't say quite that. Be fair.
- Please, sahib, hurry.
- Come on, Sergeant!
- Can't you wait a minute?
Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter.
- Can't you trust me? Kiss me goodbye.
- No, never.
They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now.
- I'm coming, Mac!
- Darling, please don't go.
You don't want a man for a husband.
You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger.
That's not me, and never will be.
I don't care how much I love you, and I do, very much...
I'm a soldier... I mean, I'm a man first.
All right, MacCheesecake, get that silly smirk off your face.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Surely Mother Kali is kind.
One Englishman fly walks in, and now our web is baited.
More will follow.
Two more have crossed the bridge.
It is well. Prepare.
You said this place was full of priests.
- Sahib do not give Din chance to say.
- You've got a mouth, haven't you?
Quiet. It's Kali.
A Thug temple.
Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs?
I've a good mind to split you in two and stuff you up an elephant's trunk.
MacChesney roar so loud... poor bhisti cannot get a word sideways between roarings.
Enough of that. We're here to find Cutter.
We should have brought every man in the regiment.
I only wish you had, sahib.
Hello, Din.
Fine work, bugler. I knew you'd do it.
Thank you, sahib.
- Hello, boy.
- Hello, mate.
You're alive, anyway. What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.
So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter.
Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop.
Where's the troop?
There's no troop, and the Guru has us.
We right walked into it.
You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop?
What a brain!
I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!
I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.
Shame? They're doing this to me to find out where the column is.
They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop.
- You didn't tell them, did you?
- Not me.
So I suppose you think you're a hero?
- That's right.
- A hero. Don't make me laugh.
Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.
Who's a coward?
- Untie him, will you?
- Yes. Untie me.
I said untie him!
Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!
You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you.
- I'll untie him myself.
- Yes, that's right.
Only one hand, that's all I need at you.
Just one hand.
- Hurry up about it.
- I'll take all day, if you order me around.
I owe you one, anyway.
Mate, look at your back.
- Never mind that. Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.
I'm sorry, mate. The fiends!
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.
- Dog.
- Maniac.
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.
Grab him regardless how many are with him. It's our only chance.
He's sacred, so they won't shoot us.
Why, you hairless dog.
Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy...
A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant.
You're talking very proudly yourself.
Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek.
- I want to know about your army.
- Why don't you enlist, mate?
Lash.
For a beginning, this is not bad.
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave.
- Who is slave? I am a soldier, too, please.
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
Proud ox, where is your army?
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him. Now. He's next.
- I'm waiting. Will you speak?
- I don't know.
Hold on, Mac, old boy!
Stop.
Look. See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in. He'll talk from there.
- No, I can't stand it!
- Will you speak?
All right.
If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you.
Take me outside.
- Be a man, Mac.
- I can't go it, mates!
Come back, Mac, old boy!
- Well, Sergeant?
- All right, guvnor.
I don't know the exact position of the troops... but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper with all the troop movements in it.
- You're sure of that, Sergeant?
- As sure as taxes, guvnor.
- I wouldn't fool you.
- I hope not.
If you have, there'll be worse than lashes.
Please don't lash me any more.
I'll relieve you of these.
Cut him down.
"Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."
That's you, MacChesney, always hiding behind regulations... you Brummagem turncoat!
Be gallant in defeat, Sergeant.
You're simply a victim of superior strategy.
Quiet, you Whitechapel scum, or I'll cut your slaggedy hands off at the wrist!
- I'll pay you back with horrible interest!
- I command you to shut up!
Tell your men to lay down their arms and get out of here, or you're a dead kipper.
Lay down your arms and leave.
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Not to freedom.
- We'll see about that. Ready?
- Right.
- Sgt. Cutter, guard that door.
- Right. Mac, take your coat.
Right. Get up.
It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs.
I'll start with him first.
No, you won't.
Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now?
All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too.
As long as I'm alive, you live.
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.
He says to keep order, be confident, and wait.
Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language.
That's enough. Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke.
Go on. Get on back.
Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib?
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home.
- Thank you.
- Fall in.
Come on.
- Get down. Look out.
- Watch your head.
- The gold!
- Yes, sahib, gold!
Look at it, mates! Gold! That's what it is!
- Real solid sunshine!
- Sit down, you fool!
See that hand sticking out?
I bet that little hand's worth £3,000 if it's worth a farthing!
Who's a blinking idiot now?
We're rich, mates. Come on!
All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer.
You order your men to get in behind them rocks... and you see us down as far as the bridge.
We'll let you loose, and there's no harm done.
How's that?
Speak, you ape, or I'll kill you.
You would throw away your shield, brave soldier?
- Do you hear something, Bal?
- The bagpipes, Mac?
I've been hearing them for hours, but it isn't them.
It's the blistering heat screaming in our ears... that makes it sound like it.
They'll pull us out, old boy... if they can find the blasted place.
Don't waste any of your guff on me, Mac.
Here we are, and this is it.
It might have been worse, though.
I might have left a widow.
Eight feet away from where I'm sitting, right here... there's enough gold to make me sole owner and proprietor... of a pub as big as the Crystal Palace.
Best pub in Hampshire. And here I am.
You torturer!
Setting that in front of my eyes.
Is there no limit to the torture an Oriental mind can think up?
So help me, if you mention gold again,
I'll tear the tongue out of your head.
Here it is. Get it.
Brave soldiers, can it be that your nerves are tightening?
We can stand it up here as long as you can, Mr. Wise Man.
Preserve your courage, gentlemen.
You are not forgotten.
They will come to save you.
That's right, mate.
You're going to see more soldiers than you ever saw before.
Gentlemen, good news.
Here's a sight that should make your hearts pound faster. Look.
The Lancers.
Look at the Black Watch out in front.
Those beautiful Scotties.
I'll buy them all a beer apiece.
Your comrades' coming chokes you with emotions.
Seeing them this way recalls to you all manner of pleasant things.
The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships... even England... even home.
You bet it does, mister.
Save your voices, gentlemen.
They're coming here to your rescue.
You tormenting fiend.
- You're so sure, aren't you?
- Quite sure. It is my plan.
Two come to rescue one... then the others follow.
If you planned it right, mate... you'll be hanging by your filthy neck by nightfall.
You think so, Sergeant?
I'm not so sure.
You seem to think warfare an English invention.
Have you never heard of
Chandragupta Maurya?
No.
He slaughtered all the armies left in India by Alexander the Great.
India was a mighty nation then... while Englishmen still dwelt in caves and painted themselves blue.
Look.
Don't be afraid, gentlemen.
I am still your shield.
It is very simple.
Your army will enter by that gap.
Then they'll proceed halfway down this gorge.
Those are my infantry.
The best mountain fighters in the world.
At a given signal, they will open fire on your troops... driving them forward into the trap.
That is my artillery.
Rather neatly concealed, don't you think?
My gunners greet them with a full salute.
And finally, in come my horsemen.
This is, gentlemen, my household cavalry... similar to that which guards the person of your Queen Empress.
Each man is mounted on a valiant charger... and eager to slay for his guru.
The honor of the thunder in and slaughter of your army falls to them.
I see it in your faces.
Who is this ugly little savage... to snarl so boldly at the British lion?
Prime generals, friends, are not made of jeweled swords and moustache wax.
They're made of what is there, and what is here.
- You're mad.
- Mad?
Hannibal was mad. Caesar was mad.
And Napoleon surely was the maddest of the lot.
Ever since time began... they've called mad all the great soldiers in this world. Mad?
We shall see what wisdom lies within my madness... for this is but the spring freshet that precedes the flood.
From here we roll on, from village to town... from town to mighty city, ever mounting, ever widening... until at last my wave engulfs all India.
My soldiers! March!
- Toad Face, if you make a move...
- Stop, or I'll slit his throat.
Obey me, my son!
Beloved guru, our men will not move if it is to cost your life.
What is my life to the life of our cause? Go!
- No! They will not let you die.
- Go!
No, you don't. We need you.
Wait a minute.
You have sworn as soldiers, if need be, to die for your faith... which is your country, your England.
India is my country and my faith... and I can die for my faith and my country... as readily as you for yours.
Go, chota.
India, farewell.
You have warned the English.
You must die.
Our guru has given his life for our cause. We must not fail him now!
We must get up there and warn the Scotties before they're trapped.
We may not warn them, but we've got to try.
Come on, mates. Let's go.
- Good work, soldier!
- Thank you, sahib.
Look.
Before I have your faces tied to bags of hot ashes...
I want you to watch as though you were rajahs at an Imperial Durbar... while your comrades are slain to the last man.
Bonnie Charlie's now awa '
Safely owre the friendly main
Mony a heart will break in twa
Should he no' come back again
You see, soldiering isn't all war,
Mr. Journalist.
Will ye no' come back again
They're coming in.
- The Colonel's got to know.
- Yes.
Trumpeter, sound off.
Shoot him down!
- You take the left flank, I'll take the right.
- Yes, sir.
They're getting away! Fire!
Good work, bugler.
Fire! Charge!
Cut their heads off.
- Poor old Din. What a mate.
- Mac, look! Here they come!
- Come on!
- Hit them again!
Get them off!
Speak to me, Bal.
They've killed him!
You'll pay for this.
I'll make you pay for this.
Take that. And that!
That's right. I don't trust you.
Why, you dirty, scheming scum.
You rotter.
Charge!
- Everything cleaned up, sir.
- Nice work, Mitchell.
Thank you, sir.
Firing party, halt.
Inwards, turn!
Fire three volleys in the air. Ready!
Present. Fire!
Ready!
Present. Fire!
- Very good, my boy.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Not half bad.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Let's take a look to the men.
Stand easy, men.
We've all done enough soldiering for one long day.
You were fine today. Particularly fine.
I'd sooner hear that from you, sir, than get a blooming medal.
Thank you, sir.
Perhaps you'd take care of this for me, sir.
And here's a man of whom the regiment will always be proud.
According to regulations, he had no actual status as a soldier.
But those who had the privilege of serving with him today... know that if ever a man deserved the name and rank of soldier... it was he. So I'm going to appoint him a corporal in this regiment.
His name will be written on the rolls of our honored dead... and I...
Let me see that last part again, will you, Mr. Kipling?
Present arms!
"So I'll meet 'im later on
"At the place where 'e is gone
"Where it's always double drill and no canteen
"He'll be squatting on the coals
"Giving drink to poor damned souls
"And I'll get a swig in Hell from Gunga Din
"Yes, Din, Din, Din
"You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din.
"Tho' I've belted you and flayed you
"By the living God that made you
"You're a better man than I am,
Gunga Din!"
Forward turn!
Straight march!
English
I received your letter and got here as quickly as I could.
Now I am going to tell you why I sent for you.
20 years ago my brother and I quarreled over a woman he married her. They relocated near
Kennegamy house, northern Canada.
A child was born, a girl.
Wife died
I heard that my brother had strangely disappeared.
Lately I have had a desire to see that niece of mine.
And find out just what happened to my brother.
That's why I sent for you.
I am afraid I couldn't stand a drift.
I will be glad to do everything I can.
You know, I haven't forgotten that you were dad's best friend.
You see my brother's name was John Ball... wife's name was, Marie.
More likely, that will be the girls name too.
Its my hope that she will spend the remaining years of my life, here with me.
You know son?
Some day she is going to inherit this here, the ranch of the pines.
I understand and I will do my best to find her.
Couldn't ask no more than that.
- When can you leave?
- On the morning train..
Good!
Rod Drew!
What are you doing here?
Well hello Bobby?
Where are you heading for?
I am going home.
I just graduated.
That's nice!
Say, how is the old Alma Mater?
Oh, kind a quiet now... they haven't found any cows or goats in the dormitory since you left.
Don't tell me the place has deteriorated into a school of learning.
Sit down.
Oh, I cant now!
My mind is in the middle of a poker game.
But I have a lot to tell you,
I will be back later.
Okay.
- Don't loose your shirt!
- No!
I saw from where that one came from.
What are you doing, getting sore when you start to loose?
You tin horn...
I didn't do it, Rod.
They framed me.
I caught him cheating and he pulled a gun on me.
Its murder.
Come on.
Nice way to have a bath.
You shouldn't have done that Rod.
Now you are in it, as much as I am.
Don't worry about that, Bobby.
The main thing is to get out of here before they pick us up.
We are about a mile from Fort Minnetaki.
We should be able to buy a change of clothes there.
Lets get started.
Here you are, Mister.
Come on, Bobby.
Telegram for you Martial.
It must be that fellow who drifted down in this morning.
Well, there they are now.
We are going to have a talk with them.
Hey you fellas, wait a minute.
Wait a minute there.
Come on, Bobby.
That's them alright!
Come on lets run them down.
We got to jump for it.
It's our only chance.
They got away.
Notify the Mountain police.
From Minetaki they have headed north.
One of them is half-breed, but we do not have any description of the other.
- You better start at Fort Minnetaki.
- Yes Sir!
We can take a shortcut through Wabinosh
House, its on the bend of the river.
Once we make there, we will be safe for a while.
The cabin looks deserted.
We can camp there for the night.
Gold!
It's a map.
They must have fought for it.
Shows the location of their mine.
We, John Ball and Peter Plante... having discovered gold at this point do hereby agree to joint partnership in it and do pledge ourselves... to forgot our past differences and work in mutual goodwill and honesty
'so help us God' signed John Ball and Peter Plante.
So this is what happened to John Ball.
John Ball?
Why are you interested in him?
He is one of the reasons I am up here.
And the other?
His daughter.
Bobby, when we get to Wabinosh House... we will make a search for this mine.
Well, Bobby!
- Bobby!
- Felice!
Gee .. I am glad to see you.
I am glad to see you, Bobby.
Felice, this is Rod Drew.
My best friend in college.
Miss Newsome.
How do you do Miss Newsome?
How do you do Mister Drew.
Well how are you Bobby?
Glad to see you back.
I am glad to be back Mister Newsome.
Mister Newsome, this is Rod Drew.
How do you do Mister Newsome!
Howdy!
Are you going to be with us for some time?
No, I am afraid not. We are only going to stay long enough to get supplies.
Oh!
Where are you going?
Well! You see ..
We were thinking of hunting wolves.. and we want to get our trap plans plotted early.
Oh!
In the mean time I have some things here I would like to leave with you for safekeeping.
- Would you please keep this safe?
- Well, certainly!
- Benoit! Place this in the safe.
- Oui, monsieur.
Felice will get you what supplies you need.
We can put you up right here at the post.
Thanks Mister Newsome, that will be fine.
You boys come along with me now and I will show you to your room.
- Bonjour LaRocque.
- Bonjour. Eh! What have you got?
You wait I show you.
- More bullets, eh?
- Oui!
When the winter catches in we will attack Wabinosh House... and bring them to knees with their our own ammunition, eh?
Oui, and she is coming in pretty quick now.
And the ammunition is very low.
But Newsome, he don't know that.
I emptied his box and put them back on the shelves.
Good.
And now, I have the grand news for you.
Two strangers have arrived at the post with a map full of gold.
- A map of gold?
- Oui.
- Where is it?
- Je ne sais pas.
I have only seen the word 'Gold' marked on the map.
Newsome had me put it into the safe.
- You can open that safe?
- Do not know if I can do that.
- You try?
- Oui.
I will give you two men.
You will go there tonight.
Oui.
It is of no use,
I cannot get it.
But she can.
She knows the combination.
Ah!
- Benoit!
- Get her.
Ah, ah!
Felice, Felice!
She is gone!
Eh!
Who is this?
Its Abonga.
What are you doing here?
We found him wounded in Felice's room.
And she is gone.
Felice gone?
Ah!
LaRocque, eh?
I have seen him before must have taken her to his place.
Who is LaRocque?
Renegade trader stationed up in the river here been giving us plenty of trouble, what were they after?
There is nothing up here of value.
Not even in the safe.
- Maybe its the map.
- We got to find Felice!
- We better head for LaRocque.
- We can go by canoe.
No, you cannot go that way.
There's not enough water.
We might make it.
One thing for certain.
It sure would give them surprise if you did get through.
Come on, lets try it.
I couldn't open the safe, but Felice she knows the combination.
Get her and bring her here.
Jules LaRocque!
So you are behind all this?
You will tell us the combination of that safe and we will set you free.
I will tell you nothing.
Lets see maybe you will.
Take one of their guns and start something.
Meet me at the back door.
Bobby!
Get him!
My gosh, she is getting away.
Eh, Bobby!
I have been thinking, maybe Felice can help me with my quest.
So you are up here on a quest?
I didn't come here, just to hunt wolves.
I will be very careful, if I were you.
Man-hunters are not exactly welcomed by most people around here.
Its not a man I am looking for, its a woman.
A young woman.
She is just about your age.
That sounds interesting, tell me about it.
Don't you think we better inform your father that you are safe?
Perhaps you are right, Bobby.
You make big mistake when you bring that girl here.
I had too!
She has seen me.
And now I cannot go back.
We will send Marie!
She is not known there.
Oui, that's a good idea.
She can tell them she escaped from
Kennegamy House.
He will need someone for my place.
That stranger have a map of gold that you must get.
But you must not tell him anything.
- Leave it to me. I will get it.
- I know.
Excuse me, monsieur.
Are you Mr. Newsome?
Yes.
I am Marie LaFleur from Kennegamy House.
I was a clerk there, and also took care of the accounts.
I am looking for work.
- Can you keep books?
- Oui monsieur.
Well you have got a job right now as far as I am concerned.
If you can help me out of this mess.
That will be simple, monsieur.
I will go and have a room prepare for you right away.
Thank you.
Did you say your name was Marie?
Oui monsieur.
I heard you say that you are from
Kennegamy House.
Have you lived along there long?
You are very inquisitive, monsieur.
I don't mean to be, but I am very interested.
I would like to have a talk with you.
If you wish.
What's the matter Felice?
I don't see why he should be so interested in that girl.
What do you care?
Are you beginning to like him?
Why no.
Things haven't been the same between you and me Felice.
Not since you met him,
I owe him my life.
But I am not going to let him come between us.
Why Bobby!
I never realized that you felt that way about me.
Do you have your map, young man?
Better not take any chances.
That LaRocque crowd is not giving up that easily.
We will be watching for them.
I am keeping my eye on them too.
Getting too many of them to be comfortable.
I have to keep watch on them..
Good-bye Mr. Newsome.
Take care of yourself. Well good luck!
Thank you.
Bobby, its not same without you.
Good-bye.
Goodbye, Felice.
Goodbye, Rod.
Goodbye Bobby.
Goodbye, Felice.
Well, what you find out?
Oh, he don't answer any questions.
I cant find out nothing from him about the map.
And this morning they start down the river.
It is too late.
No, I do not think it is yet too late.
I have another idea.
Well?
They leave this morning.
Yeah, I know. But what you found out at the mountain police post?
I found out plenty.
They are wanted men.
A mountain patrol left fort Minekati this morning to find them.
That is bad. If the police get them, we loose the map.
We must beat the police.
A mounty!
Get away from that gun.
You are under arrest.
Hit the trail, you two.
We are heading for Kennegamy House.
Not that way, this way.
I thought the Kennegamy House was south west of here.
I said we are heading this way.
So it is your little game, is it?
Pretty clever, eh!
Almost as clever, the way you got Felice.
I should kill you for that.
Get the map!
Tie them up, put them in there.
Line up against that wall.
So you are the real Mounty!
I thought that other guy was a fake.
See we go up the Way Sugar to the Big Mackey.
Come... we go!
We got to get out of here.
LaRouque must be way ahead of us.
- Yeah! With our map.
- That's where you are wrong.
I left the real one on my boot.
You are not turning him loose, are you?
He is the law!
I am not going to live him here to die.
You can do what you want. But if you turn me loose I will make arrest.
Don't be crazy Rod.
You turn him loose and we don't have a chance.
He will have every man on the fort trailing us.
Listen, we may be your prisoners, but you are coming along with us.
Till we find out what this map leads us into.
That's white peak al right, and according to the map, it is right below us.
Here it is.
There must be a small fortune in there.
What's this?
By Jove it looks like Felice!
Why Bobby, is Felice John Bali's daughter?
You knew it all the time, why didn't you tell me?
I knew, if you find out, you will take here with you and I loose her.
I know now, that she doesn't care for me.
Well, we better get started.
LaRocque will know by now that he has been send into a wild goose chase.
And nothing will stop him.
It is not here.
We have been tricked.
We go back to the cabin.
Hey look!
Maybe we will find them in the creek.
Look, there they go.
Keep rowing, Bobby!
Oh, look!
We got to stop it, the fall is just below there.
Not good Bobby.
We have got to get him back to Wabinosh House.
Three time they fooled us.
But no more.
You will bring all the men here.
This time we will fool them.
We will attack Wabinosh House for the gold and the furs.
And they will find the ammunitions all gone.
Ah, Mecogui!
What did you find out?
20, 30 men hold big pow wow with LaRocque.
Him come here quick.
They probably intend to attack.
Thanks Mecogui,
I will get guns and ammunition ready.
Come on Bobby!
Wait!
There is a mounted police force at fort Mippigon... and I am deputizing you to and get there.
I will get them Ryan.
Mr. Newsome, these are empty!
Empty?
Benoit, to blame for this.
We cannot hold them forever.
Bryan intended that we get help from Fort Mippigon.
Going after them.
Hold up them as long as you can.
LaRocque gang is attacking Wabinosh House.
I have only three men here, but we are deputizing every men in the settlement.
Call assembly.
Everyone is ready?
We go!
Someone must have tipped them off.
No matter, but they cannot hold for long.
You lead them to attack while I go for Marie.
Oui, beau.
- Good! Everything there!
- Yes, most of it.
Wait I will get the rest.
Not so fast, Marie!
Here they come!
Take cover, quick!
Well, Ryan, we are ready to go back anytime you are.
That wont be necessary.
The sergeant told me, the guy that Bobby had the fight, didn't die after all.
When he recovered consciousness he exonerated Bobby from shooting.
And you boys are free.
Here comes Leicester.
Should I try?
- My Lord Leicester...
- Later.
Let me introduce my friend,
Hillary Vane.
Later.
Later, my Lord, may be too late.
Miss Cynthia, what have you lost?
A pearl from the Queen's. dress
- Not here.
- I heard the Queen owns 3,000 dresses.
Yes, sir, but she wants to wear the dress with pearls.
I say again, my lord Treasurer, that we neglect the Queen's safety.
There are plotters abroad.
Even now, as I came down the gallery,
I saw faces better viewed behind prisons's bars.
Keep the sprat and catch the whale.
Your pardon, Grandfather.
Your pardon, my Lord.
Me and the Earl of Leicester are in private converse, Cynthia.
What is the matter?
The Queen is furious because the Spanish ambassador is kept waiting, and there she stands in her petticoat and will only wear the French dress.
Well why not let her wear the French dress, mistress Cynthia?
A pearl is lost from the back.
From the back?
Well, she won't miss it.
No, my Lord, she has eyes in the back of her head.
Here... take this, Cynthia.
Everybody should always come to you come first!
I wish everybody thought so.
If Drake had thought of coming to you first, should we be rejoicing at the good news?
You can not mean
Drake's raid on Cadiz.
I do mean Drake's raid on Cadiz.
My Lord Leicester, see, here lies England.
But half an island.
Not 300 miles long, not 200 miles broad.
How small we are.
How wretched and defenseless.
Now turn to Spain.
In the Old World and the New.
In the Old... power.
In the New, gold.
Philip could build ten such fleets as Drake burned... and never feel the difference.
But if Spain sails across the sea to us, and burns our shipping...
How should we make it good?
You are the Lord Treasurer of England.
And that treasure is empty.
My Lords, the Queen's entering the throne room.
- My Lord, I lean only on my friends.
- The lean on!
Your Majesty breaks faith with Spain.
Ambassador, you forget yourself!
My Lord Leicester, it is you who forget yourself... the Spanish Ambassador is our guest.
Your Grace, we speak for England.
Indeed Your Grace, we do.
Who dares to speak for
England in my presence?
Answer my Lord Leicester, did you?
And you, my wise Burleigh, did you?
Be silent while then as I speak for you all.
For I am, England.
And I am the voice of Spain.
Continue, voice of Spain.
My master, His Majesty King Philip...
He introduces me to my own brother in law.
Reassure your master.
My sister Mary, the late Queen, was his loving wife and for her sake
I am his loving sister.
His portrait is still hanging on a place of honor.
My King doesn’t ask Your Grace to hang his picture.
But to hang his enemies.
Just this month, English pirates have destroyed some 7,000 tons of our shipping.
Names?
What do I know of their names?
They come and go like wasps... led always by the arch-pirate "El Draco".
Sir Francis Drake sailed around the world and I knighted him for it.
Now he's haunting Spain, and I am to hang him for it!
No.
If I hang Drake, tomorrow twenty other Drakes will take his place.
How can I hold them back when your King sends my honest merchants to the Inquisition to be burned alive?
Your Grace can at least forbid them to leave England.
England is a large island very many ports.
I will not sit at each and wait like a cat at the mouse hole
But I could spend free leave to punish my Drake and his captains... if Spain can.
Majesty!
I say, my Lord, "If Spain can."
If Your Majesty will not hear words, we must come to cannons!
And see if you will hear them.
If you use threats of that kind
I will kick you out of my kingdom.
But Your Grace, you must listen.
"Must"?
Little man, little man...
"Must" is not a word to use to princes.
Our Council shall confer with you.
Meanwhile, go home and be quiet.
Leicester.
- I have been too bold.
- It was needed.
If once the Spaniards think that we are afraid...
Invasion.
Night and day it drums in my ear, invasion, invasion, invasion.
I'm afraid.
So that is why you disavowed Drake.
Disavow you call it?
That gentleman cares not if
I should disavow him.
It is a private agreement that we have.
I was not told.
Must I tell you everything, jealous Robin?
When we were children I served you.
When the Queen your sister sent you to the tower...
But he is Philip of Spain...
Still I served you and was trusted.
But today, though I serve...
And love...
I am not trusted!
Do not deceive yourself.
I know you love me and will risk your life for me.
But these men risk more than their mere life.
Once they're caught...
I can not help them and they know it.
Once they're caught, it is death by fire.
But that does not stop them from dying for me.
They still cry...
God save the Queen!
Death to the King of Spain, brave boys!
Come on you there, die for the King!
Come on!
Come on!
Richard Ingolby.
Richard!
Miguel!
Father, he knows you!
We were friends once.
Enemies now!
I wish we had never met.
Why, sir?
Because you've beaten us?
But as long as we're your prisoners, sir, it's a sort of holiday.
That's right, dear lad.
We're safe enough.
Miguel... is it not possible to spare the boy?
I can do nothing.
It's each for himself, sink or swim.
Richard, you hear me?
Sink or... swim.
Michael.
You are the Queen's servant.
Yes, of course.
I'm now going to give you her orders.
You climb up on the rail.., dive... swim for shore.
When you are on land, make for the home of Don Miguel, he will help if he can.
Leave you here?
I had rather die.
I have friends in Spain.
I'm safe enough.
Once you're in England, go to the Queen.
I will not leave!
Obey me, Michael.
In the name of the Inquisition.
Father!
- Dona Elena!
- Father came!
But you can not go downstairs in your night gear.
She's mad!
Ah, poor child, she had an English nurse and she's never got over it.
A mannerless woman who opened all the windows.
Dad!
Elena!
They said you'd never get ashore tonight!
Admiral.
Doña Elena, you must come back to your room at once.
Please tell the servants to prepare a meal for me.
First Doña Elena must retire!
I am not going back to bed yet.
What did I hear you say?
I am not going back to bed yet.
I want to hear about the fight!
Let her remain, Señora.
If you say so, Admiral, you are her father.
But for the future, Señorita, remember this:
A Spanish lady may retire, but she never goes to bed.
Listen to me, Elena.
You're not a child anymore.
A child?
When I'm going to be married in three months?
The captain of the
English vessel, is Richard Ingolby.
Your friend... long ago... in England.
A friend... from long ago...
My best friend.
And I've handed him over to the military authorities... and they will hand him over to the Inquisition.
And you know what that will mean.
Father...
But he has an only son, Elena.
I've reported him drowned.
But I do not think that he is drowned.
I think that he will reach the shore and come to us for help.
What is he like?
Fair or dark?
He could pass for a Spaniard.
And he speaks Spanish.
So if he does come...
But we mustn't help a heretic!
Besides, father, the danger!
But nobody will know!
But they will!
I can give work to a beggar if I choose.
He's only a boy, Elena.
But an enemy of Spain!
What is it?
There's somebody outside.
Is this the English heretic?
Elena!
Poor boy!
The Queen sent me to have you this...
Why does she always call you
"spirit," grandfather?
Continue!
A letter from her desk, a cordial from her cupboard, and a message from her heart.
Repeat the message.
She says: "I entreat Heaven daily for your longer life... else would I and my people stand in need of cordial all."
She is my cordial.
Vinegar for the rest of us.
She gave me a cuff this morning.
No doubt you earned it!
I was only humming a tune!
Michael's tune.
But she ordered me off to you with those letters and I was not to come back until you'd read them.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
"Garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
Oh, gad... does your gout trouble you so?
Sir Richard Ingolby has been captured by the Spaniards.
He is held by the Inquisition.
And Michael?
There's no word here of Michael.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
I said you could not do it.
Now, listen.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
"garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
"high was her degree...
"smiling...
"sighing...
"full of grace was she.
"Will you hear a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
How I came to a Spanish Lady...
"loved an English man.
- Why do you want a fire?
- I'm cooking.
What?
A treat for you.
What is it?
They call it... a potato.
It's a kind of food, very rare.
Is that safe to eat?
Father has eaten one.
He says he never felt better in his life.
You bake them.
It takes an hour.
I'm glad it takes an hour.
I never see you nowadays.
Well, I'm very busy.
You forget I'm going to be married.
Besides... you only think of getting home to your Cynthia.
I expect she's married by now.
She won't be.
How do you know?
I know.
What are you staring at?
It's over Lisbon.
What?
Smoke, look!
So thick you can hardly see the roofs.
It's just smoke.
Michael.
Your shoulder has healed at last, eh?
Yes, thank to you, sir.
Thank to Elena.
I gave you the hurt, she mended it.
Michael, I'm to hurt you again.
But this wound will not heal so quickly.
Sir?
I have a message from your father.
At last!
Where is he?
Where is he?
His last words to me were:
"It isn't our quarrel... it isn't the Queen's quarrel.
"It's a war of ideas.
The boy will understand that one day.
"Tell him...
You can't burn ideas".
But when did he say that to you?
On my ship, the night you escaped.
Then you have not seen him since?
I saw him today.
What did he say to you?
He was gagged.
What?
Did you not see the smoke, Michael, blow in from Lisbon market place?
Smoke...
An execution.
My poor boy...
Get away from me!
- You Spanish devils!
- Michael!
And you knew too!
You let me talk and laugh...
- while my father...
- Michael!
Get away from me!
If only you knew how I loathe you all!
Your Spanish faces, your Spanish voices...
And you fed me, haven't you?
And you clothed me!
You made me your household pet, but you burned my father!
And I have to be grateful to you!
Grateful!
Michael, how dare you!
You couldn't know, for you were sick...
And now for once I know it!
I'm going now to take all my father's place!
But I haven't finished his message!
He said: "My son will hardly forgive me for deceiving him."
"He'll never forgive you."
"When his first grief is over, tell him...
I can not bear anymore!
Leave him alone.
It's all you can do for him.
We now come to the scandalous business of Drake's latest capture.
Scandalous?
I talked to the Spanish Ambassador... and I confess he may well complain.
When the Spaniards took the New World, they sent home the San Philip... the San Philip, my Lords, is the greatest treasure ship the Old World ever saw...
Drake captures... ship and treasure... and tows all home to Plymouth.
Scandalous indeed!
And now I have to report that the San
Philip has fetched in the open market...
114,000 pounds...
Of which the Crown takes forty thousand...
Fifty!
Write down fifty thousand.
Your Majesty intends to accept this money?
It should be more!
Well... so long as the crew gets it's share... fif... sixty thousand.
Your Majesty then returns the money to Spain!
Return?
We are not yet at war with Spain... but we shall be if we do not return this plunder.
If Drake had not seized the San Philip... the Armada would have sailed by now.
But it has not sailed, my lord... and we are at peace with Spain.
Either we disown the capture of the San Philip or...
Or?
Your Majesty returns the money... and hangs the good Sir Francis.
Her Grace shall not so humble herself.
My Lords, let us face facts.
Why is the Armada being built?
To invade England!
But If we strike now...
Ay, strike or be struck!
- If we strike first...
- We can not strike.
We have no brigs.
Burleigh, you croak like an old raven.
You and I have kept the peace thirty years.
Do not pleases you to croak war?
A young raven, new loose from the Spanish ark.
Well, young raven...
My, if they have not trimmed your feathers!
He has sailed from
Lisbon, Your Grace, in fishing boat, single handed.
What is your name?
Michael Ingolby.
Where is my ship and where is your father?
Both lost, Your Grace.
How lost?
By fire.
Boy... your father was ever ready to love me and serve me.
I'm in grief for your loss...
And for mine.
Gentlemen, give us leave for a little.
Come.
Father explained, they heard souls as we heard cattle.
All men must be of one pattern and one blood.
Spain is the prison of all freedom.
Spain is horror!
- Spain is...
- Shhh!
But who will listen if you do not?
You are the world's hope, my father said so.
His last word to me was: "Tell the Queen...
"Tell the Queen, Michael...
How can I?
I thought I could once in Spain...
I thought if I had but the chance...
But home again...
I can not.
How you can you, Queen here in free England... understand the danger.
Tell me, Michael, how big is their Armada?
I could never learn the numbers.
How many troops?
No one knows.
Their Armada will consists of 132 ships... it will carry 20,000 sailors, besides guns.
Your Grace has made a fool of me.
Blame nature lad, not me.
Will Your Grace give me leave to go?
If you can not endure to be laughed at, boy, how shall you endure a harder service?
Do you no longer wish to serve me?
Tell me how.
For the first change your cloth.
It stinks of fish!
Thus we learn.
Michael!
Michael.
- Sweetheart!
- My dear!
My darling!
Mistress!
This is my palace, not your private parlor.
Lord Leicester's dines with me.
Change my dress and my clothes now!
I'll come back!
The wrong shoe!
Thee wrong foot.
Where're your thoughts, girl?
In my head, Madam.
Crooked answers, crooked answers!
Yes, Madam.
For crooked questions.
My wig.
Your Grace!
Do you like what you see in the glass?
Ay, Madam.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
When I was eighteen,
I was a prisoner in the Tower.
Fetch me the Earl of Leicester.
And do not loiter!
This mirror is old and blemished!
- Shall I fetch another, Your Grace?
- No, I know what you think.
- I think nothing, Madam.
- You do, you do!
You know that the Queen’s face is blemished, not the mirror.
Well, fetch me my disguise.
I had forgotten.
Me?
That you were so beautiful.
I too had forgotten.
Me?
That you were so tall.
Such hollow cheeks... so... swarthy.
Spain is a land of ghosts.
This is home.
Home, Michael.
Who gave the wench leave to mount my throne?
And where is the Earl of Leicester?
- Madam, I forgot!
- Forgot?
The state waits while a flaunting flibbertigibbet sits in the Queen's seat and lets an insolent boy flatter her?
Am I to wait your leisure?
Your Grace, the loved Lord knows whether I'm on my head or my heels.
You do not know?
Your Grace, it was all my doing.
- Do not cry, Cynthia.
- Leave her all alone!
I'll teach you two to know me better.
You kept me waiting on your pleasure, and now you shall wait upon mine, go!
- Your Grace...
- Go and be hanged!
Your dear Majesty has frightened two bairns out of their little wits.
The girl is a minx.
But the youth...
He is such a tall lad... as you were, Robin... when all the world was young.
My dear...
Nay my lord, springtime is over.
What is your autumn wish?
Your signature.
You had less tame wishes once.
They were never granted.
And now only wish for my 60,000 pounds to spend on Burleigh's fleet.
Sign those, dear Majesty... and you are safe against Spain.
See here, Robin...
I have written out for me another paper returning the money to Philip.
Without consulting the Council?
The Council!
But the boy's talk shook me.
He is a handsome youth.
You do well to be jealous!
He's stronger than you.
You are... today.
He is tomorrow.
Lord Amberley, writes that you wish for a license to travel.
Why?
To see the world, my Lord.
What part of the world?
Paris, Rome...
Madrid?
Why should I go to Madrid?
Shall I tell you?
I should be glad to hear!
To give the King of Spain news of his English friends.
Why, Mr. Vane, you have no color in your face.
Have you been ill?
That's why my doctor recommends travel.
Mr. Vane, that is not the reason.
We know because we have read them, this letters passed between you and certain Spaniards.
There was no harm!
Why should the King of Spain invite you to Madrid?
Tell me why, and I will myself beg the
Queen to grant your license.
The Queen would be merciful to a men who confesses his follies... and those of his friends.
Come, be open with me.
I will not cheat you.
I have nothing to confess.
I do not understand your Lordship.
Your application will be considered.
Goodbye, Mr. Vane.
Good day, my lord.
Did you know that gentleman?
- Mr. Vane?
- Mr. Hillary Vane.
It is very likely he will try to leave the country.
Your business is to prevent him.
By force?
If need be.
But at all costs, he is to be taken alive.
The French ambassador has arrived, my Lord.
Has the Queen returned from hunting?
Not yet.
It's late!
Has she read my petition to rejoin the fleet?
Do you think she will let me go?
Why not?
Because he likes you.
Did you speak for me?
I didn’t dare.
She's still upset with me.
Why?
Because she likes you.
Michael!
You?
At least you've learned not to loiter.
Fools, can't you see that it's a woman?
Who set you on to killing me?
Which Queen are you?
There is but one Queen, woman.
There were once two cousins.
The Queen of England and the Queen of Scots.
The English Queen put my
Queen of Scots to death.
Now I have no Queen to serve.
She's crazy, else she would not dare.
Give me the pistol.
Not loaded.
Let her go.
The will stone me!
Where are your friends?
In France.
You shall be given safe-conducts and money to take you there.
Take her in your charge.
Be content.
No harm has come to me.
Your arm.
Alive... unhurt... oh most dear!
Let me sit down.
Lord Robin...
It was a sin to take life of kind Mary of Scotland.
Not sin of yours, her life was forfeit.
I could have saved her, but I let her perish.
Well, I pay for it.
Five times, Robin, I have stood to be shot dead.
Yet still I live.
Thank God Your Majesty is safe.
Your gout, I will not have you kneel.
We use you not for your bad leg, but with your good head.
A chair!
The King of France will rejoice at Your Grace's most happy escape.
My Master also will rejoice that your gracious life was not in danger.
- Not he in danger?
- The pistol was not loaded.
But Your Grace's alarm is natural.
A woman's fear...
Four years ago the noble Prince of Orange was shot dead on his own doorstep.
And I...
I know of loaded pistols.
And so, Your Grace', does he!
- Your Majesty!
- Boy, be silent!
Your Grace, this Spaniard plots against you.
- Slander!
- Slander? Then your own people slander you.
In Spain it is common talk that
England is full of traitors whom you have sworn to service.
- What service?
- Why, to kill the Queen!
Names?
How could I learn names?
But one day Your Grace, the pistol will be loaded.
And as the shot echoes across the sea to Spain, the Armada will sail!
And then there will be fire over England.
Flames, torments!
- He's beside himself.
- I'm not!
Then you are a fool and a hothead.
Avoid my presence!
Enough, Burleigh.
You must forgive him, your Excellency.
His father's ashes have blown into his eyes and blinded him.
You had better get away as soon as you can.
Mr. Vane, you're under arrest.
You'll not take me alive!
Well, what are you going to do?
Why should I tell you?
So that you can prevent me?
I would rather help you.
Ah, the old lads telling us what to do!
I am very tired.
In a few years, I shall be asleep forever.
Why should I care what you young people do?
Then why do you swat and hamper us?
I am an upper servant in an old house.
So is the Queen.
So is Leicester.
We have spent our lives... dusting. polishing.
Dull work.
But we have learned to take a pride in the house.
And our task in our old age is to train the new servants.
The house boys... the kitchen maids... that one day will take our places.
I wonder why we do it.
We get no thanks.
- My Lord, I did not intend...
- I can not teach you to be a hero.
I'm only a servant myself.
And service is too tame for you.
Pity.
- My lord...
- Oh, go away.
- My lord...
- Oh, chatter somewhere else.
Grandfather, the Queen is asking for you!
You are to come quickly, and quicker still.
Will you take my arm, sir?
I can still totter.
There, grandchild, is the man who requires your support.
You gave orders!
You gave orders!
You get who should be taken and who'll go free!
By gad, my Lord, if you think you rule here, you will soon know better.
Burleigh...
Vane is dead!
Dead? How?
Killed in resisting arrest.
But I gave orders...
My orders were that he should not be touched!
But this fool takes it upon him to overrule my orders!
Do you not understand, my Lord, that we wished Vane visit to Philip?
And when he would return stuffed with Philip's plots, then... then we should have taken him?
Well, I was afraid foe her life, I...
Oh, I'm assured of your dutiful thoughts!
Did they get Vane's papers?
No, he leapt over the boat's side and the tide swept him away.
Waste, waste, waste.
Wherein have I failed?
Robin... do you think that dammed fellow was indeed a traitor?
I know it!
I know a youngster who is not traitor.
You don't understand.
I understand very well!
Your loyalty asks to pay for everyone's mistakes.
But I won't let you.
If the Queen sends you home in disgrace
I'll come with you and be disgraced too.
Dear... and foolish.
Why foolish?
You love me, don't you?
Well... settled?
I can't.
Michael!
I can't!
We have a right to be happy!
Everyone's the right to be happy, Michael!
Everyone, yes.
That is why we can't. be.
The last time I watched a fire fall to pieces was the day my father...
Elena and I were laughing.
And then the smoke began to drift across the bay.
Michael.
Michael!
Yes, dear, of course, we a right to be happy.
Husband and wife sitting by the fire listening to the crackles... and thinking of what they did to him.
I shall make you forget it.
I shall!
The smoke drifted right over us.
And now it's drifting over England.
Unless we stop it.
Oh, Cynthia, help me to stop it.
I'll help you.
How?
Come away, Michael.
She would like you to come away Michael, to your home and herd.
And I do not blame her for dreaming.
But it is not service.
What is service?
First obedience.
I will obey you.
Then, Michael, give me what I want.
I will give Your Majesty my life.
Would you?
Would you give me your silly young life?
Dear lad.
Then I will tell you some news.
Vane, who was on his treacherous way to Philip's court, is dead.
But it is known to none.
He was of your height, not much older...
And I speak Spanish.
Well?
Could you take Vane's part?
This is madness!
Why should he risk his life, twice?
Dear, be quiet.
No let her speak, you love her.
It is fit that you should ask her leave.
I love her... but I will not ask any girl's leave to do what I must.
Not if I order it?
Michael!
Michael, speak to me out of your own heart not because she bid you,
Must you go?
If you are killed, Michael, there will be so many years without you.
I shall grow old... fifty years without you, Michael, think of it!
Fifty springs, summers, winters.
Must you go?
Then you go with my free leave.
Lord Burleigh will order your journey.
Luck go with you!
I have no more to say to you till you return.
Girl...
- Your Grace?
- Where do you go?
I'll do but seek some... merciful corner to cry in.
Cry here.
The money... and the licence to travel.
The license not granted to Hillary Vane.
He was on his way to Philip when he died.
And took his secrets with him.
- Secrets?
- The names.
We know the plot against the Queen but do not the plotters' names.
And Philip knows them.
None but Philip.
- I'll get those names.
- How?
I do not know, my Lords.
But I know that if I do not get those names for you,
I will never see England again.
Make up the fire.
This hottest of days?
I'm always cold.
A cordial, Sire?
No wine warms.
How many letters have I answered?
Your Majesty has this morning written 40 letters by your own hand and dictated nine dispatches.
I will continue.
Sire, is it not time to rest?
Not in this world.
Who remains to be seen?
Admiral Valdez, newly arrived from Lisbon, he awaits instructions concerning the Armada.
- Who else?
- Mr. Vane, from England.
Admit the Admiral.
Employ rigorous miens.
Only by fear can the people be made to...
Admiral, I am satisfied with your report.
And the Armada sails?
A month from this day.
If the Englishman confirms our hopes.
Admit Mr. Vane.
Continue.
Only by fear can the people be made to do their duty.
And not always then.
Your Majesty... on behalf of all your devoted adherents in England
I... I...
Compose yourself.
You are welcome to Spain.
Get up and deliver me your letters.
I am the letter, Sire.
We dare not commit our plans to paper.
- But Lord Amberley says here...
- Ah, ah, but...
Mr. Vane, you must not interrupt His Majesty.
Let him go on,
I know the English.
I only wish to say, Sir... that my Lord Amberley wrote... before the attempt on the Queen's life.
What?
It was not attempted by ours.
- A poor lunatic...
- Is the Queen hurt?
Untouched.
But there is now such watchfulness at court... that we all, and my Lord Amberley in particular... favour a delay.
More delays?
Only until the Armada reaches the Channel.
In the confusion the Queen should be easier to attack.
Wait.
Now, sir, the plan.
Sir, in the audience chamber at Greenwich...
I remember that audience chamber.
Always draughty when the wind was in the East.
Yes, Sir... because, sir, behind the tapestry there is a passage... walled up since the old King's days...
But some of us have secretly taken down the brickwork...
Some of you?
How many of you attend the Queen?
My Lord Amberley, always, and... and myself until a month ago.
Does Sir Humphrey Cooper attend?
Sir Humphrey's absence hardly affects the situation, Sir.
What is the plan?
Why, to spirit the Queen's out of the palace by way of the passage.
Where would you take her?
To Sir Humphrey Cooper's.
Surely he lives in the North!
Ay, but he has an empty house in the Essex's marshes.
The Essex's marshes...
It would be easy to send a boat over from Holland.
I will consider your scheme.
Count...
I commit Mr. Vane to your charge.
Accompany him to the Governor's apartments.
And see to it that his stay with us is a pleasant one.
Your Majesty,
I most humbly thank...
Compose yourself.
Well, Admiral?
I do not understand this blunt Englishman.
I lived a year with Englishmen.
I hated everyone of them.
And how it rained!
But we must use the tools that Providence sends us, Admiral.
Blunt though they be.
It is a good scheme, my Sire.
Yes... it is a good scheme... if he is honest.
Your first visit to Spain?
And my first view of the Escorial.
Very impressive.
But I shall inevitably loose my way in all these bewildering galleries and corridors.
In that case, always ask to be sent to prison.
- To prison?
- Now we have alarmed him!
As governor of the palace, my official quarters are of course connected with the prison.
So you see, you must be careful, Mr. Vane.
Oh, I will.
His Majesty has already made me shake in my shoes.
- What did he say?
- Compose yourself!
Elena!
Spain and England under one King.
- Think of it!
- Oh, we do!
All England waiting for salvation.
All England watching the Channel.
- Waiting.
- That's it!
Just waiting.
Pedro!
Admiral Valdez has just come.
He's going to stay with us, he promises he will.
- My dear Admiral!
- Oh, Don Escobal!
Who is?
My dear, allow me to present His
Majesty's guest from England...
Mr. Hillary Vane.
My dear... talk to your guest from England.
I...
I have to talk to you.
You come from home.
My dear, how you do remind me of your father!
You speak of Don Miguel de Casanz, Admiral?
I didn't know that you've met my father at all, Mr. Vane.
I have heard his praises sound so often at home.
He made many friends in England.
It is hard for me to remember that now.
Have I...?
My father in law was killed two months ago.
Killed, by English pirates.
I'm deeply distressed to hear this.
Are you?
Why?
You are English.
Elena!
I know no full of vanity than this... to kiss and hate... to kiss and love...
To kiss.
Charming!
Charming! Charming!
Charming.
Then you approve of our
Spanish love songs?
I find them disturbing.
Ours English songs are lighter.
More heartless.
That's a challenge!
Am I to accept it?
If you dare.
Dare!
"As the holly growes green...
"And never changes that hue...
"So am I - ever have been - unto my lady true.
Pathetic show of me!
Who wrote it?
King Henry VIII.
That monster who beheaded all his wives?
How could he?
But love often turns to hate, doesn't it Countess?
I dare say, when it is rewarded by shamelessness!
What's that you are playing now?
One of our English ballads.
They call it
"The Spanish Lady's Love."
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she saved an Englishman...
"Garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
"high was her degree...
"smiling...
"sighing...
"full of grace was she.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she saved an Englishman...
How I turned to a Spanish Lady...
"saved an English man.
And now let me propose a toast!
Gentlemen, I give you the loveliness of Spain.
An ingenious toast.
It's wine!
It's music!
It's women.
I had no idea Englishmen were so gallant.
A thousand apologies!
I have been with the King until this moment.
Does His Majesty ever stop working?
Stop working?
Not to my knowledge.
I shouldn't be surprised, Mr. Vane, if you found yourself on your way back to England before dawn.
I've never known His Majesty to decide a matter so quickly.
You are to be congratulated.
There are few who succeed in hurrying our prudent King.
Then let us drink. gentlemen, to your prudent King.
- The King!
- The King!
Prudence is of course a virtue that we English lack.
You put audacity in it's place?
Do you despise audacity?
It dazzled me, once... but I have since learned to admire other qualities in a man.
Such as?
Unselfishness... consideration for others... all that is implied by...
Prudence!
My friends!
Drink to the prudent, who think as the state thinks... who believes as the state believes... who loves and hates with prudence... and dies prudently... when it is no longer safe to live... and lies snug at last in prudence's grave.
Gentlefolk of Spain, I give you the prudent's face.
And may England...
You can guess my wishes, gentlemen, for England.
Yes... speak out your wishes.
Ah, yes!
Let us now drink to the success of our guest's mission.
To the end of... of heresy!
To the invincible Armada!
To the destruction of Elisabeth!
You, you do not drink?
My glass is empty.
To the salvation of England.
Did you cut your hands?
Nothing.
Elena.
No, Michael.
Elena, please.
I must tell my husband who you are.
You know I must.
The King must know.
I can't let you betray Spain.
I'm only fighting for my own people.
And I for mine.
Then why did you say nothing when we met?
You had only to say this is
Michael Ingolby, a runaway prisoner.
Why did you keep my secret?
I remembered you.
Dear...
Dearest Elena.
Why are there wars?
Why must I be torn in two?
It isn't wrong to be found of you.
Father... he was too.
Darling.
I kept your secret till
I could speak to you.
But now I must give you up to them.
Kiss me first.
No.
It's just goodbye.
The last time we forgot to say goodbye.
Goodbye...
Michael.
Somebody is coming.
It's Pedro!
Then tell him now.
What could be more prudent?
You are are cruel!
Helena.
I can enjoy my
Spanish moonlight.
So I perceived.
The moonlight in this country is best enjoyed alone.
Why have you left your guests?
Answer me!
What happened just now?
You told me to talk to him, you said I'd been rude.
Did I tell you to walk alone with him on the terrace?
There was no harm, we were just saying goodbye.
In private?
Why are you so angry?
I shall never see him again.
Again?
Where you've seen him before?
- Nowhere.
- And why did you...
You have seen him before.
What is this mystery?
Who is this man who you insult in public...
- and yet, in private, you...
- No, no, Pedro, you're wrong.
- Well?
- I had the right!
Give me the copy of Mr. Vane's instructions and the letters.
Sir James Todd...
Lord Illingworth...
Sir Humphrey Cooper...
Mr. Joseph Madison...
Lord Amberley... and, of course, Mr. Laurence Gregory.
Ah, Mr. Vane!
Mr. Vane...
You will leave for England tonight.
Your Majesty...
I have not finished.
I have written for you the necessary letters of authorization.
The ink is still wet.
Sand it for me.
Allow me!
That is the sand... that the ink.
Your pardon.
Copy the letter again.
Meanwhile, I will outline for you the modifications
I desire to make in your plan.
Having secured the Queen's person...
Your father must have been beside himself.
- An enemy here...
- He wasn't an enemy.
He was just Michael, we were fond of him.
Fond of him?
The wife of the
Governor of the Palace has failed to disclose the presence of an enemy.
Is the King to be said that she meant no harm and she was fond of him?
I hope to deserve
Your Majesty's trust.
Trust?
I do not trust you, sir.
I do not trust any man.
If the Count of Carmenar is with us, fetch him.
But you have convinced me that you believe that your welfare depends upon obeying me... and you are right!
I reward those whom I... within reason, trust.
Upon your arrival in England, you will of course immediately get in touch with...
Sir James Tallerton...
And?
My Lord Amberley...
Mr. Joseph Madison.
And?
Sir Humphrey Cooper...
Lord Illingworth.
And?
And?
Tallerton, Amberley...
Madison, Cooper...
- Illingworth...
- And?
And?
My memory.
He... he's my oldest friend!
The name is on the tip of my tongue...
No... gone!
- He will laugh when I tell him.
- And?
Tallerton, Amberley, Madison,
Cooper, Illingworth.
Tallerton, Amberley, Madison,
Cooper, Illingworth.
And Mr. Laurence Gregory.
Count, you will place this gentleman under arrest.
This way.
Your sword.
Keep your dagger.
You will need your dagger, Mr. Ingolby.
Elena who's told you?
My wife told me a piece of folly so inconceivable...
Walk on.
We may be watched.
Do you realize what will happen to my wife if she is known to have helped a heretic?
It will never be known trough to me.
You English fool, you'll be persuaded to tell everything.
We understand persuasion.
Walk on.
You force me to choose between betraying my country or my wife.
I'm obliged to help you.
The only chance is to escape now before news of your arrest are spread through the palace.
At the end of this gallery...
I'll hand you over to the captain of the guard...
Then, without scruples, use the dagger.
And be shot down for my pain.
My dear Count, that will be very convenient.
I regret the risk, you must take it!
If...
I say if, you are adroit enough to escape in the confusion... it will be to my interest to create a confusion to delay the chase.
Make to the stables.
If you could secure a horse before the alarm is given... why, then you have a... slender chance.
Captain!
You will escort this gentleman to the prison.
I shall examine him tomorrow.
Adiós, senõr.
Adiós, Count.
Captain!
At your service, Count.
If at any time the prisoner should show sign of plotting an escape, he is to be shot down.
- Understood?
- Understood.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Mr. Vane!
Is the fire is serious?
They are getting it under.
I don't think we can do anything.
Are you leaving us tonight?
Yes, His Majesty has been most gracious.
I was just about to try to find my horse.
I've arranged that!
Thank you.
I have to slip away as unobtrusively as possible.
Oh, evidently, but does His Majesty...
You can trust me!
Thank you!
I'm ready,
I am very much obliged to you...
I should never have got away without your good offices.
I'm rather surprised His Majesty hasn't assigned you an escort.
I prefer to travel lightly.
Yes, one likes to be free!
Yet, sir, at the moment it is most essential to hurry.
We... we... we shall meet again in Lisbon!
Yes!
You'll do find us waiting for you!
Adiós!
A very pleasant fellow.
At long last Michael is saved... and you are not angry.
No, not angry, my dearest!
But you must grow up.
You see Elena, the whole trouble comes from treating your enemies like human beings.
Don't you see, my dear, that if you do that they cease to be enemies?
Think of what that leads to.
It's the end of patriotism.
It's the end of the war.
It's the end of... of everything!
Now, do you see?
I see.
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
Where are my spirits?
I've come to bid you goodbye.
I'm for Tilbury.
Your Grace should stay in London.
Your Grace will not take my advice?
I can't.
Nor the Council's advice?
The Council's a pack of cowards.
The army is at Tilbury and Leicester writes me... here, listen.
May it please you to come for this army and people... by spending two or three days in the camp.
So now comfort me, Burleigh,
And wish me good luck.
- Is this your supper?
- Not now, not now.
Why not now?
A good English broth.
Your Majesty's kindness.
Keep your breath to cool your porridge.
Come, one more spoonful.
Now I must go.
Take care of him, child.
Your Grace!
Your Grace is there to have no news?
Of the Armada?
Of Michael.
I have no comfort for you.
Do you think he will come back?
I'm not providence!
But what does Your Grace think?
I've seen blackest fears turn to hopes.
Hope on till you know there is none.
My people.
I have come to live or die amongst you all.
To lay down for my God, and for my kingdom... and for my people my honor and my blood, even in the dark.
I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman...
But I have the heart and valor of a King.
And of a King of England too.
Not Spain nor any prince of Europe shall dare to invade the borders of my realm.
Wake up your hearts!
By your peace in camp and your valor in the field
Will shall shortly have a famous victory!
Who should keep my subjects from me?
Well, loiterer?
Majesty...
News from Spain,.
Come!
Mr. Gregory.
Summon to me here my Lord Amberley... my Lord Illingworth...
Sir Humphrey Cooper,
Sir James Tallerton...
Mr. Madison...
And you come back.
You have done more than well.
You can ask and have.
She knows everything, everything!
It's better if we face it out, or do we run for it?
- Run where?
- Once the Spaniards land...
You’ll be hanged by then!
You have done enough.
Not while the Spaniards are in the channel.
You said ask and have, let me join the ships.
Your Grace...
The gentlemen are waiting.
Your place is with those others, and you know it!
Go!
What is wrong here?
Robin, I need your sword.
- My sword?
- Yes.
Here in my hand.
Kneel, Michael.
Rise up.
Rise up, Sir Michael Ingolby.
Your Grace!
Your Grace.
I rise up and I cast down.
Wait here.
Words will not count.
Hear that?
She is...
She is...
She is the Queen.
The greatest joy of my lifetime has been to serve her.
And so will you find it.
You, sirs... you have plotted to kill me.
Well, here I stand.
Will you still sway your swords?
Men use them better!
But let the King of Spain call you servants, when I call you...
Sons?
Your Grace!
Ay, sons, though your lives are forfeit.
How will you die?
In sunlight or in darkness?
For a free world, or a world where your thoughts are rationed like prison food?
Choose, for the enemy is upon us.
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!
Sir Michael Ingolby, come here!
Michael, I will give you a command.
You shall fight fire with fire.
These men shall fight under you for their souls' salvation.
Gentlemen...
Dear Michael...
If you took seven little ships and tarred them... and piled them with firewood... and so sailed them single-handed against the greatest fleet the world has ever known...
If you wield not swords in your hands, but torches!
Thou didst blow with thy wind... and they were scattered.
Peace!
Till next time.
No next time...
The Armada was scattered to the four winds.
And now the bells begin to ring.
Your Grace must rest!
No time, Robin.
For now come the rewards, and the knighting, and all the happy people.
And the blind... who will never see again.
And the maimed men... and the men with youth gone out of them.
Some men will still have youth left.
Listen to our wedding bells.
The woman's point of view!
Every steeple in England rocks for joy... and my granddaughter says...
"It's because I'm getting married"
So at last they are to marry!
I allow it.
They shall not stay at court.
I don't know married folk at my court.
Yet, I'm a married man.
Oh, fool you.
You may go.
And come again?
Come and go.
Will come and go.
Yes, it's old and tarnished.
I will have no more mirrors in any room of mine.
My loving... people.
Let us give thanks.
Almighty God...
Father of all mercy...
We, Thine unworthy servants...
We give Thee our most humble and hearty thanks!
[Ship Horn Blowing]
Mr. Hogan. Mr. Hogan!
Derelict afloat with a man on board.
- [Hogan] Whereabouts?
- Off your port bow.
[Hogan]
Right.
- Get ahold of him, boys?
- Ah, we've got him. We've got him.
[Men Grunting]
- Want to salvage that boat?
- No.
Take him to my cabin.
Ruth! Ruth!
Ruth!
Easy, old man.
Easy, easy, easy.
[Exhales]
[Sighs]
What ship is this?
The Covena. Trading ship.
We picked you up adrift.
Oh, yeah. I remember.
- Where's she bound?
- Apia.
Apia?
[Chuckles]
I'm in luck.
Luck?
Yeah.
That's where - where I was bound when - when my ship went down.
- Yeah. The Lady Vain, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we picked up her S.O.S.
Then you - you got a wireless aboard?
Yeah.
Will you send a message for me?
Sure, sure.
But you'd better make it short.
You've got a lot of resting to do.
[Groans]
Thanks.
- I suppose it's to Ruth?
- How'd you know her name?
I've heard nothing else for the last two hours.
She's my fiancée.
We're going to be married in Apia.
- Miss Ruth, uh -
- Thomas. Continental Hotel.
What's the message?
Tell her I was picked up by this boat and when we expect to arrive.
Also that I'm all right - thanks to you, Doctor.
You are a doctor, aren't you?
Yes.
At least I was... once upon a time.
- [Dogs Barking]
- [Animals Growling]
[Crowd Chattering]
- What's up, old chap?
- Bulletin on the wreck - Lady Vain.
Oh. Oh, yes.
- [Man] Say, let's go see this.
- [Excited Chattering]
[Crowd Chattering In Foreign Language]
[Men Chattering In English]
Good afternoon.
Be very careful.
[Man]
I leave at dawn.
[Woman]
Miss Thomas! Miss Thomas!
Oh, right here.
- For me?
- Radiogram.
Thank you.
- How do you feel?
- How do I look?
- Better.
- That's the way I feel.
A little turn around the deck will do you good.
Not a bad idea.
[Animal Growling]
[Dog Barking]
[Growling]
[Screeching]
You know,
I thought I heard those things.
Say, what is this, a floating zoo?
[Doctor]
Well, yes, in a way.
[Barking]
Morning, Captain.
- I want to thank you, Captain, for -
- Who are you?
Uh, Mr. Parker, this is Captain Davies.
- How do you do -
- Parker? Parker?
Yeah, we picked him up day before yesterday.
- Why wasn't I told about it?
- Well, we tried to wake you.
- Well, why didn't you?
- You had a slight list to port.
- What do you mean?
- You were drunk.
Drunk, was I?
Well, why wouldn't I be, with a cargo like I got?
- Cargo is cargo.
- Yeah, I know.
But this boatload of filthy animals -
All the way from Mombasa to where?
To some island. Which island?
You answer me that, Mr. Montgomery.
- You're well paid for it.
- [Grunts] Yeah.
An island without a name.
An island not on the chart.
Hey, you think I don't know whose island that is, don't you?
- Well, I do, Mr. Sawbones Montgomery.
- Easy, Captain.
Well, it's Dr. Moreau's island.
Dr. Moreau's island, and it stinks all over the whole South Seas!
Superstitious South Seas gossip!
Dr. Moreau is a brilliant man and a great scientist.
Great scientist, huh?
Well, if you ask me, he's a black-handed, grave-robbin' ghoul.
That's what he is.
[Laughing]
Oh, what's the use?
You're drunk.
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
Hey, what'd you say?
- Nothing.
- Well, that's all right then.
[Dogs Whining]
[Whining, Whimpering]
Hey, what do you got there?
- Slop for dogs.
- Slop?
Ain't there enough slop on this deck already?
[Montgomery]
M'ling, get out.
Yeah, before I -
Go on.
[Dogs Barking]
So I'm drunk, am I?
Only a drunken man would do a thing like that.
That means trouble.
[Barking Continues]
There now. You're all right.
- [Growling]
- M'ling!
[Dogs Barking]
Go forward and stay forward.
Say, who is that fella?
My servant. That's all.
Hey, look here, Parker. You'd better get out of sight and stay out.
There'll be plenty of trouble when he comes to.
Easy, Captain.
- [Boat Motor Rumbling]
- [Dogs Barking]
[Man Shouting, Indistinct]
Get it off of there!
Overboard with the whole spittin' mess of 'em.
Lower away!
- [Barking Continues]
- [Captain] Here it is!
[Captain Shouts]
- Hey, is that Moreau over there?
- Yeah.
Say, what is all this mystery about, uh, Moreau and his island?
I don't know.
If I did know, maybe I'd want to forget.
Hogan!
Mr. Hogan!
- Are we all free and clear?
- All clear, sir.
- All right. Cast off!
- Cast off!
- [Sailor] All right! Cast off!
- Get up there and clear that line off.
There you are, Dr. Moreau.
That's the last of 'em... and this is the last time
I'll ever put in here... forevermore!
Amen!
[Barking Continues]
[Sailors Shouting]
Well, you're gettin' off here.
No, I'm getting off at Apia.
You're gettin' off here.
Cast off that line there.
Now hurry it up.
Now, what's happened?
What is it?
It's all right, old boy.
He fell overboard.
On deck!
On deck! Hey!
- You lost a man.
- Well, finders keepers.
[Laughing]
Full speed ahead, Hogan!
What's that fool talking about?
- Pull up that ladder, men!
- Aye, aye.
Drop that ladder!
I've got to get to Apia!
You can swim, can't ya?
Davies, take this man with you!
You can't do this, Captain.
There's marine law.
This man is shipwrecked.
You've got to pick him up.
Well, I picked him up and I dropped him in my first port of call.
That's all that's required of me!
I can't have this man!
I can't have him aboard.
Well, throw him overboard.
That's what I did.
[Laughing]
- Davies!
- Hey, Davies, drop that ladder!
[Ship Horn Blows]
This is most unfortunate.
It is indeed.
I simply must get to Apia.
I don't see how. We sight a ship about once in a 1 2-month.
Uh, Mr. Parker, Dr. Moreau.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Well, Mr. Parker, you may take
Montgomery and the schooner... and leave for Apia in the morning.
That's very nice. Thank you.
Not at all.
I'm happy to be of service.
Montgomery's a fair sort of sailor.
And I can give you enough of a crew.
Ouran! Gola!
Get away from those cages!
Come on now.
Let's unload this stuff.
The dogs first, then the monkeys and then the cages.
Hurry it up.
I'll stay with Parker tonight on the schooner.
No. I'm taking him up to the house.
Mr. Parker.
- [Parker] Yes.
- You can't do that.
I've got something in mind.
Mr. Parker?
- Would you come with me, please?
- Surely.
[Dogs Barking]
[Sailors Chattering]
You understand, Mr. Parker, you are an uninvited guest.
Certainly.
You may perhaps find our domain rather strange.
I shall have to rely upon your caution while you're here... and your silence when you're gone.
- You understand that?
- Of course, Doctor.
- [Whip Cracks]
- [Fearful Howl]
[Chuckles]
Limestone formation.
Curious, isn't it?
This was once the crater of a volcano.
Extraordinarily fertile this volcanic dust.
Seeds blown here by the wind and brought here by birds.
See the result.
[Whip Cracks]
[Grunts]
Don't be alarmed, Mr. Parker.
You're quite expert with that whip, aren't you, Doctor?
It's a hobby of mine. I learned how to handle one as a boy in Australia.
There's my house.
[Gate Slides Shut]
[Quiet Growling]
[Growls]
Strange-looking natives you have here.
You'll be wanting a cold shower,
I take it, before dinner.
[Growling Continues]
Oh, an excellent brandy, Montgomery.
I hope you brought plenty.
Then, of course, you did.
Montgomery is a man to trust,
Mr. Parker... especially in the selection and the ordering of your liquors.
M'ling, you may take everything.
[Humanlike Groaning]
- [Cup Rattles]
- [Groaning Continues]
Yes.
You are a man of discretion,
Mr. Parker.
I hope so.
And now, if you'll excuse us, there are cigarettes.
- M'ling, brandy for Mr. Parker.
- Nothing more, thank you.
That'll be all, M'ling.
You may go. l, uh, should much prefer,
Mr. Parker... that you don't leave this room.
Your wish, Doctor.
I had my reasons for keeping you sober.
Go to the laboratory.
You'll see what's to be done.
You're not going?
- I'm taking her to Parker.
- Lota to Parker?
Why do you suppose
I brought him to the house?
He's seen too much already.
But she's never seen anything like him.
- No?
- You and I don't count.
The only reactions we get from her are fear and terror.
Hmm. That's understandable.
But how will she respond to Parker where there's no cause for fear?
Will she be attracted?
Is she capable of being attracted?
Has she a woman's emotional impulses?
I'd scarcely hoped for a chance like this short of London.
## [Low Humming]
Lota. Lota.
Come here.
## [Humming]
Lota. I've taught you many things.
Yes?
- All that you know I've taught you.
- Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I'm going to let you learn something for yourself.
A man has come from the sea.
I will take you to him... let you talk with him.
- Yes?
- Mmm.
I'm going to leave you alone with him... and you may talk with him about anything you please... about the world he comes from.
But you must say nothing about me... nothing about the Law... nothing about the House of Pain.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
Then come along with me.
[Animal Growling]
[Lota Gasps]
Get out!
Get out, I said!
[Chuckling]
It's all right.
Go in, Lota.
- This is Mr. Parker, Lota.
- How do you do?
Don't be afraid.
How... do you do?
Mr. Parker has come to us from over the sea.
She's a pure Polynesian... the only woman on the entire island.
Well, I'll leave you two young people together.
I've got work to do.
Won't you sit down?
Cigarette?
No.
- I thank you.
- You're welcome.
You'll have to pardon me because... this is all very strange to me.
What island are you from? Tahiti?
Samoa?
I mean, where is your home?
Home?
This my home.
I know, but you're not a native of this island.
I know because I've seen some of them.
How does it happen that you're the only woman on this island?
Did, uh, Dr. Moreau bring you here?
Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive.
Moreau!
Quickly, please!
What now?
You come from the sea?
Well, rather.
Three days on an upturned lifeboat.
You go away?
Tomorrow morning.
I wish you would not go away.
Well, that's very nice of you, but...
I must.
You come back... again?
Well, I - I don't know.
[Screaming, Groaning]
[Groaning Continues]
- What's that?
- It's the House - the House of Pain!
[Loud Groaning]
No! No!
- It's nothing! It's nothing.
- [Groaning Continues]
Nothing?
Somebody's being tortured.
- [Groaning]
- Get out!
Get out!
They're vivisecting a human being.
They're cutting a living man to pieces.
Now I know about his natives.
They're his victims.
You and I may be next.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Other gate!
We'll take Moreau's boat and get away from here tonight - now.
[Beast Man]
Sea! Sea!
- [Lota Gasps]
- [Growling]
Man from sea! Man from sea!
[All Growling, Groaning]
Lota!
[Beast Men Shouting]
[All Growling]
- [Hooting]
- Stop!
Stop!
- What? What?
- Man from sea.
- They are like us!
- They are like him.
One is not man.
[Others Growling, Muttering]
[Gong Clangs]
[Shrieking, Hooting]
[Beast Men Fall Silent]
[Whip Cracks]
What is the Law?
Not to run on all fours.
That is the Law.
Are we not men?
[Beast Men, Growling Voices]
Are we not men?
- [Whip Cracks]
- What is the Law?
Not to eat meat.
That is the Law.
Are we not men?
[Beast Men]
Are we not men?
[Whip Cracks]
What is the Law?
Not to spill blood.
That is the Law.
Are we not men?
[Beast Men]
Are we not men?
His is the hand that makes.
[Beast Men]
His is the hand that makes.
[Sayer Of The Law]
His is the hand that heals!
[Beast Men]
His is the hand that heals.
His is the House of Pain!
[Beast Men]
His is the House of Pain.
[Excited Shouting]
I didn't think, after my warning, you'd be idiotic enough to leave the house.
Now I can understand why you and your island... stink from one end of the South Seas to the other.
What makes your natives such monstrosities?
I saw you vivisecting a man.
My dear young fool, you're entirely mistaken.
Well, you can't get away with it in my case, Moreau.
Take it.
I'm now unarmed, and you're fully protected.
It's quite evident, isn't it, that I mean you no harm?
[Chuckles] Would you be good enough to come to the house?
Lota.
Lota, go to your room.
[Lock Turns]
I started with plant life in London 20 years ago.
I took an orchid, and upon it I performed a miracle.
I stripped a hundred thousand years of slow evolution from it... and I had no longer an orchid... but what orchids will be a hundred thousand years from now.
That's one there.
Yes, but how, Doctor?
[Laughs] By a slight change in the single unit of a germ plasm.
It was as simple as that.
That's a common lily.
That's a chrysanthemum.
That's unfortunately what happened to some asparagus.
[Laughing]
I went on with this research just as it led me.
I let my imagination run fantastically ahead.
Why not experiment with the more complex organisms?
- [Pounding Whip Handle]
- [Roaring]
[Laughs]
Man is the present climax of a long process of organic revolution.
All animal life is tending toward the human form.
[Laughs] I was still in London when l began this phase of my experiments.
One day a dog escaped from my laboratory... ran shrieking into the street.
And I left London, Mr. Parker... the newspapers at my heels, an aroused England crying for my blood.
I picked up Montgomery and brought him along.
He was a medical student facing a prison term for a professional indiscretion.
That was 1 1 long years ago.
Eleven long years
I've worked and I've worked.
[Gasps]
With plastic surgery, blood transfusions... gland extracts, with ray baths.
[Chuckles] With what
I have discovered in my own work... among the cellular organisms.
My work, my discoveries.
- Mine alone.
- [Beast Man Groaning]
With these I have wiped out hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
From the lower animals,
I have made -
[Groaning Continues]
Well, see for yourself, Mr. Parker.
[Groaning]
[Groaning Louder]
You're convinced that this thing on the table isn't human.
Its cries are human.
- You know what it is that I began with?
- No.
- An animal.
- An animal?
- Mm-hmm.
- Like those in the cages outside?
Then those - those creatures out in the jungle?
Are my creations.
- They were made from animals?
- Yes.
Was this thing, this poor, tortured creature -
What does that matter?
Of all things vile!
Mr. Parker, spare me these youthful horrors, please.
And those - those poor things out there in the jungle - those animals -
They - They talk.
That was my first great achievement - articulate speech controlled by the brain.
That was an achievement.
Oh, it takes a long time and infinite patience... to make them talk.
[Chuckles] Someday,
I'll create a woman, and it'll be easier.
Those are some of my less successful experiments.
They supply the power to create others... more successful.
But with each experiment,
I improve upon the last.
I get nearer and nearer.
Mr. Parker.
Do you know what it means to feel like God?
[Chuckles]
I'm talking too much, aren't I?
- Good night, Mr. Parker.
- Good night.
- You know the way to your room?
- Yes, thanks.
I hope you sleep well.
Thanks.
Good night.
Did you see that, Montgomery?
She was tender, like a woman.
How that little scene spurs the scientific imagination onward.
I wonder how much of Lota's animal origin is still alive... how nearly a perfect woman she is.
It's possible I may find out... with the aid of Mr. Parker.
You won't have much time if he leaves for Apia in the morning.
Wouldn't it be a great loss to science if he left for Apia in the morning?
[Montgomery]
Four with a fair wind.
- I want to thank you, Doctor, for -
- Not at all.
I'm only too happy to have been of service to you.
Yes, but I do appreciate what you're doing for -
Oh! Oh, this is most distressing.
I - I don't know what to say about it.
I can't account for it.
Unless, of course, the natives.
They were a bit out of hand last night.
- [Man] ...good time!
- [Man #2] You said it, mate!
[Chattering, Laughing]
- [Man] Come on, you guys.
- [Man #2] Hello! Welcome home!
- Hello, darlin'! How you been?
- Hello, baby!
- Did you miss me?
- Did I miss ya?
Pardon me. Excuse me, please.
Didn't you have a Mr. Parker on board?
- Parker?
- Yes.
Oh. You better talk to the skipper.
Let's go.
Now, men, stay sober.
Any drinking to be done,
I'll do it myself.
- [Man] Okay, Captain!
- [Men Laughing]
And if you get in a fight, send for me.
[Men Chattering]
- Oh, Captain.
- Hello there, baby.
Captain, didn't you have a Mr. Parker on board?
- Parker?
- Yes.
No.
But won't I do?
Didn't you rescue him from the Lady Vain?
He sent me a wireless from your ship.
Oh, yes. He got off at my first port of call.
At what port?
That's my business.
Maybe the American consul will make it his business.
Well, give the consul my regards.
You knew this man wanted to come to Apia, didn't you?
Well, I rescued him at sea and dropped him off at my first port of call.
- That's all that's required of me, sir.
- What port?
- Well, it was an island, sir.
- What island?
Latitude 1 5 degrees south and longitude 1 70 west, sir.
1 -5 south, 1 -7-0 west.
It's very small, sir.
You won't find it on the charts.
Then it isn't a port.
Well, it's an island, sir.
I dropped some cargo there.
Oh, I see.
That'll be all for the present.
Yes, sir.
If I find any irregularity in this,
I'll have your license revoked.
Yes, sir.
You wouldn't like that, would you?
- No, sir.
- I didn't think you would.
Yes, sir.
[Door Closes]
- Yes, sir!
- [Consul] How are you, Captain?
Miss Thomas, this is Captain Donahue.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, miss?
- When will you be ready to sail?
- I'm ready now, sir.
You'll find Donahue's boat perfectly safe, but not very comfortable.
I've worked it all over.
Are you clear on the position?
Yes - 1 5 south and 1 70 west.
Okay.
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.
Very glad to be of service to you.
Lota.
You startled me.
You're a strange child.
Talk to me.
Not now.
Talk to me.
Lota, do you know what this is?
- Book.
- Yes. Book.
From Dr. Moreau's library.
About electricity - wireless telegraphy, radio... how to build a shortwave transmitter.
Of course, you haven't the faintest idea what I'm talking about, have you?
Talk to me more.
All right.
I'll tell you something you will understand.
Lota, I must get away from this island.
Book... take you away?
Maybe book take me away.
[Parker]
Lota!
[Parker]
Why did you do that?
[Lota]
Book take you away.
Lota.
I'm in love with someone else.
I should've told you.
Love?
[Lota Gasps]
Lota.
- Moreau, you don't deserve to live!
- I beg your pardon?
Those creatures out there in the jungle were horrible enough.
But to have created a thing as tragic as that girl.
- [Tea Pouring]
- Lota?
Yes. Lota.
An animal with a woman's emotions - a woman's heartbreak, a woman's suffering.
Oh, it's criminal!
Hmm. You're an amazingly unscientific young man.
I could've overlooked those others.
I could've shown you that much consideration.
But not now.
Now I'll expose you to the world for what you really are, Moreau.
When are you leaving?
I think you'd better sit down and make yourself comfortable.
- Would you care for a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.
Well, we may as well discuss this frankly now that you know the facts.
Lota is my most nearly perfect creation.
I was thinking of taking her with me as Exhibit "A"... on a triumphal return to London.
I wanted to prove how completely she was a woman - whether she was capable of loving, mating and having children.
She was afraid of Montgomery and myself.
Then you came.
Well, she was very much attracted to you.
You can see, of course, the possibilities that presented themselves.
I'll tell you this, Moreau!
You'll make arrangements for me to leave this island somehow... and as quickly as possible.
Or this great scientific work you've been doing will stop.
How did he find out?
What did you say to him?
What did you do to let him know?
What is it, Moreau?
The stubborn beast flesh creeping back.
Well, it's no use, Montgomery.
I may as well quit.
Day by day, it creeps back.
It creeps back.
[Sobbing]
You see this?
[Lota Whimpering, Crying]
The first of them all to shed tears.
She is human!
I'm not beaten!
[Laughing]
Get everything ready.
For what?
This time, I'll burn out all the animal in her!
No!
[Whimpers]
[Moreau]
I'll make her completely human.
No, no.
- No. No!
- [Moreau Laughing]
I'll keep Parker here.
He's already attracted.
[Crying]
Time and monotony will do the rest.
- [Whimpering]
- [Moreau Laughing]
Gola! Gola!
- Huh?
- Boat come!
Man. One not man.
- One not man?
- One like Lota.
Hello in there!
I guess it's all right.
- You afraid?
- No. Of course not.
All right.
I just asked out of politeness.
Look!
You see some funny sights in these islands.
That jungle don't look any too inviting.
We must go on.
We've got to find him.
All right.
But I'd just as soon leave it for somebody else to do... if there was anybody else here to do it.
[Screeching]
[Screeching Continues]
You know, there's a bird in these jungles - kind of a parrot, laughs like a man.
They call 'im a Laughing Jackass.
[Laughs]
Funny name for a bird.
I don't know, when you figure out he laughs like a man... that's not such a funny name after all.
You're taking a very long time,
Montgomery.
There's a short circuit here somewhere.
M'ling!
- They come on boat!
- Who?
- People.
- People?
Two. One like Lota.
Dr. Moreau!
Dr. Moreau! Doctor!
Dr. Moreau!
- Boat come. People.
- People?
- Man and one like Lota.
- What?
Parker sent a wireless to Apia from Davies's ship.
Hello there.
[Screams]
Ouran.
We're looking for a man named Parker -
Edward Parker.
Oh, won't you come in?
Yeah. Thanks.
I'm Dr. Moreau.
This is my house. You're very welcome.
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
I'm Ruth Thomas.
- And this is Captain Donahue.
- How are ya, Doc?
- How do you do? Go right in.
- Thank you.
Nice little place you got here, Doc.
It serves its purpose.
Ruth!
Oh.
Ouran.
All right, Ouran.
[Lock Turns]
I may not need Parker.
This is Captain Donahue.
He was good enough to bring me here.
- How do you do, Captain?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?
[Moreau]
So you found him.
You know, I - I'd imagined Edward in some terrible place.
But this is charming.
I'll get my things, and we'll be on our way.
It's getting late.
- You'll pardon me, Doctor?
- [Moreau] Not at all.
- Won't you come in and wait?
- Thank you.
What kind of a place did you say this was, Doc?
- I didn't say.
- Oh.
It's an experimental station, of a sort, for bio-anthropological research.
Oh, I see.
[Montgomery]
Lota.
House of Pain.
No.
No House of Pain.
I promise that.
There's no twilight in the tropics.
Night falls like a curtain.
Thank you, M'ling.
- Would you care for a highball,
Miss Thomas?
- No, thank you.
- Captain Donahue, I suppose you'll -
- I'll take mine straight.
I thought so.
Whoa. That'll do. Thanks.
- Mr. Parker?
- No, thanks. We'll be going now.
Aren't you being a little rash,
Mr. Parker?
- Rash?
- Come on, Donahue.
You have a mile to go through my jungle.
- Yes, I realize that.
- [Donahue] We're not afraid.
I can see, Captain Donahue, that you would be afraid of nothing.
But Mr. Parker had one experience at night in my jungle.
I have no wish to frighten you,
Miss Thomas... but if Mr. Parker chooses to put you in what he knows to be real danger... it will be his responsibility.
Couldn't you send someone -
If you care to accept the hospitality of my house... you can leave in complete safety in the morning.
Well, perhaps that would be better.
Captain Donahue, you can share Mr. Parker's room.
Miss Thomas, you can have my room.
[Gong Chimes]
M'ling. Dinner will be for five.
[Moreau Murmurs]
[Moreau]
No wine, Montgomery?
No.
Extraordinary.
My regards, Captain Donahue.
Here's mud in your eye, Doc.
Doc, I see you're a vegetarian.
It's on account of the natives.
They've never tasted meat.
No long pig?
"Long pig"?
He means human flesh, Miss Thomas.
Oh.
[Beast Men Chanting, Indistinct]
What's that?
The natives.
They have a curious ceremony.
Mr. Parker's witnessed it.
Tell us about it, Edward.
Oh, it's - it's nothing.
They are restless tonight.
[Gasps]
What is it, dear?
Oh, uh, nothing.
[Chuckles Uneasily]
Don't pay any attention to me.
A little more claret, Captain Donahue?
Eh, don't mind if I do.
M'ling, fill up Captain Donahue's glass.
[Clears Throat]
Whoa, whoa. Whoa. That'll do.
- Well.
- Skoal!
- Good night, Doc. That sure was swell wine.
- Thank you.
- [Ruth] Good night, Dr. Moreau.
- Good night, Miss Thomas.
- [Parker] Good night.
- [Moreau] Good night.
Whoa!
[Donahue]
Say, it's a good thing I ain't a drinkin' man.
You did very well for yourself tonight.
Oh, you oughta see me when I'm real -
Yes, I - I have a rough idea.
I remember one night down in Mombasa -
Captain, uh, that's our room over there.
Oh, sure.
- Good night, Miss Thomas.
- Good night.
Don't be frightened, dear.
I'll be just across the hall.
Oh, I'm all right.
What's there to be afraid of?
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Better lock your door.
- Now don't you worry.
I'll be all right.
If you need me, call.
Good night.
[Bar Grating]
- [Bar Grating]
- [Gasps]
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
[Whimpering, Screaming]
Ruth! What is it?
[Gunshot]
[Parker]
Quick!
You'd better get dressed, dear.
Ouran tried to break into her room -
Miss Thomas's room.
- But I suppose you know that.
- I heard a scream and some shots.
And that's all you know, is it?
You didn't want it to happen, of course.
That isn't what you meant when you said that you might not need Parker?
Will you mind your own business?
I know you too well and too long, Moreau.
I've stood for anything.
I have stood for plenty.
But not this.
You're insane to even think of it, and I'm through with you here and now.
Are you going back to England... to prison?
I'd prefer it.
Same one that peeked out through the bushes this afternoon?
Yes. It was horrible.
We're no safer here than in the jungle.
I'd advise the jungle.
I'm sure Miss Thomas would be safer there.
I'm going to the ship and get my crew.
We'll stop this.
- Come with me a minute.
- I don't like your taking this risk.
I've been in tighter places than this, and the old head is still on its hinges.
- Here. You may need this.
- No, no. I'm already heeled.
I'll take that lantern.
That might come in handy.
Here. Here's the key to the front gate.
Well, here goes nothin'.
[Footsteps]
Ouran.
I want you to follow him and put your hands around his throat until -
- [Ouran] The Law.
- It's all right tonight.
[Beast Men Growl]
[Donahue]
Get back there!
Get back!
Thanks, Montgomery.
You must have a pretty good reason for helping us.
I have.
I'm going with you.
[Beast Men Growling]
Get back! Get back!
[Screeching, Whimpering]
[Donahue Gasping, Choking]
[Beast Men Screeching]
Ouran kill!
Ouran spill the blood!
[Beast Men Clamoring]
[Sayer Of The Law]
What is the Law?
Not to spill blood!
Are we not men?
[Beast Men]
Are we not men?
You broke the Law.
[Ouran]
Law no more.
[Beast Men]
Law no more?
Law no more?
You spill blood.
He tell me spill blood.
What is the Law?
[Ouran]
Law no more!
[Beast Men Clamoring]
[Sayer Of The Law]
What is the Law?
[Beast Men]
Law no more!
- Moreau -
- [Beast Men Muttering]
- [Beast Men Muttering] Law no more!
- They're more than usually restless tonight.
[Muttering Continues]
Where's Captain Donahue?
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Beast Men Clamoring]
He is man like him?
Man like him.
Man dead.
Dead.
He can die?
He can die.
He can die!
[Beast Men]
He can die!
[Beast Men Clamoring, Shouting]
[Clamoring Continues]
They're quite out of hand tonight.
[Clamoring Continues]
He can die!
Dr. Moreau! Dr. Moreau!
They come! They come to kill!
- Where's Captain Donahue?
- Dead.
- Give me the whip.
- Don't be a fool, Moreau. Come on inside.
You afraid?
Lock the gates if you are.
I'm going to meet them.
M'ling. The faithful dog.
[Clamoring Continues]
[Clamoring]
He can die!
[Gong Clangs]
[Clamoring Subsides]
[Gong Clangs]
[Whip Cracks]
What is the Law?
Law... no more.
[Whip Cracks]
What is the Law?
Not to spill blood.
He tell me spill blood.
What is the Law?
[Sayer Of The Law]
Law no more!
[Beast Men]
Law no more!
[Beast Men Clamoring]
Law no more!
Law no more!
[Clamoring Continues]
Law no more!
Come on, Montgomery.
Leave it open in case he wants to run for it.
We'll try the back way.
Quick. They're coming.
Lota.
- Lota.
- We can't leave her.
Wait here.
[Clamoring]
Have you forgotten the House of Pain?
[Murmuring]
You! You made us in the House of Pain!
[Beast Men Groaning, Clamoring]
You made us... things!
[Beast Men]
Things!
Not men!
[Beast Men]
Things!
Not beasts!
[Beast Men]
Things!
Part man!
Part beast!
Things!
Things! Things!
- Part man!
- Part beast!
- Beasts!
- Part man!
Part man! Part beast!
- [Clamoring]
- Part man!
[Clamoring Continues]
[Clamoring]
[Clamoring Continues In Distance]
[Clamoring]
Stop, you - Fools!
This is the House of Pain!
[Beast Men Growling]
[Sayer Of The Law]
Stop! Stop!
The House of Pain!
[Clamoring]
Pain! Pain!
[Both Gasping, Choking]
[Choking]
[Lota Screams]
[Montgomery]
What was that?
Where's Lota?
[Clamoring In Distance]
You... go back... to sea.
She's done for.
- Come on.
- We'll take her to the sea.
It's better that we leave her here.
The fire will soon destroy all of Moreau's work.
[Clamoring]
Hah! Little knives!
Knives!
[Moreau Whimpering, Groaning]
[Moreau Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
Don't look back.
Tom!
Oh, Tom!
Hey, Jim!
Whee!
Drat that boy.
He's always late.
I declare, you'd never know that Tom and Sid was even half-brothers, would you?
If he'd learned his Bible verses for Sunday school, he might be a better boy.
We won't wait for him.
Sit down and eat.
Fetch the cake.
Let me help you with it, cousin Mary.
Miss Polly!
Oh, Miss Polly!
Well, what is it, Jim?
Does you want this wood or this wood?
Oh, any wood, Jim.
Maybe this wood is better than this wood!
Oh, all right.
Heh!
Land of goshen, your hair looks like a hoorah's nest.
Did you wash your hands good?
Mmm. Gave yourself a lick and a promise,
I'll be bound worthy.
Eat your supper before it gets cold.
Lord, we thank thee for our daily bread. Amen.
Bread, cousin Mary, please.
Tom, it was powerful warm in school today, wasn't it?
Yessum.
Hmm.
Didn't you want to go swimming, Tom?
No. Well, not very much.
But you're not too warm now, though, are you?
Some of us stuck our heads under the pump.
Mine's damp yet, see?
Yes.
If you only pumped water on your head, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, did you?
Hmm. Well, I was sure you'd played hooky from school and gone swimming.
Didn't you sew his collar with white thread, aunt Polly?
Yes, I did.
That thread's black.
Tom!
Huh!
Ouch! It could turn black, couldn't it?
In the sun?
Well, you're enough to give a saint the conniptions.
Yessum.
Now, you march straight up to bed and right now.
Ow!
Play hooky on Friday, whitewash on Saturday!
I would, aunt Polly, but there ain't any whitewash.
Oh, yes, there is.
I mixed 3 whole bucketfuls myself.
That whole great big fence?
Every inch of it.
And you don't want any streaks in it, do you, aunt Polly?
Nary a one.
I'll tell the boys you can't go swimming
'cause you gotta whitewash the old fence.
Bye, Tom.
Aunt Polly!
Say, Jim...
I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash.
I can't, master Tom!
Miss Polly told me to go along and tend to my own business.
And if I don't, she'd snatch the head off of me.
She? Huh!
She never licks anybody.
Only whacks them over the head with a thimble.
Like this.
Ouch!
Excuse me, master Tom.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Jim, I'll tell you what I'll do.
If you'll whitewash some,
I'll show you my short toe.
Let me see.
Ow!
Clear the river!
I'm the steamboat Big Missouri.
Bound for St. Louis from New Orleans.
Let her go!
Full steam ahead!
Stop her!
I'm going a-swimming, I am.
But of course, you'd rather work.
What do you call work?
Why, ain't that work?
Well, all I know is it suits Tom Sawyer.
Say, let me whitewash a little.
Think I'd let a dude whitewash?
Oh, come on now.
I'd let you if you was me.
No. If it were the inside,
I wouldn't mind.
And aunt Polly wouldn't.
But she's awful particular about the outside.
Aw, shucks.
I'd be careful.
I'll give you the rest of my apple.
Well, here...
No. I'm a-feared.
And I'll give you this, too.
Ain't that a humdinger.
What is it?
It's a knob off a brass doorknocker.
All my life I wanted a knob off a brass doorknocker.
Well...
Here.
Quick, before I change my mind.
Don't tell aunt Polly.
I ain't seen a thing, master Tom.
Hey, aunt Polly!
Aunt Polly!
This aunt Polly that.
Aunt Polly here, aunt Polly there.
Well, what's the matter now?
Can't you tend to work and leave a body in peace?
May I go now, aunt Polly?
How much have you done?
It's all done. 3 coats, too.
Now, see here, Tom,
Don't you lie to me.
I can't bear it.
Well, look.
Huh.
Well, I never!
There's no getting 'round it.
You can work when you have a mind to.
Well, run along and play.
Virtue is its own reward as the good book says.
Aunt Polly!
Ohh!
Aunt Polly!
Oh, my sakes alive!
Ohh! Ohh!
There, don't you worry,
Sidney, dear.
You can put on your Sunday suit.
Wait till I get my hands on that blabberskite when he comes home.
Go on. Oh, dear.
Yoo-hoo!
Hello, Amy.
Hello, Tom...
Dear, I got something for you.
Where have you been such a long time?
I haven't seen you since we got engaged.
I had the chicken pox.
You haven't got it now, have you?
No, silly.
Think ma-ma would let me out if I wasn't all cured?
Who's moving in across the way?
I heard ma-ma say it was the new judge.
Oh, that's their silly little girl.
She's awful!
Ma sent me over to play with her, but I wouldn't.
She's too ugly.
Nobody round here's going to like her.
Mmm. Say, Amy?
Are you sure you got over the chicken pox?
Yes.
Certain sure?
Why, yes. What's the matter?
You look awful peaked.
I do?
What are those 2 pink spots on your cheek?
Pink spots? Where?
Of course, maybe it's only poison ivy.
Yes. Maybe it is.
But I ain't been out of the house.
Oh!
Ma! Ma!
Uhh!
Becky! Becky!
Yes, mama?
Uhh!
Tom's got a girl,
Tom's got a girl.
Aunt Polly!
Hey, Ben!
Wanna buy your frog back?
Whatcha want for her?
Bible tickets.
6 blues and 6 yellers.
You're crazy.
Give you 4 blues and 5 yellers.
Hand them over.
Ohh.
And you see, judge, whenever one of our pupils learns
2 verses of scripture, he or she receives a blue ticket.
Now, 100 blue tickets entitle him or her to one yellow ticket.
And 10 yellow tickets bring the reward of a beautiful Bible.
Attention! Attention!
Ahem. Attention.
Today we have the rare privilege of distinguished visitors.
Judge Thatcher, the newly elected magistrate of our county has consented to make the presentation of the Bible prize to Sidney Sawyer.
Come up, Sidney.
Ahem.
I'm sorry, Sidney, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait another week.
You are 2 tickets short.
I wasn't short when
I came in here.
Come on.
I don't suppose there is anyone else who has learned the necessary 2,000 verses?
Oh, I thought not.
Mr. Walters!
I'm ready for a bible.
I've got enough tickets.
Well!
Very well.
Take a seat on the platform while I count them.
Ahem.
Yes, it's quite true.
Here is the requisite number of tickets.
Then the young man is certainly entitled to his reward.
Yes.
Then if you will be so kind, judge.
Well, my fine little man, what is your name?
Tom.
Oh, no.
It is, uh...
Thomas?
But you have another one,
I dare say.
Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas, and say, sir.
Sir Thomas Sawyer.
2,000 verses are a great many.
And you can never be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them.
No doubt you know all the names of the 12 disciples?
Who were the first 2?
Answer the judge, Thomas.
Don't be afraid.
He's frightened, poor boy.
But I know he'll tell me.
Now, the names of the first
2 disciples were?
Were?
Adam and Eve!
Thy banners make tyranny tremble when borne by the red, white, and blue.
Be seated.
Thomas Sawyer!
Yes, Mr. Dobbins?
Come up here.
Now, sir...
Why are you late this time?
Perhaps you'd like to sit with the girls again?
Oh, no, Mr. Dobbins.
Then I trust you have an excellent excuse?
I stopped to talk to Huck Finn.
Huckleberry Finn!
Does your aunt allow you to associate with such riff-raff?
Well, I...
Of course not.
Go sit with the girls, you-you...
We will start with drill in multiplication.
You will have precisely 2 minutes
To write the answers on your slates.
Hmm.
Come, come.
Time is fleet.
You'll tell.
It's wonderful.
Why you bad thing!
Who drew this?!
Whose slate is this?!
Jonah Pauper, did you draw this?
No, sir.
Willie Fisher, did you?
No, sir!
Benjamin Rogers!
Rebecca Thatcher?!
Did you?
No? Look me in the eye!
Did you draw this?!
Speak up!
No?
We'll see.
Come up here,
Rebecca Thatcher.
I done it!
What?!
I did it, sir.
Come up here, Thomas Sawyer.
Hmmph!
Ooh!
Attention!
We will continue from where we were interrupted.
You have precisely...
32 seconds to complete the drill.
"How could you be so noble?"
"How could you be so noble?"
"How could you be so noble?"
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Becky.
Do you love rats?
No, I hate them.
Well, I do, too, live ones.
But I mean dead ones.
To swing around your head on a string.
No, I don't care for rats much anyway.
What I like is chewing gum.
So do I.
I wish I had some now.
I've got some at home.
I'll let you chew it a while tomorrow.
But you must give it back to me.
Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?
What's that?
Why, engaged to be married.
No.
Would you like to?
I reckon so. I don't know.
What's it like?
Like? Why, it ain't like anything.
It's...
Remember what I wrote on your slate?
Yes.
Well, just say that to each other, and you're engaged.
Anybody can do it.
Well, not now.
Some other time.
Tomorrow.
Please, Becky, I'll whisper.
I'll whisper it ever so easy.
I love you.
Now you whisper it to me.
Turn your face so as you can't see and then I will.
Turn your face away.
Now it's all over but the kiss.
Kiss?
What do you kiss for?
Why, that, well...
They always do that.
Please, Becky.
Don't be a-feared.
It ain't anything at all.
Please, Becky.
Please.
Now it's all done.
After this, you ain't never gonna marry anybody but me.
Never. Will you?
No, Tom, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me either.
Of course.
That's part of it.
So nice. I never heard of it before.
Why, it's ever so gay.
For me and Amy Lawrence, when we was...
Amy Lawrence?!
You and Amy Lawrence?!
Oh, Tom!
Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to.
Don't cry, Becky.
That was a month ago.
Go away.
Look, here's something
I wanna give you.
I don't want it.
It's a knob off a brass doorknocker.
Please, Becky, won't you take it?
Well, here's the best treasure I got.
Take it.
Aah!
Meow!
Hello, Huck.
Whatcha got?
A dead cat.
Say, Huck, what's dead cats good for?
Good for?
To cure warts with.
Cure warts with?
How do you do that?
Why, you take your cat and along about midnight you go get in the graveyard where somebody wicked's been buried.
Then when the devil comes to take that fella away, why, you heave your cat at him and say, "devil, follow corpse.
"cat, follow devil, warts, follow cat.
I'm done with you."
That'll cure any wart.
When are you going to try the cat?
Well, they're burying
Old Horse Williams today.
I reckon the devil will come after him tonight.
Horse Williams, suppose he's wicked enough?
Oh, yes.
He's the wickedest man in these parts... since my pa got run out of town.
Would you let me go with you?
If you ain't a-feared.
Who's a-feared?
Well, I'm going fishing.
I guess you better be getting to school.
I'll be waiting for you at midnight.
Will you meow?
I'll meow and you meow back.
The last time 8 cats came out before you did.
Meow.
Meow.
Meow!
Oh, meow!
Meow!
Meow.
Meow!
Hey!
Hucky, do you believe that the dead people like it for us to be here?
It's all right, if you don't step on 'em.
Say, Hucky?
Do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talkin'?
Of course, he does.
You can't be too particular how you talk.
I wished I'd said "Mr. Williams."
Shh.
The devil's comin'.
We're goners.
Can you pray?
I'll try.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I...
Look.
Why, they ain't devils.
That's Muff Potter.
Yes, and he's drunk again.
That's Dr. Robinson.
They're body-snatching.
And Injun Joe.
I'd rather they was devils than him.
Now put it in the wheelbarrow and get started.
Well?
I want my money.
You'll get your money when your job's finished,
Not until then.
Kind of high and mighty, ain't ya, for a grave robber?
I want my money now, and some more next week, and some more after that!
Why you blackmailing half-breed, I'll...
My god, don't do that! Uh!
Aah!
Muff? Huh?
Come on, Muff.
You got to get out of here.
What's the matter?
Joe... Joe...
I never meant to do it.
Of course, you didn't, Muff.
Of course, you didn't.
Huck, do you suppose we ought to tell anybody?
Do you want to get us killed?
Why, that devil Injun Joe wouldn't think any more of drownin' us than a couple of cats if we was to tell on him.
Looky here,
Let's take and swear to one another to keep mum.
Give me your hand.
No, that's good enough for little, rubbishy things.
Ought to be writin' abing like this, and signed in blood.
Yeah, and lots of swearing.
"Huck... Finn...
"and Tom Sawyer...
"swear they will keep mum,
"and may they drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot."
No use to keep bangin' on that door.
The doctor didn't come home all night.
Aunt Polly.
He's been sitting there like that ever since school.
Tom!
What's the matter with you?
He talked so much in his sleep, he kept me awake about half the night.
What you got on your mind, Tom?
Nothin'.
Now, don't waste my time!
I'm cookin' supper!
What ails you?
Nothin' I know of!
I know what'll cure it.
Painkiller?
Painkiller, a double dose, and right now.
And you did talk such stuff in your sleep.
You said, "blood, blood."
You said that over and over.
And you said, "I won't tell."
Tell what?
Now, you take this.
It'll cure anything.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
Aah!
Now get your breath, and then you take this other spoonful.
Here! Hear what I say?
Do it!
Don't ask for it, Peter, unless you really want it.
You better make sure.
Well, all right.
But if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self.
Oh!
Tom?
What on earth ails that cat?
I don't know, aunt Polly.
I never see anything like it.
What did make him act so?
Cats always act so when they're having a good time.
Oh, they do, do they?
Did you give that cat some painkiller?
Look me in the eye.
Hmm!
Oh!
Now, sir, what you want to treat that cat so cruel for?
I done it out of pity for him
'cause he hadn't any aunt.
Hadn't any aunt, you numbskull!
What's that got to do with it?
Because if he'd had one, she'd have roasted the innards out of him without any more feeling than if he was a human.
Tom, you mustn't be cruel to dumb beasts.
What's cruel to a dumb beast might be cruel to a human, too, aunt Polly.
But, Tom, it did do you good.
Done him good, too.
I never see him get along so before.
Oh, go along with you before you aggravate me again.
Ow.
You don't whack Sid when he takes sugar.
Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do.
Oh!
You...
Don't punish Tom, aunt Polly!
It was Sid broke it.
Well, you didn't get a lick a miss, I reckon.
You've been in plenty of other audacious mischief.
Oh!
Ain't you goin' to the church social?
Mmm... church social!
This here's chock full of potato salad and a great, big chocolate cake and pickles.
If I was to drown myself then they'd be sorry.
Ben Rogers is gonna bring a whole lot of fishin' worms to put down girls' necks.
They'd see my body layin' there all wet and stiff, then they'd dress up and cry some.
My ma was gonna whack me if I didn't put these shoes on.
Treat you like a dog.
Like a old cur dog.
Shoes!
Anybody'd think there was snow on the ground.
Burnin' you out with painkiller.
Squeezin' your feet.
Enough to make anybody run away.
I'd just as soon.
Huh?
We would never wear shoes.
We could go a thousand miles away.
We could go all over the world!
We can get Huck Finn to go with us!
We can use Huck's raft!
I'm Captain Murrell,
The one-eyed terror of the Mississippi, and if you don't dig for treasure, that's committin' mutiny.
Aw, I've walked the plank
10 times already.
I'm sick of committin' mutiny.
You're a fine old slodge of a pirate, you are.
You're a disgrace.
Then why didn't you let me be a hermit like I wanted to be?
All right, then, you're a hermit.
Hey, black avenger!
Now, go on, be a hermit.
Hey, Joe!
What's that?
Tain't thunder.
Listen. Don't talk.
Look!
Somebody's drowned.
They shoot over the water.
That makes the body come up to the top.
By jinx, I'd give heaps to know who's drowned.
Hucky?
I betcha they're lookin' for doc Robinson.
We won't find nothin' till we get down the river to where the raft was found.
How do you know that was the right raft?
Why, the poor little Harper boy's shoes was still on it, you old puddin' head!
That who's drowned... us!
Oh!
Say, Tom?
Do you suppose they really think I'm drownded?
Course they do.
Ain't ya glad?
Well, I suppose so,
But I thought maybe my mother would... well...
Your mother made you wear shoes, didn't she?
Well, yes, but, well... if she felt too bad, well, maybe I ought to go home.
What?
Well, you know, just for a visit.
Visit?
You're just scared.
Shucks, I'll bet you'll both want to go home.
Aw!
Joe?
Joe?
What?
What do you want to be when you go home?
You mean...
You mean, we're gonna go home?
In about
10 or 20 years maybe.
Oh.
10 or 20 years.
I think...
I think I'll be a general.
Then when I come home with my sword ad medals and maybe one leg off...
My grandpa's got one leg off.
Or maybe
I ought to go out west and join the Indians.
Then when I was chief,
I'd put on my feathers and war paint and come prancin' into Sunday school.
My ma always give us pancakes and molasses before Sunday school.
I know!
I'll be a pirate.
Then I could sail right up to town with my cutlass and horse pistols, and they'd all hide and say,
"Tom Sawyer, the terror of the seas, is back home again."
Yeah... back home again.
Well... well...
One thing about being a pirate,
Nobody's gonna bother you about washin' your feet.
My ma always makes me wash my feet with soap.
Yeah.
But I bet she don't smother the covers up around your neck or fuss around with your pillow every night.
Ma got me an eiderdown.
Well... anyhow, we won't have to listen to 'em in the mornin', rattlin' the dishes and talkin' and laughin' so loud and cheerful.
My ma don't laugh much in the morning, but she sings nice hymns.
Course there ain't such good swimmin' anywhere's as here, Joe.
But it ain't so much fun when there's nobody to tell you you can't go in.
I could tell you you can't go in, Joe.
I want my ma to tell me
I can't go in.
Never to see our boys again.
Oh, Mrs. Harper.
It's a poem, Mrs. Harper, to your Joe and our Tom.
Uh, read it, child.
"Our Drownded Boys" by Mary Wadsworth Sawyer.
"Alack, our broken hearts are so sad.
"Alack, our sorrow, it is so hard to measure.
"for though oftimes, they may have acted pretty bad,
"boys will be boys.
They were our fond treasure."
Now, don't take on so.
You're just wearing yourself to pieces.
Oh, I hadn't given up hope till they found the raft with Joe's little shoes on it.
Poor, abused boy.
I bet it was Tom's fault.
Now, Sidney, don't you say one word against our dear Tom...
Now that he's gone.
You better run up to bed.
Yes, aunt Polly.
Oh, Mrs. Harper,
I don't know how I can go on without my Tom.
And the last words
I ever heard him say were to reproach me.
Well, all our tears won't bring them back.
Oh, aunt Polly, don't you think you'd better try and get a little sleep now?
I reckon I'd better.
I'm all tuckered out.
Get some rest, Miss Polly dear.
Good night.
Good night, aunt Polly.
Good night.
O, God, in thine infinite mercy, watch over our innocent boys. punish me as I deserve, but not in this way.
I beg of thee.
Please. Oh, please, let their bodies be found so that I can look on my dear Tom's face once more for the last time.
Amen.
Why, Jim, why aren't you asleep?
I can't, Miss Mary.
I can't do nothin' but think about the funeral Sunday.
Now, stop thinking about Sunday.
Go on out and go to sleep, Jim.
I'll try, Miss Mary.
Tom, what are you...
What you do here?
You know they lookin' for you?
Why, them boys was my friends.
You ain't got no friend but me.
You stay hid.
Dear friends, we are gathered here to pay solemn and loving tribute to the memory of 3 fine and beautiful young boys cut off in the fullness of life's morn'.
What a model of obedience and uprightness was Joseph Harper.
Always the prop and comfort of his dear mother.
Always taking pride in being well-dressed and neat.
Yet, let us rejoice that he is now wearing celestial raiment.
And Thomas Sawyer.
I shall not speak of his kindness to man and beast alike... nor of his diligence in performing his appointed duties about the home.
Suffice it to say, in the recent words of a St. Louis editor,
"his life was gentle,
"and the elements so mixed in him
"that nature might stand up and say to all the world, this was a boy."
And last, but, oh, my friends, by no means least, the figure we all had come to love... the unfortunate, but enduring child of nature known as Huckleberry Finn.
How bravely he overcame the dismal handicaps of his parentage.
How nobly he grew in grace and became a useful member.
But now, alas, all 3 blossoming youths have crossed the great river.
They have stepped upon the sunlit shore.
Even now, they march.
They march into...
Tom! Tom! Oh!
Oh, my boy! My precious!
Joe!
Oh, Joe!
Where have you been all this time?
Who saved you?
Why, nobody.
We was just playin' pirates.
Playing pirates?!
Makin' a passel of fools out of us!
If they were mine,
I'd laugh their hide off.
Letting us think that they were drowned!
They have returned to us unharmed.
Let us give thanks.
Sing and put your hearts in it.
Playin' pirates.
Just wait till I get you home.
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise him all creatures here below...
I know I did wrong to run away and let you think we was drowned, but I dreamt about you anyway.
Dream? A cat does that much.
What'd you dream?
Why, uh... why...
Thursday night, I dreamt that you, aunt Polly, were sitting on the sofa, and you were sitting on the wood box, and Mary next to you.
So we did.
So we always do.
And Joe Harper's mother was here.
Why, she was here.
Hmm.
Did you dream any more?
It seems to me that Mrs. Harper said she still has hopes until they found the raft with Joe's...
Joe's...
Try harder, Tom!
It was his shoes.
Why, it happened just so!
Mm-hmm.
Go on, Tom.
Oh, it's all getting as bright as day now. then Sid said...
I think he said... he bet it was my fault.
Mercy on us, his very words.
And you shut him up sharp.
I certainly did.
And then you went to bed.
Don't tell me there ain't anything in dreams.
Sereny Harper'll know of this before I'm a minute older!
Hmm!
"Oh, it's all getting as bright as day now."
Trash!
That's what happened, wasn't it?
Purty thin... as long a dream as that without any mistakes in it.
Huh!
Sid?
Yah, you missed me!
Tom!
You, Tom!
I have a good notion to skin you alive!
You!
What have I done, aunt Polly?
Here I go over to Sereny Harper with all that rubbish about that dream, and, lo and behold, she found out from Joe you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night!
Oh, Tom, I don't know what's to become of a boy that will act the way you do.
I know now it was mean, aunt Polly,
But I didn't mean to be mean.
Honest, I didn't.
And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night.
Well, what did you come over here for then?
To tell you not to worry about us
'cause we hadn't got drowned.
I'd give the whole world to believe that, but it ain't reasonable.
Because why didn't you tell me, child?
Well, you see,
When I heard talkin' about the funeral,
I got the idea of hidin' in the church, so I put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.
Bark? What bark?
The bark I wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirate.
Why, it's still in the pocket of my old coat.
You can look and see if you don't believe me.
I wish now you'd wake up when I kissed you.
I do, honest.
Did you kiss me, Tom?
Why, yes, I did, aunt Polly.
Now, what'd you kiss me for?
Because I love you so, and you laid there moanin', and I was so sorry.
Kiss me again, Tom.
Go on to school now.
And don't bother me mo more.
Yeah, you didn't fool me.
Aunt Polly!
I never did nobody any harm before.
You'll all say that.
I didn't know what I was doin'.
I hope... I hope to die this minute if I did.
Hey, Tom.
They found doc Robinson's body and arrested Muff.
But Muff didn't kill him.
Injun Joe says he did, and Muff thinks he did.
But we saw.
What are we gonna do?
Do? Nothin'.
Do you wanna drop down dead in your tracks and rot?
Ohh.
Hear ye, hear ye,
The State of Missoura vs. Clarence Potter, alias Muff Potter.
Death was due to an incisive trauma of the heart inflicted by a knife.
It's Muff Potter's knife, all right.
I sold it to him last October.
Sure, I could see Muff stab him.
I was as close as I am to you.
That's all.
The state rests.
Your honor, I ask for an adjournment until tomorrow morning.
Adjournment? For what?
To prepare my address to the jury, which'll be our only defense.
You will introduce no witnesses?
We've been unable to find any.
Here's some more tobaccer, Muff.
And here's some real Lucifer matches.
Thank you, boys.
You've been mighty good to me, better than anybody else in this town.
And often I says to myself, says I,
"I used to show the boys where the good fishin' places was
"and befriend 'em what I could,
And now they all forgot ol' Muff when he's in trouble."
But Tom don't, and Huck don't.
And I don't forget them, either.
It's a prime comfort to look on faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble.
Good friendly faces. Heh.
Shake hands.
Little hands.
But they've helped
Muff Potter a power.
They'd help more if they could.
...tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me.
Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the 17th of June, about the hour of midnight?
Where were you on the night of June 17, about 12 of the clock?
Where were you at midnight on June 17?
In the graveyard.
A little louder, please.
Don't be afraid.
You were...
Ahem. In the graveyard!
What did you take there?
Only a...
A dead cat.
And, uh, just what were you going to do with your dead cat?
We was gonna take our warts off with him.
See, you take your cat along about midnight.
You go get in the graveyard where somebody wicked's been buried.
Your honor, since we must be exposed to all this boyish prattle about a dead cat, may I ask the cat where is the feline corpus delicti?
We will produce the skeleton of that cat.
Now, when you were in the graveyard, were you anywhere near
Horse Williams' grave?
Yes, sir.
Speak up a little louder.
How near were you?
Near as I am to you.
Were you hidden?
Where you hidden or not?
I was hid.
Where?
Up in a tree.
And now, my boy, tell us everything that occurred.
Tell it in your own way, don't skip anything, and don't be afraid.
We saw the fight.
Muff got knocked unconscious.
He didn't kill doc Robinson!
The one that stabbed him was...
Somebody get him!
Whoa!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Yay! Muff is free.
...in the bright, blue sky
They'll warble a song to me...
I got something for you.
It will make me glad
To think they are happy and free
If ever I see
On bush or tree
Young birds in their pretty nest
I must not in play
Steal the young birds away
To grieve their mother's breast
My mother...
Yoo-hoo. Tom.
All right, children, let's go to the cave!
Everybody!
Hey, wait for me!
All right, children.
Come on.
Attaboy.
Come and get your candles.
Everybody get candles down here.
Don't go out of sight of the entrance, children.
We won't, Miss Jenkins.
Yoo-hoo! Tom!
Wait for us.
Tom! Wait for Sidney and me!
Hurry, Becky!
Hurry!
They're gonna catch us!
Oh, look, Becky. Look.
Isn't it pretty?
It's just like Fairyland.
Come on under.
You won't get wet.
Thank you.
What is it?
Cake, but it's not to eat.
Just what I wanted.
Give it here, Tom, please!
Thomas, you give me that cake!
I promise I won't eat any of it, Becky.
All right, then. I'll trust you.
It's so still in here, Tom.
I don't hear any of the others.
Yes. We better start back.
Look, Becky.
It's just like a king's throne.
Yes.
Come on, Tom. Let's hurry.
It's this way.
Come on, everybody!
Time to go home!
Hurry up, children!
Come on. Come on, children.
Bats! Look out, Becky!
They'll get in your hair!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Oh, Tom, the king's throne again.
We must have gone in a circle.
Tom...
Maybe there's 2 of 'em.
No, we're lost.
I am sort of mixed-up.
Oh, why did we ever leave the others?
Don't be scared.
I ain't scared.
Nothing to be scared of.
I'm not scared with you along.
Sure. I'll get you out of here.
Why, I wasn't scared in the courtroom when Injun Joe threw his... knife at me.
I would be scared with any other boy but you.
Yeah.
Tom!
What was that?
That rock moved.
Come on. Duck under.
I'll hold it.
Ooh.
Golly.
Maybe they're hunting for us now.
Sure they are.
Take this.
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Aah!
I'm not hurt, Becky.
Hold the torch over.
What are you scared of?
Ohh!
We had a fine time.
Ha ha! Ha ha! How was it?
Well, where's Tom?
Why, he must be on the other wagon.
Uh-huh. Tom! Yo, Tom!
No, he isn't here.
That's strange.
Wonder where he is.
I was sure he was in the other wagon.
Well, who saw him last?
I guess I did.
He was with Becky Thatcher in the cave.
Well, then ask Becky.
Becky! Becky!
Becky!
She's not here.
Is Becky Thatcher in your wagon?
Becky. Becky.
No. She's not here.
They must be together in the cave.
In the cave?
Lost in the caves.
Lost in the cave.
Lost in the caves.
Lost in the cave.
Come on.
I got a driver.
Mark your way as you go.
We don't want anybody else lost in here.
Now split up, men.
Some of you men search the other passages.
No sign of 'em down there.
Nothin' here, judge.
Well, must've turned off before they got this far.
Come on.
Hey, wait a minute. Look.
There's a hole back here and footprints.
Footprints. Footprints.
Come on!
Let's have a look.
That's there, sure.
I been in this cave a hundred times, but never this far. Come on.
Becky!
Tom!
Becky!
Becky! Tom!
Wait. I'll fire a shot.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
It's them!
They're comin'!
We're all right now!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Here we are, in this cave!
Over here.
What's that? Shh!
Mr. Sherrell.
Did you hear that?
It's them.
Hey, judge, look.
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
They must've gone through there.
Come on.
Look out, judge!
Ehh!
You hurt, judge?
Tom...
We can't get through.
Can we?
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing we can do.
It's hopeless.
We couldn't clear that out in 6 months.
Becky, you mustn't.
Please don't.
I can't help it.
If only I had my mother and...
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.
There. Ain't it fun havin' a fire?
Yes, but...
Tom, I'm so hungry.
Did you forget this?
I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, the way grown-up people do.
Well, couldn't we make a wish on it?
We could try.
I wish...
I wish it was as big as a barrel.
It's good and long.
It's my kite string.
You hold on to this end of it,
And I'll unwind it down some of the tunnels.
Oh, no.
Please don't leave me.
I've got to.
We've gotta do something.
I'll take half of the candle and leave half for you.
Now don't let go of it.
I won't.
Why don't you sing, Becky, and you won't be lonesome.
If ever I see
On bush or... tree
Young birds in their pretty nest
I must not in play
Steal the young birds away
To grieve their mother's breast
If ever I see
On bush or tree...
My mother, I know
Would sorrow so
Tom!
Tom! Tom!
Wowie!
Tom!
Aah!
If Injun...
If he got in here, there must be some way out.
Let's look.
Becky! Becky!
But you gotta, Becky!
Becky!
There's light! Look!
Come on!
Please, Becky! Please!
I'll be back, Becky.
I'll be back for you!
Becky, it's getting brighter!
Becky, can you hear me?!
It's getting brighter!
Becky, there's light!
Becky!
Becky, I'm comin' for you.
And then this heroic boy actually went back into that awful darkness and somehow, some way, brought our Becky out to safety.
No common place boy could have done that, no boy other than the noble lad whom I now present to you, Tom Sawyer.
Where's Tom?
Where is he?
I saw him leave with massuh Huckleberry.
Here they are!
I got 'em!
Here they are!
They're rich!
Tom and Huck are rich!
They found Murrell's treasure.
Excellent, boys.
You did it, son.
Tom, you're a hero.
Don't forget, we're engaged.
Come on, folks. strawberry shortcake.
Oh, Sid.
Aunt Polly!
Why, Tom might even be President someday.
Aunt Polly,
Tom went and...
If they don't hang him first.

HOW DO YOU FELLOWS MANAGE
TO LOOK SO COMFORTABLY, VICKERS?
WE MAY LOOK IT, SIR,
BUT WE'RE NOT.
THEY SAY THE FIRST 40 YEARS
ARE ABOUT THE HARDEST UP HERE
ON THE FRONTIER.
AFTER THAT,
YOU GET USED TO IT.
REALLY?
[MAN SHOUTS]
TROOP, HALT!
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
[MAN SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
PEARSON?
ONE OF THE LEAD HORSES
OF THE SUPPLY CART
HAS BROKEN A LEG, SIR.
[VICKERS]
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
CARRY ON.
GIVE ME THE GUN.
SORRY, SIR.
WELL, OF ALL
THE IMPERTINENCE.
THAT VULTURE--
HAPPENS TO BE
A ROYAL FALCON,
ALMOST CERTAINLY
BELONGING
TO HIS HIGHNESS
SURAT KHAN, SIR.
OH. OH. OH.
FORGIVE ME.
I DON'T KNOW. THEY LOOK
PRETTY MUCH ALIKE
IN THE DISTANCE, SIR.
A QUITE A NATURAL
MISTAKE TO MAKE.
A DEVILISH AWKWARD ONE.
HARDLY AN INGRATIATING WAY
FOR A HOME GOVERNMENT MAN
TO PRESENT HIMSELF
IN A DELICATE MISSION
TO THE SURAT KHAN.
OH, I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
AFTER ALL, YOU MIGHT
HAVE MISSED HIM.
OH? OH, YES, YES.
TROOP,
WALK MARCH.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
HIS HIGHNESS
IS AWAITING YOU.
HIS HIGHNESS SURAT KHAN,
AMIR OF SURISTAN,
OFFERS A PRAYER
OF GRATITUDE
THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN PRESERVED
IN YOUR JOURNEY
AND PLACES HIS HOUSEHOLD
AND ALL IN IT
AT THE DISPOSAL
OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS ENVOY
OF HER MOST
GRACIOUS MAJESTY
QUEEN VICTORIA.
MAY I EXTEND HER MAJESTY'S
WARMEST GREETINGS,
AMIR SAHIB?
PERMIT ME TO PRESENT
CAPTAIN GEOFFREY VICKERS,
CORNET JAMES RANDALL,
CORNET CHARLES BARCLAY,
CORNET LAWRENCE PEARSON
OF THE 27th LANCERS.
VICKERS...
IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE FACE
OF AN OLD FRIEND AGAIN.
ONE OF THE BEST MARKSMAN
IT HAS EVER BEEN
MY GOOD FORTUNE
TO ENTERTAIN,
YOU KNOW, SIR HUMPHREY.
YOUR OWN HUNTING SKILL,
AMIR SAHIB,
COMPELS ME TO DEPLORE
MY POOR MARKSMANSHIP.
[CHUCKLES]
YOU BRITISH...
SO ADEPT
AT DIPLOMATIC GRACES
THAT EVEN MY OWN RACE
BOWS TO YOUR FINESSE.
GENTLEMEN...
I WOULD BE
INCONSIDERATE, INDEED,
TO INSIST ON ANY LENGTHY
COURT FORMALITIES.
SHALL WE DISPENSE
WITH THEM?
[SIR HUMPHREY]
DELIGHTED.
[CLAP CLAP]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
YOU'RE WELCOME,
VICKERS.
THANK YOU,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
I REGRET AS DEEPLY AS YOU,
SIR HUMPHREY,
THAT SO FAR
THE NEGOTIATIONS
SHOULD HAVE PROVEN
SO BARREN OF RESULTS.
WHILE IT IS REGRETTABLE,
WE MUST REMEMBER
THAT THE TREATY
BY WHICH
YOUR FOSTER FATHER
RECEIVED ANNUALLY
A SUM OF MONEY
FROM MY GOVERNMENT
FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY
SERVICES
CEASED AUTOMATICALLY
TO EXIST ON THE OCCASION
OF HIS DEATH.
FOR MYSELF, I SHALL
DO MY HUMBLE BEST
TO ACCEPT WITH GRACE
THIS SUDDEN WITHDRAWAL
OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT.
AND MAY I NOT
ADD FURTHER
THAT MY GOVERNMENT
LOOKS FORWARD HOPEFULLY
TO CONTINUED FRIENDSHIP
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS,
THE TRIBES OF SURISTAN?
OF COURSE, I SHALL ENDEAVOR
TO CONVINCE THE NAWABS
AND MALIKS OF SURISTAN
THAT THE ACTION
OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED
AS UNFRIENDLY,
CALM THEIR NATURAL
RESENTMENT,
AND CURB ANY ACTIVE
REPRISALS THEY MIGHT
SO EASILY CONTEMPLATE.
I AM CONFIDENT
THAT YOUR HIGHNESS'
PRAISEWORTHY EFFORTS
WILL BE REWARDED
WITH SUCCESS.
LET US HOPE
THAT YOUR CONFIDENCE
IS JUSTIFIED.
YOU KNOW, SIR HUMPHREY,
CONFIDENCE IS
AN ADMIRABLE QUALITY.
WE SO SELDOM
APPRECIATE IT FULLY...
UNTIL IT IS WITHDRAWN.
[PEARSON]
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME
I WAS IN BENGAL,
I SAW A FALCON
BREAK A LAMB'S BACK.
BEASTLY BIRDS.
YES, I THINK
I'LL SEND ONE
BACK TO MY FAMILY.
JUST THE THING
FOR A MAYFAIR
DRAWING ROOM.
ANCIENT SPORT
OF KINGS--FALCONRY.
THE APPEAL LIES
IN ITS CRUELTY.
I'D TAKE A POTSHOT
AGAINST A TIGER
IN LONG GRASS ANY DAY.
THEY'RE MAN-EATERS,
YOU KNOW.
ONLY A SAVAGE
WOULD PREFER
THIS SORT OF THING.
[SIR HUMPHREY]
AHEM. QUITE SO.
QUITE SO, VICKERS.
WHY, YOUR HIGHNESS,
I MEANT, OF COURSE--
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DARESAY YOU'RE
PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED.
HOWEVER, THE SURISTANIS
ARE AN ANCIENT RACE
OF PEOPLE.
THEY CANNOT SO EASILY
FORGET THEIR ANCIENT
TRIBAL WAYS OF LIFE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
I TRUST YOU'LL
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.
OH, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.
BORIS.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GENTLEMEN, LET US
GO IN TO DINNER.
UH, BY THE WAY,
SIR HUMPHREY,
YOU WOULD DO ME
THE HONOR IF YOU
AND YOUR GENTLEMEN
WERE TO JOIN ME
TOMORROW MORNING
AT A LEOPARD HUNT
I'VE ARRANGED.
WE START AT SUNRISE,
THE TRADITIONAL HOUR.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MEN SHOUTING]
[ELEPHANT TRUMPETS]
FINE FELLOW--
THE KHAN.
THERE'S A MAN
WHO CAN TAKE A LOSS
WITH GOOD GRACE.
YES. I DON'T THINK
I COULD LOSE £150,000
A YEAR WITH GRACE.
GREAT SCOTT,
VICKERS!
NOBODY BUT
THE HOME GOVERNMENT
WERE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ANYTHING
OF THE REAL REASON BEHIND
THIS DIPLOMATIC VISIT
OF MINE.
SORRY, SIR, BUT UP HERE
ON THE FRONTIER,
THERE AREN'T
MANY SECRETS AN OFFICER
IN MY POSITION
DOESN'T GET TO KNOW
SOONER OR LATER.
BESIDES, I'VE COME
TO KNOW THE KHAN
PRETTY WELL.
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
THE SITUATION HAS BEEN
A DEVILISH, DELICATE ONE.
HOWEVER, I AM
QUITE CONFIDENT
THAT HE WON'T TRIFLE
WITH OUR FRIENDSHIP.
BESIDES,
THE MAN'S A GENTLEMAN.
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT.
YES, OF COURSE, SIR.
YES.
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT.
[DRUMS BEATING
AND MEN SHOUTING]
[GROWLING]
[GROWLS]
YOU HAVE THE HONOR,
SIR HUMPHREY.
THE KHAN WANTS
YOU TO TAKE
FIRST SHOT, SIR.
HUH? OH. OH.
THANK YOU. SPLENDID.
[GUNSHOT]
MISSED HIM
BY A HAIR, SIR.
BAD LUCK.
[GUNSHOT]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
FINE SHOT, SIR.
[SIR HUMPHREY]
EXCELLENT MARKSMANSHIP, SIR.

[MEN SHOUTING

ARE YOU HURT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
BRILLIANT SHOT,
VICKERS.
IT WAS WORTHY
OF YOU.
IT WAS A LUCKY ONE.
I SHALL NEVER
FORGET IT.
MY GRATITUDE
WILL BE ETERNAL.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
WELL, GOOD-BYE,
DARLING.
GOOD-BYE, DEAR.
NOW, REMEMBER,
YOU SIMPLY MUST BE
BACK EARLY
IF WE'RE TO BE READY
FOR THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S
BALL TONIGHT.
OH, THE BALL, YES.
I SUPPOSE YOU FEEL
QUITE CAPABLE
OF TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF
AMONG ALL THESE--
OH, HOW SILLY.
A RESPONSIBLE LADY
OF MY YEARS IS
PERFECTLY SAFE ANYWHERE.
YES, I SUPPOSE SO.
WELL...GOOD-BYE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GOOD-BYE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ELSA, I'M SO GLAD
YOU WERE ABLE TO COME.
YOUR MESSAGE SAID
IT WAS URGENT.
IT IS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
MY BROTHER ARRIVES
IN CALCUTTA TODAY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WORD CAME THROUGH
FROM HEADQUARTERS
LAST NIGHT.
NOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHY IT WAS SO URGENT
FOR ME TO SEE YOU.
GEOFFREY'S
COMING HERE.
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST KNOW.
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?
OH, PERRY.
I KNOW WE BOTH TRIED
TO BE LOYAL TO GEOFFREY
BY HIDING
OUR REAL FEELINGS,
BUT NOW HE'S
COMING BACK, AND WE
CAN'T GO ON PRETENDING.
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?
OH, PERRY, I'VE TRIED
SO HARD NOT TO,
BUT I DO LOVE YOU.
I KNEW IT.
BUT I'M STILL ENGAGED
TO GEOFFREY.
WE MUST TELL HIM
THE MOMENT HE GETS HERE.
I MEAN, I MUST TELL HIM.
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
AND WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE FEEL, HE WON'T
STAND IN OUR WAY.
BUT SUPPOSING
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
HE WILL.
DARLING, I KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN ANYONE.
I'VE GOT TO TELL HIM.
IT'S THE ONLY DECENT
THING TO DO.
YES.
YES, IT IS.
I MUST BE GETTING
BACK NOW.
FATHER WILL BE
WORRYING ABOUT ME.
YES. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WILL I SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT THE BALL?
YES, PERRY...
TONIGHT.
IT'S ONLY NOW THAT
THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE
OF THE SITUATION
BECOMES APPARENT.
THE SAFETY OF
THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER
HINGES ON LOHARA,
WHICH IS THE BASE
FOR THE THREE
ADVANCE GARRISONS,
OF WHICH CHUKOTI
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.
THEREFORE, TWO
OF OUR ABLEST OFFICERS
MUST COMMAND AT LOHARA
AND CHUKOTI.
I'VE HAD TO
TRANSFER WOODWARD
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
HE'S TOO WELL ON IN YEARS
FOR AN ACTIVE COMMAND.
YOU SEE, WITH
SURAT KHAN JUST ACROSS
THE SURISTAN BORDER
IN A POSITION TO MAKE
THE APPROACH TO THE PASS
UNCOMFORTABLE,
I FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT WITH YOU,
CAMPBELL, AT CHUKOTI
AND YOU, WARRENTON,
AT LOHARA,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE
ANY AGGRESSIVE COMPLICATION
THAT MAY ARISE.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SIR.
YES, SIR.
OH, SHOW HIM IN.
JUST A MOMENT.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
27th LANCERS,
REPORTING FOR DUTY, SIR.
[MAN]
BEEN EXPECTING YOU,
VICKERS.
THE WAR OFFICE
IS SENDING YOU ON
A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION.
OH, SPLENDID,
SIR.
YOU'RE GOING
ON AN EXPEDITION
TO BUY CAVALRY HORSES
IN THE TATAR COUNTRIES.
OH.
DOES THAT MEAN
WE'RE PREPARING
FOR WAR, SIR?
WHATEVER IT MEANS,
YOU'RE TO DELIVER
THE HORSES YOU'VE PURCHASED
TO OUR FLEET AT BATUM
ON THE BLACK SEA.
FROM THERE,
THEY'RE TO BE SHIPPED
TO THE CRIMEA.
THAT CLEAR?
YES, SIR.
OH, WARRENTON, CAMPBELL,
YOU KNOW VICKERS.
[CAMPBELL]
YES, OF COURSE.
GEOFFREY, MY BOY,
HOW VERY NICE
TO SEE YOU.
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
TOO, SIR.
HOW DO YOU      HOW DO YOU DO,
DO, SIR?        VICKERS?
HAVE YOU SEEN ELSA?
NO, NOT YET, SIR.
HOW IS SHE?
SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, I KNOW.
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
UNTIL I SEE HER EITHER.
GOOD MORNING, SIR.
GOOD MORNING.
OH, CAPTAIN VICKERS.
YES?
YOUR BROTHER IS HERE, SIR,
INSIDE WITH SIR CHARLES.
OH, YES. THANK YOU.
YES, SIR.
[PERRY]
GEOFF.
PERRY!
BY JOVE,
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU,
YOU OLD DIPLOMATIC
GLOBETROTTER, YOU!
IT MUST BE
MORE THAN A YEAR
SINCE WE LAST MET.
COME IN HERE, GEOFFREY.
IT'S QUIETER. I HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO SAY TO YOU.
I BET YOU HAVE. I HAVE
AT LEAST A MILLION
THINGS TO SAY TO YOU,
EVERY ONE OF THEM
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE.
WELL,
LET'S GO INSIDE.
NO. I CAN'T JUST NOW.
I GOT A VERY URGENT
APPOINTMENT.
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW,
WE CAN TALK
OUR HEADS OFF,
BUT JUST NOW...
SEE YOU LATER.
SO, YOU SEE, IT DEPENDS
ON YOU, GENTLEMEN.
AND I THOUGHT I WAS
WELL-ACQUAINTED
WITH THE SITUATION.
BUT I DON'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND
SURAT KHAN'S
PRESENCE IN
CALCUTTA, SIR.
AND THIS DANCE THAT
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL
IS GIVING
IN HIS HONOR
AT THE GOVERNMENT
HOUSE TONIGHT.
FLATTERY IS
THE FOOD OF FOOLS,
BUT NOW AND THEN,
YOUR MEN OF WIT
WILL CONDESCEND
TO TAKE A BIT.
I SEE. FLATTERY
AND FRIENDSHIP,
SO TO SPEAK.
SURAT KHAN, DEVILING US UP
ON THE FRONTIER,
SEEMS TO BE DOING PRECISELY
WHAT THE RUSSIAN CZAR
IS DOING IN THE BALKANS.
YOU'VE READ
THE NEWS DISPATCHES
ABOUT THE COSSACKS
PLUNDERING OUTLYING
TURKISH VILLAGES.
MMM. IT'S AN OLD TRICK,
YOU KNOW--
DEVILING YOUR NEIGHBOR
INTO A WAR.
ONE WOULD ALMOST
THINK THAT THERE'S
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE
AT THE BACK
OF SURAT KHAN,
WHAT WITH RUSSIA'S
VITAL NEED FOR
OPEN-WATER SEAPORTS,
AMONGST OTHER THINGS.
YOU'LL ACT ONLY
ON ORDERS FROM SIR BENJAMIN.
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, ALSO,
THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE
THERE SHOULD BE
NO INCIDENT
THAT COULD CAUSE
A FRONTIER WAR
AT THIS TIME.
WE MUST MAINTAIN PEACE...
AT ANY COST.

YOU REMEMBER
MAJOR BARRETT.
OH, MAJOR BARRETT.
AND,
LADY PELHAM,
MY WIFE.
LADY PELHAM,
GOOD EVENING.
AND THIS, MY DEAR,
IS COLONEL CAMPBELL,
WHO LEAVES TOMORROW
TO ASSUME COMMAND
OF THE CHUKOTI GARRISON.
COLONEL CAMPBELL,
I AM PLEASED THAT
WE HAVE MET AT LAST.
BENJI,
KINDLY STAY HERE.
MY DEAR,
I WAS JUST GOING--
TO THE REFRESHMENT ROOM
TO GET A DRINK. I KNOW.
THEN YOU'LL BE
UPSET ALL NIGHT.
HERE. TAKE A PILL.
LIFE WITH YOU IS
JUST ONE BLASTED
PILL AFTER ANOTHER--
UH, MY LOVE.
HA HA HA! JUST LIKE
A CHILD--BENJI.
NO IDEA OF WHAT'S
GOOD FOR HIM.
I HEAR YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER,
COLONEL.
YOU MUST LET ME TAKE HER
UNDER MY WING AT ONCE.
ABOUT TO BE MARRIED,
ISN'T SHE?
THAT'S SPLENDID.
YOU MUST LET ME CHOOSE
HER TROUSSEAU.
YOU'RE A WIDOWER,
ARE YOU NOT?
I AM,
LADY WARRENTON.
WELL, I ALWAYS SAY...
BENJI.
YES. I KNOW.
TAKE ANOTHER PILL.
[GEOFF]
ELSA, DARLING.
YOU LOOK SO LOVELY.
I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU
AT THE HOUSE.
[ELSA]
I'M SORRY, TOO, GEOFF.
[GEOFF]
WHY, IT'S BEEN SO LONG,
I HARDLY KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME NOW, THOUGH.
I HATE THESE SEPARATIONS.
[ELSA]
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM,
DID YOU?
[PERRY]
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE.
[ELSA]
HOW I HATE THIS DECEPTION.
[PERRY]
ELSA, DARLING,
THEY'RE WATCHING.
[MAN]
HIS HIGHNESS SURAT KHAN,
AMIR OF SURISTAN.
COUNT IGOR VOLONOFF.
HIS EXCELLENCY
THE WAZIR OF SURISTAN.
THE NAWAB OF DAJAL.
TAKE CHARGE,
MY FRIEND.
I'M ON DUTY.
TAKE CHARGE
OF WHAT?
[WOMAN]
MY! HOW YOU'VE CHANGED.
[RANDALL]
FOR THE BETTER, I HOPE.
[WOMAN]
I ALWAYS LIKED THE CAVALRY.
MAY I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU, SIR?
HMM? CERTAINLY.
SURAT KHAN'S
JUST ARRIVED.
WELL?
HE'S GOT
A COUNT IGOR VOLONOFF
WITH HIM.
AH, VOLONOFF. THAT'S
A JUICY, CLEVER GESTURE.
OSTENTATIOUSLY FLIRTING
WITH RUSSIA, EH?
TWO STRINGS TO HIS BOW.
AH, WELL, WE'LL SEE.
OF COURSE, IT MIGHT BE
JUST A COINCIDENCE.
THE SUN MIGHT RISE
IN THE WEST.
WELL, I'LL FINISH
MY DRINK.
I HAVE
A COWARDLY AVERSION
TO MEETING REPTILES
SOCIALLY
TILL I'VE HAD
AT LEAST ONE SHERRY
AND BITTERS.
GOOD EVENING,
SIR CHARLES,
CAPTAIN VICKERS.
GOOD EVENING,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD,
MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF PRESENTING COUNT VOLONOFF?
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
COUNT VOLONOFF.
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
IT'S VERY PLEASANT,
YOUR HIGHNESS,
TO FIND YOU
IN THESE FRIVOLOUS
SURROUNDINGS.
WELL, SIR CHARLES,
SINCE YOUR KINDLY GOVERNMENT
HAS SPARED ME THE BURDEN
OF DISPENSING ITS ANNUAL
APPRECIATION TO MY COUNTRYMEN,
I AM BLESSED
WITH MORE LEISURE.
AH, WELL,
COME WITH ME.
I'LL PRESENT
SOME REALLY AMUSING
PEOPLE TO YOU.
THERE'S
MY DAUGHTER NOW.
SHE'S ENTRANCING.
ELSA IS A FINE GAL.
AND THE GALLANT
YOUNG CAVALIER
WHO HOLDS HER SO TENDERLY
IN HIS ARMS--
HER FIANCE, OF COURSE.
OH, CERTAINLY NOT.
BUT SHE IS ENGAGED.
YOU SAID SHE--
TO CAPTAIN
GEOFFREY VICKERS
OF THE 27th.
THAT'S MERELY
HIS BROTHER,
A DIPLOMAT OF SORTS,
SECONDED
FROM HIS REGIMENT
FOR DUTY
WITH THE POLITICAL
DEPARTMENT.
OH, DEAR.
HOW SILLY OF ME.
THEY DO SEEM TO BE ENJOYING
EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.
[PERRY]
LET'S GET AWAY FROM HERE, ELSA.
CHARMING...
AND MOTHERLESS.
WELL, AS I ALWAYS SAY,
COLONEL, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
I MUST START LOOKING AROUND
RIGHT AWAY
TO FIND A SUITABLE WIFE
FOR YOU.
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOU MUST BE A LITTLE
MORE GUARDED--
KEEP QUIET, BENJI.
COLONEL CAMPBELL HAS
JUST BEEN BEGGING ME
TO FIND HIM A WIFE.
WHAT PARTICULAR QUALITY DO YOU
MOST ADMIRE IN A WOMAN?
THE QUALITY
OF SILENCE.
NOW, COLONEL,
YOU'RE FLATTERING ME,
JUST AS
DEAR LORD MELVIN DID.
ONCE WHEN WE SAT
NEXT TO EACH OTHER
IN AN INTOLERABLE
GUILDHALL BANQUET,
"LADY WARRENTON,"
HE SAID,
"YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DRIVE MEN MAD."
I CAN BELIEVE THAT.
FORGIVE ME.
WHAT A DULL DOG
THE COLONEL IS.
HASN'T A WORD TO SAY
FOR HIMSELF.
BENJI.
[PERRY]
I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH, ELSA.
YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.
I--I CAN'T STAND
THIS ANY LONGER.
WE'VE GOT TO
FIND A WAY TO TELL
GEOFFREY TONIGHT.
YES, YES.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
WE SHOULDN'T BE SEEN OUT HERE
TOGETHER. YOU KNOW THIS PLACE
IS FULL OF SCANDALMONGERS.
BUT I HAD TO SEE YOU
ALONE.
WE CAN'T GO ON
DECEIVING GEOFFREY
LIKE THIS.
DARLING, I KNOW
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.
HE'S A GREAT FELLOW.
HE'S HUMAN.
IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THAT
WE MUSTN'T HURT HIM ANY MORE
THAN WE CAN HELP.
LET ME TELL HIM
IN MY OWN WAY. AFTER ALL,
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE REALLY FEEL,
HE CAN'T THINK
THAT WE'RE IN THE WRONG.
WRONG?
IT'S ONLY WRONG
IF WE DON'T TELL HIM.
LET'S FACE THE TRUTH.
WE'RE IN LOVE
WITH ONE ANOTHER.
WE ALWAYS WILL BE.
[COLONEL CAMPBELL]
ELSA.
YOU WILL RETURN
TO THE BALLROOM
AT ONCE.
MAY I SAY, SIR--
I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SAY.
THERE CAN BE
NO EXCUSE FOR A MAN
WHO IS SO DISLOYAL
AS TO TRIFLE
WITH THE AFFECTIONS OF
HIS BROTHER'S FIANCEE.
I FORBID YOU
TO EVER SEE OR SPEAK
TO MY DAUGHTER AGAIN.
I AM NOT BEING
DISLOYAL, SIR.
ELSA AND I
LOVE EACH OTHER.
LOVE?
CHEAP INFATUATION.
YOU DESERVE
A GOOD THRASHING.
PERRY...PLEASE GO.
AND AS I DOUBT THAT
YOU HAVE THE COURAGE
TO INFORM YOUR BROTHER
OF THIS TREACHERY,
REST ASSURED
THAT I SHALL TELL HIM.
MY BROTHER KNOWS ME
TOO WELL TO ACCUSE ME
OF TREACHERY, SIR.
ELSA, I'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN BEFORE YOU LEAVE
FOR CHUKOTI.
ONE MOMENT,
CAPTAIN VICKERS.
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'VE BEEN SECONDED
FOR THE POLITICAL
SERVICE,
YOU STILL RETAIN
YOUR ARMY RANK.
WELL, SIR?
THEREFORE, YOU
WILL DO AS I SAY.
IF NOT, I SHALL
HAVE YOU RECALLED
TO ENGLAND
FOR GROSS
INSUBORDINATION.
VERY WELL, SIR.
[CLICKS HEELS]
ELSA, I AM
AT AN ABSOLUTE LOSS
TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR ATTITUDE.
FATHER, I LOVE HIM.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
YOU LOVE?
I SEE.
NOW I UNDERSTAND
THE STRANGENESS
OF YOUR BEHAVIOR
FOR SOME TIME PAST.
BUT YOU
MUST REMEMBER...
THAT YOU LOVED
GEOFFREY WHEN
YOU ACCEPTED HIM.
HE'S BEEN AWAY
A LONG TIME,
AND NOW
THAT HE'S BACK,
YOU MUST REALIZE
THAT THAT LOVE
IS STILL THERE
AND THIS IS
MERELY A PASSING
INFATUATION.
I WISH
YOU WERE RIGHT, FATHER.
I'VE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT
AGAINST IT,
BUT I LOVE HIM.
ELSA, MY DEAR,
I'VE TAKEN CARE
OF YOU
EVER SINCE
YOUR MOTHER DIED.
LET ME KNOW WHAT
IS BEST FOR YOU.
GEOFFREY'S
A SPLENDID FELLOW,
LOVES YOU
WITH ALL HIS HEART.
YOU CAN'T
WANTONLY HURT HIM.
OH, I DON'T WISH
TO HURT GEOFFREY.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T,
MY DARLING.
THERE, NOW.
DRY YOUR EYES.
LET'S FORGET THIS
LITTLE INCIDENT,
AND PROMISE
WHEN YOU MEET HIM
TONIGHT,
YOU'LL TREAT HIM
AS THOUGH NOTHING
HAS HAPPENED.
I'LL TRY, FATHER.
THAT'S A GIRL.
COME.
WILL YOUR HIGHNESS
EXCUSE ME?
WHY, OF COURSE.
SOME BEAUTIFUL
LADY IS WAITING,
NO DOUBT.
YES, NO DOUBT.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
[CLICKS HEELS]
MY GOOD FRIEND
THE GALLANT
CAPTAIN VICKERS
ONCE SAVED MY LIFE,
AND AS YOU KNOW,
IN MY COUNTRY,
SIR CHARLES,
FRIENDSHIP CAN BE
CLAIMED BY FRIENDLY
ACTIONS ALONE.
YES. IN THIS
TREACHEROUS LIFE,
IT'S DIFFICULT
TO KNOW WHICH IS FRIEND
AND WHICH IS FOE.
BUT IN THE END,
ONE FINDS OUT,
AND THE WISE MAN
ACTS ACCORDINGLY.
YES.
AHEM. YES.
ARE YOU STAYING LONG
IN CALCUTTA,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
A FEW DAYS, I FANCY,
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE, UH...
UNLESS WHAT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
I SOMETIMES THINK,
SIR CHARLES,
THAT A GREAT
GOVERNMENT RESEMBLES
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
WHO, INTOXICATED
WITH THE POWER
OF HER OWN BEAUTY,
IS APT TO
WITHDRAW FROM
A SINCERE SUITOR
THE FAVORS SHE'S
ALWAYS GRANTED,
AND WHEN SHE FINDS
THIS SUITOR
CONSOLE HIMSELF
WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY,
REGRETS
HER COLDNESS.
INTERESTING. AND WHAT
DOES SHE DO THEN?
SHE CLAIMS THE PRIVILEGE
OF ANY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
AND CHANGES HER MIND
BEFORE SHE'S LOST
HER SUITOR FOREVER.
DO YOU NOT AGREE?
THE ONLY GREAT GOVERNMENT
I'M ACQUAINTED WITH
IS SINGULARLY MASCULINE.
IT MAKES UP ITS MIND,
AND ONCE HAVING REACHED
A DECISION, ADHERES TO IT.
I'M AFRAID WE'RE
LOSING OURSELVES
IN A FLIGHT
OF FANTASY.
[CHUCKLES]
YES. PERHAPS. YES.
OH, GEOFF.
PERRY, OLD LAD,
HAVE YOU SEEN ELSA?
LADY WARRENTON,
THIS IS MY BROTHER
GEOFFREY.
HOW DO YOU DO?
YOU ARE THE FIANCE
OF THAT EXQUISITE
CHILD. AM I RIGHT?
YOU ARE RIGHT.
CAPITAL.
I CONGRATULATE YOU,
BUT YOU MUST KEEP AN EYE
ON THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE
BROTHER OF YOURS.
I SAW MISS CAMPBELL AND HIM
DANCING TONIGHT.
THE LOOK IN HIS EYE
WAS ANYTHING BUT DIPLOMATIC.
AHA.
BENJI!
MR. VICKERS,
NEVER MARRY A MAN
WITH AN INDIAN LIVER.
LADY WARRENTON,
I WON'T.
BENJI!
THANK HEAVENS.
OH, GEOFFREY,
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
OH, THERE'S ELSA NOW.
WAIT A MINUTE, OLD BOY.
ELSA, DARLING,
I'M SORRY I MISSED
SO MANY DANCES.
YOU KNOW HOW
THESE DIPLOMATIC
AFFAIRS ARE.
SHALL WE DANCE NOW?
I'D LOVE TO.
DO YOU MIND, SIR?
NOT AT ALL.
LOOK AROUND YOU.
WHY?
HERE
IN THIS ONE ROOM,
YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING
THAT MAKES THE WORLD
GO ROUND--
RICHES, INTRIGUE,
AND ALL THE SEEDS
OF MUTINY, WAR,
AND HATRED.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT ALL
MEANS TO ME?
WHAT?
NOTHING.
JUST NOTHING.
YOU'RE
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S REAL HERE.
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT I'M HOLDING YOU
IN MY ARMS
AND THAT...
THAT
YOU'RE SO LOVELY.
OH, GEOFFREY.
ELSA...I LOVE YOU.
[WHISTLING]
HELLO, OLD LAD.
GLAD YOU CAME IN
AND WAITED.
I HAD TO.
MIGHT HAVE MISSED
YOU COMPLETELY.
I'M OFF AGAIN
TOMORROW.
ARE YOU GOING
WITH THE CAMPBELLS
TO CHUKOTI?
NO. WORSE LUCK.
I'M GOING UP
ON THE ARABIAN
FRONTIER
TO BUY A PACK
OF HORSES.
WE NEED PLENTY
OF THEM, YOU KNOW,
AND GOOD ONES.
SOUNDS
LIKE TROUBLE
ON THE BALKANS.
YES. THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO.
I TRIED TO SOUND OUT
OLD MACEFIELD ABOUT IT,
BUT HE CLOSED UP
LIKE AN OYSTER.
HOWEVER, IT MUST BE THAT.
HE TOLD ME TO HURRY,
AND WILL I.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY.
GEOFFREY...I...
I'VE NEVER
THANKED YOU FOR ALL
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.
OH, NONSENSE,
OLD LAD.
YOU'VE BEEN A SUCCESS.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
BUT SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED.
I KNOW
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.
WELL, WHAT?
I'VE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH ELSA.
OH, I'M SORRY, OLD LAD.
HOW ROTTEN FOR YOU.
YES, BUT, GEOFF,
ELSA'S IN LOVE WITH ME.
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I DO, UNFORTUNATELY.
WE TRIED NOT TO.
HONESTLY, WE DID,
GEOFF.
I SEE.
MIGHT I ASK
WHAT YOU INTEND
DOING ABOUT IT?
HAS ELSA TOLD YOU
THAT SHE LOVES YOU?
HAS SHE PROMISED
TO MARRY YOU?
YES, BUT NOT
IN SO MANY WORDS.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU'RE LYING.
THIS IS SPLENDID.
AFTER SNIVELING
TO ME ABOUT HOW
GRATEFUL HE IS,
MY BROTHER COMES
TO ME AND TELLS ME
HE'S STOLEN
THE AFFECTIONS OF
THE ONE PERSON I LOVE
MOST IN THE WORLD.
BUT NOT CONTENT
WITH THAT,
YOU'VE GOT
THE EFFRONTERY TO
COME HERE AND LIE.
YOU CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT.
LIE AND LIE.
LISTEN...
YOU'D BETTER
GET OUT.
TAKE YOUR DIRTY INTRIGUE
SOMEWHERE ELSE,
BUT GET OUT OF MY SIGHT
AND STAY OUT.
VERY WELL,
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU THIS.
I'VE ALWAYS
LOOKED UP TO YOU,
WORSHIPED YOU
AS A KIND OF GOD.
I FIND YOU'RE RATHER
A LITTLE MAN.
AND AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU AND OLD CAMPBELL
AND THE WHOLE BLASTED ARMY
CAN GO TO BLAZES.
OH, GOOD MORNING,
SIR.
OH, GEOFFREY.
EARLY VISIT, HUH?
YES, SIR. I JUST HAD
MY ORDERS, AND I'M
SETTING OUT.
I THOUGHT I'D
COME ALONG AND SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOU.
JUST TO ME?
WELL, SHALL WE SAY
THE FAMILY?
ELSA'S STILL IN HER ROOM,
BUT I'LL CALL HER.
TELL MEMSAHIB SHE'S WANTED
IN THE STUDY IMMEDIATELY.
CAPTAIN VICKERS IS HERE.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN
LANGUAGE]
YOU HAVE
A VERY DIFFICULT JOB
AHEAD OF YOU.
YES, I THINK SO.
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE EQUAL TO IT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
SO GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE, SIR.
COME BACK TO US
SAFELY AND SOON.
THANK YOU.
OH, GEOFFREY.
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR?
ARE YOU LEAVING US
SO SOON?
YES, I'M AFRAID SO.
I SUPPOSE THIS IS
WHAT'S KNOWN
AS THE LUCK
OF THE ARMY.
THEY SHOW YOU
A BRIEF GLIMPSE
OF PARADISE
AND THEN
TAKE IT AWAY.
I SUPPOSE, IN TIME,
I'LL LEARN
TO BE GRATEFUL
FOR EVEN A FEW HOURS
WITH YOU.
HOW LONG WILL YOU
BE AWAY?
OH, A MONTH, TWO MONTHS.
HARD TO SAY.
THERE'S SO MUCH TROUBLE
GOING ON EVERYWHERE,
WE'VE GOT TO BE
READY FOR IT
WHEN IT COMES,
BUT AS SOON AS I
COME BACK THIS TIME,
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THE ARMY
OR ANYTHING ELSE
INTERFERE
WITH OUT HAPPINESS,
OUR MARRIAGE,
ARE WE, DARLING?
OF COURSE NOT,
GEOFFREY.
RIGHT.
IT'S A BARGAIN.
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.
I'LL HURRY BACK
SO FAST.
OH...
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING...
I THINK I OUGHT
TO TELL YOU
BEFORE I GO.
IT'S RATHER SILLY,
BUT LAST NIGHT
AFTER THE BALL,
PERRY
CAME TO SEE ME.
HE'S IN LOVE
WITH YOU.
YOU KNOW, HE'S
QUITE IMPULSIVE,
AND HE SEEMS
TO BE TAKING THIS
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.
I WAS VERY STUPID
ABOUT IT.
I LOST MY TEMPER
COMPLETELY.
NOW, OF COURSE,
I COULD KICK MYSELF,
BUT I DON'T
WANT HIM TO BE HURT
MORE THAN NECESSARY,
YOU KNOW?
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY, GEOFF.
I SHAN'T BE SEEING PERRY
IN ANY CASE.
FATHER'S BEING SENT
TO CHUKOTI,
AND, OF COURSE,
I'LL GO WITH HIM,
AND PERRY
WILL SOON FORGET.
YES, OF COURSE HE WILL.
THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU,
ELSA, TO UNDERSTAND IT
LIKE THAT.
I MUST GO NOW.
THINK OF ME A LITTLE
WHILE I'M AWAY.
I WILL.
GOOD-BYE
AND GOOD LUCK.
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.
THEY'RE MOVING
ALONG FINE.
HOPE WE MISS
THAT STORM
BEHIND US.
HOPE WE MISS
ANY OTHER SORT OF TROUBLE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SIR,
WHY THESE NORTHERN TRIBES
ARE SO HOSTILE.
SINCE TURKEY'S DECLARED WAR
ON RUSSIA,
ALL THESE FELLOWS KNOW
THAT ENGLAND AND FRANCE
ARE BOUND TO COME IN
ON THE SIDE OF TURKEY.
YES. IT'S ALL
VERY COZY.
THESE TRIBESMAN
ARE GOING
TO SYMPATHIZE
WITH THE RUSSIANS.
THAT'S IT,
SO IF WE WANT HORSES,
WE'VE GOT TO PAY
THEIR PRICES...AND LIKE IT.
TROOP, COLUMN LEFT!
RANDALL!
ROUND OUT THAT HERD,
AND LET'S MAKE A START
FOR BATUM.
IT'S 60 MILES TO BATUM.
WE HAND THE HERD
OVER TO THE CAPTAIN
OF THE TRANSPORT FLEET THERE
AND THEN BACK TO INDIA!
THAT'S NOTHING TO BE
SO CHIRPY ABOUT.
YOU'RE DOOMED
TO BE MARRIED SOON,
YOU KNOW.
A MORE PLEASANT DOOM
NEVER FACED
ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN.
THIS SICK SENTIMENT.
YOU OUGHT TO BE
DRUMMED OUT OF THE SERVICE
FOR THAT REMARK.
[MAN]
DON'T MIND
HIM, SIR.
I DON'T.
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?
BE GLAD YOU CAME ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.
IT'S THE SORT OF THING
YOU'D ENJOY--
A REAL PICNIC
WITH EVERYTHING
BUT RED ANTS,
AND I'D RATHER HOPED
FOR SOME ACTION.
[GUNSHOT]
TROOP, HALT!
HERE'S YOUR ACTION.
RANDALL, STAMPEDE THE HERD
THROUGH THAT GORGE.
TROOP, WHEEL MARCH.
GALLOP!
TROOP, DISMOUNT!
TAKE COVER!
GET IN YOUR POSITIONS!
INDEPENDENT FIRE
AS SOON AS YOU'RE UNDER COVER!
[SCREAMING]
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED.
WE CAN'T HOLD ON
MUCH LONGER.
RANDALL, TAKE COMMAND.
IF I'M NOT BACK IN AN HOUR,
TRY TO BREAK THROUGH FOR BATUM.
KEEP FIRING
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
NEVER MIND ABOUT ME.
YOU DO AS I TELL YOU.
HUDSON,
YOU AND BURKE
FOLLOW ME.
YES, SIR.
HERE. FASTEN THIS
TO YOUR POMMEL.
NOW, RIDE OFF DOWN THERE
AND DRAG THIS BUSH
BEHIND YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
TRY TO RAISE ENOUGH DUST
TO MAKE THEM THINK
HALF THE BRITISH ARMY'S
COMING UP TO RELIEVE US.
HURRY!
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
FOLD UP YOUR ARMY.
[MEN]
THEY'RE RUNNING!
[MEN REJOICING]
[MAN]
PEARSON, PEARSON,
THERE'S SOMETHING
TO TELL YOUR
GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT
IF YOU
LIVE LONG ENOUGH.
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
THERE'S A BAD FELLOW!
IT'S MY TURN.
LET ME
HAVE A SHOT
AT HIM.
WAIT TILL HE GETS
ROUND THE ROCK.
HOLD IT. WAIT.
[GUNSHOT]
CAPTAIN VICKERS!
GEOFFREY, AM I
SEEING THINGS?
WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY THINK THERE'S
A RELIEF FORCE
COMING UP
TO SUPPORT US.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
SIR.
THANK HEAVEN
I MISSED YOU.
YEAH. LUCKY
FOR ME YOU WERE
AIMING AT ME.
GOOD MORNING,
GENTLEMEN.
I'M MORE THAN PLEASED
WITH THE BRILLIANT SUCCESS
OF YOUR EXPEDITION.
CONGRATULATIONS,
MAJOR VICKERS.
MAJOR? WHY,
THANK YOU, SIR.
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
IN ORDERS YET.
YOU WILL TOMORROW.
CONGRATULATIONS,
CAPTAIN RANDALL.
THANK YOU, SIR.
SHALL I SEE IT
IN ORDERS, TOO, SIR?
YES, OF COURSE.
SIR.
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE
TO WAIT A BIT, PEARSON,
BUT GOOD WORK
ALL THE SAME.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY
ABOUT GOING BACK
TO CHUKOTI?
WE NEED
SEASONED OFFICERS
UP THERE.
I WOULD LIKE IT IMMENSELY,
PERSONALLY, SIR.
HE'S GOING TO BE
MARRIED SOON, SIR.
SO I UNDERSTAND.
WELL, WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO
ABOUT GETTING YOU
AN EXTENDED LEAVE
LATER ON.
WHY,
THANK YOU, SIR.
WELL, THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN.
PERRY.
[PERRY]
YOU SENT FOR ME, SIR?
PERRY, YES. SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE,
WON'T YOU?
THANK YOU, SIR.
THE VICKERS ARE
AN OLD ARMY FAMILY.
YES, SIR.
I KNEW YOUR FATHER
AT ZANDA, PERRY.
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
GEOFFREY HAVE COME
ALONG ADMIRABLY,
THOUGH AS BROTHERS,
I EXPECT YOU'VE HAD
YOUR LITTLE DIFFERENCES.
HMM?
YOU KNOW,
BROTHERS RARELY AVOID
THESE LITTLE THINGS...
BUT THEY'RE
USUALLY TRIFLES.
TRIFLES, SIR?
CERTAINLY.
DON'T YOU THINK SO?
WELL, THAT IS, IT'S
RATHER DIFFICULT
TO EXPLAIN,
BUT, DON'T YOU
THINK, SIR,
WE'RE ENTITLED
TO SETTLE
OUR OWN PROBLEMS
IN OUR OWN WAY?
YES. YES, PERHAPS SO.
NOW, GOVERNOR GENERAL
DELHAUSSY
REQUIRES THE PRESENCE
OF A POLITICAL MAN
ON THE FRONTIER
TO HANDLE THE SURISTANI
SITUATION.
I'VE SELECTED YOU.
YOU MEAN I'M TO GO
UP TO CHUKOTI, SIR?
NO. YOU'LL BE
STATIONED AT LOHARA.
CHUKOTI WILL BE
THE SPEARHEAD OF ANY
POSSIBLE MILITARY MANEUVERS,
BUT YOUR DUTIES
WILL BE THOSE
OF AN OFFICIAL OBSERVER.
IS THAT FINAL, SIR?
I MEAN, THAT I'M
TO GO UP TO LOHARA?
FINAL. YOU'LL HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TO DO THERE
THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE.
YOU'LL LEAVE
WITH A CARAVAN
IN THE MORNING.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
PERRY. I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
HAVE GONE, OLD LAD.
ELSA CAN'T LOVE
BOTH OF US,
YOU KNOW.
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
WELL, THEN...
LOOK HERE, GEOFFREY.
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET THIS THING SETTLED
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS,
SO WHY PRETEND WE ARE?
ALL THE CARDS
ARE STACKED ON YOUR SIDE--
OLD CAMBPELL'S FOR YOU,
THE FACT THAT YOU
GOT THERE FIRST,
EVERYTHING.
I'VE ONLY ONE CLAIM--
ELSA HAPPENS TO LOVE ME,
AND ONLY ME,
AND AS LONG
AS THAT'S TRUE,
I'M GOING TO FIGHT ANYONE.
PERRY, I KNOW
YOU'RE WRONG.
WE CAN'T LET
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COME BETWEEN US NOW,
AND BESIDES, YOU--
I'LL GET OVER IT.
I KNOW.
WELL, GET THIS
INTO YOUR HEAD.
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
MY OWN MIND AND ELSA'S.
I WOULDN'T
HANG ON TO ANYONE
WHO DIDN'T LOVE ME. I--
[MAN]
THIS IS WHERE WE
TURN OFF FOR CHUKOTI. VICKERS!
COMING.
PERRY, OLD LAD--
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO SAY.
[MAN]
TROOP, COLUMN LEFT!
[BUGLING]
[MAN SHOUTING ORDERS]
EYES LEFT.
HALT!
REPORTING OUR RETURN
FROM CALCUTTA, SIR.
GOOD, MAJOR VICKERS.
ANY CASUALTIES?
YES, SIR.
ONE MAN WOUNDED.
WE WERE FIRED ON
SEVERAL TIMES,
BUT WE EXPECTED THAT.
DID YOU RETURN FIRE?
NO, SIR.
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS
ARE TO MAINTAIN PEACE.
PRETTY DIFFICULT ORDERS
TO FOLLOW, SIR,
PARTICULARLY WHEN
THEY'RE FIRING ON US.
YES. WHEN YOU'VE
BEEN SOLDIERING
AS LONG AS I HAVE,
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IT'S BEST TO FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDLESS.
YES, SIR.
BY THE WAY,
IT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL
FOR AN OFFICER
TO APPEAR BEFORE HIS
COMMANDANT'S DAUGHTER
IN SUCH A CONDITION.
RUN ALONG
AND CLEAN UP
AND COME BACK
TO MY OFFICE.
YES, SIR.
TROOP,
FACE LEFT ABOUT!
WALK MARCH!
ASK MISS CAMPBELL
TO COME TO MY OFFICE
IMMEDIATELY.
HALT!
FALL OUT THE OFFICERS.
PREPARE TO DISMOUNT!
DISMOUNT!
DISMISSED.
CAPTAIN SAHIB!
PREMA!
UP YOU GO.
THANK YOU, SAHIB.
LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU BACK
A NEW SALUTE.
WATCH.
HOW DO YOU DO IT?
LIKE THIS.
TRY IT ON THE GENERAL.
WELL, MISS CAMPBELL
LEFT WITH THE FIRST PATROL
THIS MORNING, SIR.
CONFOUND IT!
WELL, UH, YES.
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL.
WHY DIDN'T ELSA
TELL ME OF THIS?
THAT GIRL'S
A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO ME. OUTRAGEOUS!
SHE KNEW
PERFECTLY WELL YOU
WERE ARRIVING TODAY.
PARDON, SIR?
ELSA LEFT FOR LOHARA
THIS MORNING.
LADY WARRENTON
MIGHT BE ILL, SIR.
SHE MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR HER.
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF,
AND WHAT IF SHE WERE?
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.
[LADY WARRENTON]
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME--
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY.
A NICE CUP OF HOT TEA
WILL REALLY REFRESH YOU,
MY DEAR.
I'LL NEVER FORGET MY
APPALLING HONEYMOON TRIP
WITH DARLING BENJI.
YOU REMEMBER, DEAR?
BENJI!
YES, DEAR? BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE, DEAR.
HERE'S SOME NICE COLD WATER
TO TAKE WITH YOUR PILL.
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
DRINK A LITTLE TOAST
TO OUR DELIGHTFUL GUEST.
KEEP ME AWAKE ALL NIGHT?
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN.
I HOPE
YOU AND SIR BENJAMIN
DIDN'T MIND MY COMING
UNINVITED LIKE THIS.
CERTAINLY NOT.
DELIGHTED.
MIND?
WE'RE ENCHANTED.
BY THE WAY, HOW IS THAT
RAVISHINGLY HANDSOME
FIANCE OF YOURS?
YOUNG VICKERS.
DUE HERE TODAY.
NO, BENJI,
YOU'RE ALL MUDDLED.
ELSA IS ENGAGED
TO THE OTHER BROTHER,
GODFREY.
GEOFFREY, DEAR.
SOME CAKE?
NO, THANK YOU.
SO THE BROTHER IS COMING.
WELL, WELL, WELL.
THAT IS A COINCIDENCE.
MY DEAR, YOU REMEMBER
THE APPALLING BALL
IN CALCUTTA?
WELL, I WAS CONVINCED
THAT YOU AND HE WERE, UH...
SO TO SPEAK.
[SIR BENJAMIN]
PAY NO ATTENTION TO
MY WIFE, MISS CAMPBELL.
SHE HAS TWO OBSESSIONS
IN LIFE--
GIVING ME PILLS
AND SCANDALOUS INTRIGUE.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SAHIB.
THANK YOU.
LADY WARRENTON.
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
VICKERS.
SIR BENJAMIN.
ELSA! WHY,
THIS IS A SURPRISE.
HOW ARE YOU, PERRY?
[SIR BENJAMIN]
GOOD TRIP,
MY BOY?
DON'T BE ABSURD, BENJI.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A GOOD TRIP IN INDIA.
ONE EITHER TRAVELS IN
COMPARATIVE DISCOMFORT
OR IN COMPLETE DISCOMFORT.
MINE WAS COMPLETE.
YOU TWO CHILDREN
WANT TO BE ALONE, I KNOW.
YOU MUST TELL ELSA
ALL ABOUT GODFREY.
GEOFFREY, DEAR.
ALL ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,
THOUGH, WHY YOU'RE NOT
GREEN WITH JEALOUSY OF HIM
FOR ANNEXING THIS ADORABLE
CREATURE, I CAN'T IMAGINE.
COME, BENJI.
OH, PLEASE DON'T
DISTURB YOURSELF,
LADY WARRENTON.
ELSA AND I
WILL TAKE A STROLL.
SHALL WE?
YES.
NO, NO, NO.
NOT OUT THERE.
NOT ON THE VERANDA.
THERE. IN
THE SUMMER HOUSE...
WHERE THE BIRDS
ARE SINGING
AND THE FLOWERS
ARE BURGEONING.
ACROSS THE VERANDA
AND DOWN THE WALK.
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOUR CONSTANT INNUENDOS
ARE INTOLERABLE.
YOU FULLY EMBARRASSED
YOUNG VICKERS
AND THE CAMPBELL GIRL,
NOT TO MENTION ME.
WHY CAN'T YOU RESIST
POKING YOUR NOSE
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S
PRIVATE AFFAIRS?
IS NOTHING SACRED
TO YOU?
YES, BENJI, DEAR.
YOUR LIVER.
IT'S WONDERFUL OF YOU
TO COME HERE LIKE THIS.
WHEN I SAW YOU JUST NOW,
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
POSSIBLE.
WHY DID YOU
TAKE SUCH A RISK?
I HAD TO.
I'VE TRIED TO FORCE MYSELF
TO FORGET YOU.
I'VE EVEN TRIED
TO HATE YOU,
BUT I LOVE YOU.
I ALWAYS HAVE,
AND I ALWAYS SHALL.
DARLING.
POOR FATHER.
YOU SEE, HE'S RIGHT
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.
HE MADE ME PROMISE
TO TRY TO GET OVER IT.
I DID TRY...
FOR THREE MONTHS,
BUT I FAILED,
SO I THREW AWAY
ALL COMMON SENSE
AND CAME HERE TO YOU
TO MAKE SURE THAT--
THAT YOU'RE READY
TO FACE EVERYTHING WITH ME.
MY LOVE FOR YOU
IS EVEN STRONGER,
MORE A PART OF ME
THAN EVER.
I WAS SURE OF IT.
TOMORROW I MUST GO
BACK TO CHUKOTI
AND TELL
FATHER AND GEOFFREY
THAT WHATEVER HAPPINESS
THERE IS IN ME TO GIVE
MUST BE GIVEN TO YOU.
PARADES, LEFT!
TROOP, HALT!
[BUGLING]
STABLES. COMING?
PARADE LEFT,
COLUMN LEFT. MARCH!
REPORT THE RETURN
OF THE CONVOY, SIR.
VERY GOOD.
SIR BENJAMIN'S
COMPLIMENTS, SIR.
YOU'VE HAD A SCRAP.
WE WERE FIRED UPON
BY THE SURISTANIS
IN KOHRUD PASS.
WELL, YOU HAD
YOUR ORDERS?
YES, SIR. MY PATROL
WITHDREW IN GOOD ORDER,
BUT WE LOST A MAN--
LANCER WENTWORTH.
WENTWORTH?
THAT'S ALL, BARCLAY.
ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL, SIR. THE KHAN--
THAT IS, IF I MAY...
YES, OF COURSE.
GO ON.
WELL, YOU SEE, SIR, WE RAN
ACROSS A CARAVAN COMING
DOWN FROM THE PASS.
THERE WAS A HINDU MERCHANT.
HE'D JUST BEEN
TO VISIT THE SURISTANIS,
AND HE HAS IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT THE SURISTANIS ARE
PREPARING FOR AN ATTACK.
AN ATTACK?
YES, SIR.
ON CHUKOTI.
OH, COME,
COME, NOW, BARCLAY.
THE KHAN WOULDN'T DARE.
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
SOLDIERS...
OLD WOMEN, THAT'S WHAT.
I FEEL
THAT BARCLAY'S
INFORMATION
IS ACCURATE, SIR.
WHAT, YOU ALSO?
ALL RIGHT.
PRESUMING IT IS.
WHY THIS GARRISON?
WHY CHUKOTI?
ANSWER ME THAT, VICKERS.
THE KHAN'S
WISE ENOUGH
TO KNOW, SIR,
THAT AN ATTACK
ON CHUKOTI NOW
WILL IGNITE
THE ENTIRE FRONTIER.
WHY,
THE INFERNAL SCOUNDREL.
THEN HE MUST KNOW
THE HOME GOVERNMENT'S
FEELINGS ABOUT A BORDER WAR.
THAT'S IT EXACTLY, SIR.
ALSO THE FACT THAT
ENGLAND'S ABOUT TO
GO TO WAR WITH RUSSIA.
ATTACK NOW, SIR.
STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW,
AND YOU'LL CRUSH HIM.
VICKERS,
YOU WILL PARADE YOUR MEN
IN FULL MARCHING ORDER,
READY TO MOVE OFF
AT ONCE.
YES, SIR.
[BUGLING]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GOOD-BYE, MARY.
COMPANY...MARCH!
TROOPS ARE READY
TO MOVE OFF, SIR.
[CAMPBELL]
STAND AT EASE, GENTLEMEN.
I HAVE RECEIVED
THE FOLLOWING FROM
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS--
"TO THE OFFICER
COMMANDING CHUKOTI
GARRISON,
"UPON RECEIPT
OF THIS ORDER,
"YOU WILL DISPATCH
ALL AVAILABLE MEN
UNDER YOUR COMMAND
TO BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS,
LOHARA, TO TAKE PART
IN MANEUVERS."
MANEUVERS?
AT THIS TIME, SIR?
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS, VICKERS.
HE KNOWS MORE OF THE SITUATION
THAN WE DO.
MAJOR JOWETT,
YOU WILL BE IN COMMAND
OF THE TROOPS.
CAPTAIN CARY,
CORNET GORDON,
CORNET BARCLAY
WILL GO WITH YOU.
THE REST OF YOU
WILL REMAIN
IN THE GARRISON.
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS
FROM SIR BENJAMIN.
THAT'S ALL, GENTLEMEN.
BEG YOUR PARDON,
SIR.
YES. WHAT IS IT?
SENDING THE MEN OFF
TO LOHARA
ON MANEUVERS NOW
LEAVES US WITH
HARDLY ONE COMPANY
OF INFANTRY HERE.
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S
STRATEGIC TO PUT ON
A DISPLAY OF FORCE
FOR THE SURISTANI
TRIBES.
MORE EFFECTIVE
THAN BULLETS.
BUT THAT LEAVES
CHUKOTI ALMOST
ENTIRELY UNDEFENDED.
BOLDNESS. THAT, MY BOY,
IS THE ESSENCE
OF STRATEGY.
BUT THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN, SIR.
JOWETT'S WIFE
AND CHILD, ELSA,
THE SEPOYS'
FAMILIES.
NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT.
WE HAVE PLENTY OF MEN
LEFT HERE
TO DEFEND THEM.
WE HAVEN'T
ENOUGH MEN LEFT.
YOU CAN'T TAKE--
MAJOR VICKERS,
YOU'VE HAD YOUR ORDERS.
I'VE HAD MINE.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
FORWARD MARCH!
ELSA.
OH, IT'S YOU,
GEOFFREY.
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STARTLE YOU.
YOU LOOKED
VERY FAR AWAY
JUST THEN.
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING OF?
OF A PEACEFUL
COUNTRYSIDE,
OF SOFT GREEN DOWNS
ROLLING TO A BLUE SEA.
I KNOW. ENGLAND.
NO HOT, BURNING SUN.
NO ETERNAL TREACHERY
WAITING
FOR THE UNKNOWN.
ENGLAND.
IN EARLY SPRINGTIME.
ASCOT, CRICKET,
PUNTING
ON THE THAMES.
WE'LL SEE ALL THAT
TOGETHER ONE DAY.
JUST NOW IT...
SEEMS RATHER LIKE
AN INTANGIBLE DREAM.
LITTLE LIKE YOU,
ELSA.
YOU SEE...
I WAS RATHER HOPING
YOU'D BE HERE
WHEN I GOT BACK.
I WAS AT LOHARA.
YES, I KNOW.
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME.
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I HAD TO FIND OUT,
SOMETHING
I HAD TO BE SURE OF
BEFORE I SAW YOU.
YOU FOUND OUT?
YES.
GEOFFREY, YOU WANT
TO MAKE ME HAPPY?
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD.
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
EVERYTHING.
I CAME
BACK FROM LOHARA
DETERMINED TO
TELL YOU THAT--
[BULLET RICOCHETS]
MAJOR SAHIB!
MAJOR SAHIB!
MAJOR SAHIB!
TOWER GUARD SHOT!
SURISTANI.
MAJOR SAHIB.
SOUND THE ALARM!
TURN OUT THE GUARD
DOUBLE QUICK!
VICKERS,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WE'RE BEING
ATTACKED, SIR.
SURISTANI?
YES, SIR.
CONCENTRATE
YOUR STRENGTH
ON THE MAIN GATE.
SEND 15 MEN
TO THE EAST WALL.
ORDERLY!
OPEN FIRE AS SOON AS
YOU'RE WITHIN RANGE!
CORNET!
YES, SIR!
TAKE 15 MEN
AND MOUNT
THE EAST WALL!
[BABY CRYING]
RAPID FIRE!
WE'RE LOSING
TOO MANY MEN, SIR!
YES. WE'RE HOPELESSLY
OUTNUMBERED.
WE'D BETTER ABANDON
THE WALL BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.
THE BARRACKS, SIR.
WE CAN HOLD THEM OFF
FROM THERE
AND GET THEM AS
THEY COME OVER THE WALL.
GIVE ORDERS
TO ABANDON THE WALL.
BUGLER, SOUND THE RETREAT.
TAKE COVER IN THE BARRACKS, MEN!
TAKE COVER IN THE BARRACKS!
QUICK, MEN!
GET ALL YOUR WOUNDED
TO THE MEDICAL OFFICER!
GET THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS!
[GEOFFREY]
BARRICADE THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS!
ELSA, GET ALL
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AWAY FROM THE LINE
OF THE WINDOWS, QUICK.
[WOMAN SHOUTS]
MAMA!
RANDALL!
YES, HERE.
TAKE SIX MEN
AND REINFORCE THE REAR.
ISSUE MORE AMMUNITION
ALL AROUND. QUICK.
YES, SIR. FIRST SIX MEN,
FOLLOW ME.
THIS WAY. HURRY!
HOLD THESE WINDOWS
AND COVER AN ATTACK
FROM THE STABLES.
MAKE EVERY SHOT TELL,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
AMMUNITIONEER,
READY TO INTERCHANGE RIFLES.
VICKERS,
HOW MUCH AMMUNITION
HAVE WE LEFT?
PLENTY, SIR.
THAT'S THE LEAST
OF OUR TROUBLES.
IT'S WATER THAT'S
THE MAIN PROBLEM, SIR.
WATER AND THIS HEAT.
WE'VE GOT TO REACH
JOWETT AT LOHARA.
SOMEONE'S GOT TO
GET THROUGH TO THEM.
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE.
THE MOON'S GOING
BEHIND SOME CLOUDS.
NOW, DON'T FORGET.
WHEN YOU REACH
THE RIVER,
CUT A NATIVE BOAT
LOOSE,
AND THE CURRENT
WILL CARRY YOU DOWN
TO LOHARA.
THAT'S
EASY ENOUGH, SIR.
I'LL HAVE THE TROOPS
BACK IN NO TIME.
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
NOW, WITH
ANY LUCK AT ALL,
YOU SHOULD GET OVER.
THERE'S
VERY FEW MARKSMEN
HOLDING THE WALL.
LOOKS PRETTY CLEAR.
YES.
GEOFFREY, LOOK.
YOU WOULDN'T MIND
GIVING THIS
TO MY FAMILY
JUST IN CASE?
LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY CHEAP ONE.
DOES IT GO?
IF YOU WIND IT UP.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT BACK
TO YOU TOMORROW.
THANKS, OLD PAL.
GOOD LUCK.
COME, MY BOY.
OVER YOU GO.
GOD BE WITH YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.
[GEOFFREY]
YOU READY?
YEAH.
HE'S OVER THE WALL.
IN THIS CHANGING MOON,
THE KHAN WON'T DARE
TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTACK.
THANK GOD FOR HIS
EVERLASTING MERCY.
YOU LOOK
AS THOUGH
YOU COULD DO
WITH
A FEW HOURS'
SLEEP, SIR.
OH, YES.
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.
SUN'S UP, SIR.
YES.
WE CAN'T HOLD OUT
MUCH LONGER, SIR.
[MAN]
MAJOR VICKERS, SIR. LOOK.
THEY'RE GONE.
THEY'RE GONE, SIR.
[GUNSHOT]
PEARSON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU MAD?
BUT DON'T YOU
SEE THEM?
THEY'RE COMING
OVER THE WALL.
THEY'RE
COMING THROUGH
THE COMPOUND.
I CAN'T STOP THEM.
SHUT UP! STOP!
I--I--I--
SHUT UP!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
OLD FELLA.
PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER.
I'M SORRY, SIR.
[SOBS]
THE WALLS ARE
ALL DESERTED, SIR.
THAT'S VERY STRANGE.
POSSIBLY SOME SORT
OF A TRICK.
RUN UPSTAIRS
AND LOOK AROUND
CAREFULLY.
WHITE FLAG, SIR.
WHAT?
THEY'RE COMING
TOWARDS US NOW
OVER THE HILL.
WHAT THE DEVIL
ARE THEY UP TO NOW?
WE'LL SOON SEE.
REMOVE THE BARRICADE.
OPEN THAT DOOR.
HIS HIGHNESS,
SURAT KHAN,
AMIR OF SURISTAN,
SENDS GREETINGS
TO HIS EXCELLENCY
THE COMMANDANT
OF CHUKOTI
AND HUMBLY
PROPOSES A TRUCE,
WITH A REQUEST
THAT YOU WILL SEND
MAJOR VICKERS
TO DISCUSS
THE TERMS.
EXCELLENT.
HE'S PROBABLY MISSED
A BOAT FROM ITS MOORINGS
AND SUSPECTS OUR MAN
GOT THROUGH
AND IS READY
TO TREAT WITH US.
I'D BETTER GO, SIR.
YES, OF COURSE.
WE ACCEPT HIS HIGHNESS'
SUGGESTION
ONLY ON THE CONDITION
THAT WE HOLD YOU
AS HOSTAGE
PENDING MAJOR VICKERS'
SAFE RETURN.
I'M SURE HIS HIGHNESS
WILL BE GRACIOUSLY
PLEASED
AND WILL UNDERSTAND
YOUR NATURAL CAUTION.
VERY WELL.
YOU'LL ACCOMPANY ME
AS ORDERLY.
YES, SIR.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
I WELCOME YOU,
MAJOR VICKERS.
MAY THE GODS
OF COURAGE AND WISDOM
CONTINUE TO BESTOW
THEIR BLESSINGS ON YOU.
YOUR HIGHNESS,
I MUST SUGGEST
YOU COME STRAIGHT
TO THE POINT.
REALLY?
YOU PROBABLY KNOW
BY NOW THAT WORD
HAS REACHED LOHARA,
AND THE ENTIRE
BRIGADE'S
ON ITS WAY HERE.
HOW INTERESTING.
OH, IT PAINS ME
DEEPLY
TO HAVE TO DISILLUSION
YOU ON THAT SCORE.
IF IT'S THAT SEPOY
YOU MEAN--
YES.
CAPTAIN RANDALL.
OH, SO IT WAS
CAPTAIN RANDALL
WHO SO IMPRUDENTLY
ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE
THE LINES.
POOR FELLOW.
HE PAID THE PENALTY
FOR HIS FOOLISHNESS.
HE'S...HE'S DEAD?
OH, MY FRIEND,
LIFE IS SWEET AND DEAR
WHEN ONE CANNOT HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY I SENT
FOR YOU.
I'M OFFERING YOU
YOUR LIFE.
MY LIFE. WHY?
YOU SAVED MINE,
AND I SHALL NEVER
FORGET IT.
YOU WILL BE GIVEN
A HORSE AND SAFE CONDUCT--
YOUR HIGHNESS,
UP TILL NOW
THE HOME GOVERNMENT
HAS CHOSEN
TO DISREGARD
SUNDRY UNFRIENDLY
ACTS OF YOURS.
BY WITHDRAWING
YOUR FORCES NOW,
YOU'LL BE MAKING
A FRIENDLY GESTURE
WHICH WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY LEAD
TO THE REOPENING
OF NEGOTIATIONS
IN CALCUTTA.
YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING
A SINGLE OUTPOST.
YOU'RE FIGHTING
THE ENTIRE
BRITISH ARMY.
YOUR LOGIC,
MY DEAR MAJOR,
IS OVERWHELMING.
NO, MY FRIEND.
I DO NOT THINK
YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE
THAT I'LL ACCEPT
YOUR OPTIMISTIC
SUGGESTIONS.
AFTER ALL, HAVE YOU
NOT AN ENGLISH PROVERB
TO THE EFFECT
THAT POSSESSION
IS 9/10 OF THE LAW?
THEN I TAKE IT
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO BE SAID.
ON THE CONTRARY,
IF WE ARE OPEN
AND HONEST
WITH ONE ANOTHER,
THIS MATTER CAN BE
SETTLED REASONABLY.
ANY SUGGESTION
YOU MAKE MUST
GUARANTEE THE SAFETY
OF THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.
THEN THE OBVIOUS
SOLUTION WOULD BE
AN EVACUATION.
EVACUATION?
YOU MEAN SURRENDER?
HARDLY. I AM
PERFECTLY WILLING
TO GRANT THE GARRISON
A SAFE ESCORT
TO LOHARA.
WHY, I'VE EVERY
REASON TO SUPPOSE
THAT WILL BE
PERFECTLY
SATISFACTORY.
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
IN ENGLAND,
I LEARNED YOUR CHARMING
CUSTOM OF SHAKING HANDS,
SIGNIFYING THE COMPLETION
OF A BARGAIN
BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN.
OF COURSE, THE GARRISON
WILL HAVE TO LAY DOWN
ITS ARMS.
WHAT? BUT WHY?
AS A FRIENDLY GESTURE.
THAT'S UTTERLY
IMPOSSIBLE.
IT PLACES US
ENTIRELY
AT YOUR MERCY.
AHEM. WE UNDERSTAND
THEIR FEELINGS,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
VERY WELL, THEN.
WITH ARMS.
I'M SORRY.
I WON'T AGREE
TO YOUR TERMS
UNDER ANY CONDITIONS
WHATEVER.
TAKE MY OFFER
TO YOUR COMMANDANT.
THE DECISION IS HIS.
IF MY TERMS
ARE ACCEPTABLE,
INSTRUCT YOUR COLONEL
TO RAISE THE WHITE FLAG.
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THE BRITISH
NEVER SURRENDER,
YET THEIR GUNS WILL
BE USELESS TO THEM,
IF I MAY ADVISE
YOUR HIGHNESS.
I SUSPECTED YOU HAD
A PLAN.
PRECISELY.
IF COLONEL CAMPBELL
ACCEPTS OUR TERMS--
AND HE WOULD BE
EXCEEDINGLY UNWISE
NOT TO--
IT WOULD BE
VERY SIMPLE.
I WISH YOU'D
THINK IT OVER
AGAIN, SIR.
I FEEL
WE'RE MAKING
A GRAVE MISTAKE
IN ACCEPTING
THE KHAN'S TERMS.
IT PUTS US ENTIRELY
AT HIS MERCY.
WELL, WE'RE PRACTICALLY
AT HIS MERCY ALREADY.
I'M SURE YOU'RE
QUITE MISTAKEN
IN YOUR SUSPICIONS.
CAN YOU GIVE ME
ANY TANGIBLE REASON?
NO, SIR, EXCEPT
THAT THEY OFFERED ME
A HORSE
AND A SAFE CONDUCT
FOR MYSELF ONLY.
NO, I SEE NO REASON
TO MISTRUST HIM.
BESIDES,
I'VE GOT TO THINK OF
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
THAT'S JUST IT, SIR.
WE CAN'T TRUST HIM.
WELL, WE'VE GOT TO
GO THROUGH WITH IT.
ALL RIGHT, GET TO THE FIRST
AND SECOND BOAT THERE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GET THE PEOPLE
LOADED INTO THE BOATS
AS SOON AS YOU CAN,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
AND YOU TAKE
THE LEADING BOAT
TO LOHARA.
PUT THAT STRETCHER
ON THE RAFT THERE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[BABY CRIES]
CAREFUL! DON'T
OVERLOAD THAT BOAT!
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SCREAMING]
OUT OF THE BOATS.
QUICKLY, NOW!
MASSACRE!
HE'S SAFE.
MY DEBT TO MAJOR VICKERS
IS PAID.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
DRIVE THE REST OF THEM
BACK INTO THE GARRISON!
DOES IT FEEL
BETTER NOW?
YES, MUCH.
THANK YOU.
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TRUSTED HIM.
THOSE POOR
LITTLE KIDS.
HORRIBLE.
WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO THEM?
HE CAN'T MURDER
THEM ALL.
NO. THAT WOULD
BE TOO MUCH,
EVEN FOR
THE KHAN.
HE'LL HOLD THEM
AS HOSTAGES.
THAT'S WHY WE'VE
GOT TO GET TO
LOHARA FOR HELP.
IT'S
OUR ONLY HOPE.
LOOK.
IT'S OUR CHANCE.
"...BEEN OUR REFUGE
FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER.
"THOU TURNEST MEN
TO DESTRUCTION.
AGAIN THOU SAYEST, COME AGAIN,
YE CHILDREN OF MEN..."
[MAN SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
"THE DAYS OF OUR AGE
ARE 3 SCORE YEARS AND 10,
"AND THOUGH MEN BE SO STRONG
"THAT THEY COME
TO FOURSCORE YEARS,
"YET IS THEIR STRENGTH
THEN BUT LABOR AND SORROW,
"SO SOON PASSETH IT AWAY
AND WE ARE GONE.
TURN THEE AGAIN, O LORD..."
[SHOUTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
MAJOR VICKERS!
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?
WELL, WHERE
DID THIS HAPPEN?
JUST NOW, SIR,
DOWN BY THE RIVER
AT THE NORTH GATE.
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF ALL THIS?
MISS CAMPBELL!
GEOFFREY!
ALI!
TELL LADY WARRENTON
MISS CAMPBELL
NEEDS HER HELP AT ONCE.
MY DEAR.
GO WITH CATARO.
SHE'LL TAKE YOU TO
MY WIFE AT ONCE.
GEOFFREY, MY BOY,
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
HOW ON EARTH
DID IT HAPPEN?
CHUKOTI, SIR.
THE SURISTANIS
ATTACKED.
HOT WATER AND CLOTHES.
GET SMELLING SALTS.
MY POOR, POOR CHILD!
I THOUGHT
THE BEST THING
WE COULD DO
WOULD BE TO TRY
AND REACH HERE
FOR HELP.
CHANCES ARE, WE WILL
GET THERE IN TIME?
YES, IF WE HURRY.
CAPTAIN BARNES.
REQUEST MAJOR JOWETT
TO REPORT TO ME
AT ONCE
AND SOUND ASSEMBLY.
VERY GOOD, SIR.
THE KHAN MUST BE
HOLDING THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.
YES, AS HOSTAGES,
OF COURSE.
WE'VE NO TIME
TO SPARE.
PACK THE SEPOYS
IN THEIR OWN
TRANSPORT WAGONS.
WE'LL BRING THEM
ALONG WITH US.
GEOFFREY, YOU GET
YOUR ARM ATTENDED TO
AT ONCE.
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.
DO YOU MIND
IF I COME ALONG?
NO, OLD LAD.
WE'LL NEED YOU.
HALT!
THAT'S STRANGE!
THE WHITE FLAG'S
STILL FLYING.
THERE ARE NO
SENTRIES ABOUT.
SHOWS EVERY SIGN
OF BEING DESERTED.
WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF IT?
WHO KNOWS, SIR?
MAJOR JOWETT?
TAKE FORWARD A DETAIL
IN SKIRMISHING ORDER.
VERY GOOD, SIR.
THE LAST SIX SECTIONS
DISMOUNT
AND ADVANCE
IN SKIRMISHING ORDER!
I WONDER IF
THIS IS ANOTHER OF
THE KHAN'S TRICKS.
FIRE A SHOT.
[GUNSHOT]
NO SIGN OF LIFE.
TROOP, FORWARD. GALLOP!
OH, YARA! PREMA!
MEZANTI!
THERE SHE IS
ON THE STEPS, SIR.
NAN!
JOHN.
[CRYING]
YARA...
YARA, COME.
THEY'RE DEAD! THEY'RE ALL DEAD!
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME?
THEY'RE DEAD, I TELL YOU!
THEY'RE DEAD! GONE!
PREMA!
PREMA!
PREMA!
PREMA!
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
PREMA.
MY LITTLE BOY'S
GUN.
HE WANTED A GUN
TO KILL SURISTANI.
SURISTANI KILL HIM.
PREMA, MY BABY.
DO YOU HEAR ME, PREMA?
PREMA!
COLONEL CAMPBELL,
SIR,
UP OVER THE WALL.
SO THAT'S WHY
THEY ABANDONED CHUKOTI.
WE'VE GOT TO FOLLOW
SURAT KHAN.
HE CAN'T BE FAR OFF.
IMPOSSIBLE.
THEY'RE MOUNTAIN FIGHTERS.
WE DON'T STAND A GHOST
OF A CHANCE AGAINST THEM
IN THE HILLS.
BUT WE CAN'T STAND HERE
DOING NOTHING!
BY HEAVEN, WE'LL NEVER REST
TILL HE'S BEEN MADE
TO PAY FOR THIS.
INDIA WILL BE TOO SMALL
TO HOLD HIM.
[MAN]
THESE BOOKS WANT TO BE STORED
AND THE CASES
MADE READY FOR TRANSPORT.
[MAN]
AND ALL THE OFFICIAL PAPERS
IN THIS BOX HERE.
YOU'LL REPORT
TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
ON ARRIVAL AT BALAKLAVA.
GOOD LUCK, WATSON.
THANK YOU,
SIR.
MAJOR VICKERS,
SIR.
OH, GEOFFREY,
MY BOY.
REPLACEMENTS
FOR THE 27th HAVE
REPORTED FOR DUTY, SIR.
GOOD, THEN YOU'RE READY
TO EMBARK.
NEVER BEEN TO THE CRIMEA,
HAVE YOU, GEOFFREY?
THEY TELL ME IT'S
A PESTILENTIAL HOLE.
SEEMS VERY STRANGE
TO ME, SIR,
THAT THE WAR OFFICE
SHOULD BE SENDING
THE 27th TO SEBASTOPOL
TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS.
POOR DEVILS,
HAVEN'T THEY BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY
AT CHUKOTI?
THE RUSSIANS?
PEOPLES DON'T WAGE WAR
AGAINST OTHER PEOPLES,
GEOFFREY.
ENGLAND IS FIGHTING
THE TYRANNY OF THE CZAR.
THE 27th LANCERS
ARE FIGHTING SURAT KHAN.
SURAT KHAN.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU
TO KNOW THAT AFTER
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,
SURAT KHAN FLED.
YES, I KNEW THAT, SIR.
INDIA WAS TOO HOT
TO HOLD HIM.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT
HAPPENS TO KNOW
THAT HE TOOK REFUGE
WITH THE RUSSIANS
AND IS WITH THEIR FORCES
AT SEBASTOPOL.
THIS IS WORTH KNOWING.
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY THE 27th LANCERS
HAVE BEEN ORDERED
TO SEBASTOPOL.
EVERY MAN WILL HAVE
A CHANCE FOR VINDICATION,
NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF
AND FOR HIS REGIMENT,
BUT FOR EVERY SEPOY
IN INDIA.
NOW, YOU BETTER
GET ALONG, GEOFFREY.
YOU HAVEN'T TOO MUCH TIME
TO GET YOUR KIT READY.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YES. COME IN.
WHY, ELSA.
GEOFFREY,
I HAD TO COME.
WHY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?
PERRY IS GONE.
GONE? WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?
TO THE CRIMEA.
HE WAS ORDERED
BACK TO HIS REGIMENT,
AND HE SAILED TWO DAYS AGO
WITH SIR BENJAMIN
ON THE FIRST TRANSPORT.
OH, GEOFFREY,
HE'LL BE KILLED.
I KNOW HE WILL.
YOU LOVE HIM,
DON'T YOU?
I DO.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
A LONG TIME?
I THINK,
SINCE THE FIRST DAY
I MET HIM.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU
THAT DAY WHEN I CAME
BACK FROM LOHARA.
YOU NEEDN'T EXPLAIN.
I THINK I'VE KNOW IT,
REALLY, IN MY HEART...
FOR SOME TIME.
I'M SORRY, GEOFFREY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHY, IT CAN'T BE HELPED.
QUITE A NATURAL THING.
HE'S A GRAND LAD, ELSA.
HE'LL MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY.
YOU'LL BE GOING
BACK TO ENGLAND,
I SUPPOSE.
YES. I THINK SO.
OH, YOU'RE LUCKY.
WISH I COULD GO, TOO.
WELL, I MUST FINISH
THIS STUFF UP.
GEOFFREY, ARE YOU GOING
OUT TO THE CRIMEA, TOO?
YES. LEAVING
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
MAY I HELP YOU PACK?
OH, NO, THANKS.
I'VE BEEN GIVING MYSELF
A CRICK IN THE BACK
ALL THE MORNING AS IT IS.
ELSA, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT PERRY.
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE THAT HE IS.
GOOD-BYE...
AND BLESS YOU...
BOTH OF YOU.
GEOFFREY, WILL YOU
TAKE HIM A MESSAGE?
WHY, YES.
TELL HIM...
THAT I THINK HIS BROTHER...
IS THE FINEST MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.
SIR CHARLES
MACEFIELD'S
COMPLIMENTS
TO GENERAL SCOTT.
THERE ARE
NO NEW ORDERS.
SOON AS THE WAR
COUNCIL'S OVER,
I'LL NOTIFY HIM.
WE MUST ATTACK
SEBASTOPOL.
GENERAL CANROBERT'S ANXIETY
IS PERHAPS PROMPTED BY THE FACT
THAT OUR SUPPLIES
ARE RUNNING LOW.
LORD RAGLAN
UNDERSTANDS
PERFECTLY.
CAN'T YOU SEE,
LORD CARDIGAN,
THE BALTIC FLEET
IS USELESS?
THE TURKISH FLEET,
I REGRET TO SAY,
HAS BEEN DESTROYED
BY THE RUSSIANS
AT SINOPE.
THE RECENT STORM HAS WRECKED
NOT ONLY THE RUSSIAN FLEET,
BUT THE LARGEST
OF THE FRENCH MAN-OF-WAR.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
OUR RESOURCES, GENERAL.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
WE HAVE SEBASTOPOL
UNDER SIEGE,
AND OUR FORCES HAVE
THE RUSSIANS AT BAY,
SO TO SPEAK.
BESIDES, SO FAR,
NO REAL OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTACK SEBASTOPOL
HAS PRESENTED ITSELF.
ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT.
LORD RAGLAN
CAN'T BE DISTURBED
WHILE THE WAR COUNCIL'S
IN SESSION.
TAKE IT UP WITH
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.
YES, SIR.
WAIT.
ALL RIGHT. CARRY ON.
YES, SIR.
MY PLAN TO WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE
IS PERFECTLY CLEAR
TO ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN.
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ISSUE
THE ORDERS, SIR CHARLES.
VERY GOOD.
I THINK THAT'S ALL
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS.
SOME PAPERS
FOR YOUR SIGNATURE, SIR.
HMM?
WELL, THESE
ARE NOT IMPORTANT.
PRESENTLY WILL DO.
SIT DOWN.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE A DISPATCH.
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
ARMY OF THE CRIMEA.
FROM HIS EXCELLENCY,
FIELD MARSHAL
THE EARL OF RAGLAN, K.C.B.,
COMMANDING...
THE MAJOR GENERAL
SIR BENJAMIN WARRENTON, K.C.B.,
NO. 1174.
ON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
YOU WILL WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE
TO A POINT
3 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST
OF ITS PRESENT POSITION...
BY ORDER.
LIGHT BRIGADE'S
MOVING BACK, SIR?
YES.
WHAT'S SURPRISING
ABOUT THAT?
VOLONOFF COMMANDS
THE RUSSIAN
ARTILLERY POSITION
ON THE HEIGHTS
ABOVE THE VALLEY
OF BALAKLAVA.
SURAT KHAN'S
WITH HIM.
WE KNOW THAT.
DON'T YOU THINK
THE MEN OF THE 27th,
THE MEN FROM CHUKOTI,
OUGHT TO BE GIVEN
A CHANCE TO ATTACK THEM?
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
EVERY BRITISH SOLDIER
WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE
TO AVENGE
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
MAY NEVER BE
ANOTHER CHANCE, SIR.
YOU MUST KNOW
THAT THE RUSSIANS
HAVE THEIR STRONGEST BATTERIES
SITUATED ABOVE THE VALLEY.
IT WOULD TAKE
AT LEAST FIVE REGIMENTS
FOR THE ASSAULT.
OH, NO, VICKERS,
IT'S SUICIDE.
THAT VALLEY,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
IS A VALLEY OF DEATH.
IT WOULD BE
WORTH IT, SIR.
600 MEN ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN CENTER
WOULD KEEP
THE ENEMY OCCUPIED
WHILE THE COMBINED
FRENCH, TURKISH,
BRITISH FORCES
ATTACK SEBASTOPOL.
SEBASTOPOL TAKEN,
THE CZAR MUST SUE
FOR PEACE.
YES. THE ENTIRE
CRIMEA SITUATION
HINGES ON SEBASTOPOL,
BUT THIS IS NO TIME
TO CONSIDER PERSONAL
FEELINGS, VICKERS.
YOUR PLAN IS
ADMIRABLY DARING,
BUT THAT'S JUST IT.
IT'S TOO WILD.
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO DELIVER THIS ORDER
PERSONALLY
TO THE COMMANDER
OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.
IS THAT CLEAR?
YES, SIR.
WHY, WHAT'S UP, VICKERS?
WHAT? NOTHING.
YOU DO LOOK RATHER ODD,
YOU KNOW.
CONFOUND YOU, BENTHAM.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
WILL YOU?
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
THESE BATTLES
ARE THE FINEST
OF TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.
WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF MEN,
APART FROM THOSE WHO DIED
FROM THE COLD AND SICKNESS.
IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPERATIVE
THAT UNLESS--
ORDERS FROM GENERAL
HEADQUARTERS, SIR.
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN.
HIS EXCELLENCY'S
COMPLIMENTS.
THANK YOU.
WELL, HOW ARE THINGS
OVER AT HEADQUARTERS?
THEY'VE BEEN
PRETTY DULL HERE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.
THAT'S FROM
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
IT'S IMPORTANT.
WELL, SIR.
"UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
THE LIGHT BRIGADE WILL ADVANCE
AND TAKE THE ENEMY POSITION
ON BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS."
IT'S COME AT LAST.
YOU EXPECTED IT?
FOR WEEKS, VICKERS.
FOR WEEKS.
SO YOU THOUGHT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS WERE
THE ONLY ONES IN THE KNOW,
BUT I, TOO, KNEW
THAT SURAT KHAN
WAS WITH VOLONOFF
ON THE BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS.
THE 27th--
THE MEN KNOW, SIR?
CERTAINLY NOT.
THERE'D BE NO HOLDING THEM.
DO YOU MIND
IF I TELL THEM?
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE COMING WITH US?
OF COURSE.
IT'S MY REGIMENT.
BESIDES, THIS
IS MORE THAN JUST
A FIGHT FOR ME, SIR.
AND TO ME, TOO,
MY BOY.
DO YOU THINK THAT I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO SLEEP SINCE
THAT AWFUL DAY AT CHUKOTI?
AND NOW, AT LAST...
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
SPOKE TO MY BROTHER
HERE IN YOUR OFFICE?
CERTAINLY NOT.
ORDERLY...
GO TO
CAPTAIN VICKER'S BILLET
AND REQUEST HIM
TO COME HERE AT ONCE.
[MAN]
YES, SIR.
GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
ACTION AT LAST.
COME WITH ME.
I TRUST ALL THE UNITS ARE
READY TO MOVE OUT AT ONCE.
OH, I--I THOUGHT
SIR BENJAMIN SENT FOR ME.
NO. I SENT FOR YOU.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS DISPATCH
TO GENERAL HEADQUARTERS
AND WAIT THERE
UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS.
WAIT AT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS?
BUT I'VE HEARD
THE REGIMENT'S
MOVING FORWARD.
IF I HAVE TO WAIT
AT GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
I'LL BE OUT OF THE FIGHT
ALTOGETHER.
YOU'LL DELIVER IT
PERSONALLY TO
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
I BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP ME OUT OF THIS
DELIBERATELY
BECAUSE OF ELSA.
NO. NO. ELSA'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE DIPLOMATIC
SERVICE NOW, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE
WITH YOUR REGIMENT
AT THE FRONT.
YOU'LL OBEY MY ORDERS
IMMEDIATELY.
IF I REFUSE?
YOU'LL BE
COURT-MARTIALED.
I SEE--
DISGRACED EITHER WAY.
VERY WELL.
BUGLER, SOUND ASSEMBLY.
MEN OF THE 27th,
SURAT KHAN IS ON THE FIELD
WITH THE OPPOSING
RUSSIAN FORCES,
THE SAME SURAT KHAN
WHO MASSACRED
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
OF CHUKOTI.
OUR CHANCE HAS COME.
SHOW NO MERCY.
LET NO POWER ON EARTH
STOP YOU.
PROVE TO THE WORLD
THAT NO MAN CAN KILL
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AND LIVE TO BOAST OF IT.
MEN OF THE 27th,
OUR OBJECTIVE IS SURAT KHAN!
FORWARD!
13th DRAGOONS,
PARADE LEFT!
WALK MARCH!
11th HUSSARS, FORWARD!
WALK MARCH!
[BUGLING]
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SIR.
SHOW HIM IN.
DISPATCH, SIR.
PERSONAL. URGENT.
THANK YOU.
"THEY'LL ATTACK
THE BALAKLAVA
HEIGHTS."
THIS IS INSANITY.
GENERAL WARRENTON
IS ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN ARTILLERY.
THEY'LL BE SLAUGHTERED,
ALL OF THEM.
ORDERLY!
I MUST ISSUE ORDERS
AT ONCE
FOR THE CHATEAU
D'AFRIQUE AND
THE HEBREE BRIGADE
TO SUPPORT THEM.
LET ME TAKE IT, SIR.
TAKE YOUR
FASTEST HORSE.
THE LIVES OF 600 MEN
ARE IN YOUR HANDS.
YES, SIR.
27th LANCERS,
FORWARD!
13th DRAGOONS,
FORWARD!
8th HUSSARS,
FORWARD!
7th HUSSARS,
FORWARD!
4th DRAGOONS,
FORWARD!
WALK MARCH!
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
THE BRITISH LIGHT
CAVALRY
ARE
ADVANCING AGAINST
OUR POSITION.
WE'LL CUT THEM DOWN
BEFORE THEY CROSS
THE VALLEY.
NO DOUBT.
INSTRUCT BATTERY
COMMANDERS IN
POSITIONS 37 AND 22
TO OPEN FIRE
IMMEDIATELY THEY
COME WITHIN RANGE.
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
THEY'RE DEPLOYING
THE CHARGE.
SEE FOR YOURSELF,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
WHAT A TACTICAL BLUNDER.
FOOLS. WHY, THEY'LL RIDE
INTO CERTAIN DEATH!
CHARGE!
THEY'RE CHARGING!
WHAT MADNESS.
[SHOUTING COMMANDS]
ONWARD, MEN! ONWARD!
WHY, THEY'VE BROKEN
THROUGH THE FIRST LINE
OF BATTERIES.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!
STEADY, MEN!
HOLD YOUR LINE!
ONWARD, MEN! ONWARD!
INSTRUCT COLONEL PLATTOV,
14th CALVARY, TO PREPARE
THE COUNTERATTACK.
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
STEADY, MEN! PRESS ON!
INSTRUCT 14th CALVARY
TO ATTACK!
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
GENTLEMEN,
EVERYONE BELIEVES
THE 600 WENT
TO THEIR DEATH
AT AN ORDER FROM ME.
CONFOUND IT, MAN.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A MISTAKE.
I'LL STAKE MY LIFE.
YOU NEVER ISSUED THAT ORDER.
IT WAS
A MAGNIFICENT BLUNDER.
THAT ONE INSANE CLASH
TURNED THE TIDE IN OUR FAVOR.
BUT THERE WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING,
WASN'T THERE?
THE ORDERS YOU GAVE--
WERE RECEIVED
AND CARRIED OUT.
BELIEVE ME, GENTLEMEN,
I FULLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO FOR ME,
AND I'M SORRY I HAVE
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.
YOU'RE SHIELDING SOMEONE.
YOU'RE A BLASTED FOOL,
GOD BLESS YOU.

Thank you. Goodbye.
Thanks, Sergeant.
Report of horse rations,
Thirtieth Hussars.
Regimental and general files.
Now, each of these buttons represents troops.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Good.
The buttons are thickest up near the Northwest Frontier.
Oh, yes, always.
We have 300 million people to protect.
And most of the danger is there.
It's so romantic to a greenhorn like me.
Kipling and all that, you know.
Romantic?
Well, at first, yes.
A- another button to move.
41st Bengal Lancers.
Here, near the pass.
The pass?
Does that mean-
It means nothing but maneuvers.
As CoI. Stone says in his report here.
You hear that firing,
Hamilton?
Typical sniping fire, sir.
Yes, and Afridi muskets every one of them.
Not a shot from our detachment.
Good. Hendrickson's a good soldier.
Rough on him, having those Afridi swine popping away at his men and not able to return fire.
Well, he'll get a citation if this plan works.
Plan's good enough, sir, if it were anybody but Mohammed Khan.
He's a clever dog.
Yes, of course he is.
I ought to know.
But he's nibbling at our bait this time.
And if we can once draw him down out of those hills far enough, out into the open so that we can cut off his retreat, we've got him red-handed!
And that's what
I've been waiting for, for 15 years, Hamilton.
Afridi swine. When do we go into action, Hendrickson?
On no account return fire.
CoI. Stone's orders.
ColoneI's orders.
Narain Singh.
Now can we start something?
ColoneI's orders,
McGregor.
But the old fool couldn't have foreseen this.
I'd like to have you with me in a war, but for peace time, you're a bit too-
Too...
Too impulsive.
Machine guns!
Forward!
Most unfortunate, the command devolved upon you.
Of course you didn't know my orders.
I did know them, sir.
Why didn't you obey them?
You call yourself a soldier?
That's all.
The Colonel knows India,
McGregor. You don't.
You're right, I don't.
I'm just a fooI
Scotch-Canadian.
Came into your outfit to get action.
He's got a ramrod for a backbone.
He's a terror for drilling, but when it comes to the real thing-
McGregor, the Colonel has the right to act as he thinks best and say what he pleases.
Mount!
One more thing, sir.
Two replacements come in today from Delhi.
Paperwork.
When we came into the regiment as boys, we didn't know that this was 9l10ths of soldiering.
No.
We thought and acted rather like McGregor.
Mmm.
What about these two replacements?
What are they sending to us now?
From the Blues:
Lt. Forsythe.
The Blues, eh? Well, that's a fashionable regiment.
All spit and polish.
Who's the other one?
From Sandhurst:
Lt. Stone.
What?
From Sandhurst?
What, they're sending me a young cub, not dry behind the ears yet? Unseasoned?
Straight from, fr-from military college to the Frontier?
Oh, bless me.
Hmm, what'd you say his name was?
Donald Stone, sir.
Hmm.
And who asked you to interfere in my personal affairs?
Will you forget that you're my coloneI for a moment, sir?
Yes.
Look here, Tom.
In about two years, you'll be retired.
So you sent for my son because you feel sorry for me, is that it?
Not at all.
The idea was to keep the name of Stone in the 41st after you're gone.
There's no room for sentimentality in the army.
Hardly fair to ship him home without a triaI.
Still, he'll measure up to my standards, or out he goes.
Of course.
And at the first sign of favoritism, from you or anyone else, there'll be trouble.
And that's an order,
Maj. Hamilton.
Just as you said,
Major.
It's the ColoneI's privilege to do and say what he likes.
McGregor, you'll meet the two replacement officers this morning.
Lts. Forsythe and Stone.
Yes, sir. S-Stone?
His son.
His what?
I said, his son.
I can't imagine old Ramrod ever having been that human.
The train arrives at 10:30,
Mr. McGregor.
Yes, sir.
Madam, you'll marry me
Tuesday the 29th.
Be at the church at 10:00.
That's an order.
Furthermore, you're improperly dressed.
Ha, Ha.
Did you want to speak to me, McGregor?
No, sir.
I hope he's a nice follow.
He won't be. Ramrod.
I beg your pardon?
One Stone isn't enough.
We have to have two.
There he is, the younger Ramrod himself.
Everything was all right?
Thank you, sir.
Couldn't be anybody else.
Just as sure of himself as...
Look at the way they jump around for him.
Look at his luggage, everything just so-so.
Well, come on, let's get it over with.
No, I've got a little business.
You get your precious replacements.
I'm McGregor, Lancers, sent to meet you.
Oh, sort of reception committee, eh?
It's nice to know
I was expected.
The regiment's been practically breathless for a week.
Oh?
Traveling light, huh?
Well, you see, I did expect to stay a little while.
That is if you don't mind too much.
It's all right with me.
Goodbye.
And thank you very much for being so kind.
Not at all.
Your luggage and everything all taken care of?
Everything, thank you.
May I present Mr. McGregor,
Miss Leys?
Very happy.
How do you do?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Who's she?
I met her on the train, if you don't mind.
Bad business talking to strange people out here.
You know, this is India.
You don't know who they are, and you might-
Oh, I see.
BeautifuI spy meets the young Lancer officer, makes him give away important military secrets.
The Empire goes smash.
Melodrama, my dear McGregor, melodrama.
It might not be as funny as it sounds, Mr. Stone.
I don't suppose it matters to you, but my name isn't Stone.
No?
No, it's Forsythe.
Well, then, that must be Stone there.
That's very good, you know.
That's really very good.
It's almost brilliant.
Stone? I'm McGregor, sent to meet you.
That's very nice of you.
Stone, meet Mister, uh...
What did you say your name was?
Forsythe.
Mr. Stone, Mr. Fort.
We met on the train, and the name is Forsythe.
Too hot for Forsythe.
Fort, Stone. Stone, Fort.
Stone Fort.
And that's funny.
If you two will hold onto each other,
I'll tend to your luggage.
Pleasant chap.
So friendly.
Isn't he?
Just what
I've always imagined a real officer on the Frontier would be like.
Well, my mother kept me in the States untiI I made her send me to Sandhurst.
I've knocked about a bit in the States.
Scotch-Canadian, myself.
What is this I'm in?
The Foreign Legion?
I didn't even think my father knew
I was at Sandhurst, untiI this happened.
What?
His sending for me to his regiment.
Oh?
Sort of, carry on our tradition, you know?
Naim Shah, your servant, Stone.
Ali Hamdi, yours.
The night watchman, the water carrier, the sweeper.
You can hire the rest of them later.
Those things hurt my ears.
That's odd.
They sound to me like a Scotch bagpipe.
Your quarters, Stone.
Pretty, huh? And soothing.
Thought I might entertain you.
Wild Scotch airs.
Remind you of home.
Your room.
Someone deeded all this junk to the South
Kensington Museum?
That junk represents the personal belongings of the man you're replacing.
Killed on the border last month.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, McGregor, did my...
Uh, the Colonel say anything about what time he'd see me?
No, he didn't. And my guess is he won't see you till durbar.
Oh.
Don't let that get you down.
The old- The old man's a stickler for red tape.
Durbar. Bugles.
And that's an order.
Ramrod.
Durbar.
Oh, a-already?
I'll be right with you.
I want you to help me to keep them in good condition.
You keep then shined and I'II, uh, keep them dirty.
Durbar.
Whenever you're ready, sahib.
Thanks, old ColoniaI.
Durbar, Barrett.
Not today, old boy.
Where to now?
Over the border.
I wish
I'd taken my mother's advice and joined the church instead of the Army.
I wish
I had the job.
Does the Colonel think you're the only one here who talks Pushtu?
Who knows what the Colonel thinks?
I agree with you there.
Well, good luck.
Thanks, Mac.
Left wheel, turn!
Left wheel, turn!
Good head, eh? Yeah.
How old is she, Major?
Places, men.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, sir.
What's this?
An Afridi Ghazi,
Colonel sahib.
Caught in the quarters of Capt. Norton, with this.
Anything stolen?
He meant to kill
Capt. Norton.
Said Capt. Norton slept with his feet toward Mecca.
There are trees, and we have rope.
What have you got to say?
Oh.
Take him and hang him to a tree, and then sew the dead body in the skin of a pig.
Well, that's what will happen to him if he tries it again.
You tell him that and let him go.
He doesn't seem to like pigs.
If that happened, in heaven he wouldn't get the 48 maidens allotted by Allah.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sad.
Capt. Norton.
Yes, sir?
Have you a compass?
Yes, sir.
Change the direction of your bed.
Yes, sir.
Yes, that's all.
Mr. McGregor.
The two replacements?
Mr. Forsythe, from the Blues,
Mr. Stone, from Sandhurst.
From the Blues, eh?
Quite so.
Well, that's a fashionable regiment.
I am afraid, Mr. Forsythe, you'll find us different.
We have a reputation as soldiers, and we're proud of it.
Mr. Stone.
You've come to us direct from Sandhurst, without previous service.
Is that correct?
Yes, sir.
Yes. Well, you've got a great deal to learn.
And I trust that you, and you, too,
Mr. Forsythe, will measure up to our requirements.
That's all, gentlemen.
Crusty old...
I'm sorry.
Is it over?
Is that all?
That's all.
Lt. Stone.
Yes, sir?
The Colonel forgot something.
I want you to take this to him.
Yes, sir.
What's so funny?
You are.
So the rough soldier has a heart of gold.
Never mind, it comes out in all of us.
It's the mother instinct.
Is this it, sir?
What?
Where did you get this?
Mr. McGregor ordered me to give it to you, sir.
What infernal impudence!
No, uh, not you.
Not-not-not you.
How's, uh,
How- H-How's your mother?
Quite well, sir.
Good, good.
She always hated the army.
I- I don't understand why she ever let you go through Sandhurst.
She had to.
I've kept after her about it ever since I was so high.
Oh? Wanted to be a soldier, eh?
We've always been soldiers, for generations.
Yes.
Still, you're not one yet, you know?
Yes, sir.
Really, you, uh, you ought not to be here.
Uh, not on the Frontier.
But I am here, sir.
Yes, but, uh, don't try to take advantage.
Don't expect any favoritism.
I don't, sir.
I, uh,
I- I-I'm glad to see you, of course, and I...
I'm sorry that the situation makes any sort of, uh, o-of, uh, social relation impossible.
And I-I, uh...
No, no, wait! W-wait.
Uh, come back a moment.
You see, uh, this Frontier, it's not the same as home service.
No place for a Cub.
A man's got to be seasoned.
You've got to start from the bottom.
Learn everything, and if you don't measure up, out.
The service comes first.
Something your mother never understood.
Yes, sir.
Is that all, sir?
What? Uh, uh, yes.
Y- Yes, that's all.
That's all.
I'm very glad to see...
Poor kid.
I thought if I got them alone...
But the old man has ice-water in his veins.
You don't know the colonel, McGregor.
Neither do you.
Mr. McGregor.
Yes, sir.
As I remarked to one of my other officers this morning, there is no place for sentimentality in the Army.
Neither sentimentality nor impertinence,
Mr. McGregor.
Stone.
Interesting, the durbar, isn't it?
I'm sorry
I sent you in there.
I should have known better.
Should have known how he'd treat you.
What's a son to him, compared to his blasted regiment?
Martinet. Ramrod.
That's what he is.
Everybody knows it.
You might as well get used to it.
That's a lie.
I'm sorry,
I can't keep my mouth shut.
That's my trouble.
Biggest fooI in the Army.
I'm sorry.
That's all- all right, Mac.
" Sure I love the dear silver that shines in her hair "
" And the brow that's all furrowed "
" and wrinkled with care "
" Oh, God bless you and keep you "
" Mother McGregor "
Now, when a troop wheels on the move, what do the troop leaders look out for?
Mr. Stone,
I asked you a question.
Yes, sir.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
Got it all that time.
All right.
Bedding should be changed, Mr. Stone.
Yes, I see now,
Risaldar Major.
We don't have these beastly ticks in England.
Sergeant, have this horse's shoe attended to.
Come on!
Give him a good walk while he cools off.
A good man, Forsythe.
Jump!
See the way he took that jump?
Yes, they teach them to jump in the Blues.
Yes. Yes, what?
Oh.
Good work, Forsythe.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. McGregor, you're improperly dressed.
I'm sorry, sir.
That was a nice jump you made, Mac.
Thanks.
Hello, Stone.
Hello.
Remarkable man, your father.
Knows a good soldier when he sees one.
Appreciates neatness, too.
Well, how about a spot of scotch?
Thanks. I haven't finished inspection yet.
Ten minutes for their backs and five for their bellies.
That's the order of grooming.
Very touching, the lad's devotion.
Must warm the maternaI cockles of your heart.
Eh, McGregor?
What about pulling a few pegs with me, huh?
I'm in favor of it.
Let's go.
Well, uh, how about 10 Rupees?
Make it 20.
Ready?
Whenever you say.
They should make those pegs smaller.
Be more sport to it, huh?
" Oh, he flew through the air "
" With the greatest of ease "
" And the daring young man owes me 20 Rupees "
Have some tea, Stone?
No, thanks.
Call it for first in the bath.
Heads.
Right.
You fellows bathe to keep cooI and I bathe because I badly need it.
Every time I do this
I remind myself of my old man.
Whiskers.
He was a crabby old cuss.
Back in Alberta
I had a colt once.
Lot of class and nerve.
You could tell he was no carthorse when he was a yearling.
The old man hooked him to a plow.
Took all the spirit out of him.
He broke him in, as he said he would and I never forgave him for it.
I don't think the horse ever did realize what... what the old man did to him.
So I'm the horse.
Very subtle, Mac.
What the blazes do you mean?
I'm no two-year-old. I'm 21.
And if anybody thinks my old man's going to break my nerve-
What are you talking about?
I wasn't thinking of you at all.
And let me tell you another thing,
I don't need a nurse.
Now you can go on shaving.
Have a little soap.
You need it.
Do you have to do that?
Why, like you, I have a softer side to my nature.
It finds its outlet in music.
See? The scales.
Hey, Mac, get me a towel, will you?
Variations, one hand, Mac.
Listen, Forsythe.
This Mother Machree business has gone far enough.
Why, of course, Mac.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it.
Well, let's, uh, just forget all about it. Hm?
Thanks.
Hey, Mac, that soap's in my eyes.
Give me a towel, will you?
McGregor.
Variations, two hands, Mac.
How long are you going to...
Keep playing.
Variations, Mr. Forsythe, with both hands.
Cobras have a softer side, too.
Finds an outlet in music.
Of course, if you-if you stop playing,
You know, you might live a couple of hours.
I had a friend once that lived for two days.
Try it with one hand.
Mac!
Allow me.
You might spill it.
For sale, cheap.
One secondhand musical instrument.
200 feet more.
Plus 200 east.
Elevation, 300.
Mr. McGregor.
Yes, sir?
There's no word yet from Barrett.
We must get in touch with him.
Yes, sir.
You're familiar with the roads north east of Fort Jamrud?
I am, sir.
Yes, good, good.
You'll cross the Frontier tonight.
Take one subaltern, one NCO, 10 men, four spare horses.
And, uh, rifles.
Not lances.
I see, sir.
Ostensibly, a hunting expedition.
What subaltern shall I take, sir?
Mmm, any preference?
Mr. Stone, sir.
No service experience.
Take Morgan.
He's on leave, sir.
Well, then, take Forsythe.
Yes, sir.
Here are your orders.
And this time, obey them.
Yes, sir.
Forsythe.
Huh?
We're leaving for the border immediately.
What?
Action?
Can't say.
Oh.
We leave for the border?
Uh, small expedition.
Only one junior officer.
Forsythe.
Yes?
One junior officer, so he had to choose-
I chose Forsythe.
I see.
Sir.
What do you mean by intruding like this?
Why wasn't I chosen to go with McGregor?
Are you questioning my orders?
Then it was your orders.
It wasn't McGregor's choice.
It was yours.
Mr. Stone.
I came out to India to be an officer, and I've been given things to do
I learned in my first year at Sandhurst.
I haven't asked any favors, and I'm not asking any now.
But if you meant to treat me this way, why did you bring me out here?
Why did you send for me?
I didn't send for you.
Y- you didn't?
Oh.
Are you aware we're being shot at?
We camp here.
This is no place to camp.
Are you out of your mind?
They'll rush us in the night and slit our throats.
This can't be what the Colonel meant.
Easy to see how much you learned in the Blues about Frontier fighting.
No firing.
He's mine.
Rapid fire!
You just missed my ear, Mac.
You're lucky, Barrett.
You got a cigarette?
Yeah.
Thanks.
What shall I tell the ColoneI?
Mohammed Khan, is effecting a coalition of all the tribes.
But don't forget, Colonel,
GopaI's a friendly state.
The Emir's our friend, as who knows better than you.
Oh, of course, I've known
Othman Ali for 20 years.
Every year or so
I take the regiment up to Gopal for maneuvers and pig-sticking.
He's got the best wild pig north of the Ganges.
Ah.
But two million rounds of ammunition.
Oh, no, Woodley.
Why, that's enough to start a small-sized war.
And then, who knows?
Yes, who knows?
But he asked for it.
And if we refused, well, he mightn't be our friend.
And so he gets it, eh?
Yes.
McGregor, Sahib.
Oh, ask Mr. McGregor to come in.
Oh, sit down, sir, won't you?
You saw Barrett?
Yes, sir.
He reports Mohammed Khan is trying to stir up all the border tribes, and effect a coalition of all of them.
They're listening to him as he's promised to supply them with machine guns, and two million rounds of ammunition.
Ammunition?
Oh, that's good work.
Thank you, McGregor.
Thank Barrett, sir.
Look at here, sir, I-I know it's none of my business, but couldn't we slip out of here, a small detachment of us, anyway, on our own?
Try to get a chance at him, kill him, and-and nip the whole business in the bud?
Are you suggesting that I should commence hostilities without orders?
And, uh, ahem, without reporting this to the Intelligence?
Intelligence, those fools.
General staff?
You know, sir, they'll send us anywhere but into action.
To Gopal to stick pigs for instance, like last summer.
An excellent suggestion.
Sir Thomas,
Mr. McGregor.
Mr. McGregor, Maj. Gen.
Sir Thomas Woodley.
Chief of Intelligence.
Army Headquarters.
Mr. McGregor.
CoI. Stone, your regiment will leave at dawn for GopaI.
Yes, sir.
Now, get yourself a couple of hours sleep.
We leave at 6:00.
Yes, sir.
Wish I could go with you.
I always liked pig-sticking.
Pig-sticking.
Well, I seem to remember feeling that way once.
He's probably right.
Hm.
But he brought our answer, Stone.
A plain two and two that makes a very plain four.
Mohammed Khan needs two million rounds of ammunition.
And the Emir of Gopal asks us for two million rounds-
Yes, yes, and it's not difficult to guess, that Mohammed Khan persuaded the Emir to ask for it.
He knows we'll have to let him have it, too.
And GopaI's not only remote, but far enough removed from the Khan's home fires, that we shouldn't be suspicious.
Very pretty, indeed.
And it becomes our very pleasant job, to see that the Emir really is the one who gets the ammunition.
That old pussy-footer gets paid for being intelligent.
I tell you, Forsythe, everything's going to smash.
What?
Pig-sticking.
We're going to ride all around Gopal sticking toothpicks into pigs.
Sounds rather fun.
I ought to be rather good at that, don't you think?
Hmm.
By the way, McGregor,
I've got bad news for you.
Your ward needs parental controI, I fear.
That is, if you can find him.
Naim Shah tells me he's been out every night since we left.
Rolling home to quarters blotto.
Tonight he's still out on a binge.
Hm. We leave for
Gopal in two hours.
Oh, without Stone, it appears.
My, what will the stern father say?
You'd better do something about it, Mac.
The young fooI.
Let old Ramrod do what he likes with his son.
It's no concern of mine.
I'm going to bed.
So am I.
What are you doing here?
The same as you are.
Looking for him.
And I wish you'd be honest with yourself, and let me know what you're really going to do.
If you'd just tell me, maybe I'd get more sleep.
Now that we are here, what would you do if you were drunk?
How drunk?
Pretty drunk.
I'd go looking for that music.
Come on, speed it up, Stone, or we'll all be doing stable duty.
I can take care of myself.
Come along, Casanova, these will make a new man of you.
Forgot something.
I thought you might get lonesome.
Get yourself a cobra.
The welcoming committee from the Emir.
That's his vizier, bringing gifts for the ColoneI from his old paI.
His Highness,
Othman Ali Bahadur,
Emir of Gopal, bids welcome to his friends and allies of the Raj.
Welcome, huzoor, thrice welcome, in the name of Allah.
Convey my thanks to your master, ahem, my old friend.
Uh, m-may he live a thousand years.
His Highness orders me to express his wish, huzoor, that you may live long enough to be present at his funeraI.
Uh, oh, yes, quite so.
Quite so.
He went the old man one better that time.
Wicked looking birds, aren't they?
Hunting falcons, Forsythe.
Swiftest thing in the air.
Full of fight and trained to kill, like the rest of these mangy-looking fellows.
A long-legged man is always full of wind.
Barrett.
His Highness invites you, huzoor, and all the officer sahibs, to an entertainment in your honor, tonight at the palace.
I accept on their behalf with pleasure.
All my thanks to His Highness.
His Highness awaits you.
Salaam, Colonel Sahib.
Salaam, Your Highness.
May I present the officers of the 41st
Bengal Lancers, Your Highness?
My poor hovel is yours, sahiban.
Everything here is for your pleasure.
Please enjoy yourselves.
Now, this is what army life should be.
Like the Arabian Nights, isn't it?
Anything like this in Canada, Mac?
Quite a teepee, huh?
I sent to London for that, and you-
My two good friends.
My guest, CoI. Stone.
My guest, Mohammed Khan.
Very glad to know you Khan sahib.
At last, CoI. Stone.
We almost met once before, did we not, you and I?
Yes, I-I believe we did.
Just missed you, didn't I?
A blind man wants nothing except his eyes.
That's an Afghan proverb.
And now, if you will forgive me,
I must leave my two good friends together.
I must go to see my other guests.
Oh, yes,
Your Highness.
No doubt that Khan and I will find much to talk about.
Highness.
You were not expected with your lancers.
A hasty trip, wasn't it?
In search of, uh...
Pigs.
There's another proverb:
The little jackal barks, but the caravan passes.
Won't you sit down,
CoI. Stone?
Yes.
I say, look.
I saw her first.
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mac.
A direct frontal attack?
That's the wrong tactics.
This requires finesse.
I'll toss you.
The loser stays clear.
Right you are.
Heads.
Now watch closely.
Well, uh, go ahead.
Uh, I'm watching you closely.
Gentlemen.
Uh, two more of my officers
I should like you to meet.
Mr. McGregor, Mr. Forsythe.
This is our friend and neighbor, Mohammed Khan.
A great pleasure, gentlemen.
Let me give you some advice, Mr. Forsythe.
Never make fun of military Intelligence.
Thank you very much.
And now-
Uh, wait a minute.
That girI and...
I've got some things to find out.
He plans to leave tomorrow morning.
I knew he would as soon as we got here.
We must keep him here if possible.
I was right.
She came here with Mohammed Khan.
Aha, so that's how it is.
Diplomatic complications rear their heads, huh?
Looks like it.
We'd better find them.
Mac, I've been thinking.
I'm very fond of you, you know.
I have a feeling this is going to cost me something.
Oh, no, Mac.
Now, you've done enough for him, really.
This time, I'll take on the rescue work.
Well, that touches me deeply, but how many times have you told me he was my job?
Uh, we'll both do it, Mac. Huh?
Mr. Stone,
I'm sorry, but uh, but Maj. Hamilton wants to see you.
Very important, he said.
I beg your pardon. I'll be back in just a moment.
Surely.
No manners at all, this younger generation.
Completely forgot the introductions, didn't he?
My name's Forsythe.
How do you do?
That's McGregor.
Scotch, you know.
Very queer race.
Did you send for me, Major?
No.
I'm sorry.
I made that same mistake once before.
How are your pigs this year, Highness?
Pigs?
My land is overrun with unclean beasts.
Oh, that means good sport tomorrow.
You'll join us,
Khan sahib, of course?
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm leaving in the morning.
But if you wish real sport, you must come to my country.
An invitation?
My land and all it contains is at your disposaI.
Yes, yes, sahib.
Why, he gives his word, the word of a prince.
I swear it upon the Koran.
An oath?
Oh, I'll put it to the test.
He has you.
What do you demand of him, sahib?
Postpone your departure.
Join us at pig-sticking tomorrow.
I- I-I can't.
My affairs demand that-
You must.
You give your oath upon the Koran.
I am honored, Bahadur.
Tomorrow,
Pig-sticking.
I don't believe in explaining orders, but this time it's necessary.
Mohammed Khan's men are in these hills, to seize that ammunition convoy before it reaches our friend, the Emir.
There's no need to tell you how serious one ill-advised or careless move by any of you might be in this situation.
Oh, of course, we're here for sport and maneuvers.
And as some of you who are new to India may not know, a wounded pig is a dangerous animal, so a word of advice to, uh, the younger officers.
If you wound a pig and he takes to cover, do not dismount and follow.
Foolhardiness is not courage.
It's not good soldiering and it's not good sport.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Good morning.
We shall ride together, sir?
It will be a pleasure.
You have the advantage of me, in years.
The older the English fox, the safer his brush.
Cunning comes with age,
CoI. Stone.
Hunted in the shires, I see.
And you on the border.
We're fairly matched.
But I prefer your English sport to this.
You prefer hunting the fox?
Mr. Stone.
I'm worried about you.
Such a dangerous sport.
Nonsense. Why, there's no risk at all.
Good luck.
Old Ramrod's spotted one.
Look at him ride.
He made a direct kill.
Look!
20 Rupees on the first spear.
Right.
" Oh, he flew through the air with the greatest of ease "
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Did you see old Ramrod make that kill?
"A wounded pig is a dangerous animaI."
What rot.
Pig hasn't a chance.
Think so?
Hey, look.
There's your chance to find out how simple it is.
Stone!
Mr. McGregor!
Mr. McGregor!
You get back on your horse and stay there.
Mr. Stone! Mr. Stone!
McGregor, give me your tunic.
No one, you understand, no one, must know of this.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Stone, you've seen fit to disregard my advice.
You will please be good enough to leave the field.
Yes, sir.
I, uh, I-I should thank you two.
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
Now, uh, help me on my horse.
And you, too, disobeyed my orders.
I distinctly told you not to dismount.
Lights out.
How do you feel, sir?
I, oh, oh, quite all right, thanks.
They'll be over at once.
What?
Much better talk to them yourself, I think, sir.
He's your son, you know.
Better effect than if it came from me.
And when you talk,
I happen to know there's quite a strong friendship between the boy and McGregor.
Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
Of course, yes.
Well, all right.
They're here.
Well, all right.
Come in.
Oh, yes, yes, of course, it's you. Yes, I-I...
G- Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Yes, I, uh,
I- I-I sent for you.
I- I want to talk to you about something. Uh...
Uh, sit down.
S- sit down, both of you.
No, no, no, don't go, Hamilton.
It, um, it's about, uh, um...
Are your quarters comfortable?
Yes, sir.
Just like
Salisbury Plain, sir.
Yes, yes.
There are three of you together, I understand.
I- I-I mean, my s-
Uh, Mr. Stone is quartered with you, isn't he?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Well, I, uh,
I- I-I want to talk to you about something.
Uh,
Uh, oh,
Uh, oh, t-try some of my tobacco, McGregor.
I- I-It's my own mixture.
You know- you know, that fellow in Jermyn Street.
Lot of perique in it.
Hm.
Too strong for me, maybe.
No. No, not for you,
McGregor.
I- I-it might be for Forsythe.
Of the Blues.
Late of the Blues, sir.
Huh? Oh, yes, yes, late of the Blues.
Uh, I-I-I knew your father, Forsythe.
Oh, did you really?
Yes.
Snake charmer, wasn't he?
What? Brigadier General, a- a snake charmer?
Well, I thought...
Well, you see, his son plays one of those...
Oh, that's odd.
I- I-I never heard of it.
Uh...
Oh, oh, probably, it's just as well.
Probably.
Yes, probably, sir.
Yes. Yes, I-I-I knew him.
Uh...
Y- your father must be very proud of you, Forsythe.
T- t-the army a-a-and all that sort of thing, I mean.
Oh, he took all that for granted, sir.
Yes. Yes. Uh...
Uh-uh, you-you ought to make a good officer, Forsythe.
Oh, you've got a lot to learn yet, of course.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes.
W- w-where is your father now?
Cheltenham.
Retired.
Retired?
Yeah.
Well, we-we come to it.
We all come to it.
Not much to look forward to then.
Not much, unless, uh...
Well, uh, we've had a hard day.
Now, you-you'd better get yourself some sleep.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night, sir.
Good night, sir.
Good night, sir.
Yeah, good night, Hamilton.
That fellow in Jermyn Street.
Pour lumps of sugar.
Not much to look forward to.
So he wanted to talk to us.
Well, whatever it was, he couldn't get it off his chest, could he?
Say, do you suppose...
Ah, is the light beginning to break?
I got it.
The old man doesn't know what to do about his kid, and wants us to help him, but just couldn't get it out.
That's brilliant, Mac.
That's positively brilliant.
That's it, all right.
I never thought he cared that much.
I never thought he was that human.
Yet the way he went after that pig when he thought his boy was in for it.
Yeah, game old cock.
Those tusks got him a lot worse than he lets on, too.
Boy's pretty bitter and ugly.
Largely the old man's fault, of course.
Partly the old man's, partly our system's.
But mostly the boy's.
Let's wake him up.
Well, no, Mac. I leave that to you. He's your ward.
Well, the old man talked to you, too, didn't he?
That girI.
Ah, youth, youth!
I trust you won't find the journey too uncomfortable,
Mr. Stone.
Halt! Who goes there?
Guard, turn out.
Barrett sahib.
As he turned around, we fired and brought him down, sir.
Thank you, McGregor.
Your version, Forsythe?
Mr. Stone was not in his tent.
That's all we can say, sir.
You've both tried to shield him.
All the facts are obvious.
He couldn't have been seized in the middle of the camp without some outcry.
Just slipped out against orders.
Anyway, he can tell where they've taken him, sir.
Hamzulla, ask him where Mohammed Khan has taken my son.
I think I can make him talk, sir.
Well, try.
Guards doubled as ordered, sir.
Thank you, Norton.
Barrett?
Bad?
The eyes, and the usuaI...
Mogala.
Thank you,
McGregor.
I learned that one from you, sir.
Hamzulla Khan, take him away and see that he is well guarded.
Trial of that Afridi,
Services for Barrett, at noon.
That's all, gentlemen.
But, sir.
I thought that-
You thought what,
Mr. McGregor?
That you were going after your son, sir.
This incident will not change our plans in any respect.
But-But knowing where he's taking your son makes all the difference, sir.
We can be at Mogala almost as soon as he is.
This regiment can ride, sir.
I'm aware my regiment can ride.
I'm also aware that
I am not going to do precisely what Mohammed Khan has planned that I should do.
He took my son to goad me into pursuing him to draw the lancers from their position.
He's mistaken his man.
But this-
In our present position, the regiment holds
Mohammed Khan checkmate.
The regiment stays here.
Then let me go.
I can take a small detachment-
Mr. McGregor, I cannot weaken the strength of the regiment in this emergency.
And I can't permit you or any other officer to risk their lives for Mr. Stone.
But he's your son, and we can save him, can't we?
That will be all,
Mr. McGregor.
Then take a look at that.
That's what Mohammed Khan does to his prisoners.
That's quite unnecessary,
Mr. McGregor.
I know what may happen to my son through his own disobedience and folly.
I'd just begun to think
I was wrong about you, but I wasn't.
You haven't a human bone in your body.
There's not a drop of blood in your veins.
You're nothing but a-
McGregor.
So you'll sit here with your regiment while they kill your son by inches.
Well, I won't!
I'm going after him whether you like it or not.
Mr. McGregor!
Pending charges of insubordination you will please consider yourself under arrest.
Mr. Forsythe, you will be responsible for the prisoner.
You fooI.
Can't you see-
So you-
Mac!
Come along.
Well, I must say you spoke your mind, old colonial, if there's any virtue in that.
"Regiment, duty, you're improperly dressed. "
That's all he cares about.
So they'll say,
"Very good, CoI. Stone," and pin another medal on him.
Or else he's...
Haven't you said enough,
McGregor?
The coloneI's right and you know it.
You're only making it harder for him.
If you take my advice, you'll go over and apologize.
Not me. Apologize after what he did?
Oh, for heaven's sake, man, get some sense.
Do you suppose it was an easy thing for him to do?
His own son?
Why wasn't it?
He doesn't care about him.
He'd do the same thing to any of us.
But to sit here and let them pull his own son to pieces because of a few cases of ammunition-
Are you blind, man?
You think he doesn't care?
Well, I know he does.
Well, I suppose if it were your son, you'd sit here, too, like a dummy.
You would not-
No, I should probably have ordered the regiment out.
That's because I'm not the man the colonel is.
Nor the soldier.
Well, if that's what you call being a man or a soldier, I don't want any part of it.
Not me.
That kid needs him.
It's his own blood, and if he cared a hang about him-
Of course he cares. But what's that got to do with it?
He loved his wife, too, but he lost her.
She was American.
Couldn't stick the service, couldn't understand.
So he chose the regiment then just as he's doing now.
But that doesn't mean he didn't care.
I know.
I ought to know.
We were Cubs together.
He put his whole souI into the regiment, and that's all he's had.
And he won't have that long, either. Retirement.
He'll have an armchair in the club, and a window over the rag, and that's all.
And he'll have nothing if his boy doesn't carry on in this regiment.
Then he'd have everything?
Of course he would.
That's what it means to him.
But you think he'd let that make any difference to his orders, to his job?
Well, why shouldn't it?
Why can't he be a little less of a soldier and more of a man?
Why can't he forget his blasted duty for once?
Man, you are blind!
Have you never thought how for generation after generation here, a handfuI of men have ordered the lives of 300 million people?
It's because he's here, and a few more like him.
Men of his breed have made British India.
Men who put their jobs above everything.
He wouldn't let death move him from it and he won't let love move him from it.
When his breed of man dies out, that's the end.
And it's a better breed of man than any of us will ever make.
Good night, gentlemen.
There's a great deaI of speaking of minds going on here tonight.
I didn't think the old boy had it in him, but he's right.
According to his way of thinking, maybe.
It's funny, your being out here and thinking of it in any other way.
On their side, huh?
Well, I'm not. So I'm going to do something.
There's been enough thinking and talking, too. I'm going.
Are you really, now?
You know, you put me in a rather awkward position.
Look, I don't want any trouble with you, but I'm going.
Well, when do we start?
What do you mean "we"?
You're my prisoner, you know.
I couldn't let you out of my sight.
I regret to have to report, sir.
McGregor and Forsythe have disappeared.
What, desertion?
I suppose it is, technically.
Well, what did you expect?
" Sure I love the dear silver "
" That shines in her hair "
" And the brow that's all furrowed "
" and wrinkled with care "
" I kiss the dear fingers so toiI-worn for me "
" Oh, God bless you and keep you "
" Mother "
" Mcgregor "
Why do they want to talk so many languages in India?
It's up to you.
You'll have to be the talking merchant.
I'll be the deaf and dumb one.
Well, at least we're in.
I hope getting out is as easy.
Trying to be funny?
No, I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm scared stiff.
What are we going to do now?
Try to look and act like the rest of these merchants.
Set up shops.
Sell a few doodads while we take a look around.
I don't see anything that looks like a plan.
As far as I can see, we've just stuck our head in the lion's mouth.
A very large and unpleasant lion, too.
Suppose you were Mohammed Khan, where would you have put him?
Oh, no, you play first.
It'll be more fun.
All right.
You stay here and unpack these things and set up shop.
I'll take a look around.
Don't forget you're deaf and dumb.
You'd better cut your prices, Mac, before I get my throat cut.
Do you think she recognized us?
I hope not.
I don't think so.
Anyway, we won't worry about it.
Did you see anything interesting?
Not a thing.
What's that mean?
Time to go?
Yes.
But we're gonna stay right here untiI we can-
He's in all right.
No doubt about that.
And doing rather well, too.
Clicquot.
I saw the labeI. Iced.
If that's the way Mohammed Khan tortures his victims
I'd like to change places with him for 10 minutes.
That guard's got a key all right.
If we can last till night, hit the guard over the head get the kid out, try and steal some horses-
Jump them over a 40-foot wall and then that mad dash for the border.
Well, you think of something better.
Mohammed Khan sent for us.
He wants to see our rugs and laces.
Do you suppose?
No, I don't suppose.
Don't forget you're deaf and dumb.
Oh, come, come, gentlemen.
It isn't everyday that two British officers prostrate themselves at the feet of a poor border chieftain.
Mr. McGregor, Mr. Forsythe.
I told you, this Mardi Gras would be a washout.
I had hoped the ColoneI might come himself but since he has so very cleverly refused,
I welcome you to my humble home.
You remember, my dear, of course?
How could I forget?
They were such charming dinner companions.
Dinner. Yes, of course.
You will dine with me surely, gentlemen, to try my poor savage fare?
I know you must be anxious to meet my guest of honor.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. McGregor.
Yes, I've-I've seen good cricket in my time.
I was an Oxford man, you know.
But I must compliment you,
Mr. Forsythe, on your delivery.
Superb.
Oh, charming compliment.
My only regret is that it wasn't a hand grenade.
A charming thought.
A charming dinner.
The mutton was, uh, excellent.
Always mutton.
We have mutton or chicken up here. But, as you say, good mutton, quite the equaI of your English South Down.
Now you put me in a very difficult position.
Pride of country urges me to argue the point.
But my position as, uh... as a guest, shall we say-
By all means a guest, for the time being.
For the time being, huh?
Pass the wine.
My position as a guest for the time being, of course, inclines me to agree with you.
Well, a compliment indeed, that we can approach the excellence of anything British.
I'm fed up with this cat-and-mouse business.
Let's talk sense.
You've got us here and now what are you going to do with us?
Mac, manners, manners.
By the way, we didn't thank the Khan sahib for our charming and picturesque raiment.
Suppose we stay with the subject?
I'm quite prepared to supply you with horses to return to your regiment.
You can tell your coloneI that some of my men misunderstood his son's innocent flirtation.
Of course, when I found it out,
I punished them at once.
An easy explanation of how
I came to set you free.
And, uh, what's the catch?
You have only to answer two very simple questions:
By what route is the ammunition train coming and just where does the regiment plan to meet it for convoy?
Well, when the furry little animaI jumped out of the bag he really jumped, didn't he?
Well, gentlemen.
We have ways to make men talk.
If you'll forgive me,
I- I have a headache.
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
Madame Volkanskaya finds our methods in this part of the world a little too direct for her taste.
Your brandy, gentlemen.
Take it. We may need it.
I regret this, but thanks to your coloneI's cold heart and cold brain
I have no other choice, and very little time.
Now that we're no longer guests, tell him what you really think of the mutton.
Oh, yes.
As much as I regret to say this, your mutton is undoubtedly-
"Rotten" is the word.
Thanks, Mac.
Come, now, gentlemen, must I proceed to these absurd and unpleasant extremes?
Little bamboo slivers but when they're driven under the fingernails and lighted, we find them very effective.
Bring the other two gentlemen a little bit closer so they can see well.
I shall proceed first with Mr. McGregor.
I'll get you some water.
I'd rather have a cigarette, Mac.
Dentist once in MontreaI hit a nerve.
It hurt almost as bad.
Well, he's been to a dentist.
Let me alone!
Come on, Tania.
Don't faiI me, Tania.
Come along,
Mohammed Khan.
Show some speed!
Tania!
For dear old Forsythe.
Tania! Tania!
Run, jump, do something!
Do anything.
That's right.
Here we go.
Tania!
One jump.
Come on, Mohammed Khan, take that hurdle.
Ah, Mohammed Khan, by half a length.
That makes 40 million
Rupees you owe me.
Another day of this, and I'm broke.
Another day of this, we'll be going around in circles like those cockroaches.
Ah, I wonder when these whiskers stop itching and begin to be a beard!
Foulest torture ever invented.
Keep us in a cell that crawls and fix us so we can't scratch.
All the Khan's horses and all the Khan's men.
It didn't take him long.
I'd like to have seen the look on the ColoneI's face.
It looks as if they were expecting trouble.
There's only one answer.
The ColoneI's after them.
And with all the ammunition here, there's nothing to keep him in GopaI.
With those machine guns and two million rounds of ammunition the regiment wouldn't have a chance.
The old Ramrod's a fooI to try it.
He will, though.
There's nothing much we can do about it.
I wish I had my toodle-oodle here.
I'd play you some wild Scotch airs.
Over my dead body, you would.
You know, that's rather clever, Mac.
Why don't you say it?
Why don't you say what you're thinking?
Forget it!
I'm to blame. I told them, that's what you're thinking.
Why don't you say it?
Shut up!
All right, I told them and why shouldn't I? For him?
To stand there and watch and know all the time
I was gonna be next to have your nails torn off and those pincers and burning sticks driven into you untiI...
And things you can't even talk about.
Why should I stand all that?
For what? For him?
For a service that makes him like he's been to me?
He left me here, didn't he?
He knew what they'd do.
He wouldn't come after me, not him.
Regiment, service, duty!
Why should I stand what you did for them?
Why should I?
Why should any of us? Why?
I told you to forget it.
All right, Mac.
But I still don't understand why.
Why? Well...
Well, there are some things they don't teach you in military college.
Can't, I guess.
India's big, you know.
There are 300 million people and run by, uh, just a handfuI of men.
The-The-The job comes first.
Like old Ramrod, you can't let death move you, nor love.
And it's like...
How can I tell you what it's all about when I don't know myself?
"'The time has come,'the Walrus said,
"'To speak of many things
"'Of ships and shoes and sealing-wax,
Of cabbages and kings. "'
Oh, shut up!
You don't like poetry?
How should I know?
I never read any.
Perhaps something more rugged.
"Ever the faith endures,
"England, my England
"Take and break us, we are yours
"England, my own
"Life is good, joy runs high
"Between English earth and sky
"Death is death and we shall die
"to the Song on your bugles blown, England
To the stars on your bugles blown!"
If I had known I was going to say all this,
I would have brought my violin.
You weren't by any chance thinking how nice it would be if someone spilled the fire into that ammunition, were you?
About 200 yards,
I'd say.
Nearer a 100.
My last year in Oxford
I won the 220.
I ran the 100 in 10 flat at McGill.
It's nearer 200.
And where's McGill?
Mcgill's in MontreaI.
And this is a job for a 100-yard man.
Forget I'm your superior officer?
Forget you're my prisoner?
Toss you?
The cockroaches.
If Tania gets to the wall first, I win.
It's a go?
Mohammed Khan! Come on!
Tania, what's the matter?
Mohammed Khan again!
It's my job.
Your luck's as good as ever, Mac.
And now all I have to do is figure a way to get out of here.
That's all.
Too late, sir.
Hopeless to attack that strength.
If we retire now and that ammunition is distributed amongst the tribes...
You know what that means.
Yes, a costly job, sir.
I know.
But it's worth the whole regiment.
Squadron, wheel into line.
Gallop!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to wear a hole in the wall so we can all climb through.
It occurred to me, gentlemen that you might like to know what is to become of you.
I'm expecting a visit from your colonel in a few minutes.
I can assure you he will receive a very warm reception.
In the coming engagement, if the Colonel escapes
I shall send you all back to him alive.
If he is captured, you will all die.
In any case,
I shall have the pleasure of bringing the ColoneI face to face with a son who betrayed his Empire.
Very foolish,
Mr. Forsythe.
You should always temper courage with judgment.
That's a fooI thing to do.
We'll get it soon enough.
Did you get a gun, too?
Just about enough powder in those, I think, to blow that lock off.
It took us five days to think of that.
Us?
Take a little water and mix enough straw and mud to seal this lock.
What do we use for a fuse?
Mac.
Yeah.
This idea, I'm in on it.
It was my fault, all this, and if there's any way...
I mean-
Sure, I know.
Ready with that wick?
I mean, there's not much left that...
Well, I couldn't go back, like he said, not to the regiment or to England.
If anybody's going to take any chances,
I'll take them.
Sure you're in on it.
Never thought of it any other way.
Just stick close and do what you're told till we get this open.
There's someone on that tower with a machine gun.
Let me get it and cover you while you make a run for it.
All right.
Look, I've got a hunch we're going to get out of this.
We can't let the old man or anybody know what's happened.
Mohammed Khan!
Mohammed Khan!
This way.
All right, Mac, you keep me covered.
I can make it from here.
Bugles. Trumpets.
Man needs seasoning.
Poetry!
Mac! Mac, I... I...
He did it for me.
To undo what I did!
The last thing
Mac asked you... the old man mustn't know.
It's just as good a way of paying what you owe.
Mother McGregor.
Lt. John Forsythe by command of His Majesty the King-Emperor,
I confer upon you the distinguished service order.
Second Lt. Donald Stone,
41st Bengal Lancers.
For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.
He attacked single-handed, a group of the enemy and killed their leader thus demoralizing hostile forces at a moment when the success of our arms at Mogala was in the balance.
Second Lt. Donald Stone by Command of His Majesty the King-Emperor
I confer upon you the distinguished service order.
Lt. Alan McGregor
41st Bengal Lancers, deceased.
For valor.
At the sacrifice of his life he destroyed enemy ammunition supplies contributing thereby to the success of our arms in the action at Mogala.
His Majesty the King-Emperor has been graciously pleased to confer posthumously the Victoria Cross upon the late
Lt. McGregor.
In accordance with the custom of this regiment
I place this cross upon the saddlecloth of his horse.
May I go out now,
Miss Simpson?
Has it stopped snowing?
Not quite.
If it has stopped when your sister returns, perhaps she will take you out.
Oh, dear.
Here, kitty.
Suppose it never stops.
Suppose the man in charge of the snow has forgotten how to stop it.
Don't you think you had better work a while at your sampler?
No, thank you.
Oh, dear.
Hello, Sir Turtle.
You really must stop that,
Your Majesty. Stop it, I say!
Stop what?
The White Queen just knocked over the White King.
She never does look where she's going.
Alice, you know you are not supposed to play with your father's chessmen.
But I wasn't playing.
She deliberately bumped into His
Majesty and knocked him off his feet.
Alice, are you sure that that is true?
Well, I saw it.
Alice.
Yes, Miss Simpson.
At any rate, Your Majesty, stop bumping into your husband.
And you might tidy up a bit.
A white rabbit!
All dressed up in a muffler and overcoat and big woolly shoes.
There. It's gone into its nice warm rabbit hole.
It looked so funny all dressed up.
Alice, I am sure you know that there is no such thing as a rabbit dressed up in a muffler and an overcoat.
You must not say what is not true.
Well, it...
It wasn't untrue exactly.
I think you had better finish your tea.
There is another egg for you to eat.
I did eat both eggs, but I put one of them all back together again.
Alice!
Yes, Miss Simpson.
The looking-glass room.
You see, Dinah, as soon as I hold you up, the little girl in the looking-glass room holds up another cat just like you.
Oh, Dinah, wouldn't you like to see what the looking-glass house is like?
You know, Dinah, there is a looking-glass house.
First, there's the room you can see through the glass.
That's just the same as our sitting room, only the things go the other way.
You'd love living there.
But, of course, I don't know whether looking-glass milk is good to drink.
Well, anyway, then we would come to the hallway.
It is very like our own hallway as far as you can see, only it may be quite different beyond that.
Oh, Dinah,
wouldn't it be nice if we could get through to...
I can see all of the looking-glass room from here, all but a bit.
I would so like to see that little bit just behind the fireplace.
Do you think, Dinah, that if I pressed very, very hard and tried to look straight down, that I might...
Why, why...
Well, I knew this part of the room would be different.
But I do wish the looking-glass chair had moved when I moved ours.
There seems no other way.
If I could only fall like that all the time!
Can't be English.
Of course.
It's the looking-glass room.
Why, it's Uncle and Aunt!
I knew that if you could really get behind a picture,
you'd see the backs of people.
Poor Uncle Gilbert.
His trousers are all patched.
My dear niece, how would you like being framed in one pair of trousers for
20 years without being patched?
It must be very difficult.
It is.
But after all, it's only the front of a picture that counts, really.
Of course.
That is all.
What did you say?
But your hands say
20 minutes to 4:00.
I never let my left hand know what my right hand is doing.
This side of the looking glass has me all confused.
That's because everything is backward on your side.
Why, I...
I never...
Mama! Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
What's that?
It's the voice of my child!
Your child!
Oh, my precious lily!
My imperial kitten!
I must be with my child.
Let me help you.
Mama! Mama!
Dear me.
There, there, my royal pawn.
Poor thing.
Watch out for the volcano.
It blew me up! Be sure you come up the regular way.
Don't get blown up.
You'll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate.
I'd far better help you.
No, no!
The King's men! Somebody call out the King's men!
I assure you, my dear, I shall never, never forget the horror of this moment.
Well, you will forget, unless you make a memorandum of it.
I shall be very happy to remind you.
We will not be reminded by a volcano.
I'm not a volcano, and
I'm not a cyclone, either.
Then you're either a cyclano or a volcone.
And...
Well, what time was that?
I really haven't any idea, but it's very late.
I must hurry or I shall have to go back through the looking glass
before I've seen what the rest of the house is like.
My, what a strange way to walk about the garden.
The Duchess! The Duchess! Won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I shall be too late!
My ears and whiskers, how late it is getting!
Well, after such a fall as this,
I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs.
I wish Dinah were here.
That's such pretty music.
Oh, dear.
Ouch.
Goodbye, dear feet.
Oh, will I ever get to the beautiful garden?
Oh!
Oh, Mouse!
Do you know the way out of this pool, oh, Mouse?
I'm very tired of swimming about here.
Perhaps you don't understand English.
I daresay you're a French mouse.
That's French for,
"Where is my cat?"
I beg your pardon. I quite forgot you didn't like cats.
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Oh, Mouse!
Not like cats?
Would you like cats if you were me?
Don't be angry. I wish I could show you our cat Dinah.
You'd take quite a fancy to her.
She's such a dear, quiet thing, and so good at catching mice.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I hate you!
I hate cats!
My whole family hates cats.
Nasty, low, vulgar things!
Oh, dear!
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Cats! Cats!
Cats!
William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the
English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
Who are you, please?
I am a dodo.
How do you do?
My name is Alice.
And you are very wet.
I'm afraid I am, but there isn't much I can do about getting dry.
History is the driest thing I know.
Shall we dry you with history?
I'd be much obliged if you could.
Listen well.
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria, found it advisable to go with Edgar Aetheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
William's conduct at first was moderate, but the insolence of his Normans...
How are you getting on, my dear?
Beautifully, thank you.
Shall I put you to sleep now?
No, thank you!
Then you'd best run along.
I'm about to recite some dates.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Goodbye.
1585, Shakespeare was born,
1616, Shakespeare died...
Who are you?
I hardly know, sir, just at present.
At least, I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I must have changed several times since then.
What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.
I can't explain myself, because I'm not myself, you see.
I don't see!
I can't put it more clearly,
for I can't understand it myself to begin with.
And being so many different sizes in one day is confusing.
It isn't.
Well, when some day you turn into a chrysalis, and after that into a butterfly,
you'll find it a bit queer, won't you?
Not a bit!
Well, maybe you wouldn't, but it would certainly feel very queer to me.
You? Who are you?
I think you ought to tell me who you are first.
Why?
Good day, sir.
Come back. I have something important to say.
Yes?
Keep your temper.
Is that all?
No.
So you think you've changed, do you?
I'm afraid I have, sir.
What size do you want to be?
I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind.
Three inches is such a horrid height to be.
I am three inches high! It's a very good height to be!
I'm sure it must be, sir, but you see, I'm not used to it.
You'll get used to it in time.
One side will make you grow taller.
The other side will make you grow shorter.
One side of...
Of what?
The mushroom.
Which side will make me grow larger?
The large-making side, of course.
I'll take a little of both to make sure.
Oh, dear, now I'm too big again, oh, Caterpillar.
Mr. Caterpillar, sir, where are you?
Whoever lives here, it would never do to come upon them this size.
Why, I should frighten them out of their wits.
For the Duchess.
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.
My compliments to the Queen.
My compliments to the Duchess.
There's no sort of use in your knocking.
Please, sir, how am I to get in?
I shall sit here till tomorrow.
I'm sorry you were hit, but how am I to get in?
I shall sit here for days and days.
But what am I to do?
Anything you like.
Please watch out for the baby!
She nearly killed the poor little thing.
If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round much faster than it does.
Speak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Here, you can nurse it a bit if you like.
Now, I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.
Don't grunt. That's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.
What am I going to do with this creature when I get it home?
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,
I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!
There's no mistake about you now. You're a pig!
You would have grown up to be a dreadfully ugly child, but you do make a handsome pig, I think.
Why do you grin, oh, cat?
Because I'm a Cheshire Cat, that's why.
Well, then,
Cheshire puss, would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
I don't care much where.
Then it doesn't matter which way you go.
So long as
I get somewhere.
You're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.
Do you play croquet with the Queen today?
I should like it very much, but I haven't been invited yet.
You'll see me there.
Must you go so soon?
By the by, what became of the baby?
I'd nearly forgotten to ask.
It turned into a pig.
I thought it would.
Did you say pig or fig?
I said pig
and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly.
You make one quite giddy.
All right.
Don't you wish you could do this?
Well, I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat?
No room! No room!
No room! No room!
There's plenty of room!
Have some wine?
I don't see any wine.
There isn't any.
It wasn't very civil of you to offer it.
Your hair needs cutting.
You should not make personal remarks. It's very rude.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
I believe I can answer that.
Do you mean you can find the answer to it?
Exactly so.
You should say what you mean.
What day of the month is it?
Fourth.
Ah! Two days wrong.
I told you that butter wouldn't suit the works.
Oh!
Some crumbs must have got in it as well.
Hmm. I put it in with a bread knife.
It was the best butter, you know.
What a funny watch! It tells the days of the month,
but doesn't tell what "o'clock" it is.
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
Why... Why, no. I give it up.
What is the answer?
I haven't the slightest idea!
Nor I!
I think you might do something better with time than wasting it asking a lot of riddles that have no answers.
Don't you speak about Time. I daresay you've never even spoken to him.
Perhaps not.
Time and I quarreled last March, just before he went mad, you know.
It was at a great concert given by the Queen of Hearts,
and I had to sing, "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat How I wonder what you're at"
You know the song, perhaps?
I've heard something like it.
It goes on, you know, like this.
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
Twinkle, twinkle...
Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled,
"He's murdering the Time!
Off with his head!"
And ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask.
It's always 6:00 now.
Is that why all the tea things are out here?
Yes, that's it.
It's always teatime, and we have no time to wash the tea things in between.
Take some more tea.
I haven't had any yet, so I can't take more.
You mean you can't take less. It is very easy to take more than nothing.
I want a clean cup.
It's the stupidest tea party
I ever was at in all my life!
Very curious!
Would you please tell me why are you painting those roses?
I...
Well, as a matter of fact, Miss, this tree should have been a red rose tree and we put in a white one by mistake, and if the Queen should find out,
we'll all have our heads cut off.
So, you see, Miss, we're doing our best before she comes back to paint...
The Queen!
The Queen!
The Queen!
Come, come, get up!
Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts.
Her Majesty, the Queen!
Off with his head!
Off with his head!
What is your name, child?
My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Nonsense!
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Consider, my dear.
She's only a child.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
And besides, this is the executioners' day off.
It is, is it? Well, they shall lose their heads for this!
Can you play croquet?
Yes.
Then let the game begin at once.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Must I behead you all?
Here, take it. Play.
Off with some heads.
You're pointing the wrong way for a mallet!
Pardon me. My back hurts.
Well!
Don't look at me.
I'm as mixed up as you are!
This game's slowing up.
Off with some heads!
Where are my victims?
Search the hedges.
Thrash the bushes.
Shake the trees!
How glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing.
How did you like your game?
Well, it was very exciting.
Of course it is.
And the moral of that is,
"Be what you would like to be."
Or, to put it more simply, "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise
"than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been
"wasn't otherwise than what you had been
"would have appeared to them to be otherwise."
I should understand that better if it were written down.
I can't quite follow it as you say it.
That's nothing to what
I could say, if I chose.
And the moral of that is...
It's a fine day,
Your Majesty.
I give you fair warning. Either you or your head must be off at once!
Please, Your Majesty, could you make it go away?
Queen! Queen!
Where are you, Queen?
What fun!
What is the fun?
The Queen.
They never really execute anybody she condemns, you know.
The King...
The King pardons everybody.
I'm very happy to know that, I'm sure.
Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?
Why... Why, no. I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.
It's what mock turtle soup's made from.
Come here, will you,
Mock Turtle, old thing?
What is his sorrow?
It's all his fancy.
He hasn't got no sorrow.
No sorrow, indeed.
Mine are the sorrows of a sorrowful sorrow.
Mine are the woes of a woeful woe.
Mine are the...
This here young lady, she wants for to know your history, she do.
I'll tell it her.
Sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.
Once I was a real turtle.
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!
When we were little, we went to school in the sea.
The master was an old turtle.
We used to call him Tortoise.
Why did you call him
Tortoise if he wasn't one?
We called him Tortoise because he taught us.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.
We went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it.
I never said I didn't. You did.
Hold your tongue!
We had the best of educations.
In fact, we went to school every day.
I've been to a day school, too.
We learned
French and music.
I only took the regular course.
What was that?
Reeling and writhing to begin with.
And then the different branches of arithmetic, ambition, distraction, uglification and derision.
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?
Ten hours the first day and nine the next and so on.
That's why they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.
Then the 11th day must have been a holiday.
Of course.
And how did you manage on the 12th day?
Well, that's enough about lessons.
Shall we play games, or shall the Mock Turtle sing?
Oh, a song, please, if the
Mock Turtle would be so kind.
No accounting for tastes.
Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, old fellow?
In a moment.
Beautiful soup
Who cares for fish
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup
Beautiful soup, beautiful soup
Soup of the evening
Beautiful soup, beautiful...
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Much faster!
Are we nearly there?
Nearly there?
Why, we passed it
10 minutes ago. Faster!
It's all marked out like a chessboard.
Of course it's a chessboard,
and life is a chessboard, and you are a Queen's pawn.
You will go immediately to the fourth square, which you should reach in exactly no time.
Did you remark something?
I didn't know I had to make one just then.
You should have told me how kind it is of me to tell you all this.
No questions? Very well, then, no answers.
Open your mouth wide when you speak, and always speak in French
if you can't think of the English for something.
Turn out your toes as you walk
and always say "Your
Majesty," and so forth.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow.
Contrary-wise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.
I'm sure I'm very sorry.
I was wondering which is the best way out of this wood.
Would you tell me, please?
You've begun wrong.
The first thing in a visit is to say,
"How do you do?"
And shake hands.
I hope you're not much tired.
Why, nohow, but thank you very much for asking.
So much obliged.
You like poetry?
Yes, pretty well.
Some poetry.
But would you tell me first which road leads out of the woods?
What shall I repeat to her?
The Walrus and the
Carpenter is the longest.
"The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might
"He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
"And this was odd because it was The middle of the night
"The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
"They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand
"'lf this were only cleared away'
They said, 'it would be grand'
"'lf seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year
"'Do you suppose,' the Walrus said
"'That they could get it clear?"'
"'I doubt it,' said the
Carpenter And shed a bitter tear"
"'Oh, oyster, come and walk with us, ' The Walrus did beseech
"'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk Along the briny beach'
"They could not do with more than four To give a hand to each
"The eldest oyster looked at him But never a word he said
"The eldest oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head
"Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed
"But younger oysters hurried up All eager for the treat
"Their coats were brushed
Their faces washed
"Their shoes were clean and neat
"And this was odd because, you know They hadn't any feet
"'The time has come,' the Walrus said 'To talk of many things
"'Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings"
"'And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings"'
"'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said 'ls what we chiefly need
"'Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
"'Now, if you're ready, oysters dear We can begin to feed'
"'But not on us, ' the oysters cried Turning a little blue
"'After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do!'
"'The night is fine,' the Walrus said 'Do you admire the view?'
"'I weep for you,' the Walrus said 'I deeply sympathize'
"With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size
"Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes
"'Oh, oyster,' said the Carpenter
'You've had a pleasant run
"'Shall we be trotting home again?' But answer came there none
"And this was scarcely odd because They'd eaten every one"
Well, they were both very unpleasant characters.
But at any rate, I'd better be leaving the wood
because it's really getting very dark. Well, goodbye.
Look!
Do you see that?
It's only a rattle.
Only an old rattle, quite old and broken.
I knew it was.
It's spoiled, of course.
My nice new rattle.
Of course, you agree to have a battle?
I suppose so.
Only she must help us to dress up, you know.
Of course!
"Tweedledee and Tweedledum
Agreed to have a battle
"For Tweedledee said Tweedledum
"Had spoiled his nice new rattle
"Just then down flew a monstrous crow As black as a tar barrel
"Which frightened both the heroes so
"They quite forgot their quarrel"
I hope you're good at pinning and tying string.
All this has got to go on somehow or other.
This is to keep my head from being cut off.
You know, one of the most serious things that can happen to one in a battle
is to get one's head cut off.
Do I look very pale?
Well, yes, a little.
I'm very brave generally, only today I happen to have a headache.
Well, I've got a toothache.
I'm far worse than you.
Then you'd both better not fight today.
We must have a bit of a fight.
Let's fight till 6:00 and then have dinner.
There's only one sword, but you can have the umbrella. It's sharper.
Only we must begin quick.
It's getting very, very dark.
And darker and darker.
What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes!
Why, I do believe it's got wings.
It's the crow!
The crow!
May I put your shawl straight for you?
I don't know what's the matter with it.
It's out of temper, I think.
I've pinned it here and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.
It can't go on straight, you know, if you put all the pins on one side.
And dear me, what a state your hair is in!
Oh, the brush has got entangled in it.
And I lost the comb yesterday.
There, now you look better.
My finger's bleeding.
What's the matter?
Have you pricked your finger?
I haven't pricked it yet, but I soon shall.
When do you expect to do it?
When I fasten my shawl again, the broach will come undone.
Watch out, you're holding it all wrong.
Now you understand the way things happen here.
But why don't you scream now?
Why, I've done all the screaming already.
Now, what would be the good of doing it all over again?
I suppose so.
Well, it's a bit lighter now.
I'm glad that crow is gone.
I hope your finger's better now.
Much better. Better, better, better.
What is it you want to buy?
I should like to buy an egg, please.
I never put things into people's hands.
That would never do.
You must get it for yourself.
What a strange egg!
It keeps growing much faster than it should! Curiouser and curiouser!
It's bigger than a chicken!
Why, it's...
It's Humpty-Dumpty!
Don't stand there staring at me as if I were an egg.
Tell me your name and your business.
My name is Alice.
It's a stupid enough name.
What does it mean?
Must a name mean something?
Of course it must.
My name means the shape I am, and a right handsome shape it is.
With your name, you might be any shape.
Why do you sit out here all alone?
Because there's nobody with me.
Did you think
I couldn't answer that?
Ask another.
Don't you think you'd be safer on the ground?
That wall is so very narrow.
Of course I don't think so.
Why, if I ever did fall off,
which there's no chance of, but if I did...
If I did fall, the King has promised me...
To send all his horses and all his men.
Ah, so, you know. All his horses and all his men.
They'd pick me up again in a minute, they would.
However, this conversation is going on a little too fast.
Let's go back to the last remark but one.
I'm afraid I can't quite remember it.
In that case, we start afresh,
and it's my turn to choose a subject.
How old did you say you were?
Twelve years and four months.
Wrong. You never said a word like it.
I thought you meant,
"How old are you?"
If I'd meant that,
I'd have said that.
Twelve years and four months.
An uncomfortable sort of age.
Now, my advice would have been to leave off at 12, but it's too late now.
What a beautiful belt!
Or is it a beautiful collar?
It is a most provoking thing when a person doesn't know a collar from a belt.
I know it's very ignorant of me.
It's a collar, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.
It's a present from the White King and Queen.
Is it really?
They gave it to me for an un-birthday present.
I beg your pardon?
I am not offended, and it isn't respectable to beg.
I mean, what is an un-birthday present?
A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.
I like birthday presents best.
You don't know what you're talking about.
How many days are there in a year?
Three hundred and sixty-five.
And how many birthdays have you?
One.
And if you take that from 365, what remains?
Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.
Well then, there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday presents.
Certainly.
And only one for birthday presents.
That's glory for you!
I don't know what you mean by glory.
Of course you don't, till I tell you.
I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you.
But glory doesn't mean that.
When I use a word, it means what I choose it to mean, neither more or less.
The question is whether you can make words mean different things.
The question is, which is to be the master, you or the word? That's all.
However, I can manage the whole lot.
Impenetrability, that's what I say.
Would you tell me, please, what that means?
I meant by impenetrability that we've had enough of the subject, and it would be just as well if you would mention what you mean to do next,
as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.
Fancy it meaning all that.
You seem very clever at explaining words, sir.
Would you kindly tell me the meaning of a poem called Jabberwocky?
I read it a long time ago.
I can, but I won't.
That's all. Goodbye.
Goodbye, till we meet again.
I shouldn't know you if we did meet.
You're so exactly like other people.
The face is what one generally goes by.
That's just it. Your face is the same as everybody's.
The two eyes, so.
Nose in the middle, mouth under.
Now, if your two eyes were on the same side of your nose, or your mouth on the top, that would be some help.
It wouldn't look nice.
Wait till you've tried.
Watch out!
Help! Help! I'm falling!
Tell the King!
Tell him to bring his horses and his men!
Help!
What happened?
We ran into each other,
Your Majesty.
Good. I rather fancied something like that had happened.
Oh, Your Majesty,
Humpty-Dumpty fell off the wall!
I know, I know.
Four-thousand, two-hundred and seven of my soldiers are on the way.
Two without horses.
If all this King's horses and men
can't put him back together again, nobody can.
I'm glad Humpty will be all right. I was worried.
Well, don't be.
Look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my three messengers.
I see nobody on the road.
Oh, I only wish
I had such eyes!
To be able to see nobody, and at that distance!
Oh!
It's too, too bad!
Can I help you, sir?
On or off?
You are on.
In a short time
I shall be off again.
I'm so sorry. Are you the King's messenger?
I am the White Knight.
I see you're admiring my little box.
It's my own invention, to keep clothes and sandwiches in.
You see, I carry it upside down so the rain can't come in.
But the things can get out.
Do you know the lid is open?
Then if all the things have fallen out, the box is no use without them.
Can you guess why I did that?
I can't imagine.
In hopes some bees may make a nest in it. Then I should get the honey.
But you've got a beehive, or something like one, fastened to the saddle.
It's a very good beehive, too.
One of the best kind, but not a single bee has come near it yet.
That other thing's a mousetrap.
I suppose the mice keep the bees out
or the bees keep the mice out. I don't know which.
It isn't very likely there would be any mice on a horse's back.
Not very likely, perhaps,
but I don't choose to have them running all about.
You see, I'm well provided for everything.
That's the reason the horse has those anklets around his feet.
What are they for?
To guard against the bites of sharks. It's my own invention.
But let's go on. I'll go with you to the edge of the wood.
I hope you've got your hair well-fastened on.
Only the usual way.
That's hardly enough. You see, the wind is so strong here.
It's strong as soup.
Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?
Not yet, but I have a plan for keeping the hair from falling off.
I should like to hear it very much.
First, you take an upright stick, then you make your hair creep up it like a vine.
Now, the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down.
Things never fall upward, you know. It's my own invention.
You may try it if you like.
I'm a great hand at inventing things.
Now, I daresay you noticed the last time you picked me up,
I was looking rather thoughtful.
You were a little grave.
Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate.
Would you like to hear it?
Very much, indeed.
Well, I'll tell you how I came to think of it. I said to myself,
"The only difficulty is with the feet.
"The head's high enough already."
Now, first I put my head on top of the gate, then my head's high enough, then I stand on my head, then my feet are high enough.
Then I'm over.
Sir Knight!
If there were only a gate down here,
I'd be in excellent position to cross it.
How can you go on talking so quietly with your head in a ditch?
What does it matter where my body happens to be?
My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, I once invented a new pudding during the meat course.
In time to have it cooked for the next course? Hmm.
That was quick work.
Well, not the next course.
In fact, I don't believe that pudding ever was cooked.
What did you mean it to be made of?
Well, it began with blotting paper.
That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.
Not very nice alone, but imagine how good it would be mixed with other things, such as gunpowder and sealing wax.
And here I must leave you.
This is the end of the wood.
You've only a few yards to go.
Down the hill, across that little brook, and then you'll be a queen.
At last!
But you'll stay and see me off first?
I shan't be long.
You'll wait?
Of course I'll wait.
I think it'll encourage me.
Thank you very much for coming so far out of your way.
For that, I shall expect you to cry a good deal as I go.
The poor, dear Knight.
He's the nicest person yet.
Well, here I am.
What's this?
A crown! A golden crown!
I'm a queen!
I'm a queen!
How dare you say that you're a queen.
What right have you to call yourself so?
You can't be a queen, you know,
till you've passed the proper examination, and the sooner we begin it, the better. Be seated.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm ready, Your Majesties.
Can you do addition?
Now what's one and one and one and one and one and one, one and one?
I don't know.
I lost count.
She can't do addition.
Can you answer any useful questions? How is bread made?
I know that.
You take some flour...
Where do you pick the flower, in a garden or in the hedges?
It isn't picked at all, it's ground.
But how many acres of ground?
I wish you wouldn't leave out so many things!
Oh, dear.
You know any languages?
What's the French for "fiddle-de-dee"?
Fiddle-de-dee's not English.
Whoever said it was?
Well, if you'll tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is,
I'll tell you the French for it.
Queens never make bargains!
I'm so sleepy.
She's tired, poor thing.
So, smooth her hair, lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.
I haven't any nightcap, and I don't know any soothing lullabies.
I'll have to do it myself.
Hush-a-bye lady in Alice's lap
When the feast's ready we've time for a nap
When the feast's over we'll go to the ball
Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all
Now that you know the words, sing it through to me. I'm sleepy, too.
Now what am I to do?
Do wake up.
To the looking-glass world
It was Alice that said
"I've a scepter in hand
"I've a crown on my head"
No admittance until week after next.
Why... Why, how dare you!
Fill up the glasses as quick as you can
And sprinkle the table
With buttons and bran
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice with 30 times three
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice
With 30 times three
Then put in the glasses, molasses and ink
And anything else that is pleasant to drink
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times nine
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times 90 times
90 times nine
You've missed the soup and fish! Serve the roast!
You seem a little shy. Let me introduce you to that leg of mutton.
Alice, Leg of Mutton.
Leg of Mutton, Alice.
How do you do?
May I give you a slice?
Certainly not!
It isn't etiquette to cut somebody you've been introduced to.
Remove the roast!
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you...
Please don't introduce the Pudding, or we shall get no dinner at all.
May I give you some?
Pudding, Alice.
Alice, Pudding.
What impertinence!
How would you like it if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature?
Make a remark.
It's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the Pudding.
Well...
You'd better prepare.
We're about to drink to your health. Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice!
Queen Alice!
She ought to make a speech. A speech!
So she ought!
A speech! A speech!
A speech!
A speech!
Speech!
Speech!
I rise to return thanks.
Take care! Something's going to happen! Something's going to happen!
Here I am!
There was a looking-glass room, and you were the Red Queen.
There was a whole looking-glass country.
I wouldn't trust myself in that jungle if it was me, sir.
Well, I will.
We'll leave as soon as we can after Arlington gets here.
- What time is it?
- 2:30 p.m.
What? Then I've got to go down to meet the boat.
Mr. Arlington can have this room when he arrives. I'll use the lean-to.
Righto.
Blimey.
I remember the last time
I was given those orders.
It was when Mr. Parker told me to get that room ready for Miss Jane... the day she arrived.
She stood right in front of that mirror, putting cold cream on her face.
Right where you're standing now.
Beamish, I want you to get Saidi to fix up a bath for Mr. Arlington.
Yes, sir.
- He'll want one as soon as he gets here.
- Righto.
Thank you.
- These are my private quarters.
- Sorry, we didn't mean to intrude.
There was nobody in the store, so we came here.
If you want to buy anything,
Beamish will handle it.
Yes, indeed, we have some lovely things.
Mrs. Cutten was mad about them.
No, we just dropped in for a chat.
That's rather a large safari you're organizing for a hunt.
I haven't time to talk about it now.
I've to meet the boat.
- Sorry.
- Later, perhaps.
Perhaps.
- Couple of nice lads.
- Yes, very.
Keep your eye on the store, Beamish, while I'm away.
You can depend upon me, sir.
- Hiya, Mr. Holt!
- Hello, Edward.
Where's Mr. Arlington?
This is his luggage, but I think he's in his cabin.
- Have some boys take it to the store.
- This minute, sir.
Thanks.
Say, boy, which one is Mr...
- Martin!
- Well, Harry, you old devil!
I thought you'd never get here.
- Easy.
- Softening up a bit?
Wait till I've been here a week, man.
Lip rouge.
Better go back in your room and clean up a bit.
Just a minute. That's not my room.
This is my friend Mr. Holt.
- Madame Feronde, Harry.
- How do you do?
- Charmed, sir.
- Here it is!
- Monsieur, I found your bag.
- Thanks very much.
This is Madame Feronde's husband.
My friend Mr. Holt.
How do you do?
Any friend of Monsieur Arlington, we are so pleased to meet.
My wife says she will never forget the funny stories he's told her.
- Goodbye. Hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Feronde. Goodbye, Madame.
Au revoir.
- I'm having your things sent for.
- Good.
- Au revoir.
- Goodbye.
Charming fellow.
- How was the trip?
- It had its moments.
- Same old Arlington.
- What do you mean, old?
- Mr. Arlington, I presume.
- Yes.
- This is Henry Van Ness.
- This is my friend Tom Pierce.
How do you do?
Mr. Holt tells us you're going after a leopard.
Yes, and some rhino, too.
A bit of hunting, anyway.
- Van Ness and I got some leopard lately.
- We'll drop in and talk about it sometime.
- If you don't mind.
- No, not at all.
Tomorrow night.
You're not leaving before then?
We'll still be here. Come along, Martin.
Who are they?
They got wind of what we're after, and they wanted in with us.
Four white men might be better than two on this trip.
You don't know those fellows, Martin.
If four of us start out and we found the ivory, only two would get back... and they wouldn't be us.
- That kind?
- Exactly.
- What'd you tell them?
- I played dumb.
Said that you were wealthy and financing a hunting trip.
- Anyway, the wealthy part was true.
- Think so? I'm dead broke, Harry.
- So is the Bank of England.
- No, really. I'm stony.
I've staked my last penny on this pipe dream of yours.
- It had better be good.
- You're not serious!
I am. I've lost everything.
It's left me with an obsession to get it all back.
Anyhow, as long as I get it.
But when I do...
I'm going to sit on top of the pile with a gun and watch it grow.
Never thought I'd be in the same boat as you financially.
You had to go broke to get me there.
- Quite a place you have here.
- How do you do, sir?
- This is Beamish. He runs the store.
- How do you do?
- Welcome, Mr. Arlington.
- Thank you.
Come this way, sir.
I've fixed a nice bath for you.
I fancied you could use one.
Amazing foresight, Beamish.
I could use three baths.
Well, well!
- Fresh from the Folies Bergère?
- That's enough water.
A ceremonial dance.
Something to do with fertility.
- Personal or agricultural?
- Both, I think.
They'll be heading backcountry tomorrow.
Did you bring the dresses and things that I wrote for?
Everything. And a few extras.
I suppose you thought I was crazy.
So your lady turned you down for a sort of a wild man from Borneo?
It's a bit fantastic, isn't it?
A well-bred English girl living in the treetops...
- with a glorified native ape-man.
- Tarzan's as white as we are.
She's Parker's daughter.
She stayed behind when he died up there.
She's hit you pretty hard, hasn't she?
I'm in love with her, if that's what you mean.
- Where shall I put these things?
- Over by the table.
Go on over there. Put it down easy, now.
Come on, now.
I'm beginning to understand why you wanted Paris gowns.
Charm her back to civilization?
It's foolish, maybe... but I thought if she saw some of the latest dresses...
got the feel of silk, scent of perfume...
Women are funny about things like that, you know.
Might remind her.
She's been up there nearly a year now.
Look here, Harry...
I've got everything I have in this.
Did you drag me out to Africa to go after ivory or a woman?
Ivory.
- But if I can get the girl...
- Well, if that's the way...
I don't mind helping you kidnap your lady as long as we get the other first.
- I'll get it for you, sir. Just a moment.
- Thanks.
You know, if you have money, women aren't hard to get.
No harm intended, sir.
How much ivory is there really up there?
More than the largest safari can carry back.
Strange instinct that leads elephants to one spot to die.
- Fortunate one for us, though.
- I'm not complaining... if you're sure you can find the burial ground again.
I made a map of it on the way back.
14-day trek, you say?
With luck, to the foot of the Mutia Escarpment.
What's that?
The Mutia Escarpment, I mean.
It's a mountain barrier that divides the Africa we know...
from a country that no white man has ever seen and come back, except myself.
Natives hold it sacred.
- Taboo?
- Deadly.
It's the Juju of the Masai, the Wakabaranda... and all the tribes from the east to the west coast.
We came across a Zulu warrior once that had been killed by his tribe... because he tried to climb it.
What about our safari? How will they feel?
They're mostly village boys.
They'll be frightened.
But I got one safari across.
- How many did you get back?
- Myself.
Promises to be something more than a pleasure jaunt.
Yes, indeed.
Yes, Saidi.
Need safari boy, bwana. Make new pick.
What are you saying?
We have 50 first-class boys.
The chiefs have promised 200 more runners once you drum out the call.
- Fifty boy "mu/u,"bwana.
- Gone?
All boy gone make safari with Bwana Pierce and Bwana Van Ness.
- Pierce and Van Ness?
- What's the matter?
The map!
- Beamish!
- Coming, sir.
- They looked like slippery customers.
- That they were.
- Were Pierce and Van Ness in here again?
- Only for a moment, sir.
Saidi, send out the runners, drum up the tribes. Get 300 boys.
- How long ago did they leave?
- Sun here, bwana. Three, four hours.
- How soon can we get started, Harry?
- With equipment, six hours.
They'll have 10 hours' start.
Let's go without safari.
We'd be outnumbered and wouldn't have a chance.
Suppose we don't catch them.
What happens then?
I think I can find the barrier again.
But above that, Tarzan is our only hope.
- Come on, Saidi, keep them going.
- Yes, bwana.
- Saidi!
- Yes, bwana.
Give me a hand here. Here we go, boy.
Take him over here. Take that box.
Tell the boys to take a rest.
- What's the trouble?
- Bearers are done in.
I thought we'd better give them a breather here.
Tell those boys to keep the ammunition boxes out of the water.
Yes, bwana.
- How many men have we lost?
- Eight.
We figured 10 for the whole trek.
We didn't figure this pace.
Look at the condition they're in.
What is it?
They came across a white man's campfire a few hundred yards ahead.
A white man's campfire?
Pierce and Van Ness.
- He says it's still warm.
- Still warm?
- Come on, let's have a look.
- All right. Go ahead.
- My gun.
- No.
If they're close, they'll hear us.
Easy, Martin.
How old do you think it is?
Take cover!
- Pierce and Van Ness?
- Couldn't be anyone else.
- Notice the delayed sound?
- About 500 yards off, I'd say.
- Shall we have it out?
- We'd better not.
The base of the Escarpment's clearer.
Rather meet them there.
All right. You know the country better than I do.
- We'll parallel their trail.
- Right.
No use in walking into an ambush.
All right, boys, come on.
Saidi, get them on their feet, and we'll swing off a bit to the left.
Yes, bwana.
I don't like the sound of that chant.
I've hated it for days.
This is different.
They're frightened about something.
What's with them?
- What's the matter, Saidi?
- Mutia.
What?
It is the Mutia.
- It isn't any too soon to suit me.
- And a day ahead of schedule!
Juju, that's why they're frightened.
We can't lose time just because they're afraid.
- Come on, Saidi, get them going!
- Yes, bwana.
Boys, get on your feet.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
- What's the matter with him?
- He afraid of Mutia.
- Not go, bwana.
- Get into line.
- Drop that spear and get into line!
- No!
Anybody else that doesn't want to go?
- Saidi, take the lead. I'll stay back here.
- Yes, bwana.
- Whip would have done just as well.
- Perhaps you're right.
He could have carried 150 pounds of ivory.
- What's the matter, Saidi?
- Van Ness safari boy, bwana.
Gaboni kill.
- Gaboni?
- Yes, bwana.
Gaboni all time arrow here.
Couldn't be Gabonis.
They wouldn't leave the body here.
- Why not?
- They're cannibals.
First make kill. Bye, embark, come back.
The wound looks pretty fresh.
They can't be far away.
The map.
Pierce must have it.
I wonder if he got...
Is this it?
The part we don't need.
If they'd made the Mutia, no tribe would've followed them.
Sacred ground.
- What's that?
- Drum. Gaboni, bwana.
It's pretty close.
- We'd better make a run for it.
- Right.
Come on, Saidi, get them going!
- Make a stand?
- No, that's what Pierce and Van Ness did.
All right, come on!
Bwana, Mutia!
The Escarpment! Come on!
- Here they come.
- They'll never follow. The Mutia is sacred.
- He was on the Mutia!
- Lucky superstition for us.
We're out of range now.
What about a breather here?
We've got to make the top before dark.
Come on.
- Keep them going, Saidi.
- Yes, bwana.
- What's the trouble, Saidi?
- Too hard, bwana.
Let them stay where they are and pass the loads to the man ahead.
Yes, bwana.
- I hope we've got the worst behind us.
- We have.
Saidi, send the men for cover!
That's Tarzan! He's calling them off.
Come along.
No use in starting a riot, Martin.
Kill one, and we'll have to kill all.
Am I glad to see you!
You got here just in time.
That's it, Harry. I told you I'd come back.
- Come back?
- How's Jane?
Man.
Yes, Tarzan. This is Martin, my friend.
Martin my friend.
You don't know how glad I am to see you, old fellow.
Harry, Martin, my friend...
- Tarzan.
- That's right. But where is Jane?
Where is she? How is she?
How are you? Very well. Thank you.
- Has anything happened to her?
- Much man.
Yes, Tarzan, that's our safari. But...
There she is now.
Cheetah!
Cheetah baby.
Harry, I'm so glad you came.
Jane, I was so worried about you.
- When I saw Tarzan alone...
- You're not wounded?
- No.
- I was frightened.
- We came as fast as we could.
- You knew we were coming?
Tarzan heard there was a battle, and I thought it must be you.
- He was coming to help you.
- Martin my friend.
Jane, this is Martin Arlington, my partner.
I thought you were a myth, and I'm still not sure.
I think I can understand that.
I hope this means
I'm accepted in polite society.
- Yes, you're one of our set now.
- Did you think I was never coming back?
I knew you'd be back.
But, you know, it's been a year!
It's been a long year, too.
There were times
I thought we'd never make it.
- Tarzan will guide you the rest of the way.
- He will?
- I promised Harry.
- That's perfect.
Jane, I want to talk to you for hours.
But some of my men are hurt.
I should take care of them first.
- Is there any water here?
- Yes, there's a stream over there.
- He says he'll help you with your men.
- That's fine. Come along.
You know...
even if there wasn't any ivory,
I'd be glad I made the trek now.
You'll be much gladder when you see how much ivory there is.
Well, I can't say
I don't care about a fortune.
You're hurt.
- It's nothing, a Gaboni arrow.
- They're poisonous.
- Careful, Tarzan, it's hot.
- Hot?
Yes, it's coffee.
I don't think you'll like it, darling.
- Like it?
- You never drink anything hot?
- Never.
- Don't you miss it, Jane, things like this?
I must say, it is rather nice to have a cup of coffee for a change.
Yes, Tarzan.
- Where is he going?
- To build a house.
- Build a house?
- It doesn't take Tarzan long.
We have a mansion in every glade.
You can't spend the rest of your life camping out.
- Don't you ever want to come back?
- No, Harry.
Wouldn't it be nice to live where there's a lot of other men around?
Just to remind the number one boy that there's a number two?
And possibly a number three.
But on the other hand...
there are no other women here to make a fool of my number one boy.
- Yes, I've noticed the scarcity of women.
- That's not very flattering to me.
Meeting you is what made me conscious of it.
Like a hungry man outside a restaurant window.
- Don't you miss the fun you used to have?
- I have fun.
Those June nights in England,
Murray's Club at Maidenhead.
- Moonlight on the Thames?
- Dance.
A glass of champagne... sitting with real people and listening to the music.
Real people. I wonder.
Well, at least the men are civilized.
- Does that make them any better?
- For women.
Men never get a proper sense of values until they've been about a bit.
Look at Cheetah.
There's your civilization for you.
Come on, where's your vanity?
Wouldn't you like to get all dressed up again?
Not that I have any complaints on that score.
Why, I had this specially designed for me.
You haven't completely lost your interest in clothes?
- What woman ever does?
- No smart one.
Good. Come along.
Why, Harry? What is it?
- Harry's got a surprise for you.
- Surprise?
You wait and see.
They're lovely!
- I'm glad you like them.
- Like them?
Harry, they're gorgeous!
- You are a darling!
- Give me a little credit.
I shopped all over Paris to get them for you.
Look at this little thing.
It isn't much bigger than a postage stamp, is it?
But it's smart.
You look like the Jane Parker
I used to know.
Makes me feel like her.
- Not much good for climbing trees.
- Not much.
These are rather sheer, I think.
Give them to me.
There's no jungle flower with a perfume like this.
Eyebrow pencil, lipstick...
Indelible. Doesn't come off when you're kissed.
I brought all the allurements.
For two bachelors, you seem to know a great deal about what women wear.
I've done my share of shopping.
Lovely.
Well, now I'd better find a dress.
This one is the same color... as the one you wore that night at the dance at Mrs. Cutten's.
How sweet of you to remember.
The effect seems to be to promise to show something... that's never quite shown.
- It's lined.
- They're like that now.
- They are?
- Yes, London's gone leg-conscious.
I'm glad you haven't.
I like you just as you are.
How styles have changed, haven't they?
I wouldn't have believed it possible in such a short time.
I probably wouldn't know how to wear this anyway.
- Try it on.
- Yes, we'll clear out of your boudoir.
A gramophone?
Are we going to have music?
These records are four months old, but they'll probably be new to you.
I'm going to try these on.
But I want you to understand...
- it's not going to make any difference.
- Difference?
- You want me to go back.
- You must go back.
- Why?
- You can't stay here.
Supposing anything happened to him.
You couldn't live.
- I don't think I'd want to.
- That's nonsense.
- Suppose he were to die.
- Why should he?
Anything can happen in this place.
Where would you be then?
Where would he be if I went back?
We'll let him come along, too.
Tarzan over there? Then he would die.
- Come on. You're holding up the show.
- Right.
Run along. I won't be a minute. Go on.
She's priceless.
A woman who's learned the abandon of a savage... yet she'd be at home in Mayfair.
- She's not interested in Mayfair.
- Nonsense.
She's weakening already, you lucky pup.
- I don't think so.
- You'll get her back.
This is raw nature, old man.
Survival of fittest.
Up here, the fittest means Tarzan, and he wouldn't let her go.
If she wants to go how can he stop her?
Good heavens, Martin, he's...
He's not an animal.
- Please, bwana?
- Yes, Saidi.
Moko bad sick.
Needle bad.
All right. I'll give him a hypo.
Where is he, Saidi?
Get out of there! Come on!
- What was that?
- Safari boys, curious about the music.
I love it.
Need any help?
- Do you always help ladies to dress?
- When they're lovely enough.
Voilà.
How's that?
Perfect. And I thought improvement impossible.
You see? Woman's greatest weapon is man's imagination.
Very becoming, too.
- Where's Harry?
- Sick native.
He'll be away for a few minutes, I hope.
Thank you.
Funny, isn't it?
You're the first woman
I ever had to coax into an evening gown.
I imagine that isn't your usual practice.
Well, everything seems to go by opposites here.
- I believe I have this dance, Lady Jane.
- Oh, yes.
I really promised this dance to the Duke of Riverbotham... but as the old fogy isn't here, we'll let him wait.
Thank you.
You know, you're a fascinating little savage.
Forgive me, please. I forgot myself.
You're so lovely.
- I blame myself as much as you.
- Please don't.
We'll forget about it... if you'll remember that there's only one man that means anything to me.
And that's Tarzan.
- There's nothing in there. That's music.
- Music?
Music, like the natives make on their tom-toms.
This is a little bit more civilized. Look.
That's right.
You'll be the talk of the town.
It's thrilling, isn't it?
Music still hath charms to soothe the savage... but I know a greater fascination.
Yes, the jungle does grow on one, doesn't it?
Only very lately on me.
Don't forget, Martin, there are dangers in the jungle, too.
Adds to the fascination.
These are clothes.
Women wear them because they hope men will like them.
That's why I wore these, Tarzan.
I thought you'd like them.
- Like them?
- Those are stockings.
Like them.
Something provocative about the feel of silk.
Always was.
Same curiosity he had about the phonograph.
It's perfume.
I think Tarzan approves.
- No go.
- No, Tarzan.
- Harry, can't you and I have a dance?
- Most assuredly.
No go.
Harry, perhaps it is getting a little late.
I'm sorry.
You're a bad boy.
Good morning. I love you.
You never forget, do you, Tarzan?
- Never forget I love you.
- Love who?
- Love you.
- Love who?
Love Jane.
Love my...
My wife.
Go on now, lazybones.
Go on and get my fruit juice.
So you've been out shopping early?
Or did you spend the night at the club?
Now, you can't get around me like that.
Are you sure there isn't another woman?
Woman. Man.
That's the way it should be, Tarzan.
I love you. Happy.
And Harry wants to send you to London... get you all dressed up in tight shoes and an old high collar.
If you wanted to see a tree, you'd have get a little watering can...
and sprinkle it to make it grow.
- Then you'd be unhappy.
- Unhappy?
That's a word, Tarzan, I hope you're never going to know the meaning of.
What?
- Swim.
- All right.
Just a minute.
Now, you mustn't grumble, dear.
Swim.
You don't know how lucky you are compared to other husbands.
The poor things have to wait hours every morning...
- for their wives to get dressed.
- Swim.
Darling, I have to put on clothes.
There are other people here and they'd think I was immodest.
I love you.
Good morning, early bird.
Did you get your worm this morning?
That's fine.
Cheetah certainly deserts us when we get near water, doesn't she?
Wait, Tarzan!
Darling, you're very...
Throw that down to me, Cheetah.
Give that to me.
Cheetah, that isn't funny.
Throw it down to me, Cheetah.
Can't you see I've got nothing on.
Give it to me.
That's a good monkey.
Darling, come here.
They're not bad ones, anyway.
- Jane, are you all right?
- Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?
Hello, Harry.
- What is it, Martin?
- Sure we're going right?
Tarzan said a perfectly straight line.
There must be an easier way.
This is like trying to shovel quicksand.
What's the use of a guide if you don't follow him?
I might, if he'd quit yodeling and help us out.
- Saidi, have we been going straight?
- Yes, bwana.
I'm going to try a detour.
Cut off to the left where it's not so thick.
Afraid we'll lose our direction.
Anything's better than this continued hacking.
Come on, swing over, you blighters.
Martin my friend.
While there's clothes, there's hope with a woman.
You're off the track.
We'll be hours cutting our way through in a straight line.
Tarzan has taken care of that.
That's all right, Harry.
Tarzan's called the elephant to clear a trail for you.
That's fine. Thanks.
Down, Cheetah.
Cheetah will let us know if you have any trouble.
You should reach a clearing when the sun is at the treetops.
About an hour.
That's an excellent idea.
Cheerio.
Going through the jungle is play for them.
Stop it!
They're just playing?
I wonder what they do for exercise.
No, Tarzan! Don't!
That's no way to treat a lady.
- Fun is fun, but...
- Fun.
Stop it!
Wait till I get my breath.
You're going to carry me from now on.
Now, that wasn't fair.
If you do that again,
I'll never speak to you anymore.
How much further is it?
I'm glad that's over.
Jane learn. Jane learn Tarzan.
Tarzan learn Jane.
Well, I must have graduated today.
Graduated.
They can make camp here.
And I want a nice house with a river view.
It's good to rest here.
Thank you, darling.
Now, lazy, get up. You've got work to do.
Go on and see what's happened to the safari.
Good Cheetah.
Cheetah, look out!
I'm all right, dear, but Cheetah...
Good Cheetah.
Hello!
A rhino do that?
She got in front of it to save me.
She's gone, Little Cheetah.
And there's nothing you can do, nor I, nor anybody.
There, there, Cheetah.
The hurt will die down.
It has to.
Otherwise none of us could stand life.
Come back!
Tarzan doesn't want you to go there.
I'm only shaken up.
But you, are you all right?
Very well, thank you.
Tarzan, no.
We have to get the safari started.
Come on.
Good morning.
We've been up for hours.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.
Jane, tell me.
Could Tarzan really call more elephants?
- A whole herd?
- He won't believe me.
- Yes. Why?
- We can use them as a pack train.
Carry tons more ivory away.
Of course. Why, that's a grand idea!
I don't know why I didn't think of it.
Tarzan, we want you to get more elephants.
No, dear. All the elephants. Every one.
Yes, dear. They need the elephants to get the ivory, the tusks.
They load it on the elephants and take it back with them.
- Back?
- Yes.
Mahowoni sleep.
That's why they're going to the burial ground. To get the ivory.
It will make them rich.
It's no good to us just lying there.
Mahowoni sleep.
I promised them, Tarzan.
Mahowoni sleep.
What does he think we wanted to go there for?
I hadn't thought.
You see, Tarzan has no objectives.
He just goes somewhere because he wants to.
- And then my father's buried there.
- He went with us before.
- You didn't try to take away any ivory.
- Can't you persuade him?
I'll try, Harry.
Are you sure you don't know the way yourself?
No, not without him.
Did he guide you before?
- No, we followed a dying elephant.
- A dying elephant?
Yes, I told you about that.
It's elephant's instinct.
If they feel death coming on, they head for the burial grounds.
- Dying elephant.
- What did he say?
He'll take you back, but he won't go on.
But he's got to understand.
Every penny we've got in the world is tied up in this.
Tarzan knows nothing about money.
That wouldn't mean anything to him.
What's the harm? They're all dead.
It's as though somebody asked you to rob a graveyard back home.
But these are animals.
They're not humans. This is different.
Not to him. I know how you feel...
but I think I know how he feels, too.
You're going to let him stop you from keeping your promise?
I had no right to promise for him.
Tarzan is the only law here:
The jungle's and mine.
Won't you let us guide you back?
I'm going on. I've got too much at stake.
- I'm sorry, Harry.
- But didn't he understand...
If I can't have one guide, I'll have another.
Martin, wait! Hold up!
Stop it! Don't, Tarzan!
Put him down.
- Bad Martin my friend.
- You just don't understand, darling.
Tarzan, wait.
- Harry, we're leaving.
- You won't come back with us?
I belong with him. Goodbye.
I'm here for ivory. What about you?
I'm with you.
- All right, Saidi. We'll follow its trail.
- Yes, bwana.
Where's she heading for now?
Straight through the waterfalls.
That's the way we went before.
- Through them?
- Yes.
All right, Saidi.
I was afraid she wouldn't last long enough to get here.
They always do somehow.
God, it's like a city paved with gold!
Let's pack out as soon as we can.
Next trip, we'll bring 1,000 men.
Let's get started.
There's something about this place that seems to get me.
- Elephants' ghosts?
- No.
Jane's father is buried over there.
- Saidi.
- Yes, bwana.
Load up the tusks. We'll pack right out.
Everyone carries ivory, even the spearmen, understand?
- No exceptions.
- Yes, bwana.
What are these boys doing with boxes?
Boys carry food. Eat, bwana.
Come on, boys.
What are you doing with that shield and spear, boy?
Everybody carries ivory.
We don't need any spearmen. Come on.
We'll be trampled to death.
- Dead men can't give orders.
- Yes, they can.
Tarzan, wait!
Tarzan, I've got to talk to them first.
You must wait.
- Wait?
- You must.
Won't you give up this idea?
You're my people.
I don't want to see you buried here with my father.
- Perhaps, after all, we are wrong.
- What?
The elephants are Tarzan's friends.
I realize we're violating something he holds sacred.
That's generous of you.
- Tarzan will guide us back now, won't he?
- Yes.
They won't take the ivory.
They understand.
Yes, of course.
Perhaps we can stay here for tonight.
The boys are dog-tired...
- and there's no hurry now.
- Of course.
I suppose it's safe enough with these elephants here... but the boys will be uneasy.
Tarzan will send them back.
Tomorrow, when the sun is there, we'll start back.
- Saidi, have the boys start a fire.
- Yes, bwana.
Lantern, Saidi. Thank you.
Her father's grave.
This was my father's.
I want you to wear it always.
Always.
Good morning. I love you.
Always.
Yes, darling, always.
Hurry back to me, Tarzan.
Back?
Not a trace. We've beaten every inch of the riverbank for miles.
He can't be gone.
Jane, you must face facts.
They're cruel, but you must.
Why, he's fought a hundred crocodiles.
He didn't see it. I shouted.
He turned, but there was nothing he could do.
- He might have got away.
- Jane, you've got to look after yourself.
- Did you find any...
- Sorry.
But there must be some traces.
Even if he were...
He said, "Always."
Wait.
Take me away.
- You're dead-tired, aren't you, Jane?
- I'm all right.
We could make a litter and have some of the boys carry you.
The walking helps.
You're very brave.
No. If I were, I should be back there.
With Tarzan's memory.
Answer me honestly, Jane.
Would you feel better if we didn't take the ivory?
If we carried it back?
Martin, that's sweet of you... but nothing matters anymore.
Supposing she had said, "Take it back."
Strange about that croc.
I never would have believed that Tarzan could have been caught off guard... if you hadn't told me.
I thought you'd gone.
Well, she didn't desert you after all.
- In the jungle, fidelity goes to the living.
- Everywhere.
There, there, Cheetah. That's all right.
You can go with me.
What is it?
Better tie a rope on her so she won't run off again.
What is it, Cheetah?
She's trying to tell me something.
Perhaps you should leave her here in freedom.
They die in captivity.
Tarzan's alive.
What?
He's alive.
Tarzan's alive.
- I wish he were, but...
- But he is.
- She wants to take me to him.
- It's impossible.
- Do you believe this, Jane?
- I know it.
- Harry, I've got to go to him.
- Then we'll go with you.
Saidi, halt them.
Jane, you're chasing a shadow.
- He's alive, somewhere.
- We'll follow Cheetah.
Juju drums.
Where?
Behind and over there.
- Juju, bwana.
- What tribe?
New country, bwana. No tell.
All right. Get them started.
Straight ahead.
But Harry, we've got to get through to Tarzan. That way.
It's blocked. We'll save ourselves first.
Cheetah can show us the way after.
Come back here, you!
Pick up that ivory. Pick it up.
- Ivory doesn't count now.
- I'm holding on.
If we could get to those rocks, we could hold them off.
We might rush them.
The moment we raise a gun, they'll be on us.
They've never seen a gun.
We can get past.
All right, we'll try it.
Saidi, tell the boys to bring the ammunition boxes up.
Saidi, pass the word that when we fire, everyone runs for the rocks.
Ready, Martin?
Now!
Get the ammunition box.
I wish we had that box of ammunition.
- Cover me.
- Wait a minute.
- You're a better shot than I am.
- Yes, I know.
I'm a faster runner, too.
Don't waste your ammunition.
We can't kill them all.
Cheetah, come back!
Deserting us?
No, she isn't. She's going to get Tarzan.
Go on, Cheetah!
She'll make it.
Cheetah, go on!
I know who they are.
Tarzan calls them
"the men that eat lions."
Eat lions?
They roar to call the lions, then they spear them.
This time they're going to let the lions do the hunting.
They're staking Saidi out.
- Come back, you can't save him.
- Harry, come back!
Stand guard on the ledge.
I've always thought when you were faced with death, nothing would matter.
What does?
You.
Always gone.
No, dear. Always is just beginning for you and me.
Old guard, present arms!
New guard...
Halt!
New guard...
Left...
Turn!
New guard...
Slow... march!
New guard... halt!
New guard... present... arms!
Old guard... shoulder... arms!
New guard... shoulder... arms!
Old guard... order... arms!
New guard... stand at...
Ease!
Look! The Prince!
Fine body of men, the guards...
And no soldier in the world like them.
By gad, you're right, sir!
Beer and beef, that's the stuff that makes soldiers.
Besides, it gives a man... a figure
Have you seen today's "Times" sir?
No William.
- The news from Paris.
- Yes.
Over 50 people guillotined in one day.
Damnable, useless cruelty.
Well, what can you expect from foreigners with no sporting instinct?
Gad, if it wasn't for our fox hunting and our pheasant shooting...
I dare say we should be cruel too.
Let's hope the scarlet Pimpernel will save some of the rest.
- Do you know who he is, sir?
- No.
But I confess, I feel a little prouder...
When I remember that he is an Englishman.
Whoever he is...
He'll have his work cut out in Paris.
Did you read this, sir?
There they go again.
It's always the same.
The drums roll, the knife falls...
And another aristocrat parts company with his head.
Very monotonous.
And so clumsy, that great ugly machine.
When all they need is a sharper razor.
A quick wrist and flick!
Here, steady!
Ho-ho, you're all right, partner.
I wish they'd give me a few aristocrats to shave.
Eh, Jacques?
Then we should see some sport.
And you would!
When you see me dealing with the Scarlet Pimpernel.
- The what?
- The Scarlet Pimpernel!
Haven't you heard?
There's a band of Englishmen helping these cursed aristos out of the country.
Their chief is the only man who ever cheated Madame Guillotine.
He's known by the title of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Who is he?
Oh... that's the mystery.
So you're a farmer from Nordesque, are you?
Yes, sir.
You thought you could fool me with a disguise like that!
Well, I'll keep this wig of yours...
Because after tomorrow you won't have a head to put it on!
And I shall be delighted to visit Madame Guillotine...
And make the acquaintance of the only decent person left in France.
Captain, I say "Death to the Republic... and long live the King!"
Take him away!
Stupid fool!
That makes the third aristocrat
I've caught this week.
I can smell 'em through any disguise.
Thank heaven for the game of chess.
It enables us to forget the more disagreeable realities of life.
I'm not so sure it is a good thing.
We've been too detached from reality all our lives.
That's what caused the revolution.
- Possibly.
- Undoubtedly!
If we'd only had eyes to see our own follies, we shouldn't be here now...
Waiting to be shaved...
By the national razor.
Which is the Count de Tournay?
I am the Count de Tournay's daughter.
My father is over there playing the chess.
This is my mother.
The Count de Tournay?
If you will look at the passage
I have marked...
Your spirits will be uplifted.
We are not afraid to die, Father.
Even so, it is sometimes better to live.
- How many, Captain?
- Sixty-four.
Robespierre gives Madame Guillotine extra fodder today.
The former Duc de Tours.
The former Abbé de Saint Preux.
The former Count and Countess de Larnai.
The former Madame de Nijon.
The former Count d'Eterais.
The former Marquis de Jouvence and family.
The former Marquis de Robeaupier.
The two Countesses Herret.
The former Mademoiselle de Bournard.
The two former Duchesses
Passy and Boniveaux.
The former Marquis de Marais.
The former Count de Tournay and family.
The former Countess de Cherainville.
The former Madame de Piccard.
Come.
The former Count d'Arblai.
- Are you de Tournay?
- I am.
You are remanded.
Citizen Robespierre wants to see you.
- Thank God!
- The rest of you, get on!
Take him inside!
Come on!
Come on!
Get out of the way!
Get out!
You must have courage, Suzanne.
Remember...
The Scarlet Pimpernel is waiting to save us.
He's never failed to keep his promise.
But it's too late!
Long live the King of France!
Long live the King of France!
Look at me whip, me hearties.
Look at it!
Three and twenty locks of hair in it.
There they are...
There's...
There's the Duc de Rouilly.
There's his handsome wife, the Duchess.
And here's the hair of her lover...
- The handsome...
- Where's your passport, hag?
He takes me for an aristocrat.
Well, you're right, Captain.
Can't be too careful, can you?
No, you can't be too...
Here, here's me passport.
This says
"Citizeness Renard and grandson."
Where's the grandson?
He's in the cart, poor darling.
Yes? What's the matter with him?
He's got the plague.
- The horrible black plague.
- Plague?
Yes.
I don't think I shall get him alive as far as Chambois.
Give me... give me a light from your pipe, will you Captain?
Keep away from me with your plague!
Get out of here, quick!
And when you come back, try to pass another gate.
For you won't pass through this one again!
You are right, Captain.
You are right.
But I'll be back... somehow.
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.
An old hag of a woman will pass this way in a cart.
You are to stop her, and arrest her.
Did you say an old hag?
You heard me.
But, but she passed through here some time ago.
- Her passport was...
- You miserable fool!
You blundering idiot!
Did you search the cart?
No, no, I... her grandson was inside with the plague.
- Would you expect me to expose...
- You were expected to use your brains!
Now I see you haven't any!
That sick grandson was really three aristocrats snatched from the guillotine!
Ten thousand hells!
And the old hag, who was she?
The old hag, my clever Captain...
Was that cursed Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel.
- Forward, we'll catch him this time!
- Open the gates!
What's that?
What?
Sounds like a troop of horsemen.
We're being pursued!
Don't be frightened, Ladies.
You are among friends.
- But this soldiers?
- My friends, Mademoiselle, and yours.
Are you the Scarlet Pimpernel?
I am only a humble instrument in the hands of our great leader.
- How many are you?
- Twenty, madam.
One to command, nineteen to obey.
- Shall we see your leader?
- I'm sorry, I must ask you to hurry.
- Where's de Tournay?
- Taken back into prison.
- Why?
- We don't know.
So we have to come back and take him.
- How are things at Calais?
- Lawson's there.
- And Ashurst?
- He hadn't arrived when we left.
Oh hadn't he?
His time sense is defective... that's twice.
They may have arrested him.
They're very careful at the
Channel ports nowadays.
My order to you is that you're not to be arrested.
And I expect my orders to be obeyed.
Yes Percy.
You, Wilmot and Grant go back to Paris.
My brother-in-law will follow you there.
All three of you will get your next instructions from Quentin.
Well, goodbye.
And remember... don't get caught.
- Right.
- Right.
- Good luck!
- Goodbye.
Go!
Giddap!
Well...
Why did they keep de Tournay back?
Because Robespierre wanted to see him.
And Robespierre wants to see him because the Ambassador of the Republic, has come over from London.
Chauvelin?
Why?
All in your honor, Percy.
Your work is becoming even more dangerous than it was.
Our work, Armand.
You go back to Paris at once.
Find out everything you can about Chauvelin
If he goes to London, you go too.
Our most dangerous enemy...
Is citizen Chauvelin.
Citizen Chauvelin.
Citizen Chauvelin!
My dear Chauvelin, I'm very sorry that I have to ask you to undertake the journey to London.
But this matter of the Scarlet Pimpernel has become a national menace.
How can you expect me to detect him in a country that hates us like the devil and puts every obstacle in my way?
We expect you to overcome obstacles like our generals in the field.
They know that to lose the battle means the guillotine.
Have you any plans?
Naturally.
We may assume that the Scarlet Pimpernel and his gang... speaks perfect French.
They belong therefore to a class that has been brought up by French nurses and French tutors.
So far not bad.
I have a list of all the likely names.
I have them watched day and night.
Sooner or later, I'll draw the net.
You think de Tournay might be useful?
Possibly.
De Tournay, the former Count de Tournay
Former Ambassador to the former King of France in London.
Citizen Chauvelin
Ambassador of the French Republic in London.
De Tournay,
I want to make you an offer.
We offer you your life.
All we ask in return... is that you merely get in touch with your many English friends... and soon you will be able to tell us who is the man known as the Scarlet Pimpernel.
You want me to be a spy?
You have been too long in politics not to be a realist.
A little piece of information... we give you your life.
God gave me my life...
He will take it away as soon as it pleases Him.
And now my family has gone to the guillotine...
My one wish is to follow.
Would it alter your outlook to hear that your family is alive?
Don't trifle with me.
I sent them to the guillotine for the future happiness of the human race...
But I do not allow torture.
Where are they?
I saw them being dragged towards the tumbrel.
On their way to the guillotine the band of the Scarlet Pimpernel snatched them away.
Where are they?
Probably in England by this time.
To His Majesty King George III.
God bless him for his hospitality to us poor exiles.
To King Louis of France...
May God protect him.
And to your husband, madam.
I hope the Scarlet Pimpernel and you gentlemen will rescue him, as you did us.
The Scarlet Pimpernel...
What a droll name...
What does it mean?
It is a humble wayside flower, mademoiselle.
And it hides the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world.
Do you know, Sir Andrew, my best friend in London
Marguerite St. Just?
Suzanne, how often am I to tell you
I will not have that woman's name mentioned in my presence.
But mother, you can't believe that dreadful story.
- What story?
- It's the truth.
Marguerite St. Just...
Denounced the Marquis de St. Cyr and his family to the tribunal.
They all went to the guillotine.
- Marguerite St. Just?
- Yes.
She married an Englishman.
Do you know her?
Know her?
Everybody in London knows Lady Blakeney.
Lady Blakeney, have you something in your mouth?
Not now, Mr. Romney.
I can't do justice to that lovely face when it's all bulged out with bonbon.
You may talk if you like, but no bonbon!
And no gestures, please!
All right, Mr. Romney.
I'll tell you what it is about the Pimpernel that tantalizes me so.
It is his insufferable modesty.
There's no excuse for it!
It's maddening to think that somewhere there's a man as marvelous as that.
And we never see him!
He is of no use to us whatever!
Lady Blakeney, I said no gestures, please!
Oh, you must remember that
I am a French woman... and when I talk I must use these as well as this.
The de Tournay family arrived in Dover today.
All except the father.
We have to go back for him.
It's going to be devilish awkward after what's happened.
Well I'll go.
So will Hastings if you'll let us.
We will all go if it comes to that.
But even so, we're only 20.
Yesterday, 30 people went to the guillotine.
Are you trying to suggest that there aren't enough of us?
Perhaps that there isn't a decent Englishman that wouldn't be proud to join us.
We could be 500, a thousand within a week.
And within another week everyone of us would be a marked man.
We shouldn't be able to rescue a single soul.
Mere force is useless against people who are neither cowards nor fools.
We must match courage with courage... and cunning with still greater cunning if we're going to do anything at all.
We are all willing to give our lives.
But we must do more than that.
We must mask our identities...
Suffer the humiliation of being taken for fops, fools, nitwits... cowards
So many people die every day that could be saved.
You think I don't feel that?
You think I like sitting there in the shadow of the knife... while one head falls after another?
People I know and love.
Innocent people... kindly people...
Herded like sheep... butchered like cattle... by men who make high-sounding principles and excuses for the most bestial cruelty.
Robespierre's liberty, his equality...
Well... sink me, if it isn't
Colonel Ramsbottom.
Well. how are you Ramsbottom?
Winterbottom, Sir!
Ramsbottom... what a ridiculous mistake...
Allow me to explain, Colonel...
Here's that ass, Blakeney!
I'm off!
Odd's blood, this club wants cheering up.
Sink me, the place is a mausoleum.
Are you being offensive, Sir?
Who Sir? Me, sir?
No, sir!
Stab me. I'm bubbling over with good humor this morning.
Would you believe me,
I've just written a masterpiece?
- Who, sir? You, sir?
- Me, sir!
- No, sir!
- Yes, sir!
All about this mysterious
Pimpernel fellow.
How it came to me, heaven only knows because it was the busiest moment of the day...
Darn, I was tying my cravat.
Oh well, here it is.
"The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Sir Percival Blakeney,
Baronet.
- What?
- Well, that's the title.
"They seek him here,
"they seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in hell?
That damned, elusive Pimpernel."
What?
Hmm, not bad!
Not bad?
It's damned good!
I'll write it out, then you can all learn it.
Yes...
Well...
Good day, gentlemen.
Goodbye. Higgenbottom.
Winterbottom, curse you!
I beg your pardon?
Didn't I say Winterbottom?
Bunch of young jackanapes!
They're all alike, this fashionable puppies.
Insufferable!
What that young man needs...
Is a year or two of hard campaigning.
Facing powder... and shot... undergoing privation.
I can't imagine Blakeney running into much danger.
Not he!
He doesn't belong to our vintage.
It's not my fault!
It's a matter of infinitely small importance to me... whose fault it is.
The man who could put starch in my jabot...
Is equally capable of putting poison in my coffee.
There, you see?
I'm a laughingstock, and rightly so.
Look at the cursed thing.
Sticking out like a barber's pole.
Sink me, the thing is a disaster.
Go away, Brinker, you dreadful fellow.
Ladies...
Your servant.
Marguerite... your slave.
Ah, Romney.
How are you?
And how is the portrait progressing?
The eyes are wrong, aren't they?
And is the nose all right?
You know...
I rather think you missed the mouth... altogether.
Yes, you have.
Otherwise, it's the image of her.
I think that will be enough for today.
Poor Mr. Romney.
You are tired, and so am I.
Tired?
Zounds, me too.
You know, dear lady...
I've just been to Bath to be cured of the fatigue.
And now I'm so fatigued by the cure that I...
I really think that I shall have to go to Bath again... to be cured of the fatigue.
It has been a charming party.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!
Bye, Lady Blakeney, thank you.
Bye, Sir Percy...
Goodbye, Sir Percy...
Goodbye, Sir Percy!
Goodbye, Goodbye...
Goodbye...
What do you think of it?
It's clever...
But there's something lacking.
What?
I don't know.
There's a look...
A look in the eyes...
He's lost it.
Perhaps, I've lost it.
Perhaps it was happiness.
Good gad, my dear!
How you could be unhappy.
I can't imagine.
Can't you?
Percy...
Can't you?
Oh, cursed if I can.
Why, you're the most courted woman in town.
- By whom?
- By everybody.
Except you!
Dear me, my dear,
I'm your husband.
Months after we were married, we were still happy...
And then came this...
Estrangement.
Which Heaven knows, is none of my making.
Can you honestly say that?
Can you honestly deny that you've changed?
So changed...
That I scarcely know you.
You're never with me now.
You're always away on some pretext or other.
I'm always alone.
Then I've mighty good news for you, my dear.
Your brother's arriving from Paris.
- Armand?
- Yes.
When?
At any moment.
And then you won't be alone, will you?
When am I going to see you again?
Whenever you wish to.
Well then, every day.
Suzanne!
Where's the chief?
He went to town yesterday as soon as he arrived here.
- Any order for us?
- Yes...
We have to wait here till tonight for a message from Armand St. Just.
Right.
- Did you follow them?
- Yes.
A sailor gave a letter to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.
Did you get it?
It wasn't easy, but...
We had six men there.
Where are they now?
Gagged and bound on the ship.
And the letter?
You will release them tomorrow.
Watch every move they make.
Maurier...
Go over to France at once.
The moment St. Just returns, arrest him.
Armand St. Just.
Marguerite St. Just...
The famous actress...
She will give a great performance by Republican command...
For her brother's sake.
Percy, I don't want Armand to go back to France.
If you'll help me we can keep him in England.
He'll settle down here, marry a nice girl...
And have lovely children.
What a dreadful prospect.
What has poor Armand done to be sentenced to matrimony?
You should know better, my dear.
You're unhappy... Why?
Armand, I have the satisfaction of knowing that the biggest fool in England has the most complete contempt for his wife.
Percy?
How did it happen?
I don't know.
I only know that when I married him he was a man.
He was my lover.
I was glad to give up everything for him.
And now...
You mustn't leave me, Armand!
I need you...
I'm all alone.
I can't stay.
You're going back to France?
But it's not safe!
For me?
I'm no aristocrat.
For anyone under the terror.
I shall look after the Blakeney estate in France.
Oh, Percy is so rich!
What does it mean to him?
He is not even interested in his English estates.
Since the terror he wouldn't go over to France for all the treasures in the world.
Why should you risk your life for his money?
Oh, I don't risk my life.
Don't worry, darling.
Percy?
May I ask you something?
What's happened to you and Marguerite?
Marriage, I suppose.
Why?
You loved her once... I know.
Do you remember the first family to go to the guillotine?
The St. Cyrs.
They told me it was Marguerite who denounced them.
It was a lie!
I wish I could believe that.
Did you ask her?
I did.
She flashed back a "yes" as sharp as the knife of the guillotine.
I watched that execution.
The Marquis...
His wife...
His son.
And it was my wife...
Who put them there.
So that's why you ceased to love her.
What a tragedy.
Ceased?
I shall love her till I die.
That's the tragedy.
And it's to make up what she did to them...
That you risk your own life week after week to rescue the others?
Don't be so heroic, Armand.
I got a smack in the eye, and I took refuge in sport.
And what a sport!
By gad,
I think I shall give up fox hunting this winter.
Now, what do you think of it?
Monstrous fine, sir!
Vastly becoming.
Now, there's a coat you could wear with comfort.
You know perfectly well
I can wear nothing with comfort...
Until Sir Percy says so.
Where is that jackanapes?
Who. sir?
You, sir!
Here, sir!
And now, tell Treadle what...
What's wrong with this coat.
The back is admirable.
The front's fair.
The collar is. uh, possible.
But the sleeve. Treadle.
The cuff, my poor, benighted friend...
That, Sir Percy, is the last words in cuffs!
Oh, gad, I should hope so for there should never be another like it!
Oh, come now, it's...
It's not too bad.
You see, Sir Percy,
His Royal Highness approves.
My poor Treadle, His Royal Highness does nothing of the kind.
He says it's "not so bad".
And nothing in the world is "so bad"...
As something which is "not so bad".
- But Sir Percy...
- It's a crime, Treadle.
Worse, a blunder.
And quite, quite fatal to my reputation.
Why to your reputation?
Because all the world knows that His Royal Highness is guided by my taste.
Yes, yes, yes...
Percy is an expert on coats.
And britches, sir!
I'm a very wonder with the inexpressibles.
Isn't that so, Treadle?
Well, yes, up to a point.
Zounds, Treadle... Why must you be so cursed jealous?
Look at that puny sleeve...
That miserable dishrag of lace.
Odd's fish!
Looks like the lining hanging down.
It was only intended for a plain cut.
Plain! it's as ugly as a parson's widow.
Open up your sleeves, man.
Let your ruffles take the air.
Let them flow, let them ripple.
So that when His Royal Highness takes snuff...
It'll be a swallows flight.
That's it!
Why, Timmy Percy...
You're brainless, spineless, useless
But you do know clothes.
Odd's fish! That...
That’s something, isn't it, sir?
- Treadle! Treadle!
Yes, Your Highness!
Don't forget what Sir Percy says about about the sleeves.
- A swallow's flight!
- Yes, Your Highness!
Flight of, uh, a swallow.
Come along, come along, gentlemen.
Oh, by the way, Wilmot...
Chauvelin's arrived in London.
Have him watched.
I'm just off to the fight with the Prince.
- Report to me there.
- Very good.
Mendoza's groggy!
He... He's done!
Don't you believe it, sir.
He's foxing!
You wait until the 30th round.
I'll wager 100 guineas he won't last two more rounds.
- Done!
- Come on, Mendoza!
Come on Jackson!
- You'd better hedge, Percy!
- Hedge be damned, I'll double.
- Done!
- Percy must be mad!
Mendoza's finished!
Get up, Mendoza!
Where is he?
- Where is he?
- He's at you house.
No, I will not!
You tricked me once into giving you information about the Marquis de St. Cyr.
I shall never forgive myself.
I'm sick of this sentimental twaddle about the poor persecuted aristocrats.
Have you forgotten what they did to the defenseless peasantry for centuries?
What this very St. Cyr did to you?
No, I have not.
But I'm no spy.
- That is your last word?
- Absolutely!
I wonder....
Oh, by the way, how's your brother, Armand?
Very well, I hope.
I hope so too.
But yesterday he was arrested...
Arrested?
At Boulogne.
What for?
As a traitor to his country.
Traitor?
You're lying, Chauvelin.
You're trying to trick me again.
I've the proof of his guilt in my pocket.
This scrap of paper will certainly send your brother to the guillotine.
Unless, of course, you care to redeem it.
Bring me the name of the Pimpernel and it is yours.
But even if I wanted to...
- I don't know it!
- Find it!
How can I if you can't with an army of spies?
Because you go everywhere and know everyone in his circle.
That much I do know.
And this also...
That he will be among the guests tomorrow night at the Grenville ball.
So will half the world!
This thing is impossible!
You're a clever woman whose brother's life is at stake...
Nothing is impossible.
Well?
No, Chauvelin...
I won't!
Very well, madam.
Chauvelin!
Madam?
Do you swear to give me that paper?
The moment I catch the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Zounds!
That name again?
I've heard nothing else all day.
At the club. the fight, and now here.
I protest, the fellow is a public nuisance.
I beg your pardon, my dear.
Do I intrude?
No, no.
This is an old, uh, acquaintance.
Monsieur Chauvelin, the French Ambassador.
My husband.
Charmed, delighted, enchanted.
Devilish clever race, the French.
How they speak that unspeakable language of theirs defeats me.
You flatter us, Sir Percy.
No, no, you've got the cleverest heads in the world.
The only trouble is...
You all go to pieces around the neck.
Around the neck?
Yes, now look at that thing.
Sink me, what a mess!
Now, if you'd really like to know how to tie a cravat...
I'll tell you.
But it isn't easy, mind, it would take all my brains.
I'm sure it would.
Yes, now look here.
Well, you see, first of all the thing goes twice around the neck.
And then the front folds back to allow the back to come to the front.
Otherwise the front would be all behind as well as before.
Percy, what are you talking about?
You don't follow me, my dear?
That's exactly what I say.
It takes brains, doesn't it?
- One can see that.
- Yes, of course.
Good day, Lady Blakeney.
Oh, no, no, don't go.
You and my wife must have so much to say to each other.
We have.
But then I promised myself a little tête-á-tête with Lady Blakeney at Lord Grenville's ball tomorrow night.
Good.
Tomorrow night, then.
But before you go...
You must hear my verse about that cursed Pimpernel fellow.
You'll love it!
Listen.
"They seek him here...
"they seek him there...
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in hell?
That damned elusive Pimpernel".
- Delightful!
- What?
Especially that, uh... that line:
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere".
Yes, I like that too.
Because, you see
I hear that they do.
And that gives the line a sort of something...
That sort of gives it, ah...
A something, uh...
If I make myself clear.
Clear as crystal.
Good day, my dear Sir Percy.
Bonjour, "misu", as the French say.
Bonjour!
Magnificent fight this afternoon, my dear.
Gad, that fellow Mendoza's got quick ears.
In the 10th round, when Jackson had him down
I shouted, "Get up Mendoza!"
And damn me, he did.
And, sink me, he won.
Do you think...
Andrew Ffoulkes might be the Scarlet Pimpernel?
Andrew?
Never!
He couldn't hit a ball at Eaton!
Why?
What's your interest in the Scarlet Pimpernel?
No more than any other woman's.
We would all like to know who he is.
So would your friend Chauvelin,
I'll wager.
What makes you say that?
Isn't that what he is here for?
Did he tell you?
- Why should he?
- Why not?
Mind you, the man is clever...
But a fellow who can't even tie his own cravat...
Isn't likely to put a noose 'round the Pimpernel's neck is he?
Really, Percy.
Can you never rise above trivialities?
Can't rise above anything with more than three syllables, my dear, I never could.
Nonsense!
You were a man once!
A man a woman could look up to.
Could turn to in trouble.
And now...
You wouldn't know where to begin.
Couldn't you begin by telling me what the trouble is?
What is the use?
We don't even speak the same language.
Mr. Richard Brindslay Sheridan.
The Countess de Tournay.
Mademoiselle de Tournay.
The Vicomte de Tournay.
Lord and Lady Elsworthy.
The Earl and Countess of Garrow.
Well, here's our French friend!
Bonsoir, "misu", as you say.
Good evening, Sir Percy.
Milady.
My dear, look at that cravat.
You're a monstrous quick learner, sir.
Permit me.
There...
Perfect.
Perfect!
Another week, and we won't know you from an Englishman.
From an Englishman!
That is praise indeed!
Oh, Sir Percy!
What is this poem everybody is talking about?
- Poem?
- Yes!
All about the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Do tell us!
Oh, gads, there's no escape.
Forgive me my dear.
Take our friend round and tell him who everybody is...
If anybody is anybody.
- That's exactly like you, Percy!
- That's like you.
I only want to know who one person is and you know the alternative..
The Pimpernel is under this roof at this moment among your friends.
Your move, milady.
And good luck.
Marguerite!
Suzanne!
Suzanne.
The thing rhymes, you see, in four places.
And if you can get a rhyme to rhyme...
That, uh, makes it a poem, if you follow me.
Yes, of course, but what is it?
"The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Sir Percy Blakeney, Baronet.
Really, that's only the name!
Well, go on!
"They seek him here,
"They seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in...
"That damned elusive...
Pimpernel.
That's marvelous!
It rhymes!
Oh yes!
It's a poem!
"They seek him here,
"They seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in...
"That damned elusive Pimpernel!
- Oh, extraordinary.
- Marvelous!
You liked that?
Well, I could tell another one.
Zounds!
That's a monstrous good color!
Hastings!
Who made that coat?
Beagle & Beagle.
Odd's blood!
Sink me if they're not better than our master Treadle.
- Ffoulkes and Dewhurst are free.
- Escaped?
No, released. They are coming here immediately.
Of course, that's why they were released.
To lead a trail to the rest of us.
I shall be in the library at midnight.
His Royal Highness...
The Prince of Wales.
Ladies, please.
Ladies, gentlemen, please.
Ah, Grenville!
Good evening, ladies!
Good evening, gentlemen!
Please, please!
Any news from France, Grenville?
- The worst, sir.
- The King?
Doomed.
Can't we do anything?
We recalled our ambassador a month ago.
Chauvelin had the impudence to accept my invitation.
Will Your Highness permit?
Monsieur Chauvelin the unofficial ambassador of the French government.
Monsieur, we will try to forget the government who sent you.
And look upon you as merely our guest.
A private gentleman from France.
As such are you welcome, monsieur.
Well, ladies...
Did you bet on my horse at Newmarket this afternoon?
I particularly love the whole...
But I didn't want to...
Lady Blakeney with a sad face?
Ha-ha, but sadness is for mere mortals, milady.
Never, never for goddesses.
Alas, even a goddess must have moments when she's a plain woman.
Zounds, madam!
Lady Blakeney could never become a plain woman at any moment.
Ha-ha, that's better!
Now, come and help me through my... my princely paces.
I crave your permission to present Your Royal Highness the Countess de Tournay, her daughter.
This is a pleasure, madam.
Charming, charming!
You and Lady Blakeney must become great friends, madam.
Her friends are my friends.
And her enemies, the enemies... of England.
We poor exiles, madam show our gratitude to England by our devotion to the wishes of Monseigneur.
Suzanne.
- Suzanne!
- Marguerite!
They were schoolfellows in the convent in Paris.
Ah-ha, charming, madam.
Your Royal Highness,
I accepted the Lord Grenville's gracious invitation solely to implore Your Highness to do something to save my husband.
Madam.
The government does everything in it's power to save those who are threatened by death in the prisons of the French Republic.
But if a country goes mad it has the right to commit every horror within it's own walls.
Hastings slipped a note into sir Andrew Ffoulkes' cuff.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, Lady Blakeney.
Won't you take pity on a lonely compatriot?
Are you asking me to dance with you?
Not with me.
With Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.
Why?
He has a note in his cuff.
Get it!
- But listen, Chauvelin...
- Get it!
Your Royal Highness...
Your Graces...
My lords...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Pray take your places for the minuet.
Oh, please, it's nothing.
Just the heat.
Sir Andrew.
Would you be kind enough to see me upstairs?
Of course.
This way, Lady Blakeney.
You'll be all right in a moment.
Lady Blakeney.
Shall I send for a physician?
No, no!
I'm so sorry...
I'll be all right in a minute.
Would you rather be left alone?
No.
Please don't leave me!
Just for a second.
I'll be all right.
How clever of you.
Almost as good as a burnt feather for faintness.
There...
I feel better already.
Would you be kind enough to bring me my fan?
It was a love letter.
And you sacrificed it for me.
What a shame.
But I'll ask her to write you another, shall I?
Suzanne!
Are you feeling better, darling?
I spoiled Sir Andrew's dance.
Would you make it up to him by finishing it for me?
Well?
Did you get it?
He burned it.
But I got a glimpse of what was left.
It began...
Well, go on.
"Start tomorrow myself..."
And ended...
"Will be in library at midnight".
Thank you, Mary.
You can go to bed.
See that Sir Andrew Ffoulkes gets this.
My dear!
Percy!
All right, Brinker.
Well, my dear?
It's about Armand.
He's in the most terrible danger.
They've arrested him at Boulogne!
How do you know?
Chauvelin told me.
When?
Yesterday.
Well, why didn't you tell me when I asked you?
I don't know... I...
He threatened me.
Then why are you telling me now?
Because I thought you might do something for Armand!
You have influence at court.
Didn't you ask your friend Chauvelin for help?
He promised me that...
I don't trust him.
He promised you the life of your brother.
What did you give him in exchange?
What has happened to you, Percy?
Do you... hate me?
Why did you denounce the Marquis de St. Cyr?
So, that's it!
Why did you never ask me what the Marquis de St. Cyr did to me!
You didn't even know him.
No.
I didn't even know him.
Well, then.
But I knew his son.
I was only 17 when he asked me to marry him.
His father heard about it and had me arrested...
And sent to St. Lazare.
Do you know what St. Lazare is?
Do you know the sort of women that are sent there?
I would have killed myself.
Only...
Only what?
The Revolution came.
The ever-glorious 14th of July.
And I was free.
Why this tardy explanation?
I asked you once if you sent the St. Cyrs to the guillotine. You said yes.
You believed it so easily, didn't you?
And yet...
I still ask myself.
"Am I really guilty of their deaths?"
If not you, who is?
He plotted with Austria.
I told a friend.
A man whom I thought a friend.
He denounced him.
The terror did the rest.
Who was that friend?
Was it Chauvelin?
He promised you your brother's life.
What price did you pay for it?
What price did you pay for it?
I paid a horrible price.
Well?
I betrayed the Scarlet Pimpernel.
How?
Ffoulkes had a scrap of paper in his cuff.
I read it and told Chauvelin the Pimpernel would be in the library at midnight.
And was he in the library at midnight?
Chauvelin says he wasn't.
But I think he is lying.
And through my betrayal a noble and generous man might lose his life.
What am I to do Percy?
How can I warn him?
Warn him?
Against what?
Against the danger that threatens him if he goes back to France!
My dear...
If he is the kind of lunatic
I take him to be your warning won't stop him.
But he might be going to his death!
Well, that's all the fellow lives for.
Besides, he doesn't know you're in love with him.
I'm not in love with him.
I admire his heroism, but...
I don't love him.
Oh, but you do, only you don't know it.
I didn't know it myself until a moment ago.
Percy, please don't joke about it!
It's no joke.
Believe me.
Dangerous game, falling in love with a phantom, my dear.
For all you know, he may be a married man.
Who's deeply in love with his wife.
Never.
Why not?
Would any man who was in love with his wife leave her continually to face death?
Would you?
Me?
Zounds! I'm much more romantic than you think.
In a case like that
I wouldn't leave you.
Not even to go to my tailor.
The horses are ready, sir.
Thank you, Brinker.
Are you going away?
Oh, yes, didn't I tell you?
Important business in town.
Goodbye, my dear.
Your tailor, I suppose.
Not only my tailor, but also my bootmaker.
And incidentally...
I want to see what my influence is worth at court...
That little matter of your brother.
Perhaps I can help.
Oh, Percy, if you could...
I'd love you all my life.
Gad!
I must remember that, my dear.
Goodbye.
What is it Brinker?
It's 6 o'clock, milady.
I suppose you want me to leave this room.
I've never been here quite alone, have I?
No, milady.
All right, Brinker, thank you.
Percy!
Percy!
- Brinker! Brinker!
- Milady.
A letter, to be delivered into your Lady's good hands.
- From Sir Percy?
- No, madam.
From his excellency, the French Ambassador.
Where's Monsieur Chauvelin?
He left this morning for France, madam.
All right, thank you.
Brinker!
The carriage.
Very good, milady.
Is Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in?
Yes, milady.
I'll call Sir Andrew, milady.
Lady Blakeney, what's happened?
Sir Andrew, there's no time to waste in talking.
Just listen to me.
Your leader and friend, the Scarlet Pimpernel
- My husband..
- How do you know that, milady?
Do not ask any questions now.
He is in deadly peril.
Chauvelin knows that Percy Blakeney and the Scarlet Pimpernel are one and the same.
How did Chauvelin come to know?
Through me.
Do you mean to say that you betrayed him?
Yes, yes, I betrayed him, never mind how just tell me this...
Has Percy left for Boulogne?
Yes.
- To save my brother?
- And de Tournay.
What is their meeting place in Boulogne?
Why?
- Do you want to...
- Oh, look at me, man!
Do I look like a woman who wants to send her husband to his death?
I want to find Percy, to warn him, to save him or to die with him.
I'll go with you.
Can you bring your friends?
Ten of them.
The rest are in France.
Percy has forbidden us to go over.
It will be the first time we've ever disobeyed him.
I'll save Percy even if
I have to kill Chauvelin.
And if he goes to the guillotine...
I'll go after him.
There you are citizens!
Boulogne has a guillotine of it's own now.
Same as Paris!
That's nothing!
Half the towns in France have got them.
Let her go, Francois!
Good, eh?
So much for the bait.
Now for the trap.
We can't afford to make any mistakes this time.
Remember, it's either the Pimpernel or ourselves for the guillotine.
- Robespierre knows he is here.
- Yes.
The net must be spread with more than cunning.
Blakeney's no fool.
Besides, he's a master of makeup and disguise.
He may turn up as an old woman a peddler with a pack, a peasant with a beard, anything!
They've got the Scarlet Pimpernel!
Quiet!
Quiet everybody!
Quiet!
Listen, my friend
The next time you want to put on a false beard
Choose a good one not a bird's nest that wouldn't deceive a child!
Clumsy idiot!
Let go, you!
I'll teach him to pull the best beard in Boulogne!
I've never been so insulted in my life!
You disgusting, gibbering monkeys!
You'll hear more of this!
An honest woman I am, one of the few in our street!
Stripped naked by soldiers and the searched to see if I was a man!
Listen, Captain.
If I were 20 years younger that's were I should be.
Bravo uncle!
That's the spirit!
Where are you boys serving now?
Oh, we're on leave.
Stealing away the hearts of the girls of Boulogne?
No sir, I'm in love.
Ah, you rascal.
It's the wife of another man?
No, it's my own.
Splendid!
Captain, I’ll tell you a secret.
You and I are the only men in France who are in love with our wives.
Hooray!
Let's drink to it!
Well, here's to it!
Here's to it!
But it'll be hard for you to leave her for this war with England.
You think that's coming, do you?
Surely!
We shall have to teach perfidious Albion a lesson!
Well. it won't take us long to get across the channel.
Will it, boys?
No, no!
Well, gentlemen, good luck!
And...
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
De Tournay was brought here from Paris yesterday
The same prison as Armand.
I thought so.
Chauvelin's using them as bait.
Search every incoming ship.
Even the smallest fishing boat.
And you...
De Tournay and St. Just have escaped!
Escaped!
How?
God knows.
The Pimpernel knows!
Someone will pay for this!
Where are the jailers?
Missing!
Citizen Chauvelin!
How dare you burst in?
Who are you?
Jailer from the prison!
- So you're the one...
- No fault of mine!
The head jailer would have killed me if I hadn't taken the money to free those accursed aristocrats!
What?
The Pimpernel is taking them to England.
Promised us all jobs there!
But I'm a good patriot,
Citizen Chauvelin.
I'm not losing my head... because I got some information that will save yours.
What is it worth?
What do you know?
Where you can find the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Out with it!
Where?
He told us to meet him at 10 o'clock at the Lion d'Or.
Take him away.
10 o'clock at the Lion d'Or.##
Let fly foresheet!
Let fly foresheet!
There's the Lion d'Or.
Tell the men to get ready to row me ashore.
We must wait for the signal.
Brogard waves the lantern across the window for safe up and down for danger.
Look!
There's the signal.
Safe!
You've all the roads watched?
Every corner... and the beach.
And a troop of dragoons to surround the place?
Waiting outside.
Come on then...
The Lion d'Or.
Good evening.
What do you want here?
This is no place for one of your sort.
I'm the sort that pays well,
Citizen Brogard.
For what?
For a seat by the fire.
I'll wait here for a friend of mine...
And yours.
What should I know of your friends?
You signaled him just now.
You must be expecting him.
What time?
What time?
10 o'clock.
Where can I hide?
Quick, to the attic!
Citizen Brogard?
Yes?
Under arrest.
What for?
Betraying the Republic...
Helping the enemies of France...
Harboring a gang of dangerous criminals...
Smuggling aristocrats out of the country.
That's a lie!
You've got one chance.
Take it, or I'll hang you now from your own sign.
The leader of your gang is coming here tonight, isn't he?
Isn't he?
- Yes.
- What time?
He ordered his boat to be off the point at 10 o'clock.
Ah, but he'll call here for his passengers, won't he?
He might!
Might?
You'll look pretty swinging in the wind.
How does he know it's safe?
What is the signal?
A lantern in the attic window.
Waved up and down for danger... across the window when all is clear.
Come on. sergeant.
That is the wrong signal,
Lady Blakeney.
That will keep Sir Percy away!
This is the right one.
This will bring him here.
I can see you are longing to see him
As I am myself.
What a great actor Sir Percy is.
A thousand ways to cheat the poor, stupid officials of the Republic.
Look, costumes, wigs, paint.
What will he be next?
In what disguise will he arrive when the clock strikes 10?
I must arrange a reassuring atmosphere for him.
An old woman?
No, he has overdone that.
A priest...
What could be more harmless?
And so useful when it comes to the last offices.
Sergeant...
You shall have the privilege of watching over the Republic's most charming prisoner for the rest of the evening.
Milady.
- Duroc
- Citizen?
Everything ready?
The dragoons should be here at any moment.
Arrange for a firing squad as soon as they arrive.
Are you so certain you'll get him?
Quite.
Thanks to a charming friend
I found in there.
- What time is it?
- Quarter to 10.
Remember, he has to think his way is clear.
He must not suspect anything until he's in the trap.
Good evening, Monsieur Chauvelin.
How nice of you to wait up for me.
Well...
I had no idea you were in holy order.
This is only an innocent masquerade like so many of your own, Sir Percy.
Ah, but mine were successful.
Mine may prove successful yet.
You walked in here quite freely but you won't walk out a free man.
A prophet now, Monsieur Chauvelin.
The time for laughing is past, Sir Percy.
I've sought for a year.
Your energy, your ingenuity your audacity have been quite admirable.
But now...
The game is up!
Because all the trumps are in your hand, eh?
Precisely.
This house is surrounded by my soldiers.
I've only to raise my voice
Yes, yes, I see your point.
I see your point.
But suppose...
Suppose I could reach a door?
The night is black.
The sea is mine.
I make a dash!
I don't make a dash.
I don't need to.
Because one of my friends might shoot you...
From behind, hidden in that clock!
Oh, come now...
No one really hides in a clock.
Besides...
I still have...
One more avenue of escape...
Open to me.
Don't move!
Gunpowder!
If I drop this in here...
I fly straight to heaven.
And you know where you fly to.
Don't be alarmed Monsieur Chauvelin.
It's not gunpowder.
Thank you Wilmot.
You just arrived in time.
I've had five delightful minutes with Monsieur Chauvelin.
I trust there was time enough to get
Armand and de Tournay into safety.
Yes, they're safe.
Good.
Now we need five minutes.
Then I shan't trouble you anymore.
For the moment.
We must have the password, Percy.
The password.
Do we have to use force?
Not at all, Sir Percy.
The password is,
"The Channel is Free".
Splendid!
Wilmot...
You get them onto the ship.
I'll take care of our friend and join you in a minute.
That was quite sensible of you...
Monsieur Chauvelin.
Not at all, Sir Percy.
You may go...
Because I know you'll come back of your own free will.
You overestimate the charm of your society.
I told you once, the time for jesting was over.
I have all the trumps in my hand.
In that room upstairs, there's a woman under arrest who has forfeited her life by aiding the enemies of the Republic.
What woman?
Lady Blakeney.
Is the game up, Sir Percy?
Is this the last adventure?
I give up, Chauvelin.
What next?
There is a firing squad outside.
And my wife?
The Revolutionary Tribunal.
That means death!
It would have meant my death if I had not caught you!
Don't be alarmed, Sir Percy.
I don't want your wife's life.
She's free the moment you die.
I offer you a pact.
If you promise to say nothing to her...
If you'll send her on to my ship immediately...
I'll walk up in front of your firing squad.
I accept.
Sergeant!
Bring milady down.
Percy!
I wanted to give my life to save you.
- Forgive me, Percy.
- My dear, it's nothing!
I'm in no danger.
Percy.
I want to...
I want to die with you!
Don't move, Chauvelin.
Our parting would be too cruel, even for you.
Just take her out while she's still unconscious.
My boat should be at the point by now.
Good bye, my sweet.
It's good to know that...
That you loved me...
A little.
Duroc!
Send this lady to the English ship around the point.
If anybody attempts to land, shoot!
Yes, Citizen.
You two go with him.
Do you like poetry,
Monsieur Chauvelin?
"That damned elusive Pimpernel".
No, no... I mean, uh, poetry.
"This other Eden, demiparadise"
"This fortress built by nature for herself"
"Against infection and the hand of war"
"This happy breed of men"
"This little world"
"This precious stone, set in the silver sea"
"This blessed plot"
"This earth"
"This realm"
"This England"
Oh, damn me, I forget the rest.
Firing party, halt!
Left turn!
Ground muskets!
Duroc!
Zounds, now it appears I shan't have time to remember.
Shoulder muskets!
Left turn!
Quick march!
Ready!
Present.
Present!
Fire.
Fire!
Finished?
I'm so sorry, Monsieur Chauvelin,
I had to come back for my hat.
It's such a cursed good hat, you know.
Now, now, don't look at me like that!
Sink me, if you don't think
I'm my own ghost.
Duroc!
Captain Duroc?
I'm afraid it will be an hour or so before poor Captain Duroc will be able to resume his duty.
I regret that I struck him rather violently.
Seize him!
Always so impulsive, my dear Monsieur Chauvelin.
This, ah... is my firing squad.
Allow me to present
Ffoulkes, Dewhurst...
Hastings, Belville, and the rest.
But of course you know all about them.
You look rather excited, Chauvelin.
I think you need cooling down.
So...
Just a peaceful little nap...
Like we had in the Grenville library.
Are we really free, Percy?
Not you, darling.
Chauvelin said you'd be free the moment I died.
It won't be a moment sooner.
Land ahead!
Look, Marguerite!
England!
[CAT MEOWING]
MAN:
Eight o'clock.
All's well. Misty weather.
[VIOLIN PLAYING]
- Here ye are, me lad.
- Thank ye.
A press gang. A press gang!
MAN 1: The press gang!
MAN 2: Let's get out of here!
In the king's name!
Well, we got all the fish we need in one net.
- Line them up, boatswain.
- Aye, aye. Line up, lads!
Lads, bow your necks and weep.
You're in the king's navy.
I'm no seaman, sir. I'm a tailor.
What's that, your needlework?
No chin music.
- What ship?
- The Bounty, for the South Seas.
- The South Seas?
- That's the end of the world.
No, he sailed there with Captain Cook.
He knows the brown gals gay as kiss-me.
- Who's the captain?
- Bligh.
- Bligh!
- Seize him!
How long will we be gone?
Till there's enough frost in hell to kill snap beans.
How long is that, sir?
I've got to know.
- Two years, lad.
- Please, don't take my husband.
When we had a baby,
Tommy left the sea.
He don't want to serve in the navy.
- It's true, sir.
- Sorry, the king needs six men.
You can't take him! It's like forever!
I can't take them and not take him.
No, you can't take him!
I won't let you!
- Lass, lass.
- It's two years! No! It's two years!
This is England's new venture in science, in trade, in discovery.
Who else but Sir Austin Byam's son should go?
But two years.
- I understand, my dear.
MAN: Ship ahoy!
Bob.
Behold! The elder son of the sea and heir to all its oceans.
Uniform by Jeeves.
[LAUGHING]
It's so new, it creaks.
I'll come back an admiral, with a necklace for you.
Pearls as big as coconuts.
I'll name a nice shiny island after you, Sir Joseph.
- I owe you for my appointment.
- You've been appointed for one purpose:
To make me a dictionary of the Tahitian language.
I've made that clear to Captain Bligh.
- What's he like, sir?
- Captain Bligh?
He's a seagoing disaster.
His hair is rope yarn.
His teeth are marlinespikes.
BYAM:
Marlinespikes? Good.
Sounds rather terrifying.
But perhaps, as your father used to say:
"A taut hand at sea is better than a slack one."
You'd have made a rare sailor, ma'am.
Why don't you stow away, Mother?
I've considered it. Very seriously.
Well, here's to the voyage
of the Bounty.
To the voyage of the Bounty!
Still waters and the great golden sea.
Flying fish like streaks of silver and mermaids that sing in the night.
The Southern Cross, and all the stars on the other side of the world.
Bless my soul.
To the voyage of the Bounty!
Is that the Bounty?
No, sir. That's the flagship of the fleet.
There's your little pint-pot.
BYAM:
That's the Bounty for Tahiti?
She isn't very big, is she?
It ain't the size that counts, youngster.
It's the salt in the lads that man it.
- Where's your sweetheart?
- She married a sailor.
Oh.
It's Ellison, sir.
He tried to break ship.
- On deck, Morrison.
- Aye, sir.
- Churchill.
- Aye, sir.
Break ship, would you?
I can't face it, sir. Not two years.
I might not come back.
Then she's left with the baby.
Flog me, send me to jail, but don't take me, sir!
Don't.
Now, listen to me, Ellison.
The sea's hard, but you whistle it off.
Do your spit and polish and you'll come home with the seals...
...following in admiration.
I was like you when I first came to sea,
Cumberland moss all over me.
Now it's turned to barnacles.
That's better.
On this voyage, if you get in trouble, come to me. I'll see you get justice.
But if you're wrong, look out for squalls.
Now, get your chin up.
Go on deck. Say goodbye to your wife.
- You've got her aboard, sir?
- And the baby.
- Come on. Shake a leg.
- Thank you, sir.
- So you're going to the South Seas?
- Aye.
Here. Take this with you.
You can buy your own island.
Ten shillings.
Ten? I ain't seen the king's face on a shilling for so long...
...l've forgotten which George it is, but
I'll take it and pay you when I get back.
Sailor! You're not coming back, not in this little half-walnut.
WOMAN:
Here you are. Diamond brooch.
Real gold, mister, owned by Captain Kidd.
With a map of the treasure under the works.
Here. Stand clear with the tinware, Joe.
You keep leeward of the ship's gentlemen.
All right, now. Ta-ta. Ta-ta!
Mr. Byam? I'm Fletcher Christian, lieutenant and master's mate.
- You'll be my instructor.
- Yes, in navigation and trigonometry.
You'll have a watch, keep order, go aloft to mend canvas, reef and furl.
Otherwise, your time is your own.
Mr. Christian, in my hands, the ship is safe.
I understand.
"A little child shall lead them."
Come along, I'll show you below. You there, take Mr. Byam's box to his berth.
- Ahoy, Mr. Christian!
CHRISTIAN: Ahoy!
Excuse me.
Good morning, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
Think I've got enough for a two years' voyage?
CHRISTIAN:
You know your draft better than I do.
My lad, nobody can estimate my draft, least of all myself.
- Easy, easy.
- What makes her roll so?
Here's a navy for you.
Rum in the skimmers today and blood in the scuppers tomorrow.
This is our ship's surgeon.
We call him Mr. Bacchus.
- He's never told us his real name.
- I've forgotten it.
Pleased to meet you.
Mr. Byam, I should never have gone ashore.
England's only an island, and all islands are alike.
I'm going below. Bear a hand.
Easy, now. Easy.
Oh, Tommy, I'm afeard.
This ship's unlucky.
They've changed the name.
Well, I changed your name, didn't I?
Was that unlucky?
Oh, Tommy.
One, two.... Three of us in here?
My dog at home has a bigger kennel all to himself.
I can see we shall be as friendly as tomcats in a sack.
Mr. Stewart? Mr. Byam.
Drop in anytime, Byam.
I'll be just 10 inches away from you.
- A pleasure, Mr. Stewart.
- I hope you'll like the ship.
- I'd like any ship, Mr. Stewart.
- Johnny Newcomer.
Oh, yes, Mr. Byam, the amiable Mr. Hayward.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Hayward has been two years at sea.
And a man who's been two years at sea should know how to lash his hammock.
Yours looks like a Frenchman's knapsack.
All right. On deck, all of you.
Mr. Maggs?
This here Captain Bligh, sir.
Now, you being ship's clerk...
...would you call him a gentle officer?
If I was you, I wouldn't be calling him anything.
Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Maggs, no.
Never call anybody anything.
But I do hope he is gentle because
I'm his messman and I frighten so easy.
It runs in our family, Mr. Maggs.
My mother was frightened by my father before I was born...
...and I've been frightened ever since.
Do you know there's times when
I can hardly hold a glass in my hand?
- Silence. The captain's coming aboard.
- Oh, oh.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
MAN:
Company, atten!
Mr. Christian, clear the decks of this rabble.
Very good, sir. Clear decks.
Everybody ashore. Clear decks.
- Mr. Fryer, we sail at six bells.
- Sail at six bells.
- We got our rights here.
- Off ship, Joe. Off ship.
I'm not going until the ship sails.
Hey, you can't do that!
Flogging through the fleet.
We're included.
- A compliment to the Bounty, Sir Joseph.
- Yes.
Mr. Christian, pipe the ship's company at five bells to witness punishment.
Would you care to see the flogging?
No. The only discipline
I know is science.
There's science in using a cat-o'-nine-tails. Watch my boatswain.
I really must be off.
I came aboard merely to introduce Roger.
Goodbye, my boy.
This won't be all cakes and ale, Roger...
...but your family's followed the sea for seven generations.
Not one ever failed in his duty.
In a tight place, that's all you'll need to remember.
- I'll try to, sir.
- Sure you will, my boy.
- Goodbye, Mr. Bligh.
- Goodbye, Sir Joseph.
What does it mean, sir,
"flogging through the fleet"?
Sentence of court-martial, two dozen lashes at each ship.
What was the man's crime, sir?
Struck his captain.
But that's over 300 lashes.
I don't understand why--
Can you understand this?
Discipline's the thing.
A seaman's a seaman, captain's a captain. And a midshipman...
...is the lowest form of animal life in the British navy.
Now you know what a midshipman is.
[BELL RINGING]
[DRUM ROLLING]
MAN 1:
Line up!
MAN 2:
Port oars!
Ship's company, off hats!
Article 22: "If any officer, mariner or other person in the fleet...
...shall strike or offer to strike any of his superiors...
...and being convicted, he shall suffer punishment...
...inflicted on him by the sentence of a court-martial."
Ship's company, on hats!
- Mr. Morrison, two dozen, I believe.
- Two dozen it is, sir.
- The man is dead, sir.
- Dead?
- Shall I dismiss the men, sir?
- What?
Certainly not.
We'll proceed with punishment.
Boatswain, do your duty.
Come along with you. Do your duty!
[WHIP CRACKING]
Bloody murderer.
Mr. Byam!
MORRISON: Punishment counted out, sir.
- Mr. Morrison, come aboard.
- Mr. Fryer, make ready to sail.
- Starboard watch, secure for sea.
Starboard watch, shorten and cable!
Stand by to go aloft!
In captain's gig, Mr. Christian.
Both watches, hoist!
FRYER: Hoist away!
- Topsails.
Way aloft!
Winds offshore!
You'll take the mizzenmast, Mr. Byam.
What's the matter, afraid to go aloft?
Why, it's child's play.
That man they flogged.
He was dead.
Get aloft. Bear a hand.
Mr. Morrison, start those men.
[MEN SINGING]
Tallyho!
Child's play.
MAN:
Anchors aweigh, sir.
Let fall!
Down from aloft!
Down from there! A dozen for the coat of the last man down!
Please, sir!
CHRISTIAN:
Skipper Hayward!
Mr. Hayward!
- I'll take care of him.
- Keep hold!
Hoist away!
Set courses, royals and gallants!
FRYER:
Royals and gallants!
Starboard bridges, aweigh with the anchors.
- Ship ready.
- Give her lee helm.
Lee helm, sir.
- Steady.
- Steady, sir.
There she goes. Her anchor's up.
Oh, Mary, it's such a little ship.
My Tommy will bring her home.
ALL:
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
- We're under canvas again, Mr. Christian.
- Yes, sir.
- It's our third voyage together.
- Not of my choosing.
So the port admiral told me.
Well, you're here. I requested you.
I like having a gentleman as my subordinate, being a self-made man.
I admire you for that, sir.
And for very little else?
Sailing orders?
Tahiti direct by Cape Horn.
Winds permitting.
If we can't make westing, we shall have to go by Africa.
Then we'll have to get supplies at Simon's Bay.
We'll need them. This ship has less food than a prison hull.
And I don't trust that clerk of yours.
Who asked you to meddle with my clerk?
Can't get much from a hungry man.
I have to work these men we feed.
Rascals and pirates.
Did you see them growl at the flogging?
I'll teach them what flogging's like.
My advice, sir, if you'll take it, is not to be too harsh with them.
We're sailing 10,000 miles together for the next two years.
- It's like a powder magazine.
- I don't want your advice.
I've my own way with seamen.
They respect one law, the law of fear.
- My officers should remember that.
- I can only tell you what I think!
They come from jails and taverns, but they're English and they'll sail anywhere.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I expect you to carry out whatever orders I give, whenever I give them.
I'll carry out your orders, Mr. Bligh.
Then we understand each other?
Perfectly.
- Any orders for the deck?
- No.
- That all?
- Yes. You may go.
Thank you, sir.
- She's flying, Mr. Christian.
- Tahiti direct, sir.
Tahiti direct, Mr. Christian.
Pass it on: No change of sail without my orders.
Put two men at the wheel.
- We'll carry on or carry under.
- Very good, sir.
- Southeast by east.
- Southeast by east, sir.
No change in sails...
- ...except for captain's orders.
- Good.
Mr. Byam, you'll stand by for midshipman's school.
Aye, aye, sir.
BLIGH:
You! Hold up, there!
Never empty your buckets into the wind!
Find the wind, you idiot!
Find the wind and then choose your rail.
Get below!
We're off around the world, boys.
Light hearts and tight britches.
Off around the world.
Oh, dry up, you cub.
Is it human, or what do you think?
I can't stand yowling water babies.
[SINGING "ROCK-A-BYE BABY"]
Blast you! I told you not to swing that lantern!
You don't mean it makes you seasick?
An old buccaneer like you? La-di-da.
I'll knock more tar out of you than it'll take a month to mix.
- Come on, blowhard.
- Oh, stow it, will you?
I can't make head or tail of this navigation.
Don't worry. If you get tangled,
I'll jump in and pull you out.
You'd better not try and fool
Mr. Christian.
Mr. Christian holds no terrors for me.
I can wade the seven seas and never wet my shirt.
They have whales that can sink a ship, but I can sink the whale.
Behold, the face that launched a thousand ships.
Gentlemen.
Today's navigating problem:
Given the altitude of Polaris, could you find your latitude, Mr. Stewart?
To lead up to it...
...ordinarily, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
Uh, but this is not true of navigation.
We must consider winds and currents--
Yes. Suppose you considered the problem.
STEWART: Yes, sir.
- Perhaps Mr. Stewart means that it's...
...like that lantern, sir.
We assume it should hang straight down, but because the ship is rolling...
...it swings to and fro.
But by watching it closely--
You disagree with Byam, Mr. Hayward?
He knows the lantern makes me seasick.
He's doing it to break up the lesson.
- Stewart doesn't know his problem.
- Still, his original theory interests me.
Please, sir.
Proceed, Mr. Byam. You were saying, by watching the lantern closely--
What seems to be the trouble,
Mr. Stewart?
Watch the wind, Mr. Stewart.
It's not there. It's there.
Is that the face that launched a thousand ships?
[HICCUPS]
One navigation problem and three wrecks.
Smart as paint, you are.
Why, you ungrateful swab.
After I've given my all for the honor of the class.
Byam!
It wasn't my fault.
He came behind and struck me.
- Is that true, Mr. Byam?
- I'd rather not say, sir.
So you want to fight?
I'll cool you off.
Get to the masthead and stay there until I call you down.
BYAM: All the way, sir?
- All the way.
- Get below or go aloft!
- Yes, sir!
Rather heavy weather to send him aloft, isn't it?
They must learn this isn't a beer garden.
If you don't teach them, I will!
Look alive, you crawling caterpillar!
- Where's Byam?
- I couldn't help it, Stewart.
When the man looks at me,
I want to jump overboard.
Where's Byam?
- The old man sent him aloft.
- You let him take the blame, huh?
Here, here!
You've started enough trouble!
Time you learn discipline!
Get into your hammock...
- ...before I put you over a gun!
- Yes, sir.
Get up!
You see, sir? It isn't my fault.
They're only jealous because
I've been at sea before.
Who did that?
I did, sir.
Come here.
Good.
[BELL RINGS]
How she creaks. Wind's a gale.
I'm too old to envy young Byam aloft.
- Splice the main-brace, Mr. Morgan.
- I'll take it to kill germs.
What? Waste my brandy?
Here, you use the ship's drinking water.
It would shrivel me wooden leg.
Did you ever hear how I lost my leg?
- No, no, but we will.
- Well--
- I'm worried about Byam.
- Oh, he'll weather it all right.
Well, I left my leg with
John Paul Jones back in '78.
We came astern with a Yankee.
Up went our colors and our captain hails,
"What ship is that?"
"American ship Ranger," roars Jones, and up go his colors.
"Louder, you Yankee pip-squeak," our captain yells.
"I can't hear you!"
"Can you hear this?" Says Jones, and he lets go a broadside.
Thundering guns.
You all right?
- Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
- Look after him, Mr. Morgan.
Keep her head up!
MAN:
Starboard!
Get him below, to the surgeon!
Mr. Christian!
- Who brought that man down?
- I did, sir!
But I sent him aloft!
He's gone under. The top's no place.
I know his place. Time you knew yours.
Maintain discipline, not break it!
Send him aloft again!
Mr. Bligh, he's had enough!
Send him aloft again!
That's right, lad. Drink another.
You'll be as right as a truism.
If you'd lost a leg, now. ...
I lost mine in action against the French, off Jamaica.
A French surgeon did the trick for me.
He apologized in French, and I cursed him in English.
- How is he?
- I'm all right, sir.
He'll go anywhere.
Get to the masthead again, Byam.
- I've taken my punishment, sir.
- Get to the masthead!
I've had a bellyful of that masthead from Captain Bligh!
- You can't make me go back again!
- Byam.
It was Mr. Christian brought you down, lad.
Thank you, sir.
I didn't understand. Captain's orders.
- You mind?
- No. Let him have it.
Here, you'll need this.
Here's something else you'll need.
You're a plucky youngster.
If necessary, I'd be happy to cut off your leg anytime.
Thank you, sir.
- If anything happens to that lad, Bligh--
- Christian!
Christian, careful!
CHRISTIAN:
Ship's company, off hats.
O eternal God, who alone spreadest out the heavens...
...and rulest the raging sea, who has compassed the waters with bounds...
...until night and day come to an end...
...receive into thy almighty and most gracious protection...
...the persons of us, thy servants and the fleet in which we serve.
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea that we may be a safeguard...
...unto our gracious lord
King George and his kingdoms...
...and a security for such as pass on the seas upon their lawful occasions...
...and that we may return in safety to enjoy the blessings of the land...
...with a remembrance of thy mercies to praise and glorify thy holy name...
...through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
ALL: Amen.
- Ship's company, on hats.
The ship's company will bear in mind...
...we are at sea under the articles of war.
Perhaps you are unaware that the articles of war invest in me...
...the authority to order punishment.
During the recent heavy weather,
I've watched you at work on deck and aloft.
You don't know wood from canvas, and it seems that you don't want to learn.
Well, I'll have to give you a lesson.
You, you, you, step forward.
You three are a disgrace to saltwater!
Ten days on half rations.
What's your name?
- Thomas Burkitt, sir.
- He's a thief, sir. Dartmoor Prison.
- A thief.
- Convicted. Offered a choice:
Dartmoor Prison or the king's navy.
You've been to Dartmoor Prison, Burkitt?
- Yes, sir.
- It seems you prefer the navy.
You may regret that choice before this voyage is over. Your name?
Thomas Ellison, sir. Pressed into service.
I've got a wife, a baby.
I asked your name, not the history of your misfortunes. Your name?
- Smith.
- Not you, you idiot! You.
- William Muspratt, sir.
- Have you got a wife, Muspratt?
Have you got a wife?
Two, sir.
The ship's company will remember that
I am your captain, judge and your jury.
You do your duty and we may get along...
...but whatever happens, you'll do your duty. Go forward.
CHRISTIAN:
Lively, lads.
Thief. Nobody calls me a thief but the men I steals from.
Half rations.
You there!
Who did that?
I can't tell you, sir.
- Mr. Morrison.
- Aye, sir.
- Report that man for two dozen lashes.
- But....
I done it, sir.
Pick it up.
Put it back.
- Mr. Morrison, lay on with a will.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Bligh, these men aren't king-and-country volunteers.
They've been brought aboard by press gangs.
In a week, I'll get some spirit without flogging.
Teach them who's master and never let them forget.
- Mr. Morrison!
MORRISON: Aye.
Before we see port, I'll make them jump at a midshipman's jacket...
...even if it's hung on a broomstick to dry.
Give this man his two dozen. When I ask for information, I expect to get it.
- I didn't hear the watch call, sir.
- Why not?
Sorry, I was cleaning brass for Mr. Byam.
That's true, sir.
Stretch this man over a gun and give him two dozen lashes.
But I was responsible, sir.
Byam will be in charge of the punishment.
Two dozen.
That's enough, Mr. Morrison.
MAN: Man overboard!
- Bring a line!
Idiot. I'll have to teach my top men not to fall off the ship.
Mr. Morrison!
When you get him onboard, stretch him with a rail to dry him off.
I can't stand it. I got to get water.
Get back to your work.
I wanted water for my knees, sir.
I can't stand it. Please, sir.
- What is it?
- This man left his work. Wants water.
Look, sir, it's the sand worked in cruel.
- I wanted water to wash it.
- I'll give you water.
Mr. Morrison, keelhaul this man.
MAN:
Haul away!
- Well?
- The man is dead, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Bligh, I've seen calms and doldrums, but not one like this in 40 years.
- The men in the boats are worn-out.
- Not the way they're pulling.
- Put new men into the boats.
- Mr. Morrison, pipe the men.
Change the boat crews.
Dive in with your mess, lads.
The boats are alongside.
Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
I'm sorry, lad.
There's nothing I can do about it.
This bit of meat was mined in a rock quarry.
- Here, I'll change with you, lad.
- Thanks.
It's alive, all right...
...but they're fresh meat anyway.
Mr. Byam, I'm reporting these two men unfit for duty.
- Very good. You men are relieved.
BLIGH: What's the delay here?
You realize we're waiting for these men to pull us into a wind?
The men haven't finished mess, and these two are unfit for duty.
- Unfit?!
- My orders, sir.
If they can walk, they can work.
Put them in the boats and get these other men out immediately.
Any sign of a breeze, sir?
I'm about at the end of my rope.
Keep up your stroke, man.
I'll whistle a wind up for you.
[WHISTLING]
Can't we...?
- Can't we rest a spell, sir?
- No, and keep your hatch closed.
This is the cask with only one cheese in, sir.
- What's this? What's this?
- Two cheeses are gone.
- What?
- Two 50-pound cheeses missing.
- Stolen, of course, sir.
- Thieves and jailbirds!
- What?
- A hundred pounds of cheese gone.
They'd steal canvas off a corpse.
- Strange. I checked the stores myself.
- Cheeses can't fly, fool!
They've been stolen, of course.
Stop allowance of cheese until the theft is made up.
- Yes, sir.
- Pardon, sir. Back in Portsmouth...
...that cask was opened by you...
...and Mr. Maggs had the cheeses carried ashore.
- Silence!
- Perhaps you'll recollect, sir.
- Maggs had me take them to your house.
- You insolent scoundrel!
MAN: But I remember very well, sir.
I didn't get to see my wife that day.
Boatswain, spread-eagle that liar to the rigging till sundown.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Wind off the starboard bow, sir.
- Man the lee board braces!
ALL: Aye, aye, sir.
Here. Get that.
Well, Mr. Christian, if your rascals are any good, bring us into the wind.
Boats!
- Pull, lads! Pull!
- Lay into it, now. Get up.
Send her up, Burkitt. Pull!
CHRISTIAN:
Mr. Byam, pull up their strokes!
Pull! Pull!
- Mr. Hayward, speed up!
- Mr. Byam, use your rope's end!
CHRISTIAN: Come on, lads, pull!
- Come on, pick them up.
CHRISTIAN:
Pull!
We're almost in! Put your weight in it!
Good lad, Muspratt. Pull, lads!
We're in!
- We're in!
CHRISTIAN: Well done, there!
Shall I call the boats in, sir?
They've done their job.
What do you expect me to do, knight them? Hoist the boats.
- Aye, sir.
- Good, lads! Good, lads!
Well, we are out of the doldrums at last, sir.
I told you to spread-eagle that liar.
Why hasn't it been done?
Very good, sir.
Come along, McCoy.
[GROANING]
There's nothing more powerful than brandy.
I threw a brandy bottle overboard once, empty one, off the coast of Madagascar.
Three years later, I picked it up in a river in Portugal.
It had gone back to its home vineyard for more.
You would've made an excellent historian.
You have a profound contempt for facts.
BACCHUS: I don't despise facts, sir,
I'm indifferent to them.
[BELL RINGING]
Water. Water.
Cheese, Mr. Christian?
No, thank you, sir.
- Mr. Byam?
- No, thank you, sir.
- Mr. Fryer?
- No, thank you, sir.
Perhaps the surgeon wants cheese.
No, thank you, sir.
It's bad for my innards.
To the best of my recollection,
Mr. Christian, you're partial to cheese.
Not tonight, sir.
Burn me. I believe you're with the men.
If you'll allow me,
I think you've been unjust.
- Unjust?
BACCHUS: A bit of cheese, more or less.
Unjust? In other words, you say I'm the man who lied.
CHRISTIAN: I didn't say that, sir.
- You implied it.
I've no doubt that Maggs disposed of the cheeses without your knowledge...
...but I can't understand your treatment of the man who obeyed orders.
Maggs is my clerk. It's not for my men to question his orders.
Nor for you to question mine!
I want your apology.
I have nothing more to say, sir.
Then you can dine elsewhere on what you can get!
- Mr. Bligh.
- Byam.
Gentlemen.
Come, he implied it, didn't he, Mr. Byam?
Well, I can also dispense with your company!
Thank you, sir.
So you're all against me, officers and men.
Won't eat cheese, eh?
Before I'm done with you,
I'll make you eat grass!
I'm so hungry, if my mother would reach out to pet me...
...l'd have a bit of her hand.
There's fish there, all right, but they're making jokes about the bait.
You see--
If I could prove what I suspect, I--
No, I wouldn't.
I'm so weak, I'm peaceful.
Muspratt, Burkitt, look here, supper.
What?
Why--
Why, Mr. Christian, sir.
Take a look at this, sir.
Supper for six men.
Four pounds, they calls it.
If that weighs more than 2,
I'll eat the cat-o'-nine-tails.
- It ain't pig. It's horse meat.
- We pulled our hearts out for this breeze.
- And what do we get? We starve.
- Well, little meat, no distemper.
Keep the wind in the sails and out of your stomach.
If it's any comfort, the officers are in the same boat.
Not Captain Bligh.
He's getting fat, the dirty, thieving--
Burkitt!
Any more of that, and I'll clap you in irons.
Yes, sir.
Buckoes. Buckoes.
Here's your supper.
- Thompson, get your hook and line.
- Right.
See him? He's a big one, eh?
- Here you are, Burkitt.
- Right.
Well, we've got to have bait.
Sharks ain't seamen. They expect to eat.
We've got to have bait.
- You want to risk this for a meal?
- Aye.
- I'm willing.
- Yeah.
If the hook don't kill him, that pork will.
Let it go.
There he goes. There he goes.
- Got him.
- On deck with him.
- Easy, now. Easy, now. Easy, now.
- Hold him.
You first, Burkitt. Choose for your mess.
- Thanks, mates.
- Yeah, fine catch you've got there.
You know I must have a slice, eh?
- Shark eat shark?
- You forget yourself.
You give me a slice, a nice, large one, and I'll say nothing.
Tell him, you slimy quill-pusher.
Take your slice!
[VIOLIN PLAYS]
[GROANING]
[FOOTSTEPS]
At ease, lads. At ease.
Well, how's our shark-killer, huh?
He's cut to bits, sir.
He'll be all right. What's a flogging?
A few blows and a few "ohs," and then you put on your shirt.
- Here.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, if you'd lost a leg, my lad....
I left mine with a Spanish pirate off the coast of Trinidad.
A bullfighter did the trick for me.
He was so drunk he nearly cut off the wrong leg.
Hey! Here.
You'll be all right.
A bit tattooed on the back perhaps, but just the right style for Tahiti, eh?
- Hey, fiddler, give him a tune.
- Aye, sir.
- Good night, lads.
- Good night, sir.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[SINGING]
Listen, Byam. You can flog those fellows, starve them...
- ...but they'll bob up again with a fiddle.
- Music at sea...
...I never imagined how beautiful it was.
BLIGH: Master-at-arms, stop that infernal jamboree.
- It's worse than two cats on a fence.
MAN: Aye, aye, sir.
The old death's-head.
I've never known a better seaman, but as a man, he's a snake.
He doesn't punish for discipline.
He likes to see men crawl.
I'd like to push his poison down his own throat.
You both have one thing in common, the devil's own temper.
He can let his go...
...but whether I can keep mine bottled up for the next two years is a question.
I believe you will.
Whatever happens,
I'll always be glad I've known you.
I'll remember that when you're an admiral.
Good night, youngster.
Good night.
- More tea, sir?
- No, you get out.
Yes, sir.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, I've got a job for you this morning.
- Sit down. Had your breakfast?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
I want you to sign the list of all supplies issued on the voyage.
Certify and sign.
We should raise the island anytime now.
Not a bad voyage so far.
All hands accounted for.
Only six down with scurvy.
Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
Correct, there's your credit.
Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
We're still under canvas.
Mr. Bligh, I can't sign this book.
No such amounts have been issued.
You've signed daybooks with extra kegs the ship never carried.
- I have, sir.
- And why not? We all do it.
We'd be fools if we didn't on a lieutenant's pay.
I want to stow away enough to keep me out of the gutter.
I understand, a captain's prerogative.
Ordinarily, I wouldn't mind.
Why is this case different?
The captains I've served with didn't starve their men.
They didn't save money by buying up the stinking meat.
They didn't buy yams that would sicken a pig.
Silence!
They didn't call their men thieves and flog them in the bone.
- Impudent scoundrel! Sign that book!
- I refuse...
...and you have no authority.
I haven't?! I'll show you authority.
Lay all hands aft! All hands aft!
Very good, sir.
Company, attend!
Mr. Christian, step forward.
"If any officer or other person in the fleet...
...shall disobey any lawful command...
...of any of his superior officers, every such person...
...being convicted of such offense shall suffer death...
...or other punishment as shall be inflicted on him...
...by the sentence of a court-martial."
Mr. Christian, you will sign this book.
Mr. Bligh...
...the ship's company will bear witness that I sign in obedience to your orders.
But remember, sir, I shall demand a court of inquiry in England.
You mutinous dog.
- Retract that, sir.
- I will repeat it. You're a mutinous dog.
- Mr. Christian.
- Land ho, sir!
Furl away!
MAN:
There she waits, lads!
- What is it, Mr. Fryer?
- Tahiti, you fool.
Oh.
So you'll face me with a court of inquiry?
We're a long way from England and what can happen on this ship...
...before we get there may surprise even you.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Milk! It's milk!
Captain, they got cows here that lays eggs. What a place.
Would you help me up, sir?
I'd like to see the island.
BACCHUS:
What for? All islands are alike.
That's a singularly stupid observation, sir, and grossly unscientific.
Well, science is one thing and experience is another.
- See one island, you've seen them all.
- Fiddlesticks.
Well, I'm to be first ashore.
Captain's orders, to begin my dictionary.
I'll get my trade goods.
We can go ashore together.
All right, then.
- I know that man.
- Who is he?
A friend of Captain Cook's when I was sailing master.
Hitihiti, chief of the island, priest of the temple. Pipe him aboard.
- Mr. Fryer, dress ship.
- Very good, sir. Dress ship!

[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
- I beg your pardon?
- Where Captain Cook?
Uh, Captain Cook is dead.
- Morti?
- Yes, yes, morti.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
- He was a good man.
- Oh, yes.
- Hail King George.
- King George?
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Captain Cook say King George come on next English ship.
His Majesty is extremely sorry he couldn't come.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
I beg your pardon?
My hat.
Captain Cook say if King George don't come, he send hat.
Yes, yes, yes! Of course, the hat.
Mr. Maggs, go to my cabin and bring me the hat--
- The cocked hat, you fool!
- Yes, sir.
The hat will be here in one moment.
So we shall require
1,000 breadfruit plants.
- Breadfruit? Uru.
- Correct, uru. Uru.
- All we have for you.
- Thank you, thank you.
We shall have to stay here for several months.
We shall have provision--
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
- They're welcome to anything.
- Don't be a fool.
- You'll need those gifts to make friends.
- Him no need gift, my friend.
- Me Hitihiti, you my tayo.
- Tayo?
BLIGH: Chief makes you his friend.
- In my tongue, close friend.
You live home, my home.
Tayo. Friend, the finest word in any language.
- It shall be the first in my dictionary.
MAGGS: The hat.
Yes, thank you.
With the compliments of His Majesty
King George I I I of Great Britain.
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
- Byam, you come ashore with me.
- Sir?
Permission granted, mind you report...
- ...onboard ship every night.
- Very good.
- Byam will live with my family.
- Impossible.
- I can have no favorites aboard my ship.
- Bligh, you are chief on this ship...
...but I am chief on that island.
Byam will come with me, yes?
Perhaps that's best. Permission granted.
By the way, Mr. Morrison, pipe the ship's company aft.
MORRISON:
Aye, aye, sir. All hands aft.
[PIPE WHISTLING]
Well, we're here. Tahiti at last.
England to Cape Horn,
Africa, New Zealand...
...Van Diemen's Land and the great South Seas.
I've sailed the Bounty over 27,000 miles...
...and you think you've come to an island paradise...
...a tropical grog shop of feast and song and sleep.
Well, you're wrong!
You're here to labor.
You'll fill this ship with breadfruit trees.
You'll recondition her for sea.
Shore leave permitted if and when I can spare you.
If you abuse it, you'll answer to me.
Remember, your work is finished when we drop anchor in Portsmouth Harbor.
Mr. Fryer will have charge of work ashore.
Very good, sir.
Mr. Christian, you will remain onboard in charge of reconditioning the ship.
Unfortunately, you will have no shore leave while we're here at Tahiti.
That's all.

Hey, when's dinner?
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
[LAUGHING]
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Your language is most un-English.
It means exactly what it says.
Here are three pages on your words meaning "look."
- Plenty kind of look.
- That's the trouble.
There's one for the downcast eyes, one for the sidelong glance...
...one that invites, one that consents.
A whole language of looks.
Byam, you think too much.
One day, you head go crack.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
No, no, no, Tehani. I've told you before.
I like my flowers in a bowl.
Now, scat. I'm busy.
What do you call that look, Byam?
The look of a charming girl who will still be happy...
...when we English invaders go home.
By the way, what's your word for money?
Money? What is money?
All right, I'll explain. Which would you choose? The shilling or the nail?
Oh, no, Hitihiti. With one of these you can buy 20 of these.
- Oh? Where?
- Well, in England.
You see, in England, you must have money to live with to buy food.
In island of England, no fruit on tree?
- No fish in the sea?
- Oh, yes. Plenty.
No money, no food?
- That's right.
- I stay here.
MAN:
Byam, ahoy!
Sounds like Christian.
- Well, it can't be.
- Maybe so.
Hitihiti, you got him leave!
Byam!
Fletcher!
CHRISTIAN: Ahoy, Robinson Crusoe.
- Fletcher!
I'd given up on seeing you ashore and Hitihiti never even winked.
When he came aboard wearing that hat, even the articles of war failed Mr. Bligh.
HITIHITI:
Christian. Christian. Lieutenant.
Thank you for speaking to the captain.
The sea is good, but the earth is good also. Be at home.
It's good to be ashore again.
I've been as restless as....
CHRISTIAN: Can you speak Tahitian yet?
BYAM: Like a native.
Why, you little powder monkey!
If you cross my hawse again, I'll spank your little starboard, understand?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- Well, I didn't know you speak English.
- Yes.
- You must think me a perfect fool.
- Yes.
- Well, does she or doesn't she?
- Yes. She speak English. One word: yes.
Mr. Byam, your Tahitian dictionary.

This is Hitihiti's granddaughter.
[BYAM SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
- What did she say?
- You must be a king in your country.
What?
If His Majesty could see her...
...as I see her now, he'd forgive the error.
- Shall I tell her that?
- No, no. Just say thank you.
[BYAM SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
Byam...
...your friend is wise.
He looks, he understand.
You make word, you understand nothing.
No work today. Go swim, all.
Come along, Fletcher. I'll show you an island you'll never forget.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
- You can't imagine what it's--

They'd like to come with us, if you don't object.
- Object?

Aren't they amazing? I never knew there were such people in the world.
They're simple and kind, and yet, somehow, they're royal.

I'm sorry.
I was just thinking...
...what a contrast to the ship.
[HORN BLOWING]

Tehani wants to race me. Come on!

[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
- Oh.
- What's wrong?
He comes from the ship.
- Captain Bligh's orders.
- Bligh?
You're to report onboard immediately.
Oh, I am? Byam, I know his game!
He gives me leave and recalls it to devil me into insubordination. I'll oblige him!
I'll have one day off that ship if I swing for it! Tell him I refuse!
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
What did she say?
The man will tell Captain Bligh you can't be found.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
She says you were magnificent, like a storm at sea.
- Thanks for your kindness.
- You will come again?
That rests with you and the captain.
- You will come again.

- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Mr. Stewart.
Mr. Bligh wishes you to report to him as soon as you come aboard, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
- Reporting, sir.
- You relieve my anxiety.
I was about to send an armed shore party to look for you.
- I had your permission, sir.
- You're a fine figure of a king's officer.
If I could prove to that native you're a liar, they'd arrest you! You'll regret this!
Before this voyage is over, you'll know who's master here!
Mr. Bligh, I have in mind the dead seaman you had flogged in Portsmouth.
He struck his captain.
You'd like me to strike you.
- Well, I won't do it.
- Very clever, Mr. Christian.
1,000 plants, sir. The pick of the island!
Mr. Morgan, I shall commend your industry to Sir Joseph Banks.
Thank you. There's one difficulty, sir, a very grave one.
These growing plants require more water than we can store aboard.
We can't let them die, sir.
We won't.
Mr. Morgan, I'll take these trees to the West Indies...
...every tree in prime condition.
I shall cut the water allowance for the entire ship's company.
Good morrow to you.
I'll drink your health in Portsmouth!
- Put your stuff there.
- It's mine, sir. It's a gift.
Captain's orders.
Put it down and go forward!
Shore leave in heaven, duty in hell again.
- What have you got there?
- Monday Wash, sir.
It's a pet, sir.
Her name's Monday Wash.
Mr. Maggs, take that laundry for the captain's table.
But, sir! Oh!
Now get forward!
- Come along, there. Hurry!
- Did he hurt you?
No, but one day,
I'll take that cane away--
Look behind you.
[MUSIC BO? PLAYS]

Aren't you coming aboard, Hitihiti?
I have said farewell to Bligh.
I have sent gift to King George.

Oh. Well, thank her, Roger.
And tell her when this voyage is over, somehow, I'm coming back.
- I can't tell her that.

But it's a dream, Fletcher.
This island isn't real for you and me.
It's the ship that's real.
It's taking us home.
Tell her, Roger.

Reporting with deserters. Taken on the other side of the island. No resistance.
BLIGH:
Very well, Mr. Young.
So you let them take you alive.
You'll regret that, me lads.
Take them below.
BURKITT:
We ain't deserters, sir.
You kept us aboard because we dropped that tub of breadfruit.
- We wanted to see the island--
- Take them below and put them in irons.
Prisoners in escort, into file.
Left, turn!
Quick march!
- Is she ready for sea, Mr. Fryer?
- Ready, sir.
- Set topsails and jibs.
- Stand by. Topsails and jibs.
MAN:
All hands on deck!
[PIPE WHISTLING]
Looking about me, I can't believe we're in a ship of the royal navy.
The deck's like a barnyard!
Paradise is astern, gentlemen.
I'll break the men of that island if I have to flog every thieving--
Which reminds me...
...10 coconuts, Crown property, were stolen on your watch.
Correct, Mr. Maggs?
MAGGS: I counted myself.
- I'll account for the men in my watch.
- They didn't take them.
- Can you account for yourself?
Mr. Bligh, may I recall the outward voyage?
Harsh things were said, but I hoped the return trip would be better.
Then suppose you return the 10 coconuts.
- You think I'm so fond of them I'd steal?
- Yes, you hypocrite.
You stole Crown property more valuable.
- Explain that!
- Pearls, Mr. Christian.
- Pearls?
BLIGH: I believe I said pearls.
Fortunately, Mr. Maggs was at the boat.
He saw that native woman give you two pearls.
I think I'm beginning to understand.
The native woman, as you call her, gave the pearls to me.
- They are not Crown property.
- The goods I gave away to the natives...
...belong to the Crown.
What comes back belongs to the Crown!
I'm not the most patient man in the world. Give them to me!
Remember, Mr. Bligh:
Crown property.
Very well, Mr. Christian.
Crown property.
- Gratings rigged.
- Everybody present?
- Everyone present, sir, but the surgeon.
- Huh?
The surgeon is ill, sir.
- Ill? Drunk, you mean!
- We had to bleed him this morning, sir.
He's not fit.
Mr. Morgan and Mr. Christian agree.
Go below.
Tell him to report on deck at once!
Very good, sir.
Thomas Burkitt, Matthew Thompson, step forward.
CHRISTIAN:
Ship's company, off hats.
I'm sorry, sir.
Captain Bligh....
How do you feel?
I'm afraid I'm a very old man, lad...
- ...and a very sick one.
- I'll tell him again you can't report.
No, boy. No, I'm not worth getting into a scrape over.
For once, a midshipman gives an order.
You stay where you are.
A good lad.
I must pull him out.
I've taken the liberty of telling the surgeon to stay. He's not able to report.
I'll have no drunken relic holding up the discipline aboard my ship.
Once more, bring him on deck, or I'll have you seized up and flogged.
Byam doesn't wanna disobey you.
I beg you, don't force the old man.
He can't walk.
- Go below and see for yourself.
- Are you presuming to give me orders?
BACCHUS:
Reporting on deck for duty, sir.
Mr. Morrison, do your duty.
Four dozen, I believe.
Four dozen it is, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
- Well?
- What did you expect, Mr. Bligh?
The man's dead.
I call this ship's company to bear witness.
- You killed him!
- Silence.
Ship's company dismissed.
Boatswain, punishment postponed
24 hours.
Aye, aye, sir.
Do you hear, men?
Ship's company dismissed!
Bear a hand. Take him below.
Drunkard?
Yes, but everybody loved him.
The welfare of men on shipboard...
...depends upon things that seem small.
A joke at the right moment.
A glass of grog.
A kind word would do more with seamen than the cat-o'-nine-tails.
And this ship will be the worse...
...if possible, for his death.
Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
The natives are cannibals...
...but it's land.
The last we'll see for months.
You'd better get some rest.
You've been here for hours.
No. I can't sleep, and it's nearly my watch.
- Well, good night.
- Roger.
- There's something I want you to do.
- Gladly. What is it?
One never knows what may happen on a voyage like this.
If for any reason I don't return to England,
I want you to see my parents.
Well, why shouldn't you return to England?
Why?
I can't stand this devil's work much longer.
One day I'll forget this discipline and break his neck.
Wait until we're back in England.
The admiralty will save you the trouble.
Well, in any case,
I'd like you to see my parents.
- Of course. Where do they live?
- In Cumberland at Maincordare.
I've almost forgotten what the old place looks like.
I haven't seen it in 10 years.
But I do remember a tapestry in the hall...
...with ships and islands on it.
Perhaps that's what sent me off to sea.
I don't know.
In any case, I'd like you to see my home.
If anything should happen, tell my father and mother you knew me.
- You can count on me.
CHRISTIAN: Good. That's settled, then.
BLIGH: Mr. Byam, you're up late.
- It's fairly warm below.
I hadn't noticed. A true sailor can sleep in an oven or on ice. Get below.
Very good, sir.
[BELL RINGING]
Your watch, Mr. Christian.
And I must count the coconuts.
McCOY:
Mr. Christian, sir.
That shark's been following us since the surgeon died, waiting for the burial.
- Couldn't I have a musket to shoot it?
- Take the deck.
- I'll get the keys to the arms chest.
- Two muskets.
- I'd like to shoot that shark onboard.
- McCoy!
It's no use. Now's our chance.
There's a lot of us here ready. And the officers and men that won't join us....
- Well, it's them or us!
- Keep your hatch closed!
Now, get forward!
MAN 1:
Who's there?
MAN 2:
Sailor hand, mate.
- Hey, what's this noise about here?
- Water, mate.
Water?
- For deserters?
- But the lad slipped his cable.
Well, here's to you slipping yours.
When I'm free, I'll wring your scrawny pipe stem till your tongue pops out!
Tongue, is it? I'll give you something to remind you of that slice of shark.
[YELLING]
You scum! Get out!
I'm sorry, lad.
Are you all right?
Thank you, Mr. Christian, sir.
Better take care of Thompson, sir.
Murdering butcher!
I've had enough of this blood ship!
He's not master of life and death on a quarterdeck above the angels. McCoy!
Quintal!
I'm sick of blood! Bloody backs!
Bloody faces!
Bligh, you've given your last command!
We'll be men again if we hang for it!
- You say you're ready for anything?
- Aye!
- Release them!
- You're taking the ship?
Mutiny?
Yes, mutiny! Pass the word.
Seize the arms chest.
MAN:
We've been waiting for this!
[WHISTLING]
No! Don't hit me!
Take him!
Boatswain!
No, no, don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
Now, wake up! Get into your clothes and lose no time about it.
- What's the matter?
- What's happened?
- Have we been attacked?
- No, we've taken the ship.
And old Bligh's a prisoner.
Mutiny?
Tie him to the pipe.
Mr. Morrison! Mr. Coleman!
Shut up or I'll shut your trap for you!
Give up this madness, or we'll all be murdered.
You're in no danger.
What will we do with him?
- Shoot him!
- I'll slit his dirty throat!
See that, you butcher? My four dozen.
We'll give you 400.
- We'll let you know what it feels like!
ELLISON: Flog him!
You old rogue. You'd flog us.
You'd make us eat grass.
You bluenosed baboon!
Back! Back, all of you!
No more flogging aboard this ship.
That's why we're taking it.
We'll have something to say about that!
What will you do with him?
Put him in a launch and cast him adrift.
Give him food, water, cutlasses and a compass.
You can have your choice.
Go with him or stay with me.
No. Slit his throat, I say, and feed him to the sharks.
And I say go forward!
Clear the launch and lower away!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Stand by, Thompson.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Lively, old buzzing bees.
What a pity, what a pity!
Every little tree, perfect.
- You'll be sure to water them?
- Never you fret. We'll water them.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN: We'll take care of your plants, here, Morgan!
You may stay onboard if you like, without joining us.
No, thank you, sir.
All right. Your turn, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Christian, I give you your last chance to return to duty.
I'll take my chance against the law.
You'll take yours against the sea.
But you're taking my ship! My ship!
Your ship? The king's ship, you mean, and you're not fit to command it.
Into the boat!
We're ready, Churchill.
Bear a hand here, will you?
[GUNFIRE]
McCoy! McCoy!
CHURCHILL: Two little monkey jackets.
Loyal to Captain Bligh, eh?
MUSPRATT: Serves them right.
- Come on, lads, on deck.
MORRISON:
I tell you, we will!
Mr. Christian, you forgot us.
Call back the boat.
There's no more room.
You must stay with us.
- We'll join our captain!
- We're not mutineers!
I said there was no more room!
Take them below!
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN 1:
Stand the guns on them!
MAN 2:
Give them a drink!
Casting me adrift 3500 miles from a port of call.
You're sending me to my doom, eh?
Well, you're wrong, Christian!
I'll take this boat as she floats to England if I must!
I'll live to see you, all of you...
...hanging from the highest yardarm in the British fleet!
Yardarms, is it? I'll give you yardarms.
Burkitt!
You're not leaving them adrift?
They'll starve or drown.
- That's Bligh's affair.
- Your friends, Morgan, Purcell--
Do you think I wanted this?
- Call back the boat.
- No.
- Call it back!
- No!
These men have been in hell.
I couldn't stand it.
- Then I must go with Bligh.
- There's no room.
Then I call on you men.
All of you, in the name of the king, return to duty.
THOMPSON:
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Give me that gun! Give me that!
Take him below.
Stand by to wear ship.
- What course, sir?
- West-northwest, Tahiti.
Tahiti, lads!
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[SINGING]
Hey, Thompson!
Here comes their water!
Sit down, Roger.
You know, there are five other men onboard...
...who refused to take part in the mutiny.
They've agreed not to try and retake the ship.
You may have your liberty under the same conditions.
I simply want your word for it.
You may have it.
But I'll escape if I can.
I understand.
Then I may go?
Yes, you may go.
Roger...
...l'm sorry I had to hit you.
That didn't hurt.
What hurts is that you and l can never again be friends.
Keep her as she goes, west-northwest.
West-northwest, sir.
I presume you'll make for the nearest island.
No. That's certain death. The savages in these parts are fierce cannibals.
We must keep well clear of those fellas.
By my reckoning, the first port from which we can expect help is Timor...
...in the Dutch East Indies, some 3500 miles away.
Then our case is hopeless.
It is by no means hopeless.
We have extra canvas, rope, a tool chest.
We'll put on every rag of sail.
That's impossible. Deeply laden as we are, we'd fill with the first storm.
Then we'll bail with our hands if we must.
She'll see us through if we do our part, she will!
Begging your pardon, sir, but the food and the water.
We haven't got enough for 10 days.
If we are to reach Timor alive, we must make it last 20, 40, 50 days.
It's the sea against us.
Mr. Bligh, we'd be pleased if you'd ask God's blessing on our journey.
That I shall do, Mr. Fryer.
Almighty God, thou knowest our need.
Grant we acquit ourselves like men...
...in the trials and dangers that lie before us.
Bail!
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Bail!
Bail faster!
Bail faster! Bail!
Another piece, Mr. Maggs.
Thank you.
Thank you, lad.
Are we all served?
All served, sir.
Now, lads, for your own good, eat and drink slowly.
How far have we still to go, sir?
Don't let your mind dwell upon that, lad.
Think how far we've come.
We'll never see Portsmouth again?
We'll see Portsmouth again...
...and we'll see Fletcher Christian hanging from a yardarm...
...and every pirate with him.
Steady, mates.
Steady.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
- Mr. Fryer, take the tiller.
- Aye, sir.
Get away! I caught him!
Hey, lads! Give me that bird!
Share and share alike, lads.
The blood for the sick.
Raise him up, Mr. Maggs.
Norton, get me a cup.
This will nourish you, Mr. Morgan.
No, thank you, sir.
Give it to the youngsters.
They need it more.
Yes, Mr. Morgan, but I'm still giving the orders.
Timor, up ahead.
Timor!
Up with you. Up with you.
[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
We've beaten the sea itself.

Won't you come--?

- Merry Christmas, Fletcher.
Oh, thanks, lad.
I've been hoping for this for a year.
Come in. This is a day worth celebrating.
Begging your pardon, sir.
We've brought the little lady a bit of Christmas.
Well, thanks, lad.
But she must have it from you.
Come in. Come in, lads, all of you.

My boy was like that when I left home, sir.
He'll be 3 years old now.

What? A ship?
- Maybe she's Spanish.
- No.
- No, she's British-rigged.
- British?
Did you hear that, mate? British.
- British?
- She's coming for us.
We've got a chance.
The wind's against her.
She must lay outside the reef till morning.
Get your families and your goods together!
Get aboard the Bounty!
Thompson, everyone onboard?
Burkitt and Muspratt have gone into hiding.
The fools! They'll be taken and hanged.
Get in the boat.
Where are you taking us?
I don't know. The Pacific is filled with uncharted islands.
We'll find one and settle there for good.
Mr. Christian, I've got a wife and child in England. I've got to get back.
Back? You know what that means?
A yardarm.
I must take that chance, sir.
But whatever happens,
I'll never blame you.
Thanks, lad, and I understand.
Good luck.
Well, this is goodbye, youngster.
We'll never see each other again, that's certain.
- But I'll remember.
- I will too, Fletcher.
When you're back in England with the fleet...
...you'll hear the hue and cry against me.
From now on, they'll spell mutiny with my name.
I regret that...
...but not the taking of the ship.
Every time I think of Bligh....
Well, I'd do it again.
If ever I reach England again,
I'll go to your father and tell him the truth.
Thanks.
- I'll be happier knowing that.
- Fletcher.
What is out there for you?
Another island.
- Stand by. I'll be back in a moment.
- Hurry up, Byam.
When she comes around the headland, we'll pilot her in.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Oh, Tehani, I'll be back in two hours.
Tehani knows.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
The ship may be here for months before she sails.
But she will sail.
Byam, midshipman. Tehani knows.
Tehani, you're my wife, always.
Mrs. Roger Byam.
My wife, my darling.
[SHOUTS IN TAHITIAN]
There she is, lads, and we've nothing to fear.
We took no part in the mutiny.
Soon we'll be in England.
Thank God! Thank God!
We're returning. Good, eh?
Very good, sir. My name's Byam,
Roger Byam. This is Mr. Stewart.
We're midshipmen of His Majesty's ship, Bounty.
BLIGH:
Bring those men up!
Captain Bligh, thank God you're alive, sir.
They gave me a boat and a sail, didn't they?
Where is Fletcher Christian?
He sailed yesterday, sir, when your ship was sighted.
- Where to?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know, Stewart?
- I don't know either.
You're lying, both of you.
Sergeant, put these men in irons.
- Irons? What for?
- Mutiny.
But we're not mutineers.
A court-martial in England will decide that.
- We're as loyal as you.
- A court-martial will decide that!
We're reporting for duty!
If we're guilty, we'd go with Christian.
When Christian took my ship, you remained with him...
...and you'll have to answer for it.
It'll be better to tell me where he's gone!
- We don't know, sir.
- Then you'll lie in the hold...
...until you do know.
Sergeant, take them below!
MORRISON:
By the mark, 12! Rocky bottom!
- To the lee helm.
- Lee helm, sir.
- Steady!
- Steady, sir.
Mark 12!
- Foretop, any sail in sight?
- No sail, sir.
- Banktop!
- No sail, sir.
MORRISON:
By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!
Mr. Byam, I can't understand why he keeps us below here in irons.
You and Mr. Stewart, McIntosh,
Coleman, Byrne and myself...
...we are no mutineers.
Haven't I told him that time and time again?
His marines surprised me and Muspratt, sir, or we wouldn't be here, alive.
MORRISON:
Reefs ahead!
BLIGH:
Attention below.
Have you decided to tell me where Christian sailed for?
MORRISON:
By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!
Well, I'm waiting!
Well, stay here and rot.

Very well, Mr. Young.
[YELLS IN TAHITIAN]
- You heathen slime!
- Enough!
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Christian, sir, when are you going to make a landfall?
We're fierce sick of this.
It's more than man can stand...
...to be at sea forever in a ghost ship.
I've steered off the track of ships.
When it's safe, I'll put about for the island.
Until then you've got to trust me, that's all.
Deep 11. Rocky bottom!
I beg you again to give up the search.
The Bounty must be lost. The ship's dragging barnacles. The seams are open.
Men are working the pumps day and night.
- We're still afloat, are we not?
- Only by the grace of God in these reefs.
- Ease her off a point.
MAN: Ease her off a point, sir.
I must remind you this is one of His Majesty's ships.
Mr. Edwards, I intend to bring back
Fletcher Christian.
Unless he's hanging from a yardarm, not one of His Majesty's ships is safe.
Mutiny and piracy will be rampant in the fleet.
- But we'll lose the ship.
- Then we'll lose it!
As long as I have a deck under me,
I'll search for that man.
Fourteen!
MAN:
To starboard!
Old Bligh's a seaman.
The rocks are so thick, a fish couldn't swim between them...
- ...without rubbing off his scales.

...or the sharks will have us.

What's happened?
- Hard to port!
- Very good, sir!
Haul out both of them!
Get the doors!
Captain Bligh!
Get us out! We'll drown!
Lift with them and turn around!
Captain Bligh! Let us out of here!
Save your voice, man!
Take charge of the aft boat.
Captain Bligh, get us out of here!
- Get those men out!
- Aye, aye, sir! Come on, men!

Hurry up with you down there.
Thank you. You saved our lives.

How long has this trial been going on?
MAN 2: About a week now.
They should reach a verdict soon.
Oh, there, there, child.
But they won't let me see him.
Why won't they let me see him?
If I could see him to talk to him, he'd know I trust him.
- He knows that, darling.
- Oh, but it's cruel. Cruel.
They can't hang him!
[GUNFIRE]
MAN 3: There's the signal.
The trial is opened again.
On the 15th day of September, 1792...
...for mutiny on His Majesty's ship,
Bounty.
MAN:
Call Mr. Fryer.
Mr. Fryer.
Do you swear by God any evidence you give...?
MAN: Besides the leader, did you see any of the prisoners now before this court...
...in arms?
FRYER: Yes, milord.
MAN: Inform the court.
FRYER: Seaman Burkitt and Seaman
Muspratt were armed with muskets.
Seaman Ellison was armed with a bayonet.
MAN: Have any of the accused any questions to put to this witness?
Yes, milord.
Good morning, Mr. Fryer.
Oh, good morning, lad.
Mr. Fryer, you say I was armed with a bayonet.
- Did you see me use it?
- By no means, lad.
MAN: Address your replies to the court.
- Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
He merely flourished it under Captain Bligh's nose...
...and called him a few names.
Names? What names did he call him?
Sir, he--
He called him a bluenosed baboon.
[LAUGHING]
Have you any more questions to ask the witness?
ELLISON:
No, milord.
That is all.
Milord, I should like to ask a few questions of Captain Bligh.
Very well, Captain Nelson.
- Call Captain Bligh.
- Captain Bligh.
Captain Bligh, in the previous evidence given before this court...
...you failed to make clear one very important point:
A motive for the mutiny.
Can you tell us why your men took your ship?
No, sir. Until I was seized in the cabin, I suspected nothing.
A circumstance occurred the night before...
...which should have aroused my suspicions.
Going on deck, I found Fletcher Christian and Roger Byam...
...talking together at the rail.
I heard Roger Byam say,
"You can count on me."
I heard Christian reply,
"Good. That's settled."
I saw them shake hands.
I realized afterwards they were plotting to seize the Bounty.
But that's not true, Captain Bligh.
Milord, gentlemen, let me explain.
If the prisoner so desires, he may question the witness.
Captain Bligh, you've not repeated my whole talk with Fletcher Christian.
Did you not hear him tell me about his home in Cumberland?
I did not.
Well, did you not hear him ask my promise...
...that if he did not return, I would tell his parents what had happened?
I did not.
I swear before God and before this court...
...that was the content of my talk with Christian.
It had nothing to do with mutiny.
Captain Bligh, apart from the conversation you overheard...
...was Mr. Byam's previous conduct such that you believe him guilty?
Sir, his entire conduct convinces me that he plotted with Christian.
They were friends before the mutiny.
They remained friends after the mutiny.
When I arrived, the prisoner could've arrested Christian.
But he allowed him to escape.
On his own admittance.
Yes, but you knew I was trapped on the island, perhaps for years.
Outnumbered, unarmed.
I gave my word to Christian not to move against him.
Mr. Byam, if you were loyal when Christian escaped...
...I should have found you dead.
I have nothing more to ask him.
I can only say again to this court,
I am not guilty of mutiny.
If that is so, why did you not join your captain when he was cast adrift?
I was below planning a counterattack to regain the ship from the mutineers.
With whom did you plan the attack?
Sir, with my messmate,
Midshipman Stewart.
Milord...
...Midshipman Stewart died in the Pandora's boat.
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Can't they ever reach a verdict?
I'm that sick of waiting, I could stamp on a litter of wildcats...
...and never feel a scratch.
Well, what are you looking at?
It ain't Tahiti. It's only Portsmouth.
I thought she might row by in a boat.
Who, the queen?
No, my wife.
Sorry, lad.
Why can't I see her?
My wife, my boy...
...that's all I've come back for.
I knew they'd hang me.
But I've got to see them.
I've got to see them!
Blast these sea captains!
Who made their sea law?
God didn't. The burning killers!
Lad! We're all in the same boat, Tom.
They won't let me see my mother.
Won't you help us now by holding on?
Yes, sir.
Roger Byam?
Follow me, please.
- Sir Joseph.
- My lad, they've reached a verdict.
- Watch the dirk.
- The dirk?
The midshipman's dirk will be lying on the table before Lord Hood.
If it lies crosswise, you've been acquitted.
If the point lies toward you, you've been condemned.
God be with you.
Thank you, sir.
MAN: Prisoner and escort, halt.
Left, hut.
HOOD: Have you anything to say before the sentence of this court...
...is passed upon you?
Milord, much as I desire to live,
I'm not afraid to die.
Since I first sailed on the Bounty four years ago...
...l've known how men can be made to suffer worse things than death.
Cruelly, beyond duty, beyond necessity.
Captain Bligh, you've told your story of mutiny on the Bounty.
How men plotted against you, seized your ship...
...cast you adrift in an open boat.
A great venture in science brought to nothing. Two British ships lost.
But there's another story,
Captain Bligh...
...of 10 coconuts and two cheeses.
A story of a man who robbed his seamen, cursed them, flogged them.
Not to punish, but to break their spirit.
A story of greed and tyranny...
...and of anger against it, of what it cost.
One man, milord, would not endure such tyranny.
That's why you hounded him. That's why you hate him, hate his friends.
And that's why you're beaten.
Fletcher Christian's still free.
But Christian lost too, milord.
God knows he's judged himself more harshly than you could judge him.
I say to his father, he was my friend.
No finer man ever lived.
I don't try to justify his crime, his mutiny...
...but I condemn the tyranny that drove him to it.
I don't speak here for myself alone, but for these men you've condemned.
I speak in their names and Fletcher
Christian's name for all men at sea.
These men don't ask for comfort.
They don't ask for safety.
If they could speak to you, they'd say:
"Let us choose to do our duty willingly.
Not the choice of a slave, but that of free Englishmen."
They ask only the freedom that England expects for every man.
If one man among you believed that--
One man.
He could command the fleets of England.
He could sweep the seas for England.
If he called his men to their duty not by flaying their backs...
...but by lifting their hearts...
...their....
That's all.
Roger Byam, midshipman.
Having heard the evidence against you and having heard your own defense...
...the sentence of this court is you shall suffer death by hanging...
...onboard such of His Majesty's ships of war and at such time...
...as the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral...
...of Great Britain and Ireland shall direct.
MAN:
Prisoner and escort, into file.
Left, turn. Quick, hut.
I pronounce this court dissolved.
Milord, may I congratulate the court?
Captain Bligh, in my opinion, your open-boat voyage...
...was the most remarkable conduct of navigation in the history of the sea.
I must admire your seamanship and courage, but....
Detachment, fall in.
[LOCK TURNING]
Thanks, mate.
I've seen them, sir, thanks to you and your friends.
The wife, she's well, sir.
And the boy, blow me,
I hardly knew him, he's growed so.
You wouldn't believe it, the dead spit of me.
I'm glad, Tom.
Look, sir. Like the one she gave me the day we sailed for Tahiti.
Do you know, sir, that sailing seems like a dream.
As far away as the islands are.
I remember how Mr. Christian talked to me that day.
Cheered me up, he did.
Where do you think he is now, sir?
I'd give anything to know.
One thing's certain, he's taken that ship beyond maps.
I wonder if he found his island.
MAN: Well, sir, what did you find?
- Your new home, lads.
There she is, Pitcairn's Island.
THOMPSON:
There's no place to land.
That's why I chose it. I plan to run the Bounty in head-on, then burn her.
- Burn her?
- We'd be fools to burn her.
We'll be fools if we don't.
If there's one spar left in sight, we'll never be safe.
MAN: Sir, we can't burn the ship.
- We can never get back.
There's no way back, lad.
Once ashore, we're there to stay.
But this ship's our last tie with home.
Yon's a lonely rock to die on.
It's enough to live on.
There's sun and earth and water.
It can be a hell or a home as we choose to make it.
We'll remember this as long as we live and regret it.
And remember why we took this ship.
They can't press-gang you there, they can't starve you, and can't flog you.
We're not afraid of a new life.
As long as we can live it with decency and self-respect, we can and we must.
For ourselves and our children.
Well, hands for burning?
- I say burn her, hull and sticks.
ALL: Aye, aye.
Very well. We'll get the women and children ashore...
...and then stand by to take her in.
ALL: Aye, sir.
She makes a grand light, sir.
Good English oak.
Discipline has been maintained.
The mutineers who confessed have been punished.
But we're here to plead for the life of Roger Byam...
...because we believe him innocent.
And there is more at stake here,
Your Majesty, than his life.
We do not exaggerate when we say a new understanding...
...between officers and men has come to the fleet.
By returning Byam to duty, Your Majesty will confirm that understanding.
And not for today only, but for all time to come.
[SINGING]
Everyone aboard?
- The last shore boat's coming alongside.
- Make ready for sea.
Very good, sir.
- Ship ready for sea, sir.
- Very good.
Midshipman Byam, reporting for duty.
- You take the mizzenmast, Byam.
- Very good.
- Very glad to have you with us, lad.
- Thank you, sir.
- May I, Byam?
- Of course.
We're off to the Mediterranean, lad.
We'll sweep the seas for England.
Sir?
[ENGLISH - US - SDH]
Carl Denham.
Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson!
Get out! I'll have you arrested.
That's my business...
Pretending to be the gas man.
- I'm supposed to...
- The very idea.
All right, Mr. Denham. It's only me.
I am sorry, Mr. Denham. He said he was the gas man. Had a card and everything.
Listen, Mrs. Hudson, as long as I am rooming in your house... if your own father comes to the door, don't you believe a word he says.
It's a pity the people in New York don't try and catch a few gunmen... instead of hunting a nice gentleman like you.
Is Mrs. Hudson there?
Oh, ho. That's the lady in the front room.
- Oh.
- Coming.
I'm from the news.
Is that so? Well, I've got news for you:
You're going to get out of this room so fast...
- No, I'm not.
- Ladies, no riots, please.
If people don't stop getting into my house under false pretenses...
I just want a story.
If I go back without it, I'll lose my job.
- Don't bother to pull that old line.
- You're big news, you know.
What, after a whole month?
That's time enough for New York to forget the World War.
The War was a long way off, but King Kong, the giant ape...
- ...was right here on the spot.
- So I've heard.
And you're the man that brought him here.
Kong is dead. But everybody's interested in you, too, Mr. Denham.
All those people that Kong killed and injured... all the property owners who are suing you for damages, and...
And the theater owners, and the men who put money in advanced publicity, and...
Say, are you telling me?
Why don't you let him alone? He hasn't dared leave the house for a week.
That's what I want, the personal reaction story.
You want to know what the captor of the late Kong...
- ...thinks about, eh?
- Yes.
I thought I had him safe.
Don't you suppose I'm sorry for the harm he did?
I wish I'd left him on his island.
Old Kong, I'm sure paying for what I did to you.
Mrs. Hudson, suppose we look out and count the gentlemen in disguise... who are waiting for me?
If I don't get out of this house pretty soon, I'll choke.
Hey!
Aren't you going to give me a story?
All right, tell my public that Carl Denham, the bright boy... who was going to make a million dollars out of King Kong, is flat broke.
Everybody in New York is suing me for something.
The only place I haven't heard from is the Bide-A-Wee home.
But, Mr. Denham, my readers want to know...
There's a newsboy and a peddler and a taxi driver out there.
I'll bet you a nickel they're all process servers.
- There's a man coming up the steps.
- Huh?
Why, it's Charlie. Let him in.
- Hello, Charlie, what do you want?
- Captain Englehorn send you this.
- Where'd you come from?
- All time, stay on ship.
- Cook for Skipper. Easy job.
- Mm.
Tell the Skipper I'll be over at the ship as soon as I can get out of here.
- What's matter? You scared to come out now?
- You said it. Much obliged, Charlie.
- Maybe you can get out through the basement.
- Come on. Let's try it.
Rags.
Bottles, rags.
You've got a nerve.
I got everything, lady.
And I buy everything.
Rags, bones.
Say, you fresh guy!
Mrs. Hudson.
Mr. Carl Denham.
Well, I'll be. Hello, Mickey.
- Hello.
- Have a heart, will you?
That's 15 of those things you've slipped me.
- I'm the best in the business, Mr. Denham.
- Well, what is it this time?
Steiner and Wayne.
Destruction of property by Kong on 39th street.
Shock, mental anguish, and sprained ankle to owner of said property.
If I don't get out of this house,
I'll bite somebody.
Listen, Mickey, I've got a date.
You've done your job.
How about helping me out-smart those other guys?
Mr. Denham, I'll give you a ride on my junk wagon.
You... Ha, ha. You mean to say you've got a wagon to go with that makeup?
Mr. Denham, I'm an artist.
Hey.
How did you get in there?
You can go from the roof to chimney.
Anthony St. Nick and Santa Claus.
Ooh. Commence.
Rags.
Bottles. Bones.
Rags. Hey, you can take off the tin hat.
You're safe now.
Where are you going, Mr. Denham?
Drop me at the nearest subway station, James.
You know, it's funny how anybody's troubles are somebody's gain.
I've been working steady since you got in this jam.
You've no idea how that cheers me up.
The boy who was going to make a million dollars.
Rags!
So that's the mess I'm in, Skipper.
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.
I guess next time you leave big monkey alone, huh?
Next time? Ha, ha.
Charlie must think Kongs are plentiful.
Well, Denham, now I'll tell you why I wanted to see you.
- I've got a plan for both of us-
- What is it?
Going to get a couple of megaphones and run sightseeing trips around the harbor?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Mr. Denham, I...
Mickey.
- One more summons and I'll brain you.
- No, wait, Mr. Denham.
I ain't got no summons. Honest. I ain't.
I come to tip you off.
- Did you follow me over here?
- No, I live over here.
My father-in-law said he saw you come in by the gates.
I feel very friendly to you, Mr. Denham.
You've kept me working pretty steady lately.
Yeah, sure, I know, I've been a big help.
Now, what's on your mind?
I heard this afternoon you're going to be indicted.
- What?
- Indicted.
- The grand jury's going to indict you.
- Let me out of this. I'm going crazy.
You take my tip and get out.
Summons is one thing and grand jury is something else already.
- They are going to put you on the stand.
- Stop it! All right, Mickey, much obliged.
- Now beat it, will you?
- All right. Such a fine customer.
Oh, Denham?
- Denham, I...
- What good is the grand jury?
What can they find out?
I brought Kong back here, he got loose, did a lot of damage... got killed, and that's that.
- What can I do about it?
- We can go to jail for 10 years.
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm in it, too, up to my neck.
Now, see here. This ship's still mine.
There are no attachments on her yet.
- They just haven't got around to you.
- That's a good reason for hurrying.
In three hours, I can get together a skeleton crew, enough to handle her.
Yeah, and we'll go yachting.
We can make some sort of a living carrying freight.
Take the East Indies.
There are hundreds of little ports there that no sizable ship ever goes to.
- I know that part of the world.
- What'll we use for money?
Well, I... I've saved up a little.
Enough to get us started.
- Yes, but...
- Come on, Denham.
You know, Skipper... you're pretty swell to be willing to take me with you.
- Is it a go, then?
- What?
To be off on this old ship again, out of all this?
Say, you bet it's a go.
Well, this looks like a hustling community, Skipper.
Suppose we can get any business here?
Better get some soon, or we won't be able to pay the crew.
Say, uh, how far is it to Kong's island?
1,753 miles.
Well, you're pretty glib with that.
You must have been checking up.
Huh? Oh.
I just happened to come across our old chart last night... and I was curious.
Yeah, sure.
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir.
Get that number two hatch off and break out the cargo.
That won't take very long.
If we weren't so short-handed,
I'd get rid of that man.
He's a troublemaker.
Of course, Wong Ho would have to ship his copra last week.
Well, let's see.
There's a couple of half-caste traders here.
We might see them tomorrow...
- ...and get a bit of a cargo.
- Look, Skipper. There's a show in town.
- I'll bet it's terrible.
- Don't be a crab, Skipper. It's a show.
We ought to see it.
- I want a drink and some dinner.
- There's plenty of time for that.
You don't mean to say you're going to miss the sagacious seals?
Don't you want to laugh and thrill with La Belle Helene?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Come, Bobby. Come, George.
Come, Fattima. In with you.
And now, La Belle Helene!
Sweet songstress who has appeared before all the crowned heads of Europe... will conclude the performance... with one of her most popular songs.
La Belle Helene!
Oh, I've got the runaway blues
I want to wander away
Oh, I've got the runaway blues today
Don't want to stay
I know that trains are going somewhere
And steamers are sailing the blue
They go, but baby, what do I care?
'Cause none of them's going to you
Poor kid.
- You know, she's got something.
- It certainly isn't the voice.
Voice, who cares? She's got personality.
Somebody'd show her what to do with it.
I hear the steamer whistle crying
Whoo, whoo
It's just an echo when I'm sighing
Whoo, whoo
You ran away and never told me
What for, what for
And now your arms will never hold me
No more, no more
I don't want the train on the track
Don't want the ship on the sea
Why? 'Cause they ain't bringing you back to me
Poor me
Thank you for your kind reception of our efforts.
And remember, another big show here tomorrow night.
Well, if that's your idea of a pleasant evening, I...
It's interesting, Skipper.
I'll bet you could take a kid like that... and put her over to the producer of a musical comedy.
- But not to the captain of a freighter.
- Ha, ha.
Father, is that man coming again tonight?
Yes, he is. Any objection?
Can't I have a friend drop in?
- He isn't a friend.
- Well, he's a white man...
- ...somebody to talk to.
- Somebody to drink with.
That's enough. Shut up now and go to bed.
You can't get away from here. No money.
How you think you can get away from here? Huh?
Your Dutchman will be here in a couple of days, won't he?
Dutch magistrate? Ha!
What do you think he'll do for you?
He don't care what happens to you and your rotten little show.
Not a rotten show.
I was ringmaster in the biggest circus.
Used to play Colombo, Singapore.
Sure, and you was rotten.
Who're you calling... Who are you?
- Rotten captain!
- You lay off me.
Rotten captain, lost ship.
Lost it on purpose, eh?
Tried to get the insurance...
- ...didn't you?
- Shut up.
Poor captain.
Lost ship, lost job.
Lost certificate.
Ah, dry up, you old tramp.
You're a tramp.
No certificate, no job.
You're no better than me.
And you just lay off my liquor, will you?
Give it back.
Father! Father!
Father!
Father, Father, tell me what happened.
Who did it?
Tony.
Tony, come down.
Tony.
Tony, please, come down.
Tony.
Tony.
- Tony.
- You'll never catch a monkey that way.
- Did you ever catch a monkey?
- Did I ever...? Ha, ha.
Lady, you'd be surprised.
They won't come back.
Oh, well, why should they?
Oh, uh...
I saw your show last night.
How'd the monkeys get away?
I had to let them out.
The tent burned.
Where's the man who owns the show?
He's my father.
He was hurt.
He's dead.
Well, what a tough break.
I'm sorry, kid.
My father used to be with World Wide.
- That's the biggest circus in the East.
- Yes, I know. What did you do?
I was in the ballet.
I wasn't very good.
What happened to World Wide?
Well, my father... Well, he sort of drank.
You know.
And...
They didn't want him anymore.
- So he started his own show.
- Yes.
Well, we just had a few monkeys.
It wasn't very good.
Say, that's no way to talk.
"I wasn't very good, the show wasn't very good."
Cut it out! You want to tell everybody how good you are.
Throw out your chest. Brag about yourself.
Oh.
So you're in the show business too.
No, I'm in the shipping business.
- I just put in with the cargo.
- Oh.
I thought maybe you had a show, and I could...
No, I'm sorry.
Well, I've got a date.
Are you going to be all right?
I mean, have you got any money?
Yes.
Well, keep your chin up.
I'll be seeing you.
Miss, I heard about your father.
- If I could do anything...
- You've done enough.
You killed my father.
Killed? Why, what...?
The tent caught fire.
My father was beaten over the head.
He wasn't burned.
What do you think the magistrate will say to that when he gets here?
You can't accuse me.
- You wasn't there.
- How do you know I wasn't?
Unless you were.
How do you know what my father said to me before he...?
Before he died?
He... What did he say?
The magistrate will be here in a few days.
I'll tell him.
You better be careful.
What are you going to tell the magistrate?
You can just wonder about that till he gets here.
- There isn't a pound of cargo for us here.
- What'll we do now?
Might pick up some business in the Banda group.
It's a dull life, Skipper.
We need excitement.
Carl Denham.
Don't you remember me?
- Nils Helstrom.
- Well, for the love of Mike. Helstrom.
Sure, I remember you.
This is Captain Englehorn.
Captain Helstrom. Sit down.
Say, do you know who this is?
The man who gave me the map of Kong's island.
And he wants to know if I remember him. Ha-ha-ha!
Have a drink.
So, that was your ship came in last night?
Mine and Denham's.
I heard about you in Singapore.
How you'd captured the biggest animal on earth and taken him back to New York.
Agh.
I'm down, Denham.
- Don't you think you owe me something?
- Ha, ha.
Well, sir, you certainly came to the right man.
- How about a 50-50 split?
- You mean that?
Sure, I mean it. I'll give you half of everything I made out of King Kong.
- How much would that come to?
- Well, let's see, 10... no, 11 lawsuits and the privilege of being indicted by the grand jury too.
- Ah. Then you're broke too?
- Broke? I'm shattered.
Well, then how about giving me passage on your ship?
- I want to get away from here.
- Where's your own ship?
I lost her on the Banka reefs.
- Tough luck. No job since?
- Everyone is down on me.
It wasn't my fault.
You know what those waters are like.
Will you take me to some port that isn't Dutch?
- What's the matter with the Dutch?
- I tell you, they're down on me.
I want to make a fresh start.
You realize how far we'd have to go to land you out of Dutch, uh... jurisdiction?
We can't run all over the Indian Ocean carrying one passenger.
Sorry, old man. Have another drink.
But, Denham, when you got Kong off that island... didn't you get the treasure?
- What?
- Didn't you find the treasure?
Find it?
Why, I never even heard of it.
- Say, are you kidding me?
- Why should I?
To tell the truth, I had an idea
I'd go and look for it myself someday.
You held out on me, eh?
How much do you know about this treasure?
Well, not a lot.
Dying native I picked up at sea...
You drew the map from his description, and he told you about the great wall.
Yeah, he talked about the treasure of the island.
Who put it there?
Why, the people who built the wall.
Yes, that might be.
Skipper, do you remember I said there wasn't a reason... on Earth for going back?
Look. The answer to a prayer.
We're off again.
Hello. I heard you were stopping here.
Felt a little worried about you.
Thought I'd better see you before I go.
- Are you going?
- Yes. Off tonight in a big rush.
- On your ship?
- Yeah, sure.
There isn't any other way to get out of this place, is there?
Oh, uh, here, you take this.
- Can't I go too?
- What?
- Let me go on your ship.
- Nix, kid, nix.
We're going on a long voyage.
We won't be putting in at any port where we could leave you.
Don't leave me. Please, take me with you.
I won't be any trouble.
I'll just sit on the ship.
I won't talk or anything.
Listen, kid, I can't. Honest.
Now, you take this money and buy yourself a passage on the next ship... that's going where you want to go.
- Go on, take it.
- Let me go with you.
Please. Please.
No, no, no, nothing doing.
Now, you take it. Sorry it isn't more, but that's the best I can do.
There'll be a schooner or something along pretty soon.
I can't take you, kid. You'll be okay.
You just make a plan and stick to it.
- All right.
- That's a good girl.
It's a pretty tough life, isn't it?
Well...
Good luck.
- Weather's made-to-order, Skipper.
- I hope it holds.
The next land we sight will be Kong's island.
Yeah.
That fellow Helstrom is getting too chummy with the crew.
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you call him down for it?
What's your opinion of Helstrom?
Well, he got in some trouble over losing his ship, I guess.
That's pretty plain.
He certainly was anxious to leave Dakang.
And he isn't at all anxious to get to Kong's island.
Have you noticed him when we talked about the time we were there?
- Think he's scared?
- Scared green.
Green now and yellow later on, eh?
- Does he expect us to go ashore?
- Why, sure.
He's got to have a bodyguard, hasn't he?
Say... do you know there was a dozen sailors killed on the last voyage he made here?
- Killed? By them animals?
- Yeah.
But, you see, Denham and the skipper came out all right.
But you don't have to worry.
There's plenty of rifles aboard.
If I was captain, I certainly wouldn't take my crew into danger.
- Hey!
- What?
Wha...?
Hey, Bill.
Where?
Hey, Connelly.
If you want me to, I'll give Helstrom a tip that he's too thick with the crew.
Go ahead. Bad for discipline.
We must be in Russia. Here comes the Committee of the Workers.
- Captain Englehorn.
- Well?
- Captain, I went down in forward hold.
- Well, what of it?
- Captain, I found something.
- What's the matter? Found what?
Holy mackerel.
- I just didn't have anywhere to go.
- All right, go back to your work.
This young lady a friend of yours,
Mr. Denham?
No. Well... yes. I met her, that is,
I talked with her in Dakang.
Look here, this isn't my fault.
I told her she couldn't come.
Well...
We can't take her back. Mr. Helstrom.
You ought to be beaten to a pulp.
You called me?
Yes, we have a passenger, and she...
You. How did you get here?
This is our partner.
I know him.
You do?
Yes, of course, you couldn't help seeing each other in Dakang, could you?
Well, here we are.
Just one big, happy family.
You take the words right out of my mouth.
You keep your mouth shut.
You promise me to keep quiet.
I won't promise.
You crazy brat. Denham's sore at you anyway for being here.
You try to make trouble between us, and he'll be off you for life.
Skipper's looking for you.
Say, I don't know what's the matter with you and Helstrom... but we're all cooped up together on this ship.
I didn't ask you to come.
You're here on your own hook.
No matter who you like or dislike... you've got to behave and be pleasant.
Understand?
Are you mad at me?
Not very.
It's, uh... This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
Mr. Denham.
- Mr. Denham.
- Yeah?
Skipper says get dressed and come on deck.
Okay. What is it?
Have we sighted the island?
Yes, sir, about two miles off.
- Say, it's a thrill coming back here.
- Yes, sir.
You had a pretty bad time when you were here before, didn't you?
Yeah, it's a pretty tough spot.
The natives will be glad to see us.
We did them a good turn once, and I...
What the...?
I'm warning you all.
You're crazy to do a thing like this.
We're not crazy enough to go to that island.
- What is it, Skipper? Is this on the level?
- It's real enough.
- Where's Helstrom? They get him too?
- All right.
Over that side to the lifeboat.
All of you.
So this is why you've been spending so much time in the foxhole.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We know what we're doing.
Come on, get over the side.
You can row yourselves to your blasted island and stay there.
Yes, and if those animals kill anybody, it won't be us.
Yes. Get going.
Because you pay us your dirty money, you think you own us.
You sweat and drive us, but you don't give us a living wage for our blood and sweat.
- When did you do all this sweating?
- You think you own us, body and soul.
- Oh, listen to reason.
- We've listened enough.
We've got the ship and we're going to keep it.
- Over the side.
- You're not going to shove this kid off too.
She followed you aboard the ship, she can follow you off.
Do you think I want to stay? I know.
Here's your chance to get rid of me.
- He killed my father.
- What?
He was a drunken old tramp.
I didn't kill him.
I know you did.
He said you'd be angry if I tried to make trouble.
Well, what a fine partner you've turned out to be.
Aw, pipe down. Get going.
Of course, you know what this will mean when you get caught.
Listen, I'll call the whole thing off now.
We'll turn back.
Sure, and be arrested for mutiny as soon as we reach port.
I'll give you my word I won't report you.
It's too late for that kind of talk.
We'll stick by what we've done.
Over the side and see how you like it.
I'll be seeing you again, I hope.
What do you think the chances are?
- Charlie, they throw you off too?
- No throw off. Get off.
Me no like them men.
- Cast off.
- Wait.
Aren't you going to give us any guns?
We've given you food and water.
You're lucky to get that.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Good boy, Charlie.
You cook now, you die pretty soon.
Row, you blasted bourgeois.
You got a nice day for it.
Now, then, go to your places.
Stokers below.
Bosun.
- Get that ladder up.
- What was that?
I said, get the ladder up.
Oh! And I promote you.
- You'll be mate now.
- That's fine. Who's gonna be captain?
I'm taking command, of course.
Clear the decks. Get back to work.
Do you think that we got rid of a good captain... so we could have a bad one?
We're through with captains on this ship.
He wants to be boss.
Let him go with the rest of the bosses.
Yo-ho!
Ha!
That's where all captains belong, over the side.
Bon voygee, Captain Helstrom.
Something tells me we've got a passenger.
Well...
How nice to see you again, under the circumstances.
Skipper, have we got to save him?
Hey, Skipper, when the natives see us,
I bet they'll throw a party.
Well, maybe not a party.
It's the chief.
Hey, did you throw that, you rat?
He says yes, he did, because his village is destroyed... and his people are killed, and it's all our fault for leading Kong inside the wall.
Well, tell him not to attack us.
Tell him we overcame Kong... and we're still big mates.
Come on, Charlie, shove off.
We've got to find another place to land.
What's the good of this?
There's no way out.
Well, it's the only place we've seen where we could get a foot ashore.
Maybe we can climb up someplace.
You stick with me, kid.
A fly couldn't climb out of here.
Yeah, here's a way out.
Wait till I take a look.
- Uh, captain, I...
- Huh?
- About that mutiny, I...
- The less said, the better, Helstrom.
We're all in a tight place together, and I don't think you'll let us down.
No, no, of course not.
Of course not.
- I didn't know that you came.
- You said stick to you.
Do you obey orders?
Why doesn't Denham come back?
We'd better go look for him.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Ha!
Look!
Well, if it isn't the little Kong.
He's stuck in the quicksand.
He can't get out.
I never knew that old Kong had a son.
Don't you think we ought to help him?
Well, how?
If we could get logs and things to him, maybe he could get out.
- Aren't you afraid of him?
- Yes, sort of.
Well...
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for him.
So am I. But I've got a reason.
Animals always know when you're trying to help them.
I don't believe he'd hurt us if he got out.
I suppose we're both crazy, but let's try.
Look out, Skipper, that's quicksand.
Skipper, there's a...
Skipper, believe it or not, there's a little Kong.
What? A little...
- How little?
- Well, just a little one.
- About 12 feet high.
- Good...
Well, what happened? What did you do?
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.
I felt...
Well...
I felt I owed his family something.
You really feel conscience-stricken about King Kong, don't you?
Whatever you do, don't mention Little Kong to Helstrom.
- He'd have a nervous breakdown.
- I'd like to break his neck.
We ought to go hunting and save our rations for emergencies.
This is cut right into the side of Skull Mountain.
My guess, that temple.
- Maybe big devil live in there.
- A temple?
Helstrom, suppose the treasure should be hidden here.
That certainly would be wonderful.
- You'd better come along with me, Helstrom.
- We'll meet here at sundown.
My go with Skipper.
Unh!
I'd forgotten you.
You'd better wait right here.
We'll all be back soon.
Do you think I'm going to stay here alone?
Well, all right, then, come on with me.
But be quiet.
And don't talk.
I thought tropical jungles were full of fruit.
That's what everybody thinks who's never been...
Look.
Well, we won't starve, anyway.
Good boy, Little Kong.
Say, can he scrap, just like his old man.
- Look, he's hurt.
- Huh?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was helping us?
Of course not.
You want me to believe he was grateful?
Well, he did save us, didn't he?
And how do we know what animals think?
Let's go and help him.
Are you game?
Yes, if you are.
Wait.
If you talk, very calmly... sometimes that keeps animals quiet.
- You frightened him.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
Was I too rough with him?
Poor old boy.
Baby Kong.
Yeah, some baby.
You're not a patch on your old man.
I must be completely cuckoo to be doing this.
Giving you a ﬁrst-aid treatment instead of running like blazes.
Guess it must be remorse or something.
You see...
I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with a gas bomb and then... carried him off to New York in chains.
I've been sorry for it ever since.
Yeah, you see, the poor old geezer got shot at the finish.
I guess if I'd left him alone... we'd all have been better off.
This is sort of an apology.
There you are, boy.
Two good deeds in one day for something that size... we ought to be caught up on our good deeds for a year.
I wish I had one of those coconuts.
I'll see what I can do about it.
Hey, look what you're doing, you big dummy.
I wish you'd be a little more careful of what you wish for.
Hey.
You better lie down and do your sleeping.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go to sleep.
I was helping you keep watch.
I have to keep watch of you.
That's the third time I've caught you.
Aren't you going to signal the others again?
Well, there's no use wasting any more ammunition.
They'd have answered those shots
I ﬁred if they'd heard them.
You better lie down.
Here.
Take my coat for a pillow.
- You'll need it.
- No, I won't. I'll keep the fire going.
There you are.
You're a grand little scout.
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess, kid.
You didn't.
I came.
Well, then I'm glad they wouldn't let you stay on the ship.
But I'm just another trouble.
You told me not to come on the boat.
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.
It's gone.
What fashion animal you call that, huh? I no like.
Here's your gun.
Well, that leaves only one shotgun among us.
It's light enough now.
We better go and look for Denham and the girl.
Mm. Heh.
- Well.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- No sign of the Skipper?
- No.
I'll fire one more shot.
Our guardian angel.
Hey, look.
I'm going to try and get into this place.
If you have no objections.
You're sure you don't mind?
Well, that's fine.
Listen, you attend to your business and I'll attend to mine.
Look! The treasure!
The treasure of the island!
I was expecting you.
Come on, baby.
We've found it!
Please, Little Kong, help us.
Hand it down.
Attaboy, Kong.
Stick to me, kid, and you'll wear diamonds.
Look at them.
Just look at them. We're rich.
We're all rich.
Well, what are you going to do with them?
Huh?
Yeah, I guess maybe a sailboat would be more useful.
Hey, put that down.
Hey, look out!
You'll shoot yourself, you half-wit.
Hey!
Hey, look out! You want to kill somebody?
Sure, you've fixed everything now.
You big rummy.
Do you think he's dead?
Denham.
That's the Skipper.
- What's happened? Where's your gun?
- It's broken, Skipper, but listen...
What? Both guns gone? We can't stay here. Let's go back to the boat.
Helstrom, the treasure, I...
You fool, there never was any treasure.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Then that was just a yarn you were giving me.
Of course. I had to tell you that to get away from Dakang.
Then there isn't any treasure at all?
Helstrom. Helstrom.
- He's going to the boat.
- Why, that crazy fool may take it.
Let's go after him.
I'm going back for the rest of the treasure.
Make sure of the boat.
I'll catch up with you. Hurry!
Earthquake!
My poor kid.
It doesn't seem to matter very much.
Stick to me and you'll wear diamonds.
Look.
Look.
Ship.
Ship.
Hello, kid.
What are you thinking about?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was saving my life?
Well, I'm sure he did.
Pretty soon, when we get back... you'll be saying goodbye to me, won't you?
Yeah.
What?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Well, you'll have plenty of money, kid.
We'll split the treasure four ways.
Couldn't you just split it... three ways?
How do you mean?
Well... one-third to the Skipper, one-third to Charlie... and one-third... to us.
Well, you said stick to you.
This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
She isn't coming yet, Toto.
Did she hurt you?
She tried to, didn't she?
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto...
Dorothy, please. We're counting.
- But she hit him...
- Don't bother us now, honey.
The incubator's gone bad and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.
Oh, that poor little thing.
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...
...because she says he chases her nasty old cat every day!
- Seventy. Dorothy, please!
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.
He can't catch her old cat anyway.
- And now she says she's gonna...
- Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy.
Oh, all right.
How's she coming?
Take it easy.
Ow!
You got my finger!
Get your finger out of the way.
There you are.
Right on my finger!
Lucky it wasn't your head.
Zeke, what am I gonna do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto...
Listen, honey,
I got them hogs to get in.
Dorothy, you ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.
- I have so got brains.
- Well, why don't you use them?
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.
Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble, see?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Say, get in there before I make a dime bank out of you.
Listen, kid...
...are you gonna let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.
I'm not afraid of her.
Next time she squawks, walk up to her and spit in her eye.
- That's what I'd do.
- Oh! Oh!
Oh! Zeke!
Help! Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!
Help!
Oh! Oh!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
- Yes, I'm all right.
I fell in, and Zeke...
Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am.
You gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Look at you...
What's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?
I know three farm hands that'll be out of a job.
Dorothy was...
I saw you tinkering with that contraption.
- You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
All right.
But someday they'll erect a statue to me...
Well, don't start posing for it now.
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.
You see, Dorothy toppled into the...
It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty!
Feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!
- Yes.
- Auntie Em...
...you know what Miss Gulch said she was going to do to Toto?
- She said she'd...
Stop imagining things.
You always get in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...
...and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Someplace where there isn't any trouble.
Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?
There must be.
It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train.
It's far, far away.
Behind the moon...
...beyond the rain...
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll...
...find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then...
...oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why...
...can't I?
Mr. Gale.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
I want to see you and your wife about Dorothy.
- What has Dorothy done?
- What's she done?
I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
- You mean, she bit you?
- No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No.
That dog's a menace. I'm taking him to make sure he's destroyed.
Destroyed! Toto?
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?
Of course we won't.
Uh, will we, Em?
Please, Aunt Em!
Toto didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
I'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.
Hand over that dog or I'll bring a suit that'll take your farm!
The law protects folks against dogs that bite!
How about if she keeps him tied up?
He's gentle.
- With gentle people, that is.
- That's for the sheriff to decide.
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you wanna go against the law.
Hm. Yes.
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto has to go.
- Now you're seeing reason.
- No.
Here's what I'm taking him in, so he can't attack me again.
No, No! I won't let you take him!
- You go away or I'll bite you myself!
Dorothy!
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.
I've got an order!
- Let me have him!
- Please stop!
Put him in the basket, Henry.
- The idea!
- Don't, Uncle Henry.
Oh, Toto!
Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county...
...doesn't mean you can run the rest of us!
For 23 years I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you!
And now...
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!
Toto, darling!
Oh, I got you back!
You came back!
I'm so glad!
They'll be coming back for you in a minute.
We've got to get away!
We've got to run away!
Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?
And who might you be?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.
Let's see. You're...
You're traveling in disguise.
No, that's not right. You're...
You're going on a visit.
No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we...
You're... You're running away.
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows.
Now, why are you running away?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.
They... They don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you.
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.
Oh, he's perfectly welcome.
As one dog to another, huh?
Now, let's see, where were we?
Why can't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of Europe?
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing. Yes.
Well, uh, I never do anything without consulting my crystal first.
Let's go inside here. We'll...
Just come along. I'll show you.
That's right. Here.
Sit right down here. That's it.
This is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal...
...used by the priests of Isis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.
And so on, and so on. Now...
...you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment...
...in order to be better in tuned with the Infinite.
We can't do these things without reaching out into the Infinite.
Yes, that's all right.
Now you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.
Ah.
What's this I see?
A house with a picket fence...
...and a barn with a weathervane...
...of a running horse.
- That's our farm!
- Yes.
Yes. There's a woman.
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.
That's Aunt Em.
Yes. Her name is Emily.
That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I can't quite see.
Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her.
Someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
Well, it's... It's someone she loves very much.
Someone she's been very kind to.
Someone she's taken care of in sickness.
I had the measles once, and she stayed right by me every minute.
Uh-huh.
What's she doing now?
Yes, she's... What's this?
Why, she's putting her hand on her heart!
- She's dropping down on the bed.
- Oh, no, no!
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.
You don't suppose she could really be sick, do you?
- Oh, I've gotta go home right away.
- I thought you were going with me.
No, I have to get to her right away!
Come on, Toto! Come on!
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.
A whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry.
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.
Get them horses loose!
Where's Hickory? Hickory?
Doggone it!
It's a twister! It's a twister!
Dorothy!
Everybody in the storm cellar!
Henry, I can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!
We can't look for her now.
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em?
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
Auntie Em!
We must be up inside the cyclone!
Oh! Miss Gulch!
Oh!
Toto...
...I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
We must be over the rainbow!
Now I know we're not in Kansas.
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
Who, me?
Why, I'm not a witch at all.
- I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.
- Oh.
Well, is that the witch?
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.
I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch...
...just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.
And there's the house, and here you are...
...and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East.
What the Munchkins want to know is, are you a good witch or a bad witch?
But I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.
Witches are old and ugly.
What was that?
The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch.
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.
You are?
Oh, I beg your pardon!
But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.
Only bad witches are ugly.
The Munchkins are happy because you freed them...
...from the Wicked Witch of the East.
- But if you please, what are Munchkins?
The little people who live here.
It's Munchkinland...
...and you are their national heroine, my dear.
It's all right.
You may all come out and thank her.
Come out, come out
Wherever you are
And meet the young lady
Who fell from a star
She fell from the sky
She fell very far
And Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star
Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star
She brings you good news
Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas
A miracle occurred
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this
The wind began to switch
The house to pitch
And suddenly the hinges
Started to unhitch
Just then the Witch
To satisfy an itch
Went flying on her broomstick
Thumbing for a hitch
And oh, what happened then was rich
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch
Of what was once the Wicked Witch
We thank you very sweetly
For doing it so neatly
You've killed her so completely
That we thank you very sweetly
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Let them know
The Wicked Witch is dead
As mayor of the Munchkin City
In the county of the Land of Oz
I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally
- To see
- To see?
- If she
- If she?
Is morally, ethically
- Spiritually, physically
- Positively, absolutely
Undeniably and reliably dead
As coroner I must aver
I thoroughly examined her
And she's not only merely dead
She's really most sincerely dead
Then this is a Day of Independence...
...for all the Munchkins and their descendants.
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead
We represent the Lullaby League

From now on you'll be history
- You'll be his...
- You'll be history
And we will glorify your name
- You will be a bust

Tra-la-la-la-la
La...
I thought you said she was dead.
That was her sister, the Wicked Witch of the East.
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?
Was it you?
No. No, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents too!
- Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?
- The slippers. Yes!
The slippers!
They're gone!
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?
Give them back to me or I'll...
It's too late! There they are, and there they'll stay!
Give me back my slippers!
Only I know how to use them.
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me. Give them back!
Keep tight inside of them.
Their magic must be powerful...
...or she wouldn't want them so badly.
Stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Oh, rubbish!
You have no power here.
Begone, before somebody drops a house on you too.
Very well. I'll bide my time.
And as for you, it's true I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like.
But just try to stay out of my way!
Just try!
I'll get you, my pretty...
...and your little dog too!
It's all right. You can get up.
She's gone!
It's all right. You can all get up.
Oh! What a smell of sulfur!
I'm afraid you've made an enemy of the Wicked Witch.
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether.
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in the Emerald City, a long journey from here.
Did you bring your broomstick with you?
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.
- Well, then, you'll have to walk.
The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.
And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment...
...or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
But how do I start for Emerald City?
It's always best to start at the beginning.
And all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
- But what happens if I...
- Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Goodbye!
My!
People come and go so quickly here!
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Follow the Yellow...?
Now which way do we go?
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.
Who said that?
Don't be silly, Toto.
- Scarecrows don't talk.
- It's pleasant down that way too.
That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?
Of course, people do go both ways.
Why, you did say something, didn't you?
Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.
I haven't got a brain.
Only straw.
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?
I don't know.
But some people without brains do a lot of talking, don't they?
Yes, I guess you're right.
Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?
Why, no.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.
- Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.
It's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back.
Oh, dear. That must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?
Down? No, you see, I'm...
Well, I'm...
Oh, well, here. Let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Very kind.
Oh, dear. I don't see...
Of course, I'm not bright about doing things...
...but if you'll just bend the nail down, maybe I'll slip off and...
Oh, yes!
Whoops!
- There goes some of me again!
- Does it hurt you?
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
My! It's good to be free!
Did I scare you?
No, no. I just thought you hurt yourself.
- But I didn't scare you?
- No, of course not.
I didn't think so.
Boo! Scat! Boo!
You see? I can't even scare a crow.
They come from miles around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face.
Oh, I'm a failure, because
I haven't got a brain!
Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could...
I could while away the hours
Conferring with the flowers
Consulting with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain
I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le
In trouble or in pain
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain
Oh, I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things
I never thunk before
And then I'd sit
And think some more
I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and be merry
Life would be a ding-a-derry
If I only had a brain
Whoa!
Wonderful!
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas could do that...
...the crows would be scared to pieces!
- They would?
- Where's Kansas?
- That's where I live.
I wanna get back there so badly,
I'm going to Emerald City...
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
- You're going to see a wizard?
- Mm-hmm.
Do you think if I went, this wizard would give me brains?
I couldn't say.
But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
- Yes, that's true.
- But maybe you better not.
I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch!
I'm not afraid of anything!
- Except a lighted match.
- I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box of them for the chance of getting some brains.
Look, I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing.
And I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.
Won't you take me with you?
Why, of course I will!
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!
You're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
- To Oz?
- To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Oh.
Apples!
Oh, look!
Oh!
Ouch!
What do you think you're doing?
We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and...
Did you say something?
- She was hungry!
She was hungry!
How would like to have someone come along and pick something off of you?
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.
Come along, Dorothy.
You don't want any of those apples.
Hmm.
Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be?
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green worms.
Oh, you!
I'll show you how to get apples.
Oh! Oh!
Hooray! I guess that did it. Help yourself.
Why, it's a man!
A man made out of tin!
Yes!
Look!
Did you say something?
He said "oilcan. "
- Oil can what?
- Oilcan?
Oh, here it is.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
He said his mouth.
The other side.
Mm... Mm... Mm...
My goodness! I can talk again! Oh!
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.
Here.
- Did that hurt?
- No, it feels wonderful.
I've held that axe up for ages.
Goodness!
How did you ever get like this?
Well, about a year ago...
...I was chopping that tree...
...when suddenly it began to rain.
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.
And I've been that way ever since.
Well, you're perfect now.
My neck. My neck.
Perfect?
Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.
Go ahead, bang on it!
Beautiful! What an echo!
It's empty.
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
- No heart?
- No heart?
No heart.
All hollow.
When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his mettle
And yet I'm torn apart
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human
If I only had a heart
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental
Regarding love and art
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows
If I only had a heart
Picture me
A balcony
Above, a voice sings low
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
I hear a beat
How sweet!
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion
And really feel the part
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper
If I only had a heart
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear!
That was wonderful!
You know, we were wondering why you couldn't come with us...
...to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there.
Oh, but he will!
He must!
We've come such a long way already.
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!
Helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen?
Well, stay away from her...
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!
And you!
I'll use you for a beehive!
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?
Fire! I'm burning! I'm burning!
I'm not afraid of her.
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard, whether I get a brain or not!
Stuff a mattress with me!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart or not.
Beehive! Bah!
Let her try and make a beehive out of me.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had.
And it's funny, but I feel as if
I've known you all the time.
- But I couldn't have, could I?
- I don't see how.
You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember.
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
We know each other now, don't we?
- That's right.
- We do.
- To Oz?
- To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
I don't like this forest.
It's dark and creepy.
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do...
Do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
We might.
Animals that eat straw?
Some, but mostly lions and tigers and bears.
- Lions!
- And tigers?
And bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Oh!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Which one of you first?
I'll fight you both together, if you want.
I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back!
I'll fight you standing on one foot!
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!
Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh?
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why...
- Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
- Oh, scared, huh?
Afraid, huh?
How long can you stay fresh in that can?
Come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard.
Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay!
That's getting personal, Lion.
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.
What's wrong with you teaching him?
Well, I hardly know him.
Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee.
Shame on you!
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him.
No, but you tried to.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but picking on poor little dogs...
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?
Is my nose bleeding?
Well, of course not.
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!
Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are...
You're nothing but a big coward!
You're right, I am a coward!
I haven't any courage at all.
I even scare myself!
Look at the circles under my eyes.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.
Oh, that's too bad.
Don't you think the Wizard could help him too?
I don't see why not.
Come along with us.
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.
- And him a brain.
- He could give you some courage.
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion?
I would.
No, of course not.
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.
- My life has been simply unbearable.
- Oh.
Well, it's all right now.
The Wizard'll fix everything.
It's been in me so long.
I just gotta tell you how I feel.
Well, come on!
Yeah, it's sad,
Believe me, missy
When you're born to be a sissy
Without the vim and verve
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse
If I only had the nerve
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion
A fate I don't deserve
- I'd be brave as a blizzard
- I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
If the Wizard is a wizard
Who will serve
Then I'm sure to get a brain
- A heart
- A home
The nerve!
Oh
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
So you won't take warning, eh?
All the worse for you, then.
I'll take care of you now instead of later!
When I gain those ruby slippers...
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!
And now, my beauties...
...something with poison in it, I think.
With poison in it.
But attractive to the eye and soothing to the smell!
Poppies.
Poppies!
Poppies will put them to sleep.
Sleep...
Now they'll sleep.
There's Emerald City!
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.
He really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that.
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes, let's run!
- Come on! Come on!
- Hurry! Hurry!
Oh, look!
Come on! Come on!
Look at the scenery. It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
Oh. What's happening?
What is it?
I can't run anymore.
- I'm so sleepy.
- Give us your hands and we'll pull you.
Oh, no, please.
I have to rest for just a minute.
Toto. Where's Toto?
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!
Coming to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
- Don't you start it too!
- No!
We ought to carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
- Let's.
- Yes.
- Now look at him. This is terrible!
- Here, Tin Man, help me.
Oh, this is terrible!
I can't budge her an inch.
This is a spell, this is!
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?
Help! Help!
It's no use screaming at a time like this.
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!
Help!
It's snowing!
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is!
Maybe that'll help!
Oh, but it couldn't help!
It does help!
Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh. Oh.
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Look! He's rusted again.
- Oh, give me the oilcan, quick!
Here.
- He is rusted.
Here.
Here.
Quick! Oh! Oh!
Curses! Curses!
Somebody always helps that girl.
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.
And woe to those who try to stop me!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Look! Emerald City is closer and prettier than ever!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
Keep straight ahead for
The most glorious place
On the face of the earth
Or the sky
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart
Hold on to your hope
March up to the gate
And bid it open
To the Emerald City, as fast as lightning!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
March up to the gate
And bid it...
...open
Open
Who rang that bell?
We did!
- Can't you read?
- Read what?
- The notice!
What notice?
- It's on the door!
As plain as the nose on my face!
Oh... Uh...
Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk.
"Bell out of order. Please knock. "
Well! That's more like it!
Now, state your business.
We wanna see the Wizard.
The Wizard?
But nobody can see the great Oz.
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!
Well, then, how do you know there is one?
Because he's...
Oh! You're wasting my time!
Oh, please. Please, sir.
I've got to see the Wizard.
- The Good Witch of the North sent me.
- Prove it!
She's wearing the ruby slippers that she gave her.
Oh! So she is!
Well, bust my buttons!
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
That's a horse of a different color!
Come on in!
Cabby! Cabby!
Just what you're looking for.
Take you any place in the city, we does.
- Would you take us to see the Wizard?
- The Wizard? The Wizard?
Yes, of course. But first I'll take you to a little place...
...where you can tidy up a bit.
- Oh, thank you so much!
We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess...
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.
He's the horse of a different color you've heard tell about.
Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!
And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Chirp, chirp, chirp!
And a couple of la-di-das
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the merry old land of Oz
We get up at twelve
And start to work at one
Take an hour for lunch
And then at two we're done
Jolly good fun!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's how we laugh the day away
With a
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
In the merry old land of Oz
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there
And a couple of brand-new straws
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the merry old land of Oz
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there
Whether you're tin or bronze
That's how we keep you in repair
In the merry old land of Oz
We can make a dimpled smile
Out of a frown
Can you even dye my eyes
To match my gown?
- Uh-huh
Jolly old town!
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there
We give the roughest claws
That certain air of savoir-faire
In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha
In the merry old land of Oz
Who's her? Who's her?
It's the witch!
She's followed us here!
"Surrender, Dorothy. "
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?
- The Wizard will explain it!
- To the Wizard!
Dear! Whatever shall we do?
We better hurry if we're gonna see the Wizard!
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.
Stop that now, just...
It's all right!
Everything is all right!
The great and powerful Oz has got matters well in hand.
I hope.
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!
Get out of here. Now go on!
Go on home.
Go home.
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.
Orders are, nobody can see the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!
But, please! It's very important.
I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
But she's Dorothy!
The witch's Dorothy?
Well, that makes a difference.
Just wait here.
I'll announce you at once.
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.
- I've as good as got my brain.
- I can fairly hear my heart beating.
I'll be home for supper.
In another hour,
I'll be king of the forest.
Long live the king!
If I were king of the forest
Not queen
Not duke
Not prince
My regal robes of the forest
Would be satin
Not cotton
Not chintz
I'd command each thing
Be it fish or fowl
With a woof!
And a woof!
And a royal growl
As I'd click my heel
All the trees would kneel
And the mountains bow
And the bulls kowtow
And the sparrow would take wing
If I
If I were king
Each rabbit would show respect to me
The chipmunks genuflect to me
Though my tail would lash
I would show compash
For every underling
If I
If I were king
Just king
Monarch of all I survey
Monarch
Of all I survey
If you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Not nobody, not nohow!
- Not even a rhinoceros?
- Imposserous!
- How about a hippopotamus?
- I'd trash him from top to "bottom-us. "
- Supposing you met an elephant?
- I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant"!
- What if it were a brontosaurus?
- I'd show him who's king of the forest!
How?
- How?
Courage!
What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage!
What makes the flag on the mast to wave? Courage!
What makes the elephant charge his tusk...
...in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?
What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage!
What makes the sphinx the Seventh Wonder? Courage!
What makes the dawn come up like thunder? Courage!
What makes the Hottentot so hot?
What puts the "ape" in apricot?
What have they got that I ain't got?
Courage!
- You can say that again.
Huh?
The Wizard says go away!
Go away?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
And I was so happy.
I thought I was on my way home.
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.
We certainly are.
Auntie Em was so good to me...
...and I never appreciated it.
Running away and hurting her feelings.
Professor Marvel said she was sick.
She may be dying...
...and it's all my fault.
I'll never forgive myself.
Never, never, never.
Please don't cry anymore.
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.
Come on.
I had an Aunt Em myself once.
Wait a minute, fellas.
I was just thinking, I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.
I better wait for you outside.
- What's the matter?
- He's just scared again.
Don't you know the Wizard will give you courage?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
- What happened?
- Somebody pulled my tail.
You did it yourself.
- Oh.
- Here.
Come on.
Come forward!
Tell me when it's over!
Look at that. Look at that!
I wanna go home!
I am Oz...
...the great and powerful!
Who are you?
If you please...
...I am Dorothy...
...the small and meek.
We've come to ask you...
- Silence!
- Oh!
Oh! Jiminy crickets!
The great and powerful Oz...
...knows why you have come.
Step forward...
...Tin Man!
You dare to come to me for a heart, do you?
You clinking, clanking, clattering...
...collection of caliginous junk!
Yes, sir.
Yes, Your Honor.
You see...
...a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road and...
Quiet!
And you, Scarecrow...
...have the effrontery to ask for a brain...
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!
Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, Your Excellency.
I mean, Your Wizardry!
Enough!
And you, Lion!
Well?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...
...frightening him like that when he came to you for help!
Silence, whippersnapper!
The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.
What's that? What'd he say?
Huh? What'd he say?
But first, you must prove yourselves worthy...
...by performing a very small task.
Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West.
But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it.
Bring me her broomstick...
...and I'll grant your requests.
Now go!
But what if she kills us first?
I said go!
"I'd turn back if I were you. "
I believe there's spooks around here.
That's ridiculous!
Spooks. That's silly.
Don't you believe in spooks?
No. Why, only... Oh!
Are you all right?
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do.
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!
You'll believe in more than that before I'm finished with you.
Take your army and bring me that girl and her dog.
Do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed.
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.
I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.
Take special care of those slippers.
I want those most of all.
Now, fly! Fly!
Bring me that girl and her slippers!
Fly! Fly! Fly!
Help! Help!
Go away now!
Toto! Toto! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
What happened to you?
They tore my legs off and threw them over there!
Then they took my chest and threw it over there!
That's you all over.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you.
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!
Now, let's see...
What a nice little dog.
And you, my dear.
What an unexpected pleasure.
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty.
- All in good time.
- Please give me back my dog.
Certainly, certainly...
...when you give me those slippers.
- But the Good Witch told me not to.
- Very well.
Throw that basket in the river and drown him.
No! Here. You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto!
That's a good little girl.
I knew you'd see reason!
I'm sorry! I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...
...those slippers will never come off...
...as long as you're alive.
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.
These things must be done delicately...
...or you hurt the spell.
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!
Run, Toto, run!
Run, Toto, run!
He got away! He got away!
Which is more than you will!
Drat, you and your dog!
You've been more trouble to me than you're worth.
But it'll soon be over now!
Do you see that?
That's how much longer you've got to be alive.
And it isn't long, my pretty.
It isn't long!
I can't wait forever to get those shoes!
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened.
Dorothy! Dorothy!
Where are you?
It's me. It's Auntie Em.
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!
I'm frightened!
Come back! Come back!
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!
Look! There's Toto.
Where'd he come from?
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy.
Come on, fellas!
I hope my strength holds out.
I hope your tail holds out.
What's that? What's that?
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch.
- Dorothy's in that awful place?
- I hate to think of her in there.
- We've got to get her out.
- Don't cry now.
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Who's them? Who's them?
- I've got a plan how to get in there.
- Fine. He's got a plan.
- And you're gonna lead us.
- Yeah.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- I gotta get her out of there?
- That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy.
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...
...guards or no guards,
I'll tear them apart.
I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.
- There's only one thing I want you to do.
- What's that?
Talk me out of it.
- No, you don't!
- Oh, no.
- Now, wait a minute.
Up!
Shh!
Shh! Shh!
Come on, I've got another idea.
Do you think it would be polite, dropping in like this?
- Where do we go now?
- Yeah.
There!
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?
It's us!
- Yes!
It's me! She's locked me in!
We gotta get her out! Open the door!
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!
The hourglass is almost empty!
Stand back!
Oh, Toto! Toto! Oh, Lion!
I knew you'd come!
I knew you would!
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.
Why, my little party's just beginning.
Trapped. Trapped like mice... rats.
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.
We'll let them think about it a little first.
Seize them! Seize them!
Stop them, you fools!
Seize them! Seize them!
There they go! Now we've got them!
Half of you go this way, half of you go that way.
Hurry! Hurry!
Where do we go now?
This way. Come on!
Back! Back!
Well!
Ring-around the rosie, a pocket full of spears!
Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?
The last to go will see the first three go before her.
And her mangy little dog too!
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!
It's burning! Help!
Don't throw that water!
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!
I'm melting! Melting!
Oh, what a world! What a world!
Who would've thought a good little girl like you...
...could destroy my beautiful wickedness?
Look out! Look out!
I'm going.
She's dead. You've killed her.
I didn't mean to kill her.
Really, I didn't.
It's just that he was on fire.
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
The broom.
- May we have it?
- Please. And take it with you.
Oh, thank you so much!
Now we can go tell the Wizard the Wicked Witch is dead!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
Can I believe my eyes?
Why have you come back?
Please, sir. We've done what you told us.
We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.
We melted her.
Ah, you liquidated her, eh?
- Very resourceful.
- Yes, sir.
So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast. Not so fast!
I'll have to give the matter a little thought.
Go away and come back tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I wanna go home now!
- You've had plenty of time already.
- Yeah.
Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz!
I said come back tomorrow!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises.
Do you presume to criticize the great Oz?
You ungrateful creatures!
Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow...
...instead of 20 years from now!
Oh!
The great Oz has spoken! Oh!
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.
The great and...
Oz has spoken.
Who are you?
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz.
You are? I don't believe you.
I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.
- You humbug!
- Yeah.
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.
You're a very bad man!
Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man.
I'm just a very bad wizard.
What about the heart you promised Tin Man?
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?
- And Scarecrow's brain?
- And Scarecrow's brain?
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.
Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth...
...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain.
Back where I come from, we have universities...
...seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers.
They think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma.
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me...
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...
...I hereby confer upon you...
...the honorary degree of Th. D.
- Th. D.?
That's Doctor of Thinkology.
The sum of the square roots of two sides of an isosceles triangle...
...is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Oh, joy! Rapture!
I've got a brain!
- How can I thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.
As for you, my fine friend, you're a victim of disorganized thinking.
You are under the delusion that because you run away from danger...
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.
Back where I come from, we have men who are called "heroes. "
Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs...
...and parade it down the main street.
And they have no more courage than you have.
But they have one thing that you haven't got. A medal.
Therefore...
...for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor...
...conspicuous bravery against wicked witches...
...I award you the Triple Cross.
You are now a member of the Legion of Courage.
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart.
You don't know how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.
But I still want one.
Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.
They are called phil...
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial.
Therefore, in consideration of your kindness...
...I take pleasure at this time in presenting you...
...with a small token of our esteem and affection.
And remember, my sentimental friend...
...that a heart is not judged by how much you love...
...but by how much you are loved by others.
Ah.
Oh! It ticks!
Listen! Look, it ticks!
Read what my medal says. "Courage. "
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!
Oh, they're all wonderful.
Hey, what about Dorothy?
Yes, how about Dorothy?
- Yeah. Dorothy next.
I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
You force me into a cataclysmic decision.
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her myself.
Oh, will you? Could you? Oh!
But are you clever enough to manage it?
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...
...born and bred in the western wilderness...
...premier balloonist par excellence to the
Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.
Until one day, while performing feats of stratospheric skill...
...never before attempted by civilized man...
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
The balloon failed to return to the fair.
- It did?
- Weren't you frightened?
You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death...
...sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified.
Suddenly the wind changed...
...and the balloon floated down into this noble city...
...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the first wizard deluxe!
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...
...retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway.
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...
...you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum.
My friends. I mean, my friends!
This is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown...
...be that as it may.
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...
...am about to embark upon a hazardous...
...and technically unexplainable journey...
...into the outer stratosphere!
To confer, converse...
...and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards.
And I hereby decree that until what time...
...if any, that I return...
...the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains...
...shall rule in my stead...
...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...
...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage.
Obey them as you would me.
Thank you.
Oh, Toto! Come back! Toto!
Don't go without me.
I'll be right back.
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!
- Ruined my exit!
Come back! Come back!
Don't go without me!
Please come back!
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
Goodbye!
Oh, now I'll never get home.
Stay with us then, Dorothy.
We all love you.
We don't want you to go.
That's very kind of you...
...but this could never be like Kansas.
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.
Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Look!
Here's someone who can help you!
- Will you help me? Can you help me?
- You don't need help any longer.
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
- I have?
- Then why didn't you tell her before?
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.
What have you learned, Dorothy?
Well...
I think that it...
...that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.
And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again...
...I won't look any further than my own back yard...
...because if it isn't there...
...I never really lost it to begin with.
Is that right?
That's all it is.
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.
- I should've felt it in my heart.
- She had to find it out for herself.
Now those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds.
- Toto too?
- Toto too.
- Now?
- Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!
Oh, it's...
It's gonna be so hard to say goodbye.
I love you all too.
Goodbye, Tin Man.
Oh, don't cry.
You'll rust so dreadfully.
Here. Here's your oilcan.
- Goodbye.
- Now I know I've got a heart...
...because it's breaking.
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...
...but I'm gonna miss the way you used to holler for help...
...before you found your courage.
I would never have found it if it hadn't been for you.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
- Are you ready now?
- Yes.
Say goodbye, Toto.
- Yes, I'm ready now.
- Then close your eyes...
...and tap your heels together three times...
...and think to yourself:
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home. "
There's no place like home.
Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no...
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!
- Yes, darling.
Hello there! Anybody home?
I dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big...
- Well, she seems all right now.
- She got quite a bump on the head.
We kind of thought she was gonna leave us.
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.
And I tried to get back for days!
There, there, lie quiet now.
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.
Remember me...
...your old pal, Hunk?
And me, Hickory?
You couldn't forget my face, could you?
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.
And you and you and you...
...and you were there.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
We dream lots of silly things when we...
No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place.
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice...
...but most of it was beautiful.
But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, "I want to go home!"
And they sent me home.
Doesn't anybody believe me?
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.
But anyway, Toto, we're home!
Home! And this is my room...
...and you're all here.
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again...
...because I love you all.
And oh, Auntie Em...
...there's no place like home!

My son.
Have they killed my son?
My husband is a slave.
God, have mercy.
Our Father, who art in Heaven...
Thirty-five, thirty-five.
But it's not enough.
Look at this gold
Christian hair.
Thirty-six.
Thirty-six.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses...
Here. For your 36.
...as we forgive those who...
Of all the Christian captives... not one so tall and slender.
Thirty-seven and no more.
Thirty-seven? Sold.
And may Allah give you joy.
His mercy is everlasting.
Come on, you!
No. No!
Of all the captives, this is the fairest!
The cross! The cross!
Let me kiss the cross!
That one is fair.
Your cry shall be heard through all the worid.
Now, how much will you bid... for this daughter of a Christian prince?
Forty dinars.
Forty dinars, you say?
Forty.
Not enough.
Who will bid more for the Christian captive?
Forty-five.
Forty-five.
Forty-five.
Forty-eight. Fifty.
Behold the Sultan,
Saladin the Conqueror.
Saladin!
Make way for Saladin!
Hail to Saladin, servant of the Prophet!
Make way for Saladin,
Sultan of Egypt!
Make way for Saladin!
Make way for Saladin!
Stay, infidel!
Hearken to me, unbeliever, foe of Christ.
Strike him down!
Let him speak.
You rule here in Jerusalem.
You have conquered.
The Holy Land is yours.
But never will you conquer this!
Strike him down!
Woe to the unbeliever.
I go to all the kings in Christendom.
A mighty host shall arise and arm!
Who sets foot in Asia with a sword... shall not return.
The swords of the Prophet will conquer.
Go, Hermit.
Carry your thunder across the sea.
Tell your Christian kings what you have seen.
Your women sold as slaves... your knights trampled under our horses... your gospels cast into the flames... the power of your cross broken forever!
Stop, blasphemer.
I go. But I will come again.
And with me shall come the great Crusade.
The armies of Christ shall arise and redeem his tomb.
The cries of these Christian women sold into slavery shall be answered.
The host of our Lord shall fall upon Islam... like a mighty wave of the sea.
Woe to you, unbeliever.
I go to preach the great Crusade.
And so I have come to summon you, Philip,
Lord King of France... to war for your faith... to lead the multitudes on Crusade... to free the city that was hallowed by the footsteps of our Lord.
Your answer, Philip,
Lord King of France?
I will go.
So be it.
Until now, you have fought for the man who is Philip.
For France.
But now, your sword, your life...
I give to God... that the gates of Jerusalem may be opened... and the tomb of our Lord set free by this Crusade.
Crusade. Amen.
So be it.
Philip, Lord King of France.
Amen.
Sire... if you go, what of Richard?
Richard of England?
Richard the Lion-Heart of England.
With you away...
Will take France.
Is that what you try to say,
Conrad of Montferrat?
Quite.
Richard is betrothed to my sister, Alice.
And with Alice
Queen of England...
The English Lion will be caged.
You're a wise and clever king.
I do my duty and safeguard France.
Richard would not dare break this pledge of marriage.
Alice and I leave at once for England.
I will accompany you.
I desire to see this English king.
# Oh, Richard ruled in England
The Devil reigned in hell #
# And both were mighty monarchs
Who governed passing well #
Both at the same time.
Watch out.
He's aiming for the mark.
# Till Richard went to Hades
The Devil a visit to pay #
# And with his fire and brimstone
Poor Satan ran away #
# And broke his pitchfork, too ##
Guard yourself, Blondel.
I'll try a singing target.
Here he comes.
Look out, Blondel.
Blondel, come out and fight like a man.
I can't fight you with this!
Smithy, how goes my sword?
Hair of the devil, it's not done!
Here, sire.
A fair, sweet blade!
Well, it should be.
You take long enough, old Hercules.
No one can hurry fire or steel.
Well, you can't shape steel with words. Here.
But, sire...
Every lick that goes into this now... will come out in a fight!
Nay, sire, you can't shape steel with love taps!
Give it to me.
Love taps?
Aye, lad... Sire.
It wants my arm to strike it right.
Your arm? Well, who do you think strikes the harder blow?
A king or a smith?
Why, a smith, of course.
All right.
We'll find out!
How?
You can have the first blow, and no love taps, remember.
Strike my king?
Lord bless me, no.
That'd be treason.
I command you to strike, and strike hard.
Mercy on my soul.
# The smith dislikes to strike his king #
# Yet washes for the blow #
Well, what holds you, man? Strike.
# Now will the birds begin to sing ##
Oh, my...
A love tap, my dear fellow, nothing but a love tap.
Now then, you keep your...
Nay, sire. Wrong man.
# The King prepares to smite the Smith #
# Oh, let the welkin ring #
# The stars he'll see are not a myth #
Now, you keep your feet.
# Here comes the royal swing ##
Me lute!
Devil take you, Richard, you've done for him!
What?
Oh, no.
He's got to finish my sword.
Get up, Hercules.
Come on, get up.
You better finish my sword.
Come on, man. Get up.
The sword, man. The sword.
The sword.
Something hit me.
Something hit him.
Aye, something hit you.
It was the King.
The King.
Aye! The King.
Laid his fist to me jaw, he did. A fair, sweet lad.
The Earl of Leicester comes.
Sire, the Earl of Leicester.
Sire.
What's the matter, Robert?
Have you seen a ghost?
I've seen the King of France.
Philip, here in England?
He is at the castle.
Will you come to greet him?
Does my saintly cousin come in peace or war?
He comes in peace.
And he brings his royal sister.
Oh, Alice.
She's no dove with an olive branch.
Your father gave his pledge to France... that you would wed the Princess Alice.
The surly-tempered witch.
Your father's pledge was England's pledge.
You cannot escape this marriage.
Now, what do I care for France?
Fighting. Always fighting.
Fearing no devil and praying to no God.
Well, why should I?
I know my horse, Fauvel.
I know the feel of a lance in my hand.
I know what it is to see men go down before me.
Now, look.
This sword's being made for me.
No other arm shall wield it but mine.
With this sword, Robert...
I'll swing a stroke from Norway down to Spain.
Why should I fear and pray for what I don't understand?
The King of France is waiting.
How much longer,
Prince John, will Richard keep France waiting?
Who knows what Richard will do?
He's not an ardent suitor, is he, Brother?
If he knew that the fairest lady in Christendom were waiting, I'm sure...
He does know.
I sent Leicester to tell him.
And I offer apology for him.
Richard is my brother and I am deeply ashamed.
Ashamed?
Of my future husband,
Prince John?
Ashamed of your king,
Prince John?
Yes. For many things, in many ways.
Why, it is an open scandal.
He has no faith in God.
He is a graceless...
Richard, by the grace of God,
King of England...
Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine,
Count of Anjou.
Cousin Philip.
Welcome to Windsor and to England.
The greetings of France.
Oh, the Lady Alice.
I am not accustomed to waiting, Richard.
Even for a betrothal kiss.
Well, let's postpone it.
Well, what other guests have we?
Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat and my friend.
Then he is mine.
England gives welcome to Montferrat.
I understand now, sire, why men call you the Lion-Heart.
Well, why are we all so glum?
Come on, wine, music.
Ho, lads, wine!
Blondel, song.
Richard, we've come to...
You have not heard my troubadour, have you?
Shall it be of love?
No, no, no. Hunting.
And why not of love?
Come, Richard.
We'll pledge to my sister,
Alice.
What's the cross,
Cousin Philip?
The sign of the Crusade.
The Crusade?
I go to Holy War in Palestine.
A miracle is happening,
Richard.
Men are arming everywhere for our Christian faith.
Emperor Barbarossa of Germany has taken the cross.
So has Leopold of Austria.
And Hugo of Burgundy goes.
Well, let them go.
I've no love for monks and shave-pates.
And I'm content in England.
And France.
You realize why we've come,
Richard, Alice and I?
How long do you propose to honor us here?
My time is short.
And so I give you happiness,
Richard... in your marriage to my sister.
I've no wine left,
Philip.
I can't drink that toast.
The pledge of marriage was given by your father.
Yes, but Alice and I were just children then.
The late king, your father, desired this alliance with France.
Philip, you know that the late king, my father, and I... seldom agreed on anything.
The Lion squirms in the net.
Richard of England... do you refuse to wed the Princess of France... to whom you are pledged?
Sire, there's a great crowd at the outer gate.
They seek the King.
Well, let them in!
You'll answer me!
Yes, yes, Philip.
Later, later.
Open the gates.
Open the gates, I say.
Richard!
You will get an excellent view from the balcony.
Open the gates!
The Hermit is here.
Let the Holy Man through.
Oh, ye men of England... the kings and the peoples of every other land... are going forth to war for the cross.
Will you close your ears to the cry of Christendom?
No!
Do you fear to die where Christ, our Lord, suffered... to give you life everlasting?
No!
Never!
Will you turn from him... now that he is being crucified again?
Behold, in the City of His Sorrow... darkness falls again upon the Mount of Calvary.
Will ye deny him now?
No!
Never!
Come to the army of the cross.
Lift up your swords, not for lust or gold... but for the Lord, our God.
Come, ye men of England.
Take the cross to your heart... that ye may find the real, true cross.
That man's inspired!
Now shall the son depart from the father... and the husband from the wife.
Many who go shall not return.
Therefore, all other earthly promises and vows are wiped away.
By the devil's teeth,
I see the way out!
Father!
The King! Make way for the King! Stand back!
King Richard.
God bless you, Richard.
Good father, do I hear it right?
The taking of the cross will cancel a pledge?
No other pledge shall bind one who has taken the Crusader's Oath.
Then give me the Oath.
Richard of England, will you join the Crusade, forsaking all else?
Yes,
I will renounce everything.
Even the lovely woman to whom I'm pledged.
Richard of England... do you swear you will not lift your hand... against any other who wears the cross?
That you will not turn aside from the Crusade... until the Holy City is again free?
I swear.
Give me the cross.
You can lie to yourself,
Richard... you can lie to me... but you cannot lie to God.
This cross will humble you,
Richard.
It will burn into your heart till your pride is in the dust.
The King takes the cross!
That settles Philip.
But not the Lady Alice.
What is she going to do?
Father, give me the cross.
Alice of France...
No!
This is work for men!
Work for all Christians, men and women.
Work for men and only for men.
I'll get you knights,
I'll get you men-at-arms... yeomen, esquires, grooms, cooks, blacksmiths...
I'll even get you a minstrel.
Here, Blondel!
Sire!
Alice of France... do you swear you will not lift your hand... against any other who wears the cross?
Let me through to the King.
I have the King's sword!
Hear it ring!
Oh, men of England, the battle cry has sounded.
England is at war!
Mother, I must go.
Alan, my boy, you may never come back.
Mother, I may touch the wood of the true cross.
Out with your steel, men, for the Crusade!
For the Crusade!
Good father, consecrate these swords to the service of England.
To the service of God.
Amen.
Let God's blessing be upon these swords.
May they rescue the tomb of Christ our Lord.
May they restore to his people... the cross on which he died.
Amen.
Check.
The fire burns low.
An eventful day, my princely friend, an eventful day.
You may have won a throne.
Check.
You're a treacherous man,
Montferrat.
In good company, John.
Check.
John, supposing your brother,
Richard, does not return... from this Crusade?
Well, hazardous business, these Crusades.
Many will be killed.
Even kings.
By the infidels?
Yes, of course.
By the infidels.
Check.
Then I would be
King of England.
And marry Alice of France.
Would England and France when the Crusade is won... make me King of Jerusalem?
Yes.
Sire.
You know, John...
I have the direst premonition tonight... that your lion-hearted brother will never return to England.
In fact, I can give you my word for it.
Raise the standard of France!
Forward!
Raise the standard of England!
Leicester!
The knights are mounted, sire!
Sound the trumpets.
The Crusade goes forward!
# Onward Ho!
To conquer the foe #
# On for the God and faith we know #
# Bearing the sword of the Lord
The Sword #
# Not into war for glory #
# We fight for God and the King #
# Die though we might
For God and the King #
# Even to the last Crusader #
# We stand for the Lord, our God #
# Death or life may Christ attend #
# Holy cross and tomb defend! #
My love goes with you.
# Bearing the sword of the Lord
The sword #
# Thy holy power leading #
# Our lives we pledge unto God #
# Danger or foe we charge unheeding #
# Even to the last Crusader #
# We stand for the Lord, our God #
Goodbye, darling.
You will come back?
Yes, darling.
# For God and the King #
# Even to the last Crusader ##
It's the English, Tina.
The English.
Lend a hand with that cart.
Right row to the ship.
Left row to the English tent.
Oh, isn't it glorious?
They're going to the Holy Land to free the tomb of our Lord.
Oh, I wish I could carry a sword and fight with them... or nurse the sick or...
Tina, we must do something to help them.
Crusader!
Crusader, where is your king?
Eh, lass?
Don't you know him?
No.
But I've heard the minstrels sing of his chivalry... his bravery and his gentleness.
Yes, his gentleness.
Yes, they sing of a saint in armor leading the blessed Crusade.
Then they're better singers than I am.
What do you want of him, lass?
I have flowers for him.
Flowers?
He'd rather have a side of beef.
We haven't eaten for a week.
Oh, but we have plenty.
We shall help you.
My father has thousands of cattle.
Where's your king?
Thousands of...
Yonder.
Bring that catapult into line with the street.
Hail to the King.
Come along, Tina. Hurry.
# Round the mountain now we go #
# A fair young face to see #
# And now the ocean billows blow #
# Broad as they can be ##
Hold those horses!
Block the wheels or it'll go through that house.
Stop it!
Fix the left block.
Look out!
Get the other block, then pull.
Now, get the chocks under those wheels... and bring the back wheels over to that side.
Tina, that's King Richard.
Get a company of crossbowmen... and bring them up here to give these men a hand!
Aye, sire.
Now, come on, look lively there!
Come on, pull over there.
Don't fret that horse, you idiot!
Look out!
The King's horse!
He's hurt the King's horse.
That's blood.
He'll catch it.
Blockhead, you'll hang if that horse is crippled.
Now then, men, all together!
Aye, sire.
That can't be Richard.
Oh, yes, that's Richard.
Move along, there.
What are you waiting for?
I hope he starves.
The King!
We've got to see the King!
King Richard.
Sire.
Silence!
Well, what is it?
Sire, we've had no food for days.
We must eat.
I'll get you food, but stop howling for it!
But, sire...
King Sancho.
I'll give you a bond on the City of London for your cattle.
And what should I do with your City of London?
Can you move London to my poor Kingdom of Navarre?
No, no, Richard.
You heard my price.
I cannot pay it.
But Navarre is a poor country.
And I am a poor king.
We drove our cattle down to Marseille... to sell to you Crusaders for gold... not promises.
By the devil's teeth,
I'll take what I need.
No, Richard.
Seize all his cattle!
Richard!
You wear the cross.
You may not plunder another Christian.
Or strike one.
Still, there is a way.
Well?
I have a daughter.
A fair, sweet girl.
Just like a flower.
A girl, but ready to be married.
You understand?
No.
Marry her.
Marry your daughter?
Yes.
Well, by the devil's beard.
I'll settle a dower on her.
Herds of cattle and sheep.
Shiploads of grain.
A hundred cartloads of fodder for your horses.
You can marry your wench to the devil!
Tighten your belt,
Robert.
Scour the countryside, glean what you can.
The country's bare as a wolf's tooth.
Sire, the men are truly desperate for food.
Yes, sire, give us food.
We sail tomorrow.
We can't ship horses without fodder.
How many head of cattle have you in Navarre?
Six thousand.
How many?
Seven thousand.
How much grain?
Barley and wheat enough to fill four cargo ships.
I'll marry your wench.
My Lord, think...
No, not now, Robert.
Would you crown this unknown girl
Queen of England?
I said I'd marry her.
I said nothing about the Crown of England.
Well, she'll arrange that.
Drive your cattle and your carts here into my camp.
I'll marry your girl when we come back from Crusade.
Promises.
Promises.
All right, all right, here.
This is surety that I'll marry your daughter whenever you say.
What's her name?
Berengaria.
And you'll marry her tonight.
Yes, yes, yes, tonight.
My son.
Make way for the King of Navarre.
Robert, have his cattle driven into our lines... and the grain stored in our ships.
This wedding, sire...
No, never mind that.
Just tell the men that they'll eat tonight.
Yes, sire.
But, Daughter, he's your saint in armor.
Your pure white knight.
The minstrels sing his praises, you've heard them.
You'll bless me for this marriage, my child.
Never.
If you'd given your cattle to help the Crusade... this never would have happened.
Well, I did!
I gave him the cattle, and he gives you a crown.
But he's such a noble king.
So gentle.
Didn't you strew flowers in his path?
Why, Daughter, what's the matter?
# When the sun goes down for another day #
# And the Dipper dips to the Milky Way #
# We up with our cups with a heigh and a ho #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
Hercules! Steady, my dear friend.
Hey, Blondel, no, no, no.
You'll sing for your dinner.
# Oh, the man in the moon has a light in his eye #
# And the Dog Star barks in the midnight sky #
# Our king he lifts his cup on high #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
All right, Blondel, you've earned your dinner.
Here we go.
Let's cut this up.
Well, what is it?
The lady is waiting.
What lady?
Berengaria of Navarre, whom you will marry, sire.
Marry?
Sire!
# Oh,
Richard is no ladies' man though something of a sinner #
# He eats and drinks and now he pays Navarre #
# for Blondel's dinner ##
Shut up, fool.
No light matter to wed the daughter of Navarre.
I hope she's lighter than her father.
Sire, let me lead you to the bridal bower.
I'll do more.
I'll send you in my place.
But, Richard, I can't. I...
Draw my sword.
Huh?
Draw my sword.
Now bear it with you to the chapel.
A sword to a wedding?
Have you never heard that one of royal blood... may send his sword to the altar in his stead?
Good Brother?
Marriage by token is your privilege, sire.
Oh, what will Navarre say to this bridegroom?
That's for you to worry about.
Come on, Blondel.
Don't keep the lady waiting.
I'll tell your wife, Blondel.
This is a bad beginning.
He's a ladies' man.
# Blondel, he would a-wooing go #
# Whether his mother would let him or no #
# Blondel, he would a-wooing go #
# Whether his mother would let him or no #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
Where is King Richard?
Here.
That's King Richard's minstrel.
And King Richard's sword.
Yes, my Lord of Navarre.
He sent his sword as a token.
A token? Of what?
Isn't Richard coming?
He is in despair that he cannot be here.
What?
A thousand duties assail him.
And so, in his place, he sent me.
You?
His minstrel.
No, no, milady.
He didn't send me in his place.
He didn't send me.
He sent his sword to be wed to you.
Just as if my king himself were here.
Your gallant king.
I am tricked.
Tricked by that rogue of a Richard.
That breaker of promises!
I'll have the blood out of you for this.
Good Brother, tell him.
Sire, the man says true.
If your daughter marries this sword, she marries King Richard.
Eh?
Such is the law.
The law? The law?
And the marriage will hold?
Until death.
There, you see, my child?
You were mistaken.
Didn't I tell you
Richard was a man of his word?
A pure knight, a noble king.
Let us begin the ceremony.
No!
No, I will not.
But, my child.
No, Father, let me go.
Please let me go!
But it's the man himself you will marry.
Richard of England.
And you agreed for your father's sake.
For the Crusade.
For the Crusade.
Begin.
We have come together before God and his angels... in the place of this holy church... that we may couple together these two bodies.
# When Jupiter winks at Venus below #
# And the nightmare gallops to and fro #
# We'll drink to our king with a heigh and ho #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
All right, Hercules, we'll go and see if my horse is lame.
Oh, no, no, keep your seats, keep your seats.
Eat your fill and drink deep.
And look to your horses before you turn in.
Tomorrow we sail for Palestine.
Long live Richard!
Long live Richard!
Long live the King!
Wilt thou, Richard, have this woman for thy wife?
To love her and worship her... and keep her in sickness and in health?
And all others forsake... and hold thee to her, to thy life's end?
I will.
Or he will.
Wilt thou, Berengaria, have this man to thy husband?
To love him, obey him, worship him... and serve and keep him in sickness and in health?
And all others forsake... and hold thee only to him to thy life's end?
I will.
I join you, man and wife, in holy wedlock.
The ring.
Amen.
Wilt thou give to the sword the kiss of peace?
And what token shall I take Richard?
There!
My child!
Milady!
There's your token.
Take that back to him.
Milady.
Tell him that's all he'll ever see of me.
I hate him and I'll never, never forgive him.
My child!
You are beside yourself.
Sire. Your sword.
Oh, then I'm married.
Yes, sire.
And what did the wench say to her husband?
Well, she said many things.
Oh, sire, if you could only have seen her.
Well, I don't want to see her.
Here, give me a cloth or something to bandage this wound.
Well, what's this you have?
A token from your bride.
Soft, isn't it?
Just what I need.
Hup, son. Hup, hup.
Well, she said it's all you'll ever see of her.
That's good.
I'd not be seeing her anyway.
We set sail in the morning.
Look, there's the English King.
Sire.
Doesn't an ·ngel looking down from heaven smile?
Not upon a devil looking up.
What, no Godspeed for a poor Crusader?
Not for Richard of England.
Oh, so you recognize me?
Yes.
And who are you?
It wouldn't matter to you,
Richard.
Ride on.
As you wish, milady.
Very nice, too.
On me oath, yes.
Wonder who she is.
Your wife.
What?
Berengaria, your wife.
You married her last night.
Why the devil didn't you tell me she looked like that?
You didn't ask me.
Oh, you half-wit.
Richard, you can't go back now.
The fleet is waiting and the King of France is ready to sail.
May a poor devil look up to heaven again?
Are you so far above me, my ·ngel, that you cannot hear?
Perhaps it's the smell of brimstone... that makes you tilt your pretty nose so high.
Now I see you have two eyes.
Or are they stars?
I confess my sin.
I ask your forgiveness.
I'm in the dust at your feet.
So is my veil.
Well, you see, my horse was wounded.
Yes, so am I.
Here, come back.
Wait a minute, you're my wife.
Richard. King Philip will sail with the tide.
Wait.
This is not England.
You don't command here.
Nor is it Navarre.
So you don't command here.
Well, I can always leave.
Oh, no.
Not till I know you're coming to Palestine.
Palestine?
You're very lovely,
Berengaria.
I'll never go.
Well, we'll see. Navarre!
Let go my wrist, you're hurting it.
Well, stop pulling then.
Navarre!
What's the matter?
Is this my wife?
Now, Richard, now.
That was all settled last night.
You can't change your mind now.
Is she my wife?
That's what I said.
You have the cattle.
We had a priest and witnesses.
Have her board ship then...
I'll never set foot on your ship.
No, not on mine.
I go on a war galley.
You'll go on the ship of the women.
Richard!
The tide is full.
We must sail.
Attend to her, Navarre.
Wait.
She has a will of her own.
A very strong will of her own.
It's not easy...
You have her on that boat.
Or when I come back,
I'll visit your halfpenny kingdom... with fire and sword, and burn your castle over your ears.
He would do it, Berengaria.
You must go on that ship as he says.
No!
But, Berengaria.
No, never.
Never will I set my foot on that ship!
But, Berengaria, it's such a beautiful ship.
Milady, the master of the ship.
Your pardon,
Princess Alice... but there's another lady come to the ship.
Well, who is she?
I'm sorry, milady... but I'm afraid that she must have this cabin.
What?
Gracious lady,
I assure you it's the truth.
Surely you have made a mistake.
This is the royal cabin.
Thank you. Tina.
I am Alice of France, betrothed to King Richard.
Who are you?
I'm his wife.
His what?
His wife.
I was married to him last night.
We can share the cabin.
Share, with you?
Why, I'll kill you, you lily-faced thief!
Let me go. She's stolen the throne of England...
Lower away!
Oh, infidels!
Hear ye the challenge of the kings of Christendom.
The Crusade has crossed the sea.
Our Christian armies surround your wall.
In the name of God... we call upon you to surrender the city of Acre.
What is your answer?
They've shot him!
Assassins!
Kings of the Crusade, this is their answer to our herald.
Insolence.
Arrogance.
We'll send them back
10,000 like it.
They struck the first blow.
We'll answer them with blood.
Milords.
Have you forgotten... that the cross upon which our Lord died... is within the walls of Acre?
We must try to open those gates without more bloodshed.
I have granted a truce.
A truce?
Saladin, Sultan of Islam... comes now before this Council of Kings.
Let him see the might...
Kings of the Council...
I've kept you waiting while I sought for one whose ship was delayed.
Milords, the Queen of England.
Do you hear, Philip?
I am presenting my wife.
I greet the Princess of Navarre.
Philip!
Milord of France.
Your Majesties.
Leicester.
And why do you grant truce to the infidel?
To hear if he'll make terms.
We'll make our own terms with the sword.
Milords, Saladin comes.
Saladin the Conqueror,
Sultan of Islam.
Christians, who is your leader?
I am.
Who speaks?
Richard of England.
The Lion King.
And I am Philip,
King of France.
And who are my other enemies?
I am Hugo of Burgundy.
And I am Frederick,
Duke of the Germans.
Michael,
Prince of the Russians.
Sverre, the Norse King.
I am Leopold of Austria.
William of Sicily.
I am Nicholas,
Count of Hungary.
And I am Conrad of Montferrat.
You see, infidel, we are many kings.
There is room in Asia to bury all of you.
Insolence!
Boasting and wine go well together.
Ho there!
Bring wine for the infidel.
We, of the true faith, drink no wine.
You refuse me?
Not you, my noble enemy.
I refuse the wine.
Well, we'll drink water then.
A goblet of water for the King of the infidels.
They told me he had horns like the devil.
I think he's magnificent.
Water may be poisoned as easily as wine.
It is our custom that someone first taste the cup offered a king.
Richard of England offers no poisoned cup.
Drink.
Well?
She did well!
Brave.
Well, what have you come to say?
Must my wife give you courage to speak as well as drink?
Your wife?
She does not wear the Crown of England yet.
Robert, give my wife escort to my tent.
Your Majesties.
Milord Sultan.
Now, what brings you here in truce before us?
I offer peace to you, foes of Islam.
He does well to make peace.
You will surrender Acre, and then Jerusalem...
I will surrender nothing.
Go, while yet you live.
Lead your armies and your ships over the sea, whence you came.
I say to you, go in peace while you can.
Boasting is cheap.
Life is cheap.
We do not fear you.
We are many kings.
And I am one king with many armies.
Go and live, stay and die.
Bold words.
We'll answer you with steel.
With this sword,
I'll cut my way into Jerusalem.
No. You'll find the blade too dull.
My sword dull?
Here, fetch me a mace.
An iron mace.
Guard.
Bring up a chair.
Set it in line with this.
My sword dull?
Good, Richard.
The Lion King has shown us the strength of his arm... not the sharpness of his sword.
What does he mean?
The blade cut iron.
Here. Cut through this... in midair.
That's impossible.
It offers no resistance.
Why, look!
Work of the devil.
Magic.
Lmpossible.
Witchcraft.
The devil is in him.
Black magic.
A sharp blade, my Lord Sultan.
But Christian armor is not made of silk.
Just as easily will I cut your Crusade to pieces... unless you accept my terms.
From you, Sultan of Islam,
I accept only war.
Milords.
My answer is war.
No terms. War.
War.
For God and the cross.
Very well, milords, war.
Within a month,
I shall enter Jerusalem.
By Allah... you shall never pass the gates of Jerusalem.
Arrogance.
Unbeliever.
Speak no more.
This is war.
The Saracen's steel is sharp.
Richard, by what right... do you call yourself leader of the Crusade?
I don't care who leads if it be through Acre toward Jerusalem.
Or who gives command if it be to battle.
But, Richard, you know very well...
Milords, please.
You must not quarrel.
England and France are the hope of the Crusade.
Yes.
Conrad is right.
You must stand together until we win Jerusalem.
The Oath of the Crusade binds us.
Richard gave no thought to that when he made this marriage... if marriage indeed it be.
Philip.
Steady.
Marriage it is,
Cousin Philip.
It is more than a marriage.
It's a studied insult to France.
Be careful!
Richard.
I regret the insult.
But not the marriage.
Third hour of the night... and all's well.
Good night, Tina.
Good night, Tina.
Oh!
Good night, Tina.
I said, good night, Tina.
You didn't find your way to my tent, did you?
I liked my own tent better.
How should you know?
My bedposts are Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John.
They are consecrated to my safety.
I, too, as your husband, am consecrated to your safety.
Then stand on guard, outside.
Is it Saladin that you fear?
He looked at you today,
I noticed.
Saladin would not force himself upon me.
And he's an infidel, remember.
Infidel.
Had you but half his courtesy.
Have I spoken harshly?
That's easily changed.
Might it please my sweet queen... to come to her husband's tent?
You see, you don't answer to courtesy.
Get up.
No.
Matthew, Mark, Luke... and John...
I wish you to understand that this lady is my wife.
Who wishes to be alone.
I just wanted to assure them.
What are you doing?
Why, I usually remove my spurs before retiring.
If I scream, every woman in this camp will come.
All right then, scream.
Listen to your minstrel meowing of love.
You don't know what love is.
Perhaps I do.
Even if I can't put it into pretty words.
Oh, it isn't what you say, it's...
It's what you are.
I'm no pale gallant to sit at a woman's feet.
No, I should say you're not.
You take by storm.
What's a woman to you?
A citadel? A herd of cattle?
Oh, Richard of England, it's not as easy as that.
Now, will you please leave my tent?
As you will.
Since you go with me.
Richard, what are you doing?
Let me go. Richard, let me go!
I told you to go to my tent and that's where you're going.
I am not going to your tent.
Put me down.
You are.
If I can find you.
Where the...
I'll get you out of here.
Look here, I'm your husband.
You're not.
This is my husband.
This is what I married.
For goodness sake, be reasonable.
You little devil!
My husband will protect me.
Drop that sword, you wildcat.
Not until you get out of my tent, you blustering barbarian.
Milord of England. Milord.
King Richard.
Sire.
Pardon.
Well?
We're attacked, sire.
Saladin attacks from the gate.
Run the mantelets forward.
Mass the knights.
Charge behind them.
Stanley, take mantelets one to 50.
Sire, your spurs.
Blount, take mantelets 50 to 100.
Aye, my lord.
If you'd been in my tent... they wouldn't have had to look all over the camp for me.
Well, I didn't ask you to come here.
Mass the longbows on the right flank, crossbows on the left.
Aye, sire.
Tell your men.
Carry the flares forward.
Aye, sire.
You didn't ask me to come here.
The next time you will.
Sire, they're throwing wildfire from the walls.
All right, cover the war engines.
Wet hides for the war engines.
Where are the French?
They mass for attack on the west tower.
We'll strike toward the gate.
Now then, where the devil is my sword?
Richard.
Robert, stay here. Keep her in bed if you can. I can't.
Sire, my place is with you.
Stay here.
If the infidels break through our lines, guard my wife.
He may be killed.
Yes, milady.
And I must stay here.
I love him, if you do not.
Milord.
Dear lady, a dreadful thing has happened.
To Richard?
Yes, dear child.
To my sorrow.
He's wounded.
No.
He's...
No.
He's not dead.
He's not harmed as yet.
But a messenger has arrived from England.
Bad news?
Tell me, my dear.
You love Richard greatly, don't you?
I am his wife.
He never comes to your tent, yet you love him.
No.
Your lips say no... but your eyes just now when you thought him dead...
Tell me, what's the matter?
What does the messenger say?
You sew a Crusader's banner.
Tell me.
But you stand between England and France.
And anyone who stands there,
Berengaria... is in the way of the Crusade.
Yes, in the path of God.
What right have you to say a thing like that?
How terrible that the lovely thing you are... could destroy Richard.
Destroy Richard?
And the Crusade.
But how could I?
I'd give my life...
There'd be no need for that if only
Richard would give you up.
Annul your marriage, send you away.
Does Richard want that?
No. No.
Richard will not let you go... and it is not in your power to give him up.
My dearest child, you must be very brave... for you alone can help him now.
But how?
How can I possibly help him?
What can I do?
You must step from the path of the Crusade.
You mean, kill myself?
What else is to be done?
Richard has been summoned to the Council.
He stands now at bay before the kings.
Take me there at once.
Richard, you are no longer
King of England.
And who has dethroned me,
Cousin Philip?
Your brother, John.
My brother?
Who brings you such report?
Tell this Lion of ours the news from England.
Tell him who holds the throne of England.
King John.
"King" John?
You lie, you treacherous dog.
Milord of England.
Who dares believe his words?
I have proof.
I am England's king!
Not if I support your brother John.
How bold we grow with treason.
I serve France, not England.
Richard, put that woman aside.
Marry my sister, and I support you against John.
John offers to make Alice
Queen of England.
Richard, you must make your choice.
She was sold for cattle.
I am land and power.
What does love matter?
I am France.
Richard is England, or John is England.
I marry England.
Choose, Richard.
Who gives Alice the Crown of England?
You or John?
Kneel, Berengaria.
What would you do?
Kneel.
Richard, please.
Give me up, put me aside.
You will kneel, Berengaria.
Think. You will destroy yourself, the Crusade... for me.
What she says is true, you will destroy yourself.
Please, Richard.
I, Richard, King of England... bestow upon thee,
Berengaria of Navarre... the right of sovereignty.
In the presence of these
Lords of Christendom...
I grant thee the royal privileges... that thou shalt rule by my side and share my crown... and only death shall deprive thee of this power.
Berengaria...
Queen of England.
Whoever challenges this act makes war with Richard.
I have only one answer.
Renounce this woman or France withdraws from the Crusade.
Milord of France, you must not.
Marshal of France.
France must not withdraw.
Call back your men.
No, milord.
We need you.
France and England are the two arms of the Crusade.
I will not fight beside him.
Don't let him withdraw from the Crusade.
Make peace with France.
This will end the Crusade.
Give her up and the Crusade will go on.
This woman means war with France.
Give her up, Richard.
Send her away.
There is no other way.
Put her aside.
This maid will be your undoing.
Listen, Richard...
I stand firm!
Father, stop them.
Make peace between them.
You'll regret this.
Cease your quarrels.
I'll follow Philip of France.
Aye.
Cease your quarrels.
Will ye fight over your petty kingdoms here?
There is but one kingdom, the Kingdom of God.
Richard of England, you lied when you took that cross you bear.
You've broken faith with man and God.
Do you hold to that woman against the Crusade?
Will you destroy the Crusade...
Silence!
I have my wife at my side... and English swords to follow me.
I'll open the gates of Jerusalem if I go alone.
Now what do you think of your husband?
You're magnificent.
There's no one like you,
Richard.
And you no longer hate me?
For standing alone against them all... against the worid, for me.
I want to kneel to my king.
Oh, Berengaria.
It's I who should kneel to my queen.
England will be so proud of you.
But England must be proud of you.
If you could only love me a little.
Oh, Richard.
Much more than a little.
Does anything else matter?
Yes.
What?
What matters most is you're wrong.
For making you
Queen of England?
I loved you for doing it, and still you're wrong.
If I could pluck the stars from Heaven... to make a brighter crown for you...
I'd do it.
It's lovely.
But it's nothing.
You are everything.
The crown is yours, not mine.
The fate of these men, the Crusade itself is in your hands.
Richard, if you break with Philip, you wrong God.
And make me guilty.
I have broken already.
But you'd make peace if I were out of the way.
England, France, what's it all matter?
All that counts now is that
I love you and you love me.
But it means your throne, your life.
Richard, send me away.
To a convent.
If you went to 40 convents...
I'd smash my way through 40 walls to find you.
I won't destroy you.
Destroy me?
Why, you've given me something to fight for.
I never knew there was such a power of fighting in love.
Would you let our love stand in the way of the whole worid?
In the way of Heaven, if need be.
Why do you look at me like that?
Berengaria, what are you thinking of?
Richard, hold me.
Closer.
I am yours.
I do love you, and will love you no matter where I am, forever.
You'll be here in my arms forever.
Nothing else counts, does it?
Nothing.
I'd give my life for you.
And I will give mine for you.
Kiss me, beloved.
One kiss to last through all eternity.
Oh, Richard.
Make me proud of this sword that I call my husband.
It brought us together.
Till now, it's kept us apart.
The priest said,
"Until death."
Richard... promise me one thing.
Anything.
Swear that you'll go on to Jerusalem, no matter what happens... that you'll let this sword stand between us until the Crusade is won.
I swear to you, Berengaria... that this sword will enter Jerusalem... and rest on the tomb.
And if that is not done... may it stand between us as man and wife... forever.
Make way for Saladin.
Saladin comes.
"He sendeth his bolts and smiteth whom he will."
Oh, my Sultan, why do
I see you in these garments of the Christians?
So that I may pass through their lines as a Christian knight.
Your life is sacred to Islam.
You must not risk it.
My life is in the hand of Allah.
I must ride to our army in Jerusalem and return with 100,000 horsemen.
Or Acre will fall.
Allah grant that you return unharmed.
As Allah wills.
Have the horses brought to the shepherd's gate in the east wall.
The foes of Islam shall be as dust... and the wind of the wrath of Islam... shall scatter their dust over the earth.
Fourth hour of the night... and all's well.
Fourth hour of the night... and all's well.
Fourth hour of the night... and all's well.
Stop!
You can't go out there.
See what you nearly got?
What are you doing here?
Holy Mother, the Queen!
Forgive me, milady.
You can't go out there.
There's nothing out there but death.
Many have died for the Crusade.
I seek the Hermit, the Holy Man.
He's not out yonder.
Then find him for me.
I want him.
I want him to comfort someone who is about to die.
Yes, milady.
Milady,
I can't leave my post.
But you can if I order you.
Well...
I shall keep your post for you.
You?
I will wear your mantle.
Then no one will know.
Milady, it's kind of rough for you.
I must have something to cover my head.
Will you give me your helmet, too?
Why, yes.
Now, do I look like a real sentry?
A very funny sentry.
Please go.
I'll find him.
I'll bring the Holy Man to you, milady.
Thank you.
The Sultan is leaving.
Let your eyes be the eyes of hawks.
There!
A Christian.
Father...
Iook.
Go back, Father.
Run! Run for your life!
Master.
Master, we must ride on.
We must go.
Allah has sent her to me.
I will not let her die.
# Oh, Richard ruled in England
The Devil reigned in hell #
# And both were mighty monarchs
Who governed passing well #
# Till Richard went to Hades
The Devil a visit to pay #
# And with his fire and brimstone #
# Poor Satan ran away! ##
Look out! The King! The King!
Have that one posted there.
Quick, pass it fast.
Here, here, come along, come along, Smithy.
Hurry up with those scaling ladders.
Sire, a ladder's no stronger than its weakest rung.
All right, you'd better see there are no weak rungs then.
Aye, sire.
Here, you on the siege tower!
Aye, sire.
Get those crossbows to the front of the platform... and the longbows to the back!
Aye, sire.
The King.
The King.
Let me through to the King.
Stand aside, men.
Sire. Sire.
Sire, the Holy Man...
Queen of England... captive.
Robert.
England's Queen is captive behind that wall.
The Holy Man!
The Holy Man is taken!
Where?
See his staff.
His broken staff. See!
Sound the call to arms.
Trumpeter, sound the call to arms.
Berkeley, start the siege tower forward.
All men to your posts!
Fifty horses for the tower!
Roll the mantelets forward to the foot of the wall.
Aye, sire.
Bring the mantelets to the wall.
Forward!
Bring up all horses to the tower!
Brace that siege tower.
Get up there! Get up!
Men, forward! Men, forward!
Heave forward!
Sire, they storm the walls of Acre.
The Hermit has been captured.
Raise the Oriflamme of France.
We join the attack.
In God's name and the King's!
To arms! To arms!
Quick, men!
The Christians attack!
Thousands are coming!
Christians attack.
The Christians are coming!
The Christians attack!
Let the war drum call to battle!
Summon every sword of Islam to the wall!
Light the fires upon the walls!
# Even to the last Crusader #
# We stand for the Lord, our God #
# Death or life may Christ attend #
# Holy cross and tomb defend ##
Keep those ladders going over the moat!
Show the Christians their Holy Man.
Look, Christians, here is your saint.
The Holy Man!
They're killing him!
What are they doing with him?
Let your cross save him now.
The Holy Man!
Back, Christian dogs, or we kill your Holy Man.
Tell us, Hermit, what shall we do?
On! On, ye men of the cross.
Good Father, if we attack, it means your death.
Fear not, my sons, attack!
Within these walls is the cross of our Lord.
Dog of an unbeliever!
Send back your people or you die!
Yes, death!
Death!
Send your people!
Send them back!
I command you, in the name of God, attack!
Stop his blaspheming voice!
In this sign... ye shall conquer.
Silence him!
Hearken my prayer, O, Lord!
Men of the cross, attack!
Glory to the King!
Move!
Clear the way.
Push the mantelet forward!
Faster, knights.
Follow me to the bridge.
Hope was left to them, the everlasting peace.
Standby to lower the bridge!
Cast them to the moat!
Which of you has seen the Christian Queen?
Oh, King, we have seen no Christian woman.
She's captive here.
Where is she?
I'll get the truth out of you.
It is the truth.
We know nothing.
Sire, we've searched the palace from tower to vault.
Your lady is not there.
Well, search the houses everywhere!
Yes, sire.
Sire, we have searched and questioned.
No one has seen the Lady Berengaria.
Take what men you need, but find her.
Sire.
Sire, it is the cross.
The true cross.
Sire, I have seen it.
I have seen it.
Sire...
Oh, Alan.
I have seen it.
Have your wounds been looked at?
It matters not.
I have touched the wood of the true cross of our Lord.
It's in there.
It blesses those who touch it.
My boy, you're badly hurt.
I'm dying... but I've touched the cross.
Go, my king.
Lay your hand on it.
Yes, yes, yes.
It is found.
It is there... in eternal light... awaiting you.
All right, son.
We'll go together.
We have found the glory of the worid.
Praise to the Lord of hosts.
Let me touch it.
Let me touch the wood of the cross before I die.
The cross of Christ.
Praise to the Lord, our God.
It is true.
The cross on which he died.
Lo, he is with us always... even unto the end of the worid.
Sire! Sire!
We've word of her!
What?
Here!
Sire! Your lady, we've news of her.
This dog has seen her.
Where? Where is she?
She's gone from Acre with Saladin.
With Saladin!
They went through our lines toward Jerusalem.
Sound the call to arms.
We go on to Jerusalem.
My horse!
You cannot, Richard.
Thousands lie dead outside the walls.
The Count of Hungary...
You heard my orders, Robert.
Sire. Sire.
The cross.
Sire, Saladin has gone to a great army at Jerusalem.
They will outnumber us
10 to 1.
Sound the call.
Sire, it's certain death.
Certain death.
Don't go, sire.
Don't go.
Not half the Crusade lives to follow you.
I ride to Jerusalem.
Let follow me who will.
The King!
Follow the King!
Here is peace by the Holy City of Jerusalem.
I carried you here in my arms... and I prayed to Allah that you would live.
You are kind.
No knight could be more gentle.
Because you have crept into my heart.
Tell me, why did
England's Queen desire to die?
Because I was in the way of my husband.
For his sake?
Yes.
You are no longer the wife of the Lion King.
What do you mean?
Islam does not accept a Christian marriage.
And here is the love of Saladin... who holds you ever in his heart... who worships your loveliness... who would give you all the gifts of the worid... happiness, power... the kings of Asia to kneel at your feet.
That would not bring me happiness.
Words that rise quickly to the lips may not be true.
The truth lies hidden in your heart.
I am your captive.
I do not love you.
Love is not a ring of gold to hold you captive to it.
Love is a flower that blooms at Allah's will.
It is written that you should come to me.
And who can change what is written?
Master.
Yes?
Oh, my master,
Acre has fallen.
The Christians are on the march.
The Lion King rides to Jerusalem.
Richard.
Tomorrow he will be within sight of the Holy City.
Summon the Amirs.
Tomorrow I shall meet the Lion King in battle.
You will never defeat him.
You shall go with me... and from my tent you shall see the foes of Islam... swept like dust before the might of Allah.
God forbid.
Crusaders, charge!
Charge!
Richard, there is nothing here but the dead.
I tell you, old Hercules is slain.
He saved my life today.
It was by that mound.
And I'm going to find his body.
Search tomorrow, sire, when we can see.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow we may keep him company in heaven or hell.
Tomorrow we fight again.
What's left of us.
Sire, take care.
There are the lights of Saladin's camp.
All right,
I'll go that way.
Sire...
Blondel, you go this way.
But, Richard, I...
Here, give me that torch.
Templar, you stay on that mound... and watch.
What brings
Conrad of Montferrat to me?
I offer you victory.
Tomorrow I shall win it.
The Crusade is broken.
Not yet.
Victory is not sure while
Richard of England lives.
You're his brother's friend.
And would be yours.
What price do you ask for your treachery?
The kingdom of Jerusalem, which I shall rule under you.
And what do you offer me?
Richard's death.
Within the hour, he will lie on the battlefield among the slain.
Who would slay your Lion of the Crusades?
Fifteen swords of mine follow him where he goes alone.
With Richard dead, you will rule unchallenged in Asia.
I have no traffic with assassins.
Away with this dog!
My Lord Sultan, you can save him.
Your Lion King?
Yes.
It is not my hand that will strike him down.
Would you let him die by the swords of traitors?
He is the tempest that has shaken Islam.
My men have died beneath his sword.
But you can tell him, warn him.
If he were here, as you are, my captive... then I would spare him.
For a ransom?
Yes.
Then I will be his ransom.
You, my Princess?
Yes, yes.
Take me to be your wife, but save his life.
Send men to aid him quickly... or quickly warn him before it's too late.
You will open your arms to my love?
Yes, yes, I promise.
Karakush.
Ride to the English King.
He searches among the dead on the battlefield.
Say to him:
"Guard thyself against the soldiers of Montferrat."
Oh, my Sultan... guard thyself against this accursed Christian woman.
Go.
I obey.
Ride swiftly. Swiftly.
Sire.
Hercules!
Old Smithy.
They told me you were dead.
Here, let me.
No, lad.
No, lad. I'm done.
I wanted to tell you,
Richard...
Yes?
I've been... lying here by it, thinking... it's more than a sword
I made for you, lad.
Nothing else... matters...
Steady, steady.
...if you've got this.
The cross.
Old Hercules.
If you...
If you really are there... receive this old man's soul.
Whose men are these?
Conrad of Montferrat's.
But they obey me.
And what message do you bring me now?
Your death.
Strike him down!
Strike him! Kill him!
Look out!
Go at him!
Back, you treacherous dogs!
Pull him down!
How is it that Saracens come to the aid of the English King?
By Allah,
I come not of my own will.
Then who sent you?
The Christian Queen.
Berengaria? Where is she?
In the tent of my master.
Get off, you dog!
Give me that horse!
The tent of your master?
Oh, my master, the King of the Christians.
Let him pass.
Richard.
Lion King, you come unbidden to my tent.
I have come for my wife.
She is my captive.
You were not wise to seek her here.
Now I hold you... as my army holds within its ranks the remnant of your Crusaders...
I have conquered.
If I die here, at least
I'll take you with me... and my men will fill hell with your infidels.
By Allah, I wish you might have been my brother, not my foe.
I offer the Lion what I would offer no other man.
Your Crusade is crushed.
Your kingdom is seized by your brother, John... and other traitors seek your life.
Surrender yourself.
Accept Islam, and I will make you
King of Jerusalem.
I fight for the cross.
No.
You wear the cross... of one who gave his life in this very land... that men might be at peace.
But you have no faith in that cross.
Those who follow me have faith.
In their blood, they crawled to that cross in Acre.
Shall I break faith with them now?
Oh, no, Richard, no.
Not to save my life.
You have chosen your fate.
What ransom will you take for my wife?
Whatever you ask, I grant.
I will take no ransom.
She promised herself to me, and she is mine.
You'll not say that and live!
Richard!
Ho!
Out of my way!
Richard, if it's blood you want,
I'll tear open my wound.
Let my blood flow with yours and all the others.
Oh, my love, they've hurt you.
No, no.
No, Saladin healed me, cared for me.
You owe your own life to him.
To Saladin?
She promised herself to me, to save your life.
I'll not accept my life at that price!
Do you intend to keep your promise?
Yes.
Richard, you must believe...
I've never loved anyone but you.
I love you now.
Don't make me suffer more.
If only we could put an end to pain, if only we could have peace.
If you fight on, thousands and thousands more will die.
Richard, you mustn't.
You know how to yield to a conqueror.
Do you think to teach me?
We've been blind.
We were proud, dearest, when we took the cross... and in our pride, we fought to conquer Jerusalem.
We tried to ride through blood to the Holy Place of God.
And now...
Now we suffer.
The Holy City of Allah.
What if we call him
Allah or God?
Shall men fight because they travel different roads to him?
There is only one God.
His cross is burned deep into our hearts.
It's here... and we must carry it with us wherever we go.
Don't you see, Richard?
There's only one way.
Peace.
Make peace between
Christian and Saracen.
You ask me to lay down my sword?
If you love me.
Sultan...
I offer you peace.
You ask for the truce of Allah?
Truce of Allah or peace of God, yes.
I ask it for the Crusade.
Upon what terms?
The gates of Jerusalem shall be opened... and all Christian captives shall be freed.
All Muslim captives in Acre shall be freed.
Every Christian shall be allowed to enter Jerusalem.
If they bear no arms.
Granted.
They shall come in peace to the tomb... and go in peace.
All but you...
Lion of the Christians, the foe of Islam... you may not enter the gates.
I vowed to go to Jerusalem with my sword.
And I vowed you should never pass the gates of Jerusalem.
I offer terms your sword could never win.
Richard.
Richard, you hold the peace of the worid in your hands.
What does it matter what happens to us... if men can live and the Holy City be freed?
Berengaria, you know what you ask?
Yes.
We've come to our cross, beloved.
We carry our love... and the pain of it deep in our hearts.
Your terms are granted.
It stands between us as man and wife... forever.
I make peace with you.
Let there be peace.
You love him... deeply.
Oh, God...
I was blind.
But now I see.
I know now you really are here.
I've come through blood to your Holy City.
Have pity on the fool that I am.
The Holy Man was right.
Your cross has burned deep into my heart.
I'm no longer king.
I've no pride now... no glory.
I kneel to my God.
Grant me your mercy... and give her back to me.
Have pity on a penitent fool.
Jerusalem is freed!
The war is over.
Freedom! Freedom!
The Crusade! The Crusade is at the gates!
I'm free!
I can see the light.
Open the gates!
There is peace.
Let them open the gates.
Open the gates!
We are free!
Open the gates!
We're free!
There they are!

Richard, beloved... you've conquered.
Look at their faces.
Don't you feel their joy?
I'm glad they're happy, but...
I can't feel anything, except wanting you.
Was there ever such happiness in the worid?
You gave them this.
This that all the hours of Christendom could not give.
See, the gates of Jerusalem are open... and the Crusade is going in.
Now, I can take my gift to the tomb of our Lord.
No, no, don't leave me yet.
Last night,
I asked for you.
You asked?
Whom?
I just begged for you.
You prayed.
We've reached the gates.
I can go no further.
But I shall come back to you,
Richard... when I have laid our gift before our Lord... so that it will no longer stand between us... as man and wife.
But Saladin...
Saladin bade me tell you... all captives shall be freed.
He would not hold me without love.
I'm yours, Richard.
Oh, merciful God.

Whoa!
Mush!
Now beat it!
All right, I'll leave, if that's the way you feel about it.
But I'll leave like a gentleman.
Quiet, everybody! Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
You're about to take your last look at
Mr. Thornton's handsome, smiling face.
So make the most of it, you weasels!
But, as a last insane gesture...
Mr. Thornton wants you all to step up to the bar and have a drink with him!
Quiet!
Are you ready? Let's go!
To the bar, everybody!
There you are!
Hiya, Tex.
Hiya, dude. The boys're telling me you're going home.
Yep. Catching tomorrow's boat.
Well, there's no use in wishing you luck. I guess you've had plenty.
Give me Michigan Avenue on a hot afternoon... and you can have all the yellow dust this side of Seattle.
I guess we all feel the same way, kid.
It seems that all the homesick guys in the world came up here.
- Put this away for me. It's wearing me down.
- Sure thing.
- Ah, they been kinda running against you. - Yeah- Oh, thanks.
Give us a couple more stacks. Here's where
I'm apt to earn my fare back to Seattle.
There you are.
Did I say Seattle?
You'd better quit while you still have the price of a pick and shovel, dude.
What's the matter? You want your grave dug? Give us some action! I'm buying!
Well, the hot seat went cold, eh?
Better luck next time, dude.
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
Well, so long, fellas.
- So long.
- So long, dude.
Russ, my stomach wants to know how my credit is.
Well, if your stomach's as good as your credit, you'll live to be 100.
Thanks. Did I ever tell you about my grandpa? Died when he was 106.
- What interrupted his youth?
- He quit drinking.
So they cleaned you out, eh?
- That's tough.
- Ah, there's a lot more where that came from.
What's the matter, Mr. Thornton? Ain't you speakin' to your pals since you got rich?
Well, hello, Shorty! How are ya?
- Have a stimulant.
- Thanks.
- When'd you get out?
- This afternoon.
These bastilles up here ain't as cozy as them stirs down in little ol' New York.
The finest jailhouse I ever seen was the Coney Island precinct.
- They sent you up for opening the mails, didn't they?
- Shh! Shh!
That was a miscarriage of justice.
Listen-Ah!
All I did on that mail route was peek in a couple of those bill o' dues.
It gets darned lonesome on the trail there.
I was as innocent-like as if I was sittin' in the New York Public Library.
Letters are supposed to be private, even up here.
Well, if I wasn't honest trying to seal it up, I wouldn't have got caught.
- That's too bad.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- That letter I opened was very interesting.
- Yeah?
Yeah. If you'd have saved a bit of your bankroll, I'd have cut you in on somethin'.
- Oh. More mail?
- Yes and no.
That letter I opened was worth about a million bucks.
Thanks very much for the snort-ola.
Ah! See ya around sometime.
Hey, Shorty! Shorty! Wait a minute.
Let me hear a little more about that pipe dream of yours.
Pipe dream is right.
I been dreamin' about this for six months up in that cold Arctic can.
- Yeah? What do you need a bankroll for? - Well, I-
Hey, youse guys! Get outta here!
23 skiddoo!
Boo!
I need a bankroll to grubstake us as far as Dawson City... and then a long way beyond that.
- Yeah? That sounds interesting.
- You know somethin'?
When they caught me opening those letters... and the judge presented me with six months- or, as the English jockeys say, a dozen fortnights- well, that judge asked me a lot of silly questions, like how many letters I'd jimmied... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
- But there's one question he didn't ask me.
- Yeah?
He didn't ask me what was in that letter.
- Say, is your credit still good in there?
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- Come on. Let's go and exhaust it.
- Okay.
His name was Blake. Martin Blake.
He had red whiskers and, well, he was a little blind.
Oh, yeah, I remember. He was cracked.
- Told everybody he'd found a rich lode.
- That's the guy.
Well, he got sick on the trail. He was coming to Dawson City to file his claim.
He wrote a letter to his son,
John Blake, in San Francisco.
He had a note on the envelope
- said if anything happened to him... the letter should be mailed.
Well, his number was up, so the letter was mailed.
And you looked inside to be sure everything was neat and in order.
Mmm. But there wasn't much of a letter.
It was mostly a map.
You made a copy?
As I'm coming to the backstretch with a pencil,
I feel the long arm of John Law on my shoulder.
- Did they take the copy away from you?
- No.
- Then you still have it?
- No again.
Well, what'd you do with it?
I et it.
When that map started to digest though, see, it sorta went to my head.
Went to my brain.
So, while I'm sitting up there in the booby hatch...
I made a copy of it from memory.
Take off my boot.
Well, I'll show you. I got a good memory too.
Course, there's a couple of things here I don't quite figure out.
Now, you see...
I don't know if this is a mountain or a river.
And I think they said there was rapids here.
But I don't see how that could be, because I don't remember no river up there.
Hey, listen, little man, the graveyards up here is full of gold hopheads... guys that smoked a pipeful of hope... had glittering yellow dreams and ended up under a pile of rocks in frozen ground.
Me, I'll take bourbon.
Kills you slower, but a lot more pleasant-like.
Now, wait a minute, Mr. Thornton.
Something mighty strange happened today.
- Something mighty strange.
- Yeah?
Sit down.
I'm standin' out in front of the Palace Hotel, see.
Not doin' nothin', because, well, you know, a fella just out of the can and broke... just lookin' and standin' is about the limit of your activities.
- Yeah.
- Well, it was a good idea, see.
- 'Cause things started happenin'.
- Yeah?
Out of this hotel comes the most beautiful skirt that you ever put your peepers on.
And following her is a dignified-lookin' guy-
I'd say 46 autumns.
And him and her get in the sled and they go off, headed for Dawson City.
- Thanks for the society note.
- Yeah, but wait.
I get excited, see, I run into the hotel and take a look at the ledger.
You know the names of these two interesting people?
Mr. and Mrs. John
Blake of San Francisco.
Old man Blake's son?
I hope, in my subtle way,
I've made myself clear.
You have.
Look, if I get the money for an outfit, how do we split?
Even-steven.
Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Listen, they got a day's lead on us.
- It's only a gamble.
- That's what I like about it.
Hot-
What's the matter with this fido?
Sorry, Jack, but that one's taken.
Belongs to a team I sold yesterday.
I'll tell you what. I got a big fella
I'll give you for practically nothin'.
Fifty bucks!
What's the matter with him?
- He ain't broke yet, and I don't think he's gonna be.
- Oh. Tough, huh?
St. Bernard. He's all animal, Joe.
- He's on a hunger strike.
- Won't eat anything?
Nothin' but your hand or your foot, or points north.
- He looks like he was stolen from some joint in the States.
I never ask a dog no questions.
- Blue ribbons don't mean nothin' to a pooch up here.
- How'd you like to see me make this guy eat?
- All right by me.
- I ain't got nothin' to do all winter.
- Get some grub.
- Frank, dinner for one!
- Unharness Little Boy Blue. Put him right there.
- Dinner for one.
- Okay. Let him out.
- I hope you know what you're doin'.
- I hope so too!
All right, let go of him.
All right, pull your dog out!
Don't let your dog get this piece.
He'll eat regular from now on.
I wish I had time to break him. He'd make a great dog.
- All right, Frank, put him back.
- I'll do it. Here.
Which one of you is Mr. Groggins?
Well, speak up. Is Mr. Groggins here?
My name is Smith.
Are the outfit and provisions ready that were ordered in my name?
Well, why don't you answer me,
Groggins? You speak English, don't you?
Uh, y-yes, sir. H-
Here's your whole outfit.
- Tenderfoot, huh?
- Not as tender as he looks.
If I'm not too inquisitive, will six dogs be enough?
- They'll pull the load, all right.
- With me on it?
Well, I don't know about that.
You don't look like a man who knows much about anything, Mr. Groggins.
Well, I do know... that people come up here don't usually make a buggy ride out of it.
They walk or run with the dogs, sometimes break trail.
You sure will need more dogs if you're gonna ride that sled.
And more dog food.
And a needle and thread.
What for, my intelligent friend?
To sew up the guys that's gonna split their sides laughin' at ya!
Once in a while people do laugh at me.
But very briefly.
Well, sir, dogs! Dogs!
Uh, bring Flip and Frowsy.
Say, Joe, why don't you show the honorable Mr. Smith this beautiful animal?
I don't think so. He's too savage.
Is that so? Well, just let him out.
- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith.
- Let him out, I said.
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.
I don't like to take the responsibility, Mr. Smith.
That's why you'll never amount to much.
What are you asking for him?
Uh, 250 bucks.
Sold. Let him out.
So your name's Buck, eh?
You're tough, huh?
Hey, wait a minute. That dog cost me a lot of money.
- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins.
- Wait a minute.
That dog belongs to me.
I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot.
That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself.
That's all right. I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
Just as you say, my good man.
Just as you say.
Well, what others have you?
- Uh, here. Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle. Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on. Out.
Come on. Come on. Come on, Harmon.
Here ya are, Mr. Smith.
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting. Mush!
Been a great pleasure, gentlemen.
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
Well, I don't like to see a dog killed either.
But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks.
All right, I told you
I'm buying him, and I am.
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
- Quiet, quiet.
Whose money is this?
Listen, you, you're my dog, and I'm your boss.
The sooner you learn that, the easier it's going to be for both of us.
Come on.! Mush.! Mush.!
Ho! Ho!
Right there!
Hey!
Go on! Get back there! What'd you bring this baboon along for?
- That big guy don't like him.!
- That's just too bad! He'll learn to like him!
- Come on! Let's go! Mush! Mush!
- Get your teeth out of him.!
Come on! Get up there!
Come on, gray boy!
Come on, Buck.
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.
Come on, big boy.
We don't mean you any harm.
We're trying to be friendly with you.
Buck, come here!
Buck, come here.!
Come on, boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Come on, now, be-
Buck! Hey, Buck! Buck, come here!
Well, you can kiss that 250 bucks good-bye.
Yep. It's too bad too.
He'd have made a great dog.
Now he'll either freeze to death, or wolves'll get him. Poor fella.
Make yourself at home, Buck.
Hey! Look, boss! Wolves!
Is he dead?
No, he isn't dead. And he isn't a he.
Hey, you know who that is? That's Blake's woman!
Oh, John! Oh, John darling! I'm so glad!
Oh.
Oh- Oh,
I thought-
Is my husband with you? Have you found him?
You're the only one we've found so far.
What about your husband?
I don't know.
We ran into trouble... and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river.
The ice broke, and
- and then some of our dogs died.
Two days ago my husband went out to look for food... and he hasn't come back.
Do you think he's dead?
That's a pretty good guess.
What are we gonna do with her?
What can you do? Take her to Dawson and leave her.
You're forgetting one thing, pal.
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.
And they had the map
- the original one.
You'll find my husband for me, won't you?
There's nothing we can do. We're a thousand miles from nowhere.
Either the cold got him, or the wolves.
- Get on the sled. We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.
He isn't dead. I
- I don't believe that.
Hey, listen, lady, in this country when a guy is gone for two days, he's gone.
I refuse to go until I definitely know about my husband.
If you don't wanna stay and look for him, you can go without me.
No! No! Put me down!
Put me down! I can't go!
I've got to stay! Put me down!
Stop! Stop this sled!
Whoa! What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
- Oh, no, no. You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own good. Later on you'll thank me.
I hate you, you beast!
Let me out of here!
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me!
Whoops! Ha!
- Let's go! Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share.
You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty.
Can you cook?
Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook.
Huh. Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents?
I'll do nothing to help you.
I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me.
Want you? We just had an attack of insanity and decided to keep you from committing suicide.
Very bad idea, come to think of it.
Hey! You're forgettin' our guest of honor.
Thank you, Mr. Hoolihan.
- Hey. Gimme. Come on, gimme.
- Hmm?
Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if
I ain't too inquisitive... what was you and your old man gonna do up here?
Work.
Oh. Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?
Probably.
Can't understand it, a guy taking his wife way out in the wilderness.
Stupid, if you ask me.
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.
Yeah?
Yeah. He loved me and I loved him.
Well, I wouldn't let him go alone.
Undoubtedly, that will still impress you as being a very stupid reason.
We thought it an excellent one.
I still think it's stupid.
Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.
Well, tell me somethin'.
Uh, didn't he have some object?
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?
What I mean is, did he have a hunch, or did somebody give him a tip?
- I'm very tired, Mr. Hoolihan, and I know you must be.
- Me, tired? Heck no!
Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Boss, she's a woman in a million.
- You think so?
- Yeah. She don't talk.
Oh!
All right, get on with the dogs.
No, thank you. I'll cross the way you men do.
Hold on! Hold on!
Stick with it.!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!
Say! Nice, modest little prices they have here.
They practically give things away.
Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave?
Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do. Come on.
- Come on, Buck.
- Come on, Buck.
Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye.
There's an officer of the
Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you've been very nice, Mr. Thornton.
I
- I suppose I was a little difficult, but...
- well, losing someone you've grown to love isn't- - Yes, I know.
I'm sorry I was so rough.
Well, I
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.
Mmm. I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states.
No. My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?
We know what brought you up here. We've known all along.
I mean, old man Blake's claim.
But how? How could you possibly know?
Give me that map, Shorty.
Yeah.
Did you ever see this?
Or, uh, something like it?
Yes. Yes, I've seen the original.
This won't do you any good. It isn't correct.
I know it. That's why I was going to suggest that-
My husband had to borrow and beg to make this trip.
He went through all sorts of horrible difficulties and-
I know. Well, now he
- he's gone.
That's why I was going to suggest that-
And you were gonna take it away from him, steal it.
Oh, now, please be reasonable. Why don't you come in with me and Shorty on this thing?
Where our map is incorrect, give us the right route. We'll be partners.
And, well, while you're about it...
I suppose you may as well consider all angles.
We need your information about this.
We could probably find the mine ourselves without your help. It would take longer.
Of course, you don't know us very well... except that we're a little rough on women.
We might play you dirty.
We might take your information and then tell you to, well, go jump in the river.
We might do that.
On the other hand, we might be on the up-and-up with you.
Let me see your map.
This river here
- it isn't a river, it's a dry creek.
- And that mountain peak, that's down here.
- Criminy! That's it!
Ha!
All the other mistakes are minor ones.
All right, Mr. Thornton, now you can tell me-
How did you express it?
To go jump in the river?
We've gotta do a lot of jumping ourselves to get the 700 bucks for the outfit.
- Seven hundred dollars is hard to get.
- My, oh, my, oh, my.
But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife, stick somebody and take it away from 'em.
- Yeah!
- Come on, Shorty. Mush!
- Come on. Let's go.
- All set.
Keep your fingers crossed till we get back.
We've gotta make a touch, Shorty.
Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine.
Yeah, I been noticing that.
You're the doctor. You know what's good for ya.
The way I figures it, hunting for gold's a full-time job.
Anything that interferes with it, interferes with it.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Mind keeping that fat snoot of yours out of my affairs?
All right, all right. No offense, boss. No offense whatsoever.
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?
Come on!
My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?
That's the second time he's attacked me!
Yeah, he's crazy about you!
Can't you see?
Wait a minute, partner. I'll give you a chance to make some money.
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.
- Ha.!
- Five hundred.
Nope. Not interested.
I'll give you $1,000!
That's a fabulous price to pay for a dog. I could get a team of six for that.
What do you expect you'd do with him if I let you have him?
Give myself the exquisite pleasure of putting a bullet through his head.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
No, thanks. I'm sorry I can't contribute to your fun, mister.
Boo!
What'll you have to drink, gentlemen?
Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?
Hello, Sam! How are you? Glad to see you. Sam, this is Shorty.
- Hello.
- Ah, yes!
Just seen the argument you had with that fellow back there.
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
- No, no.
The dog doesn't like him either.
Look, Sam, how you fixed?
Uh, pretty nearly flat.
But anyhow, I got enough to ask you gentlemens to join me in a drink.
- Bourbon, straight!
- Ditto!
Likewise! Come on, boy! Come on!
Schnapps?
Well, Sam, here's to your very good health.
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog.
Yeah? That's a lot of dog too.
Ja!
- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?
- No, no, no, not yet.
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole! Ha-ha! How are you?
I got lots trouble.
Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap.
What matter, huh?
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
Two of my dogs, they die.
It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull.
Quiet, now!
Yo! That's one fine dog, mister!
You want to sell, maybe?
- No, I don't.
- I'll say he don't!
You know, that fellow back there...
just offered him 1,000 bucks.
- One thousand bucks? - Mm-hmm.
What the dog do? Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of yours without any help at all.
- Sure! I'll bet you he could.
- Well, he could.
How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner?
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome... he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds. It's impossible.
Well, then it's impossible. Let's drop it.
Is it all right to look at him, mister?
It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
Come on, boss. Let's get outta here.
What's the matter, gentlemen?
If I overheard correctly... the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet. Says he's broke.
I don't want money from you, my friend.
If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000.
- If he can't- - Well?
Why, then, I'll take the dog.
No.
Say, that sounds fair to me.
Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds.
- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!
First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.
Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem to think I'm giving you the best of it.
Don't do it, boss.
Let's go outta here.
A thousand dollars.
It's a bet!
It's a bet!
I think you make one big mistake, mister.
But, well, we go outside.
- Thornton's crazy!
- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!
- Ten-to-one he can't! - It's a bet!
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!
- Gee, boss, he can't do it. He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.
You're not only doing this for money.
You're afraid of getting stuck here and losing that Blake woman.
Oh, all right.
Your dog is to pull the sled a hundred yards from the standstill.
That's the bet.
A hundred yards.!
All right, all right!
One, two, three, four...
All right, get back.
Nobody touch that dog. five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, one, two-
Dog is gonna draw a sled. Just stand there.
The dog will do it!
It's plenty load for one dog to pull.
The dog will do it!
Five, six, seven, eight, nine-
Keep your hands off that dog, now! You understand?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Seven, eight, nine, a hundred.
Go on, mister. We're waiting.
Buck.
Buck.!
Buck! Come on, boy!
Come on, Buck! Mush!
Come on, boy! Mush, Buck!
Come on, come on, Buck!
- Come on, boy.
- Stay away from that dog!
Buck, come on!
Buck! Come on, boy!
Come on, whitey! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hooray! That dog done it.
- He all right?
- Hope so.
Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but haven't you forgotten about the money?
The gelt? Please.
Mmm! Thank you, sir.
- Oh, say. You know something?
- Well?
You'd make a good dog biscuit.
- What's that, a halter?
- Yeah.
Hmm. Being as I'm working like a horse, I just as well look like one.
There you are. Now hang on to this.
Is that all?
Did you remember nails?
Nails. Hammers and saw. Look.
You bought 'em yourself. What's the matter with you this morning?
- Nothing. Get out.
- Mmm.
Oh, hey, listen-
There's something we did forget
- a medicine kit.
We need some iodine and quinine, just in case.
Yeah, all right. I'll get 'em.
Hmm. I hope it won't be too heavy for you to carry.
- See youse later.
- All right.
Say, uh, what do we need the nails and hammers for?
Well, the snow's disappearing fast.
We'll have to cache the sled later on and build a boat.
Oh?
Say, uh, look-
Yeah?
What is it?
I, uh-
I got something to tell you. Maybe you better take it sitting down.
You know how I feel about women in this country.
Where we're going is ten times as tough and rugged...
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?
Well, just this.
I paid your room rent here at the hotel... and I'll leave you enough money for expenses until we get back.
You mean I'm supposed to wait here while you and Shorty go-
That's it.
I've been wondering whether you'd try something like this.
Well, if you're going, I'm going too.
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.
All right, Shorty and I will stay here. You go find the mine.
- Oh, don't be smart.
- Well, you're not going.
Wouldn't be fair to you, or to us either.
Slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions.
Besides, it's more of a risk than I want to see you take.
Believe me, that's my only reason for making this decision.
If you don't like my way of doing it, do it yourself.
- You can have my share.
- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?
Well, thank you very much. You'll not leave this town without me.
We'll leave without you.
You'll wait here and like it.
All right, come on. Let's get going.
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.
If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along, smack her down.
Wonder what's happened now.
Oh, well. You know, I know a couple of people used to fool around like that... and they got children now.
You, uh
- You still want to go along?
Not only do I still want to go, I am going.
All right, come on. Let's get going.
Come on.!
Mush! Mush!
Come on.!
Hey! Hey! Come on!
Mush! Mush!
Mush!
- What's up, Sergeant?
- They just brought a fellow in.
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?
It seems like he left his sled to go hunting for food... then couldn't find his way back.
He was almost a corpse when they found him.
- What's his name?
- Well, we found these on him.
Name seems to be Blake
- John Blake, San Francisco.
Here it comes.
Say, it even looks like a raft.
Thanks. I always wanted to join the navy.
- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?
- I'm afraid not, matey.
- They'll have to run along the bank.
- Very well, sir.
Be careful of that varnish on the deck, you two gobs.
Step right in, commodore.
All set? Shove off, cabin boy.
Ca-
Toot, toot!
Hard aport!
Come on, Buck. Come on.
The way I figure it, we go 100 miles upstream... then we follow a creek that runs into it north.
Huh!
Never fails.
Oh, you pretty things.
That's right
- north for about 40 miles.
And then all we gotta do is-
Oh, if you could only cook.
Then all we have to do is find the knoll... upon which stands a tree, half-shattered by lightning.
And the cabin.
Near that knoll.
Gee, I wonder what it's gonna be like... having things instead of wishing for 'em.
Hmm.
Not nearly so much fun.
You're wrong, Claire.
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.
It's owning something that counts.
Taking it when you can't get it any other way
- that's all right too.
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.
When there's something you need, grab it.
Take it away from the other guy.
It's a good law.
It works.
Nope. It only works when you deserve to have what you take.
Otherwise it's stealing.
Perhaps that particular commandment isn't respected up here.
They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.
Well, Noah... that boat manipulating's a little too tough for my delicate constitution... so if you don't mind, sir, I shall go below.
Good night.
- Night, Shorty.
- Night.
Good night, dice.
Summer's just around the corner.
I can smell it.
You know, somehow
Dawson and Skagway and... even California seem like places I've just heard of.
Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places... never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember... and that's a very kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
What are you thinking of, Buck?
Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking.
Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law- the law we were just talking about.
It's getting late, Jack.
Think I'll say good night.
Not guilty, Your Honor.
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
Oh, boy!
Hey, somebody pinch me.
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.
Hey! Hey, boss!
Boss! Come here, quick.
Hmm. Look at this.
Oh, my. Oh.
Lookit, lookit! Tell me if I'm dreamin'. Lookit.
Holy mackerel.
It's gold, Claire. More gold than
I've ever seen in my whole life.
Oh!
Oh, be careful!
Hey, if we panned this much in an afternoon... think what we'll get in a month.
Gee, I wish I could stick around here a couple of days longer.
You know, I been dreamin' of this moment all my life.
I'm sorry, Shorty, but you got to file a claim.
As long as the trails are open, some prospector is apt to discover this creek.
First to register gets discovery rights.
You're the boss, boss.
- When I get to Dawson, first thing I'm gonna do- - Don't.
- Don't what?
- Get drunk.
Not a chance. I'm gonna catch up on my meals.
I like coffee, and my stomach's been getting weaker every day.
Well, so long, kid.
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- So long.
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake.
Good-bye, Shorty.
Come on, dogs.
- Hey.! Hey, Shorty.!
- What?
You forgot your meal ticket.
Oh! Oh, yeah. Come to papa.
Snake eyes.
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.
Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
What's the matter, boy?
Buck!
Buck.!
- What's biting him?
- I don't know.
- What's that, Jack?
- Wolves.
That's funny. They don't usually come so close to camp.
Buck! Come here!
Buck, come back here!
If that's a pack, they'll kill him. Buck, come here!
Buck.!
He's been changing lately.
Haven't you noticed?
Seems as though he remembers things up here.
Buck, come back here! Buck!
Buck! Buck, come here!
Well, well. Welcome, stranger.
How are ya? Huh?
Well, seems we still mean more to him than- than that old memory.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
You better come inside before you change your mind.
Come on, tough guy. Come on.
All right, kid, shake it up.
Shake it up.
Oh, that's grand music.
Yes.
That's grand music.
Aw, that's grand music.
Yeah. That's grand music.
That's lovely. Come on.
Shake it up.
All right. You tired? Hmm?
All right, come on now.
Let's pull. Together.
One, two...
- three-
- Oh!
Well, we weren't together.
- Oh, I wish you hadn't.
- Why not?
I haven't let myself think about us.
- I didn't dare.
- Why?
Oh, I don't know. I-
I've had sort of a strange premonition.
I don't know exactly how to explain it, but-
Explanations belong 5,000 miles away.
I only have one question... and I only want one answer.
You know the answer.
I don't want to know the answer.
I want to have the answer.
It just struck me, Mr. Blake.
Now my back please, Kali.
I say, Mr. Blake, it's just struck me that so far...
I've taken this entire matter on trust.
I believed your story and put up the money for this outfit.
I still believe your story, but I think it's time... you gave me a little more positive proof.
You should show us the map, Mr. Blake.
When I asked you in Dawson
City to help finance me...
I told you I knew the location of a very rich mine.
I still know where that mine is.
I'm taking you there.
But the map, Mr. Blake-
Why do you continually refuse to show us the map?
I see.
Well, what's to prevent our taking it away from you?
The possibility that such a map may not exist- except in my memory.
Violence will do you no good.
You've come this far... and now there's nothing you can do but go all the way.
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.
Now, now. Who talked of killing?
We're not pirates, my dear man.
We are gentleman adventurers on the road to great riches, eh?
Come, come, Kali. My towel.
Say, Jack.
- Buck's gone again.
- Yes, I know.
- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?
Well, that's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company.
Mmm!
Wait a minute.
According to all you told us, and to all calculations... we should have located the mine two days ago.
I'm afraid you're bringing out my worst side, Mr. Blake.
- Yes, I-I know, but- - If you're trying to hoodwink us... we are certain to find it out sooner or later... and if such is the case... there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you.
I swear I'm doing the best I can.
I followed the compass directions exactly.
The burnt tree.!
- The cabin! That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake... how can you ever forgive me for doubting your integrity?
You've placed me in a most embarrassing position.
I scarcely know what to say.
One for the master.
And one for the dame.
And one for the little boy who's filing the claim.
Why, Jack, I never suspected.
The world doesn't understand me.
At heart I'm an artist.
Oh, I want to write poetry. I want to compose.
I want to sing, paint.
- Barns?
- Yes, yes. Those too.
I want to starve in a garret.
Wear me hair long. Get egg on a flowing tie.
In other words, be a genius. Ah
- But no.
No, the world sneers at me talent... and instead it gives me... gold.
Oh, my poor boy.
You seem to have all the comforts of home, Mr. Thornton-
A comfortable cabin, golden evidence of more comforts to come... and a beautiful lady.
You will oblige me greatly if you will assist... in making this incident as painless as possible.
Come on, get it over with.
What are you going to do?
Do? My dear man, nothing at all.
The important thing is-
We're going back by water,
Kali, using Mr. Thornton's canoe.
You may destroy our burros.
As I was saying, the important thing is to prevent you people... from filing claim on this charming site before we do.
And how do you expect to do that?
Oh, very easily- by leaving you here and destroying all means of transportation.
- If you can't get back to
Dawson to file, why, then...
- you can't get back to
Dawson to file, now can you?
So we'll file instead.
If you want to work the mine while we're gone... you're very welcome to do so, of course.
We'll be glad to recompense you for your trouble when we get back.
Meanwhile we'll take with us your gun and ammunition, axes, et cetera.
It would be a grave error to leave behind... the implements for building another canoe, wouldn't it?
Kali!
Francois.! Kali.!
Come here.!
Look here, Smith. Why can't we do business?
I'm always open to an honest proposition, Mr. Thornton.
We'll give you the claim, all of it.
You can have what gold we've got.
But leave us some way of getting out of here. The winter snows are coming on.
My dear man, you call that a business proposition?
We already have the mine, and the gold is ours by right of-
How shall I put it?
By right of conquest.
Do you mind if we don't argue the point anymore?
Let's help ourselves.
Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold.
I must commend your sense of humor, Mr. Thornton.
Very few people would be able to smile on an occasion like this.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
I remember watching a magician once.
From an apparently empty hat, he shortly produced a rabbit.
He smiled very much as you're smiling now...
because, I imagine, he knew all the while...
that he had that rabbit up his sleeve.
You've something up your sleeve, perhaps.
Perhaps.
Roll up your sleeve, Mr.
Thornton. There's no rabbit there.
Come, come. Don't let's strain our friendship.
Madam.
Careful, you idiot. You might have split the bottom.
We'll be back, my friends.
For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye.
Look out!
Well, they wanted gold. Now they got it.
Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water.
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah. He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
Some prospector, I guess.
Go away, Buck. Get out of the way.
John! John!
Oh, John.
John, darling.!
Claire, dearest...
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
All right, dear.
I thought I'd... lost you.
Try to rest, please.
He's feeling much better this morning.
He remembers everything, thank heaven.
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
He wants to see you, Jack.
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
Well, I'm keeping you.
Jack.
You know I love you, don't you?
You couldn't doubt that, could you?
Well, he needs me.
You have your law and...
I have mine.
Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can.
You need medical attention. Take the canoe.
It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on.
Will you come with us?
No, I'll stay here and work the mine.
When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found.
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that.
Would you, Buck?
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it tougher on everybody.
Oh, Jack, put your arms around me.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of rapids. After that it's clear sailing.
Good-bye, Thornton.
And God bless you.
Good-bye, Blake.
Good-bye, Jack.
Good-bye, Claire.
It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, Buck?
It's all right, boy. Go ahead.
Shorty?
- Yeah!
- Shorty!
- Hello, boss!
- Why, you old son of a gun.
You came just in time.
You saved my life.
Well, look at you.
You're all dressed up.
Yeah. We're in the money. I filed the claim.
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!
No trouble at all. I went right in and signed the names.
- Oh, and the claim was- - Shorty.
What's that?
That's our new cook.
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.
{3898}{3930}Who is it?
{3940}{4006}That we'll know better|when you've opened the door.
{4008}{4040}Me?
{4062}{4139}My mistake. After I've opened the door.
{4174}{4215}Open it, quick!
{4296}{4330}Why, Jeremy Pitt, isn't it?
{4332}{4423}It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded|at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river.
{4426}{4486}-The rash fool.|-He sent me for you. No time to lose.
{4488}{4562}Why, to be sure, I'll lose none,|nor my head either.
{4564}{4613}Come in and regain yours|while I get my things.
{4615}{4663}-I'll wait here.|-As you please.
{4664}{4715}Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress.
{4780}{4844}Jeremy, how was the battle?
{4846}{4896}Battle? Slaughter, rather!
{4898}{4947}What can clubs do against cannon?
{4948}{5063}In case this business keeps me overlong,|take care you water my geraniums...
{5064}{5113}especially those|under the bedroom window.
{5115}{5161}Geraniums. Won't you ever grow up?
{5163}{5230}One would think you were still|at medical school.
{5238}{5273}Geraniums!
{5275}{5319}You would think of geraniums...
{5320}{5382}when every other able-bodied man|is out fighting.
{5384}{5463}It's out of favor I seem to be with you,|my vinegary virgin.
{5470}{5531}-Half the town is saying you're a papist.|-Why?
{5532}{5616}Because I have the sense to sleep tonight|instead of rushing to my ruin...
{5618}{5680}in an attempt to put|this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?
{5682}{5725}He'd be even worse than King James.
{5727}{5783}Make haste with that cloak there,|my pretty one.
{5784}{5837}And the other half of the town|that defends you...
{5839}{5896}claims that you're just a coward.
{5913}{5983}Mrs. Barlow, my darling,|you can tell them, if you like...
{5984}{6051}that I've been most anywhere|that fighting was in evidence.
{6053}{6145}Fought for the French against the Spanish,|and the Spanish against the French...
{6147}{6211}and I learned my seamanship|in the Dutch Navy.
{6224}{6310}But having had adventure enough|in six years to last me six lives...
{6312}{6397}I came here, hung up the sword,|and picked up the lancet.
{6400}{6507}Became a man of peace and not of war.|A healer, not a slayer...
{6509}{6604}and that I am going to be as long as|I'm on top of the sod and not under it.
{6759}{6868}-Will you be back for breakfast?|-Who knows, my pretty one?
{7156}{7230}The worst is done, my friend.|Give your mind peace.
{7792}{7836}The King's men!
{7864}{7947}There's nothing to fear.|This is a Christian country.
{7948}{8019}Christian men don't make war|on the wounded...
{8020}{8062}or those who shelter them.
{8250}{8303}I'm Capt. Hobart of Col. Kirke's dragoons.
{8305}{8344}What rebels do you harbor?
{8346}{8422}No rebels. This wounded gentleman--
{8424}{8469}No need to ask|how he came by his wounds.
{8471}{8518}A rebel. Out with him.
{8596}{8655}This man can't be moved|without peril to his life.
{8692}{8740}Who the devil may you be?
{8757}{8798}Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.
{8800}{8839}Don't fling your French at me.
{8840}{8892}Latin, my dull friend.|It means I'm a doctor.
{8894}{8935}Or a liar.
{8936}{9030}If your wit were as big as your voice,|it's the great man you'd be for this.
{9032}{9097}You may find me great enough|to hang you!
{9118}{9164}Yes, I don't doubt it.
{9165}{9231}You've the looks and manners|of a hangman.
{9232}{9283}Take him away, and the others, too!
{10032}{10103}"ln the name of His Majesty,|Our Sovereign Lord...
{10104}{10191}"prisoners of the Crown,|you stand indicted...
{10192}{10243}"for having maliciously|and traitorously conspired...
{10244}{10334}"to change, alter, and wholly to subvert|the ancient government...
{10336}{10385}"of this Kingdom of England.
{10387}{10442}"Therefore, you are charged|with high treason...
{10444}{10504}"against the most illustrious|and most excellent...
{10506}{10578}"Prince James ll by the grace of God...
{10580}{10659}"of England, Scotland, France,|and lreland, King.
{10661}{10716}"Having no fear of God in your hearts...
{10718}{10778}"and being moved|and seduced by the devil...
{10780}{10855}"you have failed in the love|of due obedience toward the King...
{10856}{10932}"and have moved to disturb|the tranquility of the nation...
{10934}{11018}"and to stir up war to depose said king|from title...
{11020}{11095}"honor, and the regal name|of the imperial crown.
{11110}{11196}"Therefore, you are here to be tried|before His Majesty's Commissioner...
{11198}{11285}"the Lord Chief Justice,|Baron Jeffreys of Wem...
{11288}{11379}"and by a jury of 12 good men and true."
{11467}{11531}James Haynsworth, hold up your hand.
{11541}{11597}-Guilty or not guilty?|-Guilty.
{11599}{11686}-Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty?|-Guilty.
{11688}{11795}-Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty?|-Guilty.
{11798}{11904}-Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty?|-Guilty.
{11905}{12024}-John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty?|-Guilty.
{12027}{12123}Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty?
{12125}{12175}Guilty. Praise the Lord.
{12177}{12268}Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty?
{12285}{12309}Guilty.
{12311}{12430}-Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty?|-Guilty.
{12439}{12529}Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty?
{12531}{12587}It's entirely innocent, I am.
{12616}{12679}Take the stand and face His Lordship.
{12748}{12829}Are you guilty or not guilty?|You must use the right words.
{12832}{12922}Words, is it? Not guilty.
{12951}{13027}And speaking of words,|I'd like to say a few about the injustice...
{13028}{13098}of keeping an innocent man|locked up for three months...
{13100}{13210}in such filth and heat and ill-feeding|that my chief regret is I didn't try...
{13212}{13274}to pull down the filthy fellow|that sits on the throne.
{13276}{13307}Silence!
{13308}{13395}Are you entirely ignorant|of the proper procedure of the court?
{13397}{13444}Most happily ignorant up to now.
{13446}{13501}I could gladly have done|without this acquaintance.
{13503}{13547}Enough of this.
{13553}{13656}There is nothing more to be said,|except the passing of sentence.
{13659}{13731}May it please Your Lordship,|but there's a deal more to be said!
{13733}{13769}Silence!
{13771}{13860}-How now, fellow?|-There is the little matter of my defense.
{13862}{13915}Very well, then...
{13924}{13986}but in heaven's name, be brief, man.
{13997}{14039}We have much to do.
{14080}{14130}I am guilty of nothing, my lord...
{14135}{14205}unless it be adjudged a crime|that a man try to live peaceably.
{14207}{14272}Living peaceably|with the army of Monmouth?
{14275}{14327}I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord.
{14328}{14394}I was arrested while engaging|in my profession as physician.
{14396}{14483}What's this?|You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?
{14506}{14563}And as such was summoned|to the aid of Lord Gildoy...
{14564}{14640}by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify.
{14642}{14712}Master Pitt will testify.
{14714}{14772}He that is himself a confessed traitor.
{14782}{14859}-ls that your witness?|-There is also Andrew Baynes.
{14860}{14929}Master Baynes|will have enough testifying...
{14931}{15011}in a useless effort|to keep his own neck from the halter.
{15012}{15081}I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater,|the town where I live.
{15083}{15133}We've no time for all this.
{15159}{15213}If these other traitors|are as stubborn as you...
{15215}{15278}I may sit here till the next assizes.
{15301}{15335}Very well, then.
{15336}{15404}There's a witness I'll give you|that you can't deny:
{15406}{15443}yourself, sir.
{15445}{15537}For if I'm not physician,|how is it I know that you're a dying man?
{15667}{15748}The death to which you're dooming|hundreds of poor men daily...
{15750}{15848}in a frantic effort to send their souls|to perdition before your own...
{15850}{15896}is a light pleasantry...
{15897}{15951}compared to the bleeding death|in the lungs...
{15952}{16017}to which the great Judge|has condemned you.
{16020}{16116}Now, fellow,|we'll be done with the witnesses...
{16118}{16195}and I will convict you|out of your own rascally mouth.
{16233}{16319}When this Pitt came to summon you,|as you claim...
{16321}{16389}did you know you were called|to attend another rebel?
{16391}{16455}My business was with his wounds,|not his politics.
{16457}{16503}Did you know the law...
{16506}{16597}that any person who does|knowingly receive, harbor, comfort...
{16599}{16716}or succor a rebel|is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?
{16718}{16786}I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.
{16803}{16883}Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!
{16986}{17045}I thought it was to my fellow man.
{17204}{17294}It's a fearful thing|to send a man's soul to perdition...
{17328}{17374}but I am bound by my conscience...
{17376}{17455}and my love of my king to deal out justice.
{17611}{17694}Therefore, I instruct you,|gentlemen of the jury...
{17716}{17781}that inasmuch as Peter Blood|has admitted...
{17783}{17841}aiding a traitor to your king...
{17843}{17910}you do bring in a verdict of guilty...
{17912}{17964}that he may be hanged...
{17966}{18030}for the high treason he has committed.
{18176}{18247}What a creature must sit on the throne...
{18249}{18321}who lets a man like you|deal out his justice.
{18473}{18543}-Your Majesty.|-Sunderland, what brings you here?
{18544}{18590}These numerous hangings.
{18592}{18673}Splendid, aren't they?|We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.
{18675}{18714}Very true, Your Majesty...
{18716}{18771}but a foolish waste|of valuable human flesh.
{18773}{18798}How so?
{18808}{18915}Your Majesty's colonies in the West lndies|are urgently in need of slaves.
{18923}{19036}A healthy, vigorous man|can be reckoned worth from £10 to £20.
{19038}{19098}Splendid, Sunderland.
{19114}{19200}Send out word immediately that the King|is graciously pleased to command...
{19202}{19275}that all rebels convicted|but not yet hanged...
{19277}{19309}be gathered together...
{19311}{19396}and shipped by the first available boats|to the Americas.
{20018}{20086}Give us water!|There are men dying down here.
{20516}{20606}You'd think they'd take better care|of a valuable cargo like us.
{21052}{21148}Ahoy, the deck! Land sighted, Port Royal!
{21367}{21452}It's a truly royal clemency we're granted,|my friends...
{21463}{21530}one well worthy of King James.
{21566}{21677}He spares us the mercifully quick|extinction of the hangman's rope...
{21680}{21734}and gives the slow death of slavery.
{21752}{21849}He grants us our lives|in exchange for a living death.
{21936}{22011}It's an uncertain world entirely.
{22375}{22453}"Be it known, men, that these prisoners|who stand before you...
{22455}{22523}"are now to be sold at a right|and fitting price.
{22524}{22584}"They may be put to labor|in the sulfur mines...
{22585}{22643}"or on the plantations|for a period of 10 years.
{22644}{22691}"And the parties|to whom they are assigned...
{22692}{22749}"must enter into security|for the proper punishment...
{22751}{22775}"of their offense."
{22777}{22823}His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal.
{22824}{22897}Guards, attention! Present muskets.
{22906}{22986}Good day, Captain. Lovely day, isn't it?|Or is it?
{23016}{23079}-Good day, Dixon.|-Good day, Governor.
{23080}{23149}I suppose we can begin this sale now,|Governor.
{23151}{23197}No, better wait for Col. Bishop.
{23199}{23270}He has the privilege|of being late for everything.
{23272}{23314}Yes, I know.
{23316}{23349}There he is.
{23643}{23708}-Good afternoon, Col. Bishop.|-Good afternoon, Governor.
{23710}{23746}Good afternoon, Miss Arabella.
{23748}{23796}How is my darling, the Governor,|and his foot?
{23798}{23863}Every day I think my gout|can't get any worse...
{23864}{23913}and every day it does.
{23916}{23991}My dear Colonel,|according to the King's request...
{23992}{24083}it is for you to take first choice|of this dainty nosegay...
{24115}{24168}and at your own price.
{24179}{24224}Egad, they're an appalling lot...
{24226}{24278}not likely to be of much value|on the plantation.
{24280}{24321}The less you want, the more for Dixon.
{24323}{24393}-Dixon? Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all.|-Buy them all?
{24395}{24438}To keep them out of Dixon's hands.
{24440}{24511}I perceive somebody's been talking|behind my back...
{24513}{24548}telling the truth.
{24549}{24621}-And you can joke.|-Arabella dear, don't be childish.
{24623}{24678}These men are rebels against their king.
{24680}{24725}They should be hanged, drawn,|and quartered.
{24727}{24796}-Any fate they meet is too good for them.|-Your uncle is right.
{24798}{24858}-Let the sale commence.|-My foot!
{24860}{24954}My dear, the law is the law,|and it's His Majesty's law...
{24956}{24998}and must be obeyed.
{25036}{25079}The best of the lot.
{25121}{25156}Open your mouth.
{25247}{25282}-£20.|-Sold!
{25284}{25343}Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.
{25429}{25497}-As if he were buying horses.|-Yes, quite.
{25753}{25838}-Same price.|-This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot...
{25840}{25879}young and sturdy.
{25981}{26011}-Same price.|-Sold!
{26012}{26064}Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.
{26305}{26332}Quiet!
{26409}{26441}Open your mouth.
{26868}{26950}His pride has bought him a ticket|to Dixon's mines.
{26984}{27026}He isn't there yet.
{27065}{27146}-My dear, consider your social position!|-Uncle!
{27291}{27337}-Which one?|-That one.
{27341}{27415}-Him? I will not.|-But I want you to.
{27416}{27503}No. Let him cool his head|in Dixon's mines. I'll have none of him.
{27577}{27649}-£5.|-£5? That's an insulting sum to offer.
{27651}{27733}-Does anyone offer more?|-£6.
{27850}{27895}You're making an exhibition of yourself...
{27896}{27961}a girl like you,|bidding for a slave before these people.
{27963}{27996}-Will you buy him?|-Certainly not.
{28132}{28178}When a lady's interested in a man....
{28180}{28239}Calm down, Dixon,|£8 is nothing for such a man...
{28246}{28320}a skilled physician,|a gentleman, and a scholar.
{28335}{28414}-All right, £9.|-£10!
{28460}{28519}It's apparent Miss Bishop wants him|more than I do.
{28520}{28575}Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for £10.
{28651}{28678}Sold!
{28702}{28735}£10, sold.
{28769}{28819}What would you like done with him,|Miss Bishop?
{28821}{28885}Why, I don't know.
{28963}{29047}You're extremely foolish.|It might have cost you your life.
{29052}{29123}It was fortunate for you|that I was here to save you.
{29127}{29229}I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought|by anyone by the name of Bishop.
{29255}{29307}You could learn a lesson in gratitude.
{29309}{29360}I could thank for not interfering.
{29368}{29460}As it happens, you are hardly in a position|to have anything to say about it.
{29462}{29515}You may join the others belonging|to my uncle...
{29517}{29593}and henceforth you may take your orders|from him.
{29631}{29690}Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop.
{30241}{30283}Come on. Move on, there.
{31656}{31715}Last night, this dog attempted to escape.
{31732}{31788}Today you'll see what happens|to those who forget...
{31790}{31869}that my friend King James|did you all a favor...
{31871}{31938}in saving you from your just fate|on the gallows.
{31940}{31987}Show them the iron, Kent.
{32192}{32234}F-T.
{32266}{32338}Whoever wears that brand|is known as a fugitive traitor...
{32340}{32383}and will be treated as such.
{32395}{32447}Burn those letters in your brain...
{32458}{32515}Iest they be burned on your hides, too.
{32521}{32635}There speaks a fit friend for King James|if ever I heard one.
{32657}{32746}Would I had him and his friend James|roasting on a spit over that fire.
{32768}{32873}Great would be the burning thereof|and loud the rejoicing in Heaven.
{32906}{32941}Do your duty!
{33270}{33374}What a cruel shame|that any man is made to suffer so.
{33419}{33519}-This beastly gout!|-Perhaps a new dressing will help.
{33521}{33545}Perhaps.
{33547}{33588}-I have it here.|-Put it down.
{33590}{33622}So sorry, Doctor.
{33624}{33668}Easy, you clumsy louts!
{33670}{33754}-We won't hurt you, Governor.|-You thick-fingered jackasses!
{33764}{33810}His Excellency will have his little joke.
{33812}{33866}Ill-begotten bunglers!
{33868}{33928}-Blundering pill peddlers!|-Your Excellency--
{33944}{33991}That is the final straw.
{34056}{34119}Out of this house...
{34120}{34171}and never let me see your faces again.
{34172}{34231}-But think of our reputations.|-Hang your reputations!
{34232}{34292}Leave me! I don't want to see you again!
{34294}{34347}Away! Out!
{34348}{34405}I don't want to see you!|Out into the streets!
{34432}{34504}Stop shouting.|You brought on my headache again.
{34506}{34560}Good! Hannibal, come take my crutch.
{34566}{34635}Easy, now. Help me up with my foot.
{34636}{34679}No remedy. Why, thank you, dear.
{34817}{34873}Why doesn't His Excellency|try another doctor?
{34875}{34903}Another doctor?
{34905}{34963}There are only those two|on this wretched island...
{34964}{35030}-and each one is worse than his partner.|-There is another.
{35032}{35112}And according to what I've heard,|he became a slave by being a doctor.
{35114}{35147}A slave?
{35149}{35238}Would you elevate a slave|to the position of doctor to the Governor?
{35266}{35330}-ls he a good doctor?|-I don't know.
{35447}{35483}Why are you laughing?
{35492}{35563}I'm just thinking how annoyed|Peter Blood would be...
{35564}{35611}if I did him another favor.
{35680}{35761}Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens|of this sovereign island...
{35763}{35809}who come before you with complaints.
{35811}{35858}Complaints, complaints.
{35868}{35951}Can none of my citizens|follow the example of their governor...
{35956}{36035}who endures the utmost agony|without a murmur?
{36074}{36138}-Easy there, fellow.|-Did I hurt you, sir?
{36140}{36203}No, but I thought you were going to.
{36223}{36297}Your Excellency,|this vagrant hides his sins...
{36299}{36349}behind the name of Honesty Nuttall.
{36351}{36445}-He's charged with being in debt.|-State your case, fellow, and no lies.
{36447}{36503}I was on the way to pay the butcher|on Tuesday...
{36504}{36594}as Honesty Nuttall is my name,|when I chanced on a poor old beggar.
{36596}{36631}It was Jones from the grog shop...
{36633}{36683}who begged me to have a drink with him.
{36684}{36732}Try standing on it, Your Honor.
{36751}{36830}Stand on that bundle of pain? Impossible.
{36836}{36923}I remembered in time my poor|starving wife in need of the five bob.
{36925}{37015}What is this all about? Silence!
{37023}{37083}-Sit down.|-What's he here for?
{37085}{37143}For debt, Your Excellency,|and the prevaricator--
{37144}{37231}If it's for debt,|don't annoy me with such petty things.
{37232}{37278}Order him to work it off.
{37280}{37355}Work? Not that, anything but work.
{37357}{37388}What's your trade?
{37390}{37469}I'm a ship's carpenter|when the painful necessity arises.
{37474}{37506}Take him to work on the docks...
{37508}{37576}and don't you attempt to escape|till every farthing's paid...
{37578}{37626}or I'll stretch your hide on the rack!
{37628}{37685}Escape? How could a debtor escape|from this island...
{37687}{37743}even if he had a boat to do it with?
{37745}{37816}I couldn't escape any more|than a slave could escape.
{37862}{37917}I can walk.
{37924}{37965}Wonderful, my dear fellow.
{37967}{38038}Only two months' treatment,|and I'm a well man.
{38040}{38077}It's a miracle.
{38083}{38170}-The next complaint--|-Drat the next complaint. I can walk.
{38172}{38208}Come, Doctor.
{38210}{38286}You'll get your reward for this,|Peter Blood.
{38288}{38379}-From now on, you're my physician.|-Your Excellency is too kind.
{38380}{38456}Come back early tomorrow.|You're always welcome, Dr. Blood.
{38996}{39019}Hello.
{39332}{39369}Don't I know you?
{39386}{39439}A lady should know her own property.
{39451}{39529}-My property?|-Let me refresh your memory.
{39534}{39613}My name is Peter Blood,|and I'm worth precisely £10.
{39644}{39721}Forgive me for not recognizing you,|Dr. Blood.
{39723}{39765}You're so changed...
{39778}{39806}for the better.
{39832}{39886}The Governor tells me|I have you to thank for that.
{39888}{39942}You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.
{39944}{40044}Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life|when my friends are treated like animals?
{40046}{40131}It's they deserve your favors, not l.|They're all honest rebels.
{40133}{40207}I was snoring in my bed|while they were trying to free England...
{40208}{40247}from an unclean tyrant.
{40251}{40304}I believe you're talking treason.
{40310}{40355}I hope I'm not obscure.
{40356}{40408}-You could be flogged for that.|-No.
{40428}{40497}The Governor would never allow it.|He has the gout.
{40501}{40538}You depend upon that?
{40542}{40639}I intend to, for all it's worth,|and that promises to be considerable.
{40697}{40787}But you'd hardly know about that.|You've probably never had the gout.
{40867}{40930}-Good afternoon, Miss Bishop.|-Good afternoon.
{41673}{41780}15-2, 15-4, and a pair are six.
{41796}{41847}-Another?|-What else is there to do...
{41848}{41927}ever since you ruined the Governor's foot|and our reputations with it?
{41928}{42016}-I ruined the Governor's foot?|-I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are--
{42018}{42059}-Someone coming.|-A patient?
{42061}{42090}A patient!
{42169}{42239}-I beg your pardon, Doctor. I'm so sorry.|-It's all right.
{42350}{42383}Come in.
{42400}{42469}Good afternoon, colleagues. Dr. Bronson.
{42524}{42591}-Dr. Whacker.|-Good afternoon.
{42618}{42650}How's business, my friends?
{42652}{42676}-Terrible.|-Good.
{42678}{42737}-Terribly good.|-That relieves me.
{42741}{42798}I had heard that things|were not altogether....
{42813}{42860}Idle gossip, obviously.
{42878}{42920}You intend to remain here?
{42937}{43015}Remain here? Why not?
{43058}{43093}It's queer.
{43097}{43187}There are you, free to come and go as|you please, and you choose to stay here.
{43189}{43296}While l, who hate this pestilential island....|Such are the quirks of circumstance.
{43316}{43375}I must be running along, gentlemen.
{43390}{43433}Good day, gentlemen.
{43482}{43571}It's pleasant to see|everything so prosperous with you here.
{43598}{43643}-Not so hasty.|-Just a moment.
{43644}{43711}There's something I'd like to ask you.
{43715}{43751}Well, gentlemen?
{43754}{43817}Have you been thinking of leaving us,|Doctor?
{43822}{43903}Leaving? Now, Doctor.
{43911}{43957}How could a slave think of leaving?
{43959}{44066}Or even if he were fool enough to try,|by what means could he hope to escape?
{44072}{44151}And where, for example,|could he raise the few pounds necessary...
{44152}{44216}to purchase even a small boat?
{44218}{44291}-We might supply it.|-You?
{44307}{44395}-Now, gentlemen.|-Now, let's talk this thing over.
{44408}{44477}Now, if you'll just sit down here.
{44480}{44547}Now then, how much will you need?
{44560}{44639}£20 might buy a small wherry,|£10 more might equip it.
{44640}{44676}He's right.
{44679}{44745}-He means--|-You needn't tell me what he means.
{44747}{44821}I know two Christian gentlemen|when I see them.
{44832}{44932}Two men whose hearts are bleeding|for a brother doctor in distress.
{44980}{45055}But it's too much to ask,|too noble a gesture to hope for.
{45056}{45117}No, my good man, not at all.
{45120}{45159}But who would buy the boat?
{45160}{45244}We would not dare,|and you, a slave, you could not.
{45247}{45270}True.
{45279}{45383}That would be my part. To find someone.|A man as eager to escape as l.
{45396}{45479}-A man held here for debt, say.|-Then it's a bargain?
{45504}{45597}Gentlemen,|you've opened for me the gates of hope.
{45648}{45671}Doctor.
{45795}{45849}-My dear colleague.|-Gentlemen.
{45973}{46002}Now we have him.
{46004}{46076}We've only to get him involved|and reveal his plan.
{46078}{46156}He'll steal very little of our business|when he's in irons.
{46192}{46225}Gentlemen.
{46275}{46351}There's one thing slipped|my mind entirely.
{46372}{46468}Simple-minded men might think this|an opportunity for trickery...
{46474}{46568}but brilliant men like yourselves|will remember in what favor I stand...
{46570}{46641}with the Governor|in contrast to some others...
{46643}{46722}and how little their words|would weigh against mine.
{46724}{46798}Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot!
{46800}{46839}Good day, gentlemen.
{47625}{47675}-Are you all with me?|-Yes.
{47677}{47703}Listen.
{47704}{47781}There's a man named Nuttall|who's in trouble with the Governor.
{47783}{47845}He's looking for a small boat|which he'll purchase...
{47847}{47882}on the night chosen for our escape.
{47884}{47921}-Escape?|-Quiet!
{47972}{48062}While he gathers stores and equipment,|we must be ready on the inside.
{48067}{48157}We might steal some sugarcane knives|and hack through the stockade walls.
{48159}{48194}Or dig our way under.
{48196}{48291}Once at sea, if we get there,|our troubles will have just begun.
{48293}{48342}If any of you want to withdraw,|now's the time.
{48344}{48379}-No.|-Not me.
{48392}{48474}You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match|your hearts against any other.
{48476}{48551}We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt.|He was a ship's pilot.
{48553}{48648}Here's one you won't have to teach.|Six years in King James' Navy.
{48650}{48749}-What?|-That's nothing. I was a blooming gunner.
{48752}{48811}-A gunner?|-ln the King's Navy, too.
{48813}{48863}I was always ashamed of it up to now.
{48871}{48910}We'll have a crew yet!
{48912}{48983}Any of you others|been keeping such secrets?
{49008}{49046}Where's Baynes?
{49063}{49143}-Where is he?|-He tried to escape today.
{49148}{49199}No! Caught?
{49236}{49283}-Branded?|-Yeah.
{49604}{49640}No!
{49743}{49791}Why did you do it, Andy?
{49796}{49854}I told you I'd try to get you out.
{49856}{49934}I couldn't stand it any longer.|I couldn't stand it.
{49936}{50025}I was going mad.|What do you think a man is made of?
{50027}{50079}How much do you think he can stand?
{50251}{50355}"Watchman, what of the night?"|lsaiah 21 :1 1.
{50861}{50918}Don't make the purchase|until well on in the evening.
{50920}{50957}That way there'll be less risk...
{50959}{51010}of anyone wondering where you came by|the money.
{51012}{51094}Lumme, Captain.|It ain't too late for us to change our minds.
{51096}{51156}Stow the provisions away on board|as soon as it's dark.
{51158}{51225}Then all you've got to do is sit down here|and wait for us.
{51227}{51289}Is that all?|Wait all alone in the blooming dark...
{51291}{51352}waiting for someone to come along|and nab me.
{51359}{51438}Nuttall, my lad,|there's just one other little thing.
{51440}{51549}Could you find me a good piece of timber|about so thick and so long?
{51554}{51580}Yes, I think so.
{51582}{51647}Then do so and lash it to your spine.|It needs stiffening.
{51648}{51695}Courage. I'll join you at midnight.
{52024}{52074}How long does it take to feed|this pack of dogs?
{52076}{52157}It's a wonder we make a profit at all.|You don't drive them hard enough.
{52159}{52203}Get them out of here!
{52496}{52578}I've just been with Nuttall at the boat.|It's tonight.
{52583}{52657}-At last!|-For heaven's sake, command yourself.
{52684}{52748}-Tonight, Hagthorpe.|-Caution above everything.
{52750}{52810}He who goes slowly, goes safely.
{52855}{52935}Remember, Jeremy,|you're the only navigator among us.
{52937}{52992}Without you, there's no escape.
{53097}{53134}Hello, Uncle!
{53136}{53225}Riding again? What do you plan to see|riding always the same road?
{53227}{53319}You'd be surprised what interesting things|there are to see on this island...
{53321}{53358}if you only keep your eyes open.
{53360}{53462}Today, for instance, I saw something|that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know.
{53515}{53593}Stores and equipment|are all stowed away onboard.
{53650}{53703}We could use more food,|but there's no money left.
{53704}{53791}I'm not taking any chances|by asking our medical friends for more.
{53800}{53859}I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat|by midnight.
{53883}{53954}Jeremy, we must not fail tonight.
{53956}{54032}What the devil have you been up to?
{54034}{54110}Tonight will be a fine night,|judging by the sky.
{54125}{54217}There you are, Pitt. Keep it covered up|and it should heal in a day or so.
{54288}{54339}Miss Bishop. You looking for me, sir?
{54340}{54395}Yes. You, stop!
{54440}{54506}What's the matter? Why are you shaking?
{54524}{54572}Nothing. I....
{54654}{54710}What's going on between you two?
{54732}{54793}Why, nothing. The man has a bad leg.
{54881}{54942}I'll tend to you later.|Where have you been?
{54958}{55008}I've been at my work,|attending to the Governor.
{55010}{55040}You lie.
{55048}{55073}Do l?
{55075}{55119}The Governor's had another attack of gout.
{55120}{55206}He's been screaming for you|like a wounded horse all the afternoon.
{55208}{55256}Then it appears|I was not with the Governor.
{55258}{55302}Then where have you been?
{55304}{55379}-Why, I've been at....|-He was with me, Uncle.
{55381}{55405}What?
{55407}{55499}Thank you for protecting my reputation,|Dr. Blood, but it was a useless gallantry.
{55501}{55567}My uncle knows that I spend my time|with whomever I please.
{55568}{55638}You might choose your company|with better taste.
{55640}{55715}His Excellency's waiting for you!|Here, Kent, lend him your horse.
{55716}{55743}Yes, sir.
{55756}{55822}Otherwise, the lout will be all night|getting there.
{55824}{55867}Will I be required there long, sir?
{55868}{55941}You're afraid your work will interfere|with your social affairs?
{55943}{56035}If I get back late, before midnight,|could I get back into the stockade?
{56037}{56111}Will you stay here talking all night?|Be off with you!
{56270}{56318}Take him to the stockade!
{56328}{56371}Go on, get along in there.
{56559}{56599}If he talks, we're lost.
{56902}{56930}Well?
{56968}{57035}It seems that you're continually|doing me favors.
{57036}{57087}-I don't know why.|-Neither do l.
{57089}{57116}Yes, I do.
{57118}{57199}It's because you're so very grateful|and always thank me so prettily.
{57207}{57279}Sure now, you don't blame me|for resenting you and your favors.
{57281}{57374}This is interesting. I've had men tell me|they had reasons for admiring me...
{57376}{57440}and some have even laid claims|to reasons for loving me...
{57442}{57548}but for a man to store up reasons|for resenting me, how refreshing.
{57560}{57598}You must tell me a few of them.
{57600}{57659}The first is reason enough.|You bought me.
{57684}{57789}I've had no lack of experiences in my time,|but to be bought and sold was a new one.
{57791}{57841}I was in no mood to thank my purchaser.
{57843}{57907}That I can understand. Go on.
{57917}{57966}I've resented you because your name|is Bishop.
{57968}{58029}My thoughts have lumped you|with your uncle.
{58044}{58105}How was I to know|that a devil could have....
{58120}{58186}That a devil could have an angel|for a niece?
{58208}{58282}From a resentful man,|that is a pretty fair compliment.
{58304}{58380}Have you any more reasons|for resenting me like that one?
{58385}{58438}Indeed, I have. And the strongest of all...
{58455}{58555}I've resented you|because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.
{58564}{58603}Do you understand that?
{58679}{58714}I don't know.
{58725}{58788}Perhaps if you were to explain further, l....
{58825}{58871}I've already talked too much.
{58928}{58967}I'll open your mouth!
{59152}{59225}You'll stay here|without food or water until you talk.
{59332}{59408}-Why did you lie to your uncle?|-Because....
{59442}{59505}Dr. Blood,|you're a physician and should know.
{59512}{59604}Is it not considered unhealthy|for a slave to be seen at a boat?
{59627}{59701}-Why should it be?|-Boats put out to sea.
{59706}{59744}Slaves may not.
{59785}{59836}You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?
{59838}{59866}Am l?
{59877}{59938}The Governor will be waiting for you.
{59963}{59987}Yes.
{60019}{60100}Miss Bishop,|it's difficult for an lrishman to apologize.
{60105}{60180}But I hope you can forgive me|for having thought badly of you.
{60182}{60242}I will, if you tell me|how you think of me now.
{60244}{60324}How I think of you now? I think of you....
{60360}{60453}I think of you as the woman who owns me.|Her slave.
{60484}{60559}But I think the man is lucky|who can count you his friend.
{60560}{60606}I think you know you can.
{60819}{60885}Your slave is grateful|for all marks of favor.
{60887}{60939}When you forget your slavery|and go so far--
{60940}{60975}Now there, you're mistaken.
{60977}{61042}However far this slave may go,|he won't forget.
{61084}{61161}It's a characteristic we lrish|have in common with the elephants.
{62468}{62521}Hello. Where are you going?
{62536}{62610}You're so much improved,|I was returning to the stockade.
{62612}{62685}Don't leave me tonight. I'm a sick man.
{62708}{62761}I assure you, sir,|there's nothing more I can do.
{62763}{62803}There must be something.
{62816}{62868}Perhaps you ought to bleed me again.
{62932}{62980}Very well, then, if you wish it.
{63054}{63109}But mind, no more softness about this.
{63116}{63204}I'm gonna have you well by midnight|if I have to bleed you to death.
{63564}{63611}-Who goes there?|-Peter Blood.
{63913}{63979}-Jeremy, what's happened?|-Water.
{64093}{64126}Easy, lad.
{64277}{64328}I didn't tell him. I didn't.
{64344}{64435}-Tell him what, Jeremy?|-About our plans.
{64483}{64519}My back.
{64608}{64649}Help me.
{64704}{64756}-Who did this?|-Bishop.
{64777}{64836}Bishop. Swine!
{64838}{64894}I didn't tell him. I didn't.
{65140}{65232}-ls our boat still standing in at the bay?|-Yes, Jeremy.
{65252}{65310}I wondered if I was still out of my mind.
{65343}{65434}I've been seeing boats sailing in and out...
{65452}{65553}in and out, but ours will never sail.
{65577}{65607}Not now.
{65624}{65699}Or if it does, you'll sail without me.
{65725}{65817}What?|And get lost at sea without our navigator?
{65819}{65910}-Nonsense, lad.|-We are not going this time.
{65928}{65972}It's hopeless for all of us.
{66028}{66068}We'll manage somehow.
{66277}{66334}-What are you doing here?|-Doing?
{66358}{66394}Why, the duties of my office.
{66396}{66459}I said he was to have|no food nor drink till I ordered.
{66460}{66514}Sure now, I never heard you.
{66516}{66554}How could you? You weren't here.
{66556}{66624}Then how do you expect me|to know what orders you've given?
{66687}{66770}In the name of humanity!|If you know the word.
{66777}{66848}-You dare take that tone with me?|-Yes, I do!
{66888}{66935}I've been too soft with you...
{66949}{66991}but that shall be mended.
{66998}{67031}Kent, tie him up!
{67126}{67193}Had it easy here up to now. Get up there.
{67486}{67530}Now I'll take this rod to you...
{67532}{67606}until there's not an inch of hide left|on your dirty carcass.
{67612}{67642}Another beating?
{67644}{67722}This will be a good half-dozen of them|you've given me in promise.
{67724}{67779}This will be as real as it is overdue.
{67792}{67871}And what becomes of His Excellency|the Governor's gouty foot?
{67872}{67970}You'll not save yourself with that device|this time. Nothing will save you.
{68087}{68145}Pirates! Spanish pirates!
{68258}{68318}This is what I call a timely interruption.
{68333}{68404}Though what will come of it,|the devil himself only knows.
{71967}{72038}We've got to get through the town|to get to the boat.
{72044}{72080}Wait here, lads.
{73296}{73327}It's me. Mr. Nuttall.
{73328}{73376}You came close to being|the ex-Mr. Nuttall.
{73377}{73436}Wouldn't be the first death I died today.
{73455}{73517}We can't stay here waiting for them|to catch sight of us.
{73519}{73556}Let's get to the boat down this way.
{74152}{74203}Sunk to the bottom of the briny.
{74215}{74274}And it sunk our hopes with it.
{74312}{74373}-Perhaps not.|-What do you mean, Peter?
{74420}{74507}-He's gonna take a bath?|-Yes, but not for cleanliness.
{74516}{74593}Since the Spaniards have been|thoughtless enough to sink our craft...
{74595}{74671}I'll see if I can't persuade them|to lend us one of theirs.
{77608}{77714}Your Excellency,|facts are so often dull and deplorable.
{77723}{77780}Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you...
{77782}{77880}it is my painful duty to inform you|that 250 of my men...
{77882}{77963}are now complete masters|of the town of Port Royal.
{77972}{78042}Your most worthy islanders|have been disarmed...
{78049}{78118}and your city is now|absolutely in the hands...
{78120}{78208}of the forces of His Majesty|King Philip of Spain.
{78220}{78291}Now that you have our city,|what do you want with it?
{78296}{78369}For a price,|I could forebear reducing it to ashes.
{78389}{78486}-What price?|-200,000 pieces of eight.
{78518}{78578}200,000 pieces of eight?
{79958}{80018}That's why we waited till this morning|to put to sea.
{80020}{80108}We've a message for those Spaniards.|They are on their way now to receive it.
{80110}{80173}-Hagthorpe, man the guns!|-Clear deck!
{80348}{80427}-All ready, Hagthorpe?|-Aye, Peter, ready.
{80428}{80490}Give them a taste of their own iron!
{81537}{81586}You've done it, Hagthorpe!
{81600}{81633}Hurrah!
{81738}{81779}Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir?
{81781}{81848}You did that,|you son of a Yorkshire steer...
{81850}{81919}and bless your rusty heart,|it's a gunner you are!
{82005}{82042}It's the Governor.
{82098}{82169}It must be that some brave party|of citizens captured the ship.
{82171}{82207}I think you're right.
{82426}{82488}Someone should go aboard|and congratulate them.
{82490}{82543}Yes. My foot.
{82548}{82634}Since your gout so unhappily|prevents you, allow me to be the one.
{82636}{82707}Go ahead. You've always wanted|to be governor anyway.
{82719}{82746}Don't be nervous.
{82748}{82791}-Man those sweeps.|-Aye, sir.
{82927}{82995}-Shall we hoist anchor, Peter?|-Aye. Get under way.
{83036}{83086}There's another boat approaching.
{83242}{83295}It looks like Col. Bishop.
{83309}{83346}-Who?|-Bishop.
{83348}{83404}The fool would come blundering|in just now.
{83406}{83496}-I'll make short work of him.|-No, Hagthorpe, none of that.
{84048}{84120}But.... Who....
{84457}{84532}Welcome aboard the Cinco Lagos,|Colonel darling.
{84547}{84582}You? Was it....
{84597}{84708}Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took|this ship and turned defeat into victory?
{84710}{84808}Myself it was. Myself and these,|my friends. And your friends.
{84865}{84914}And you saved my money, too!
{85067}{85144}-Yes, it was heroic.|-Heroic, is it?
{85146}{85193}It was epic.
{85203}{85230}You amaze me.
{85231}{85305}On my soul, you deserve well.|You all deserve well.
{85309}{85381}-You shall find me grateful.|-How grateful?
{85394}{85487}I shall ask His Excellency to write home|to the King an account of your exploit.
{85488}{85544}Perhaps some of your sentencing|shall be remitted.
{85546}{85599}That's just about|what we expected from you.
{85600}{85675}Now, Wolf, Col. Bishop has a kind heart.
{85681}{85731}-But what kind, I'd hate to say.|-What is this?
{85733}{85827}Why, Colonel darling,|such unusual generosity from you...
{85828}{85880}must be making you feel unwell.
{85883}{85965}-As your physician, I'd prescribe--|-A bit of neck-stretching.
{86098}{86170}Lads, we shouldn't hang this man.
{86171}{86215}-No?|-No.
{86455}{86488}Tie him over the end of a gun!
{86490}{86549}I'll scatter his innards|all over the sugarcane field.
{86551}{86604}You're wasting words, I say. Hang him!
{86763}{86868}Wait, lads. Hanging's too dignified for him.
{86873}{86910}Can you swim, Colonel darling?
{86912}{87001}We're giving you the chance to cool off|some of that excessive heat of yours.
{87003}{87054}Over the side with him, men!
{87250}{87334}One, two...
{87349}{87385}three!
{87552}{87609}Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this...
{87611}{87674}if I spend the rest of my life doing it!
{87682}{87779}And then the whale came,|and the whale swallowed Jonah. I hope.
{87807}{87863}Goodbye, Jonah. Don't forget to write.
{87973}{88019}What's the next move, Peter?
{88023}{88103}Up anchor! Wolf, man the capstan bar.
{88108}{88237}Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft.|Thomas, get those men over here.
{88371}{88461}Round you go, men!|That's no water wheel you're working.
{88663}{88713}-Can you handle it, Jeremy?|-Aye, aye, Peter.
{88715}{88759}We sail. Hard to starboard.
{88804}{88915}Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft!|There's no chains to hold you now!
{88985}{89019}Break out those sails...
{89020}{89105}and watch them fill with the wind|that's carrying us all to freedom.
{90452}{90490}We, the undersigned...
{90556}{90600}are men without a country...
{90636}{90715}outlaws in our own land,|and homeless outcasts in any other.
{90738}{90805}Desperate men,|we go to seek a desperate fortune.
{90927}{90991}Therefore, we do here and now|band ourselves...
{90992}{91037}into a brotherhood of buccaneers...
{91047}{91114}to practice the trade of piracy|on the high seas.
{91121}{91187}We, the hunted, will now hunt!
{91239}{91313}To that end, we enter into|the following articles of agreement.
{91315}{91341}First...
{91402}{91476}we pledge ourselves|to be bound together as brothers...
{91490}{91540}in a life-and-death friendship...
{91554}{91615}sharing alike in fortune and in trouble.
{91677}{91708}Second article.
{91744}{91826}All moneys and valuables|which may come into our possession...
{91839}{91902}shall be lumped together|into a common fund...
{91914}{91972}and from this fund|shall first be taken the money...
{91974}{92026}to fit, rig, and provision the ship.
{92069}{92157}After that, the recompense each|will receive who is wounded as follows:
{92189}{92280}For the loss of a right arm,|600 pieces of eight.
{92305}{92362}Left arm, 500.
{92381}{92447}For the loss of a right leg, 500.
{92457}{92513}Left leg, 400.
{92528}{92577}A fellow can get rich if he's lucky.
{92580}{92610}Greedy.
{92654}{92705}If a man conceal any treasure captured...
{92707}{92789}or fail to place it in the general fund,|he shall be marooned.
{92804}{92844}Set ashore on a deserted isle...
{92846}{92913}and there left with a bottle of water,|a loaf of bread...
{92919}{92963}and a pistol with one load.
{92990}{93069}If a man shall be drunk on duty,|he shall receive the same fate.
{93103}{93182}And if a man shall molest|a woman captive against her will...
{93192}{93257}he, too,|shall receive the same punishment.
{93299}{93410}These articles entered into,|this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.
{93497}{93555}Now, men, you've heard the agreement.
{93565}{93638}It's the world against us|and us against the world.
{93650}{93755}"His hand will be against every man,|and every man's hand against him."
{93763}{93819}Genesis 16:12.
{93843}{93954}Those of you in favor of these articles,|raise your right hands and say aye!
{93966}{93997}Aye!
{95581}{95623}Blood!
{95639}{95717}This impertinent,|ungoverned rascal must be eradicated.
{95725}{95756}Yes, Your Majesty.
{95758}{95827}Sinking Spanish ships|causes me enough embarrassment...
{95829}{95902}-but he sinks English ships as well.|-Yes, Your Majesty.
{95904}{95947}Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it?
{95949}{96014}He does his best,|but conditions on the island--
{96015}{96110}Silence, Willoughby! I'm not interested|in anything you have to say.
{96129}{96180}I know your feelings towards me.
{96222}{96310}Sunderland, what are you Secretary|of State for? Have you no solution?
{96311}{96398}-Yes, Your Majesty.|-Get your head off that hinge. Speak up.
{96399}{96491}Since Gov. Steed is incapable,|you should appoint a stronger man.
{96494}{96520}Who?
{96522}{96595}Col. Bishop assures me|that if he were in power...
{96599}{96642}he would not rest day or night...
{96643}{96737}until this Capt. Blood|was swinging on execution dock.
{96747}{96795}Angling for the office, is he?
{96799}{96877}What difference|if he's the iron man we need?
{96923}{96964}Draw up the appointment.
{96979}{97055}I've already taken the liberty of doing so,|Your Majesty.
{97545}{97618}Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed,|I wish you both a pleasant journey.
{97619}{97716}I thank you, Governor.|Again, congratulations, Gov. Bishop.
{97725}{97814}-May your term of office be successful.|-Thank you, my friend.
{97819}{97875}Arabella dear,|have a nice holiday in England.
{97876}{97908}I'm sure I shall.
{97910}{97934}-Captain.|-Yes, sir.
{97935}{97995}-Keep a weather eye open for pirates.|-Very well, sir.
{97996}{98080}Before you return, Arabella,|I shall have the sea swept clean of them.
{98082}{98154}Particularly one.|I think you know whom I mean.
{98241}{98320}I hope he gets the gout|the infernal office gave me.
{98330}{98408}Come along. Goodbye.
{98622}{98693}Thomas Fulton. One share, no injuries.
{98726}{98831}James Graham. One share,|plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound.
{98855}{98953}Zachary Stevens.|For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo...
{98955}{99007}one share, plus £10 of silver.
{99065}{99183}Oliver Clark. One share, plus 400 pieces|of eight for the loss of his left leg.
{99184}{99231}There you are, Oliver, I'm proud of you.
{99236}{99349}Lord Chester Dyke.|No injury, one share and £5 of silver.
{99359}{99398}Anton Brazilimo.
{99452}{99482}Andrew Fell.
{99507}{99594}One share, plus 500 pieces of eight|for the loss of his left arm.
{99605}{99658}There you are, Andrew, and good luck.
{99669}{99738}David Sampson. One share, no injuries.
{99809}{99909}Honesty Nuttall. No injuries, one share.
{99947}{99979}Hold on, Captain.
{99981}{100066}How about me little toe,|heroically sacrificed in battle?
{100067}{100162}Honesty Nuttall. One share, and nothing|for the toe he just shot off himself.
{100245}{100281}You stupid numskull.
{100283}{100378}You should have shot out your brains|and left your toe for thinking with.
{100621}{100662}Ahoy, the deck!
{100670}{100734}An English ship on the port bow!
{101016}{101047}So it is.
{101050}{101134}A fine big ship, too,|as far as I can judge from this distance.
{101151}{101197}Shall we sail over|and give them a surprise?
{101199}{101223}No, Peter.
{101225}{101270}The men are set on putting in at Tortuga.
{101271}{101319}Their gold's burning holes in their pockets.
{101320}{101377}What's one ship more or less to us now?
{101382}{101439}It appears I have a mutiny on my hands.
{101797}{101890}What ho, the deck! A ship to starboard!
{101971}{102013}It may be a pirate!
{102306}{102401}Very well, then.|Sail on, little ship, back to England...
{102431}{102472}where we may never go.
{102504}{102582}You'll never know|how close you came to not getting there.
{104307}{104354}Your turn, mon capitaine.
{104355}{104379}Up!
{104444}{104482}It's your turn now.
{104593}{104631}Again, my captain.
{104669}{104704}-Are you ready?|-Right.
{104730}{104766}It's good.
{104771}{104813}This time, my friend, huh?
{104883}{104928}-You missed.|-No.
{104938}{105007}I am defeated.|You win the prize, Capt. Blood.
{105015}{105071}-Goodbye, my dear.|-Goodbye.
{105106}{105146}What a charming captain.
{105163}{105209}Some other time, perhaps.
{105211}{105246}Why?
{105247}{105298}What sort of a man are you?
{105310}{105396}I'm the sort of man you like, my dear.|A man with money.
{105435}{105467}The money!
{105757}{105831}Mon capitaine,|what a pair we would make.
{105833}{105922}In all the Caribbean,|there is no buccaneer so strong as me.
{105925}{105951}Except you.
{105954}{106005}You almost flatter me, Levasseur.
{106007}{106098}Why do you hold off your consent so long?|We become partners.
{106099}{106161}You've been in Tortuga|these three, four months.
{106165}{106227}You must be even so much|in need of gold as l.
{106249}{106307}Such a partnership requires sober thought.
{106309}{106387}My poor head has been dancing with rum|this whole week past.
{106393}{106466}Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest|this side the Caribbean.
{106468}{106551}With your brain and my strength,|there is nothing we cannot do.
{106574}{106637}There's very little I can't do all by myself.
{106878}{106926}Long Iive Capt. Levasseur!
{106956}{107013}And here's to Capt. Blood!
{107015}{107038}Hurrah!
{107222}{107299}Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend.
{107306}{107363}-You're next, Peter.|-Mon capitaine.
{107398}{107474}It's clearly understood, then,|that we sail under my articles.
{107475}{107540}Those very severe articles of yours?
{107542}{107609}Mais oui, I sail under the articles|of a girls' séminaire...
{107611}{107685}to have you as my partner, mon capitaine.
{107820}{107883}Women will be the death of you yet,|Levasseur.
{107904}{107987}It is a very pleasant way to die,|even if it is expensive.
{108027}{108095}What is the first order,|mon capitaine partner?
{108100}{108166}We sail on the tide.|Outside the harbor, we'll scatter.
{108168}{108266}Each ship will proceed singly to pick up|any stray ships we'll find on the journey.
{108268}{108317}We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra.
{108319}{108348}Magnifique!
{108350}{108415}I give you the toast. To our great success!
{108417}{108494}Let me give one.|To the greatest captain on the Caribbean!
{108496}{108576}-Oui!To Capitaine Levasseur!|-Capt. Blood.
{108587}{108624}Bravo!
{108626}{108703}The articles aside,|let's give a toast to Capt. Blood.
{108739}{108775}Capitaine Levasseur.
{108777}{108831}To the greatest captain on the coast.
{108951}{109010}The greatest captain on the coast, is it?
{109050}{109125}Methinks the greatest captain|on the coast...
{109135}{109177}has just made the greatest mistake...
{109179}{109242}the most ordinary common fool|could make.
{109614}{109707}It's been so lovely. I'd like to stay forever.|You've all been so kind.
{109721}{109770}Come again and visit us soon, dear.
{109783}{109854}England is so much more beautiful|when you're here.
{109859}{109919}-Thank you. Goodbye.|-Goodbye.
{109931}{110006}-Thank you for everything.|-Goodbye, dear.
{110008}{110059}-Goodbye, Amelia.|-Goodbye, Mary.
{110424}{110526}However else the court may have changed,|the art of flattery still flourishes.
{110527}{110566}Stab me if it's flattery.
{110568}{110665}When the King ordered me on this journey|as a special emissary to the West lndies...
{110667}{110743}I looked forward with some trepidation|to a life among the savages.
{110745}{110803}But when I found|you were one of those savages...
{110804}{110899}returning to your native heath,|my grateful eyes could hardly believe it.
{110958}{111030}You pictured us running around|in animal skins, eating raw meat?
{111032}{111097}Why not, in a country filled|with lndians and pirates?
{111099}{111214}Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen|to hear of a wild rogue named Blood?
{111219}{111253}-Peter Blood?|-Yes.
{111283}{111334}No. I don't know him.
{111348}{111408}I hardly number pirates|among my acquaintances.
{111410}{111479}Of course not. Stupid of me.|I merely mention him in passing.
{111480}{111536}Because he's one of the objects|of my mission.
{111538}{111562}-Your mission?|-Yes.
{111564}{111640}I've been sent to try to blot out|all this piracy, my dear.
{111642}{111730}And in a manner|I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood.
{111810}{111870}Ship on the port side, sir!
{111954}{112012}Yes, that's a fine ship.
{112095}{112185}-Captain, what ship is that?|-I don't know, Lord Willoughby.
{112195}{112283}She flies the French flag.|She could be anything in these waters.
{112301}{112378}-We're in pirate waters now, aren't we?|-Yes, we are.
{112387}{112489}Yonder bank of low clouds|is the island of Virgen Magra.
{112500}{112545}-Exciting, isn't it?|-Very.
{112550}{112618}Could she be a pirate ship, by any chance?
{112619}{112695}Any ship we meet in the Caribbean|could be a pirate ship.
{112847}{112943}Ahoy, English ship off port side!
{112945}{113003}Prepare to come onto starboard tack!
{113004}{113045}Starboard tack it is!
{113047}{113075}Steady at the helm!
{113117}{113148}Ready?
{113150}{113186}Stand by your guns.
{113332}{113372}What Iuck.
{113376}{113471}Just as I'm about to give up and anchor|to wait for my partner, Capt. Blood...
{113472}{113537}this fine English prize|walks into my parlor and says:
{113539}{113593}"Hello, Capt. Levasseur. "
{113595}{113682}-We've got to give welcome, Cahusac.|-Yes, and how. Light it!
{114379}{114459}The ransom for you two is fixed at|20,000 pieces of eight.
{114460}{114495}I shall provide a boat for you...
{114497}{114567}to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica|to collect it.
{114592}{114686}Meanwhile, mademoiselle remains|with me as hostage.
{114693}{114761}I find it very lonely on this island.
{114781}{114858}I refuse absolutely and utterly!
{114859}{114942}You know this? It is the rosary of pain.
{114955}{115042}It is possible to screw a man's eyes|out of his head.
{115063}{115121}Very well. Do your worst.
{115135}{115158}AIors!
{115186}{115214}No, stop!
{115215}{115282}Lord Willoughby, thank you,|but don't be foolish.
{115291}{115332}Mademoiselle is right.
{115335}{115382}Thank you, miss.
{115387}{115463}I beg you to spare yourself|and the young lady.
{115465}{115512}You know,|I've been too modest with you...
{115514}{115583}but since I have said|20,000 pieces of eight...
{115585}{115662}eh bien, I have said 20,000 pieces of eight.
{115664}{115744}For what, if you please,|have you said 20,000 pieces of eight?
{115829}{115903}If it ain't the niece|of our old friend Col. Bishop.
{115916}{115968}You don't recognize her. Mind that.
{116012}{116043}What does he mean?
{116045}{116091}Your guess is as good as mine.
{116336}{116407}-Good morning, Levasseur.|-Hello, Captain.
{116408}{116445}-Cahusac.|-Capitaine.
{116455}{116541}I arrived late last night and put into a cove|a few miles to the west.
{116543}{116616}We've walked across|to give you good morning, but, faith...
{116618}{116694}it seems we've interrupted|some business of yours.
{116695}{116747}-Who are these people?|-Oh, yes, here.
{116749}{116819}As you see, two prisoners.|I captured an English ship.
{116820}{116876}Yes. We saw her coming across the spit.
{116878}{116962}I must congratulate you, Levasseur.|I didn't so much as sight a sail.
{116966}{117024}The fortunes of war, my partner.
{117027}{117083}And these are also the fortunes of war?
{117084}{117158}Big fortunes. A nobleman and the niece|of the Governor of Jamaica.
{117160}{117185}Really?
{117187}{117239}I suppose congratulations|are again in order...
{117241}{117309}but have you forgotten there's an article|in our agreement...
{117311}{117355}forbidding the taking of women prisoners?
{117357}{117422}That's a foolish article of yours.
{117428}{117506}I was not aware you regarded it so|when we signed.
{117507}{117592}Would you care to dispute|my opinion now, your men against mine?
{117651}{117743}Not this morning, thank you.|As you say, a foolish article.
{117744}{117779}Heard, my friend.
{117780}{117865}That is why these are prisoners|of my own, a matter personal.
{117871}{117926}-And the 20,000 pieces of eight?|-Their ransom.
{117927}{117994}-That is also a personal matter?|-lt is.
{117999}{118082}Obviously, these two prisoners,|and particularly the young lady...
{118083}{118181}must be kept in someone's hands for,|shall we say, safekeeping...
{118183}{118223}but why your hands?
{118234}{118294}Why shouldn't Pierre have her,|or Roch, or Jacob...
{118301}{118362}since she's as much their property|as yours?
{118371}{118464}Or doesn't that please you?|You'd like to keep her for yourself.
{118511}{118562}And who might that be, do you suppose?
{118563}{118646}-That is your Capt. Blood.|-Capt. Blood?
{118675}{118699}Now, my captain...
{118701}{118778}since you covet our joint property|of war, you may have her...
{118779}{118831}providing you're willing to buy her.
{118833}{118897}-Buy her?|-At the price you yourself have put on her.
{118899}{118939}20,000 pieces of eight.
{118941}{118999}The ransom is to be paid by Gov. Bishop.
{119001}{119046}It is for division when it comes.
{119047}{119119}But if the Governor should refuse to pay|the ransom, what then?
{119120}{119203}No. If you're to keep the girl meanwhile,|pay the ransom.
{119210}{119269}Let it be your risk to collect it|from the Governor.
{119271}{119310}Capt. Blood is right.
{119312}{119399}-It's in the articles.|-What's in the articles, you fools?
{119401}{119478}Where do you suppose|I have 20,000 pieces of eight?
{119480}{119527}-Let someone buy her who has.|-Who?
{119528}{119559}-l.|-You?
{119603}{119662}Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward.
{119811}{119847}Here they are, Peter.
{119884}{119955}I bid 20,000 pieces of eight.
{119962}{120014}Can you improve on that, Levasseur?
{120033}{120082}I don't wish to be bought by you.
{120188}{120247}As a lady once said to a slave...
{120248}{120330}you are hardly in a position|to have anything to say about it.
{120411}{120485}-You want the girl?|-Why not?
{120495}{120551}And I'm willing to pay for what I want.
{120576}{120648}Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls.
{120697}{120749}At what do you value each of those?
{120850}{120901}1,000 pieces each.
{120903}{120994}They're worth rather more, but very well.|Here are 12.
{120995}{121091}The three-fifths the value of the prize|due your ship for having made the capture.
{121093}{121173}For the share due my men,|I make myself responsible.
{121481}{121567}Now, Wolf, will you be so kind|as to take my property aboard ship?
{121599}{121664}And that settles that, my captain partner.
{121704}{121770}-No, you don't!|-Stop, Capitaine!
{121806}{121871}Wait! You'll not take her while I live!
{121873}{121926}Then I'll take her when you're dead!
{121968}{122056}-Capitaine, it has been honorably settled.|-lt has not been settled for me!
{122058}{122135}What is a girl, more or less?|Do not be a fool, Capitaine!
{122137}{122172}It's my business.
{122315}{122406}Two breaches in our articles committed|by you. You should be marooned.
{122427}{122491}It's what I intended for you in the end...
{122493}{122598}but since you prefer it this way,|you muckrake, I'll be humoring you.
{124265}{124290}Up!
{125719}{125810}And that, my friend, ends a partnership|that should never have begun.
{126464}{126527}All these things I've gathered|in my journeys.
{126573}{126656}I've gone far since I was a slave|on your uncle's plantation...
{126673}{126732}thousands of restless, hectic miles.
{126746}{126815}But somehow tonight,|I've got a strange feeling...
{126816}{126864}that my journey's almost over.
{126923}{126962}You see these ankle rings?
{126963}{127028}They came from a ship|that was out from Persia.
{127043}{127086}And these pearls...
{127094}{127167}they're the choice from a fleet|we captured off the Azores.
{127170}{127243}-Have you ever seen such pearls?|-Yes, I have.
{127251}{127350}They're like the pearls you sometimes|use for making purchases, are they not?
{127423}{127495}-Yes, they are.|-How many lives did they cost?
{127527}{127589}As few as possible.|It wasn't lives I was after.
{127591}{127647}-What, then?|-I never quite knew.
{127657}{127753}Some urge that drove me on.|Revenge, I suppose.
{127775}{127825}But I've had my fill of revenge.
{127851}{127926}I often wondered|why I bothered to save all these things.
{127936}{127983}Tonight I know it's because...
{128003}{128062}one day you'd be here in this cabin|to wear them.
{128063}{128097}I'll never wear them, never!
{128099}{128170}Those nor any other plunder gotten|by a thief and pirate.
{128196}{128231}Thief and pirate.
{128243}{128276}I've seen your pirate ways.
{128278}{128328}I've seen myself bargained for|and fought over.
{128330}{128371}A combat between jackals.
{128407}{128439}But I thought you understood.
{128441}{128482}You mean you thought you'd bought me.
{128483}{128545}I suppose I should have regarded that|as a compliment.
{128547}{128626}You pirates are used to taking|without the formality of purchase.
{128627}{128685}I advise you to go back to your ladies|at Tortuga...
{128687}{128738}who are thrilled by your bold,|lawless ways.
{128739}{128798}I only hate you and despise you.
{128821}{128900}I might have expected your thanks|for what I've done this day...
{128902}{128946}but very well, let it be so.
{128955}{129051}I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you|how a thief and a pirate can deal.
{129055}{129109}Once, you bought me for a miserable £10.
{129115}{129192}Now I've bought you for considerably|more. The amount's of no matter.
{129194}{129252}What matters is|now I own you as you once owned me.
{129254}{129329}You're mine, do you understand?|Mine to do with as I please!
{129493}{129566}Capt. Blood,|Lord Willoughby sends his compliments...
{129567}{129632}and requests you to talk with him|at your convenience.
{129634}{129670}He's been sent by the King himself.
{129672}{129739}Tell him I'm not convenient|to any friend of the King's.
{129741}{129783}All I've got to say is good riddance...
{129785}{129835}as soon as I can get him to his destination.
{129837}{129861}I shall.
{129898}{129960}Jeremy. Wolverstone.
{130000}{130075}-Wolverstone!|-What is it, Peter?
{130087}{130122}We're changing course.
{130124}{130181}Draw down every rag of canvas|the yards will hold.
{130183}{130253}-Aye, aye, Peter, but....|-Jeremy!
{130277}{130327}All hands on deck!
{130498}{130550}-Jeremy!|-Coming, Peter!
{130620}{130662}Forever sleeping when I need you?
{130664}{130736}-I wasn't sleeping. I was--|-Never mind! Get ready to go about.
{130738}{130793}-Set the course for Port Royal.|-Port Royal?
{130842}{130904}But the English fleet is at Port Royal.|Col. Bishop--
{130906}{130968}Sweet, merciful heaven! Haven't you ears?
{130970}{131016}Set the course for Port Royal!
{131141}{131213}-Make speed there, Wolverstone.|-Speed it is, Peter.
{131240}{131316}-Follow we a helm, west by north.|-West by north, sir.
{131505}{131580}Make speed there! To your halyards!
{131591}{131690}Tacks and braces. We head for Port Royal.
{131851}{131913}Make speed there! That's the order!
{131927}{131964}Make speed there.
{132011}{132079}There's a gallows waiting|for each of us at Port Royal...
{132080}{132139}and no man should be late|to his own hanging.
{132184}{132227}How you hate the villain.
{132229}{132308}If I were a young man,|I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous.
{132341}{132390}But you said you didn't even know him.
{132393}{132433}He was once my slave.
{132475}{132498}Slave?
{132533}{132571}Did you know him well?
{132589}{132614}I did.
{132656}{132722}He's not such a bad fellow for a pirate.
{132752}{132822}When he made his escape,|I was thrilled and happy.
{132832}{132900}That was before I knew how he would use|his freedom.
{132903}{132932}But aren't you forgetting...
{132934}{133010}that a man's bitter heart|may demand revenge?
{133024}{133066}That is the unforgivable thing:
{133071}{133124}to have put his revenge above|everything else...
{133126}{133184}and to have destroyed himself.|That's what he's done.
{133186}{133240}I've seen pirates. I know their ways.
{133243}{133322}Cruel, evil, greedy,|plundering peaceful cities...
{133324}{133389}torturing their captives. Beasts.
{133807}{133863}Are you so much in love with him?
{133867}{133894}In love with him?
{133899}{133948}That you care so much what he does?
{133950}{133992}I don't care in the least what he does.
{133994}{134059}Someone should,|in view of what he's doing now.
{134071}{134149}But your uncle's with the fleet|at Port Royal. That much is fortunate.
{134151}{134219}Why? What's this about my uncle|in Port Royal?
{134220}{134299}He amazes me, this fellow.|That's where he means to take us.
{134301}{134362}-No, he can't.|-They won't let me near him.
{134363}{134465}He's alone on his quarterdeck|in a fine lrish temper, I suspect.
{134486}{134571}-But I learned of it from one of the crew.|-Lord Willoughby, he mustn't.
{134588}{134631}My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.
{134633}{134718}He lives in the hope of one day|taking and hanging Capt. Blood.
{134726}{134782}Capt. Blood probably doesn't know that,|of course.
{134783}{134836}I doubt if it'd make any difference if he did.
{134838}{134902}He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.
{134918}{134946}Chivalrous?
{134968}{135046}And yet he's been what he's been|these last three years...
{135050}{135098}and done what he's done.
{135125}{135171}Lord Willoughby, help me.
{135191}{135241}I see your point, my child...
{135243}{135311}but that's something|you must decide for yourself.
{135327}{135390}Life can be infernally complex.
{135963}{136014}It's hard to lay tongue to the right words.
{136016}{136052}I'll lay tongue to them.
{136054}{136097}We won't sail to Jamaica.|Them's the words.
{136099}{136163}Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica.
{136167}{136234}When you risked your neck in a duel|over that petticoat...
{136235}{136270}that was your business.
{136271}{136349}But it's our necks you're risking now,|and I say no.
{136351}{136396}Not for her, nor a dozen like her.
{136398}{136446}I got a great affection for my neck.
{136447}{136526}I have no wish to hear it cracked|by a hangman's knot.
{136531}{136616}This is what comes from sailing the seas|with a lovesick madman.
{136682}{136730}We've been with you since the first, Peter.
{136732}{136764}We have a right.
{136853}{136892}You, too, Jeremy?
{136982}{137015}All right, lads.
{137027}{137068}What do you mean, Peter?
{137083}{137175}You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica.|There's nothing more to be said.
{137188}{137271}-Hurrah for our side!|-Quiet. You sound like a rooster.
{137280}{137314}Good night, lads.
{137315}{137393}Wait a minute, Peter.|Where are we sailing for?
{137459}{137498}That's for you to tell me...
{137499}{137541}since I'm no longer running this ship.
{137543}{137597}We didn't say that, Peter.
{137603}{137650}As Jeremy says, you've got the right.
{137652}{137735}You've been with me from the first,|and you've been loyal and true...
{137738}{137818}followed me into every tight corner|men could follow another.
{137819}{137898}-But you always got us out.|-And none the poorer for it.
{137902}{137965}Yes, but on this occasion,|there's no gold to be got.
{137967}{138028}Do you think it was|for gold we followed you?
{138036}{138122}No, but I can see now I've not got|the right to ask you to follow me.
{138123}{138178}The girl is my concern, not yours.
{138190}{138287}Are we gonna stand by and see|this little snip laugh at our captain?
{138290}{138324}There's Bishop's fleet.
{138326}{138398}That might be paying a high price|to keep from being laughed at.
{138400}{138486}We're not yet such lily-livered scum|as to be afraid of Col. Bishop.
{138493}{138561}No. That is, not very afraid.
{138598}{138656}Fie on you deserting our captain|in this way...
{138658}{138748}you scurvy traitors, you Judas lscariots,|you snakes in the grass...
{138750}{138795}you wolves in sheep's clothing!
{138797}{138850}I was only with them to spy on them.
{138909}{138958}You'd better think carefully, lads.
{138960}{139027}Yonder lies Jamaica,|and straight we sail for it.
{139031}{139127}-Aye. And straight we sail for it.|-Aye!
{139464}{139545}-Ahoy, the deck!|-Ahoy!
{139547}{139602}I have sighted Port Royal!
{139609}{139668}Aye! Port Royal, you say?
{139670}{139704}Aye, sir!
{139879}{139924}There's something amiss!
{139942}{140043}I see flashes of gunfire|from ships in the harbor!
{140050}{140090}-Fetch the Captain.|-Aye, sir.
{140092}{140169}Bugler, all hands on deck!
{140884}{140943}It's terrible to wake up at dawn|dreaming of thunder.
{140944}{140996}That's gunfire if I ever heard any.
{141030}{141118}-There's a battle in Port Royal harbor.|-How many ships do you make out?
{141119}{141217}It's hard to see clearly in the early|morning light. I think there are two.
{141224}{141279}It's an attack on Port Royal, but who?
{141306}{141344}Pirate craft, perhaps.
{141359}{141410}Wish I could make out their flags.
{141445}{141522}-Perhaps I can supply you the answer.|-You can?
{141524}{141602}Yes, if I may speak to|so inaccessible a person.
{141605}{141681}If Port Royal is being attacked,|they are likely French ships.
{141683}{141706}French?
{141892}{141951}You say Port Royal's attacked|by the French? Why?
{141952}{142012}When two countries are at war|and one is attacked...
{142014}{142058}who would it be but the enemy?
{142060}{142120}What's this? France and England at war?
{142122}{142201}You mean you don't know? Where have|you been the past few months?
{142203}{142246}At sea, out of touch with the world.
{142248}{142323}The fire from the fortress is weakening!
{142332}{142415}One ship is already firing on the town!
{142426}{142452}That's strange.
{142454}{142525}Where is the English fleet|that's supposed to protect the town?
{142527}{142594}It's my turn to supply the answer.|It's out chasing pirates.
{142595}{142694}Bishop would never let his fleet leave its|post in time of war. He wouldn't dare.
{142695}{142783}Col. Bishop, if I may say,|is a very old and dear friend of mine.
{142785}{142855}-It's probably me he's after.|-That fool! Blunder!
{142856}{142902}And me in his own front yard.
{142950}{143010}Shorten sail there, Wolf.|Lend a hand forward, Andy.
{143012}{143090}Stand by helm and keep her headed|two points to larboard of the fort.
{143092}{143116}Aye, aye, sir.
{143118}{143160}Get your men to their stations, Chester.
{143162}{143190}Port watch to stations!
{143192}{143228}Speed there, lads!
{143242}{143302}-Reef the fore topsail!|-Aye, aye, sir!
{143304}{143352}Take in the topgallant sail.
{143387}{143450}May I ask, Captain,|what are your intentions?
{143452}{143535}Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you|at Port Royal, but now....
{143672}{143729}Miss Bishop,|an unlooked-for circumstance...
{143731}{143786}prevents my landing you|on your own dock.
{143787}{143856}But I trust that if I put you ashore|on the beach nearby...
{143858}{143906}that would be equally satisfactory?
{143908}{143943}-l--|-Thank you.
{143997}{144064}Only please understand, this is a bargain...
{144066}{144101}your freedom for my freedom.
{144103}{144170}From now on,|I no longer regard myself as a slave.
{144198}{144235}My life's my own...
{144251}{144313}even though I'm a thief and pirate.
{144387}{144446}Capt. Blood, are you,|an Englishman, thinking of leaving...
{144447}{144505}when yonder,|an English town is being taken?
{144507}{144565}Hagthorpe,|clear my deck and keep it cleared.
{144567}{144649}-Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him.|-Take your hands off!
{144652}{144727}-Wait, lads.|-Capt. Blood, I must talk to you.
{144741}{144783}Very well then, Lord Willoughby.
{144785}{144861}Myself, I've the honor to be lrish,|but part of my crew's English.
{144863}{144915}I was myself once, too, in loyalty.
{144919}{144949}Of what should we be thinking?
{144951}{145005}Of the chance to fight for your king.
{145007}{145043}To fight for my king?
{145054}{145127}Yes. He was loyal enough|to send me to seek you out...
{145130}{145190}to offer you pardon for your past crimes...
{145192}{145249}freedom from your slavery|and more than that...
{145251}{145323}a commission in his own navy|for you and your men.
{145333}{145418}You hear that, Chester?|The King wants us to join his navy!
{145502}{145544}Read it for yourself.
{145546}{145598}Lord Willoughby,|you're a guest aboard my ship...
{145600}{145683}and I've still some notion left me|from better days of decent behavior...
{145684}{145744}so I'll not be telling you|what I think of this offer.
{145746}{145815}All I'll say is,|I wouldn't soil my hands with it...
{145816}{145885}even though they're the hands|of a thief and a pirate.
{145894}{145954}But this concerns you, too, my lads.
{145969}{146015}What do you say to serving the King?
{146017}{146047}No!
{146143}{146202}I'd like to serve him with a rope necktie.
{146223}{146271}I'd rot before I'd serve him.
{146293}{146368}I'd sink this ship with all hands|before I'd serve him.
{146370}{146444}It would appear then|that my crew is still a little dubious...
{146446}{146503}as to the merits of His Majesty's offer.
{146508}{146582}However you hate the King,|England is still England.
{146586}{146663}And a bad king is bad king,|and worse one if he's James.
{146670}{146746}James?|This commission is sent by King William.
{146770}{146854}King William? Who may King William be|and what's he king of?
{146855}{146934}I'm alluding to His Majesty,|King William lll, William of Orange...
{146935}{147002}who, with Queen Mary,|has come over from the Netherlands...
{147004}{147082}and has been ruling England|the past two months or more.
{147140}{147218}They've roused themselves at home|and kicked out that pimple James?
{147220}{147286}Yes, and he's fled to France|and he's in hiding there...
{147287}{147337}and England and France are at war.
{147339}{147409}The English people will go so far,|Capt. Blood...
{147411}{147481}and then they get up|on their stubborn hind legs.
{147483}{147538}-And William sent us this commission?|-Yes.
{147551}{147644}He knows you're good men,|wrongfully sold into slavery.
{147646}{147725}He can use good men in his navy.
{147727}{147777}It's the long-winded fellow you are.
{147779}{147843}Why didn't you tell us this|in the first place?
{147877}{147938}Bugler, summon the men amidships!
{148160}{148249}Men!|I've just heard a startling piece of news.
{148252}{148354}King James is kicked out of England|and good King William reigns in his stead.
{148448}{148527}For me,|this changes the shape of the world.
{148535}{148585}For you who were slaves with me...
{148587}{148641}it means that we're no longer slaves.
{148643}{148715}That we once more have|a home and a country.
{148723}{148761}For you who are English...
{148763}{148830}it means a chance to fight|for your native land...
{148832}{148918}for I now propose to sail into Port Royal|and take it from the French!
{148920}{148968}Those of you who are not English...
{148973}{149044}will have to be content|with fighting for Capt. Blood...
{149091}{149162}and the loot you'll find|on the French ships.
{149195}{149267}-Are you willing to fight, men?|-Aye!
{149291}{149347}Have we an English battle flag on board,|Hagthorpe?
{149349}{149444}We have every manner of battle flag,|including a lady's purple petticoat.
{149451}{149494}Wait, I've a better idea.
{149495}{149563}When an English lion creeps up|on a nest of French foxes...
{149565}{149595}he wears a bushy tail.
{149597}{149677}Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.|Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf.
{149679}{149707}Stand by the helm, Jeremy.
{149709}{149757}Forward, men, to your stations.
{149780}{149840}-ls that satisfactory to you?|-Perfectly.
{150082}{150122}Clear decks for action!
{150239}{150314}Capt. Blood's orders.|You'll be put ashore with these men.
{150316}{150370}A ship is no place for a woman|in time of battle.
{150372}{150431}-I want to talk to him.|-I'm sorry. The Captain's busy.
{150433}{150467}-lnto the boat.|-Aye, sir.
{150468}{150507}Follow me, Miss Bishop.
{151643}{151698}Musketeers, to your stations!
{152243}{152272}A French ship.
{152351}{152420}Hope we get on them|before they discover the trick.
{152744}{152771}-Andy.|-Aye, Peter.
{152773}{152845}Run to Hagthorpe.|Tell him to fetch all the hot coals.
{152847}{152894}-Put them by the guns.|-Hot coals, sir?
{152895}{152962}-No questions. Run.|-Aye, aye, sir!
{153153}{153223}Stand by ready to fire as soon as|we come amidships.
{153228}{153313}Stand ready to fire|as soon as we've come amidships!
{153324}{153364}Open your ports!
{154184}{154251}Strike that French flag|and hoist our own colors.
{154339}{154378}Man your port guns!
{154486}{154525}Ready, Hagthorpe?
{154582}{154614}Fire!
{154943}{155015}Hagthorpe,|give them the hot galley broadside!
{155016}{155078}Aye, Peter! Load them, lads!
{156155}{156225}Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line!
{156456}{156503}We never miss.
{156902}{156983}-That's one ship neatly disposed off.|-Now for the other one.
{156994}{157062}-Jeremy, helm quarter to port.|-Aye, aye, Peter.
{157063}{157102}Clear away that burning wreckage!
{157179}{157249}-Port guns, Wolf. Hurry.|-Aye, Peter.
{157256}{157310}Man your port guns!
{157905}{157971}Those French gunners|must've learnt their trade in England.
{157973}{158019}That's their third direct hit.
{158256}{158310}Two guns out of order.|Ship's taking water below.
{158312}{158361}Replace them with two|from the starboard side.
{158363}{158427}-Keep hammering that waterline.|-Aye, aye, sir.
{158737}{158791}Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking.|What should we do?
{158793}{158871}Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking.|Get your men forward.
{158873}{158897}Aye, aye, sir.
{158959}{159014}-What now, Peter?|-Take the helm yourself, lad.
{159016}{159051}Straight into them!
{159120}{159194}-We'll never do it, Peter!|-Musketeers to the prow!
{159195}{159290}Grappling hooks to larboard. Forward|gunners, fire as hard as they can load!
{159384}{159425}Rapid fire, men!
{159427}{159477}Hagthorpe, double them up!
{159485}{159554}They won't take it, Peter!|They're blazing hot!
{159771}{159824}Up into the shrouds, men!
{160008}{160052}We're going to swing across on ropes.
{160054}{160099}When we clear the rail,|come over the side!
{160101}{160127}Aye, aye, Peter!
{160244}{160298}You and your men swing across|into their rigging.
{160300}{160371}When you see me cut down|that French flag, drop down.
{160444}{160494}Up, men, into the shrouds!
{160561}{160622}Strong and sure! Grapnels over!
{161576}{161637}All right, my hearties, follow me!
{162199}{162228}Follow on, men!
{162703}{162770}"Dust thou art,|and unto dust thou shalt return."
{163454}{163494}"Love thy neighbor as thyself."
{163496}{163546}Leviticus 19:18.
{165978}{166063}-Hurry, Cato. We'll be late.|-Yes. The fleet's in already.
{166272}{166322}-Stop!|-Yes.
{166422}{166461}Capt. Blood!
{166559}{166587}Miss Bishop.
{166626}{166673}I'll be on the veranda.
{166739}{166773}I thought you'd gone.
{166775}{166822}You can't be here.|My uncle's just returned.
{166824}{166865}-Yes, I know.|-You know?
{166867}{166911}-What are you going to do?|-Just stay here.
{166913}{166965}No, it's impossible. You mustn't stay here.
{166967}{167018}-He's sworn he'll hang you.|-I doubt he will.
{167019}{167062}I've always been bad luck for your uncle.
{167064}{167142}You can't know the threats he's made.|The dreadful threats he's made.
{167143}{167191}His whole life is spent|in searching for you.
{167193}{167261}-Now he's found me.|-But you can still save yourself.
{167263}{167308}Please, for my sake.
{167310}{167400}For your sake? What do you mean for your|sake? Isn't it true that you hate me?
{167426}{167480}-Hate you?|-Or is it that you love me?
{167494}{167563}I'll hide you.|And tonight after dark, I'll find some way--
{167565}{167611}You love me, don't you?
{167639}{167712}Whom else would I love? Now will you?
{167714}{167752}You love me!
{167754}{167813}Lord Willoughby, she loves me!
{167857}{167915}He'll be here any minute.|I'll hide you somewhere.
{167916}{167977}We'll hide together. I know just the place.
{168268}{168298}How's this?
{168299}{168351}You must be mad. He'll come here first.
{168353}{168396}Good. I forgot to tell you.
{168400}{168448}The Governor and I are|on the best of terms.
{168450}{168509}He lets me come and go here|as I please. Look.
{168647}{168723}-You can't arrest me!|-I have, by order of the Governor.
{168725}{168786}The Governor? You are mad.|I am the governor.
{168788}{168839}You mean, you were the governor.
{168846}{168910}But we've changed that in your absence.
{168913}{168942}What?
{168943}{169028}You're broken for abandoning your post|in time of war.
{169035}{169058}Who are you?
{169060}{169140}My name is Willoughby. I'm a special|emissary of His Majesty the King.
{169143}{169170}Lord Willoughby?
{169172}{169231}-You were informed, I think, of my coming.|-Yes.
{169232}{169308}Yet you went off|on some wild goose chase after a pirate...
{169310}{169369}Ieaving your capital at the mercy|of the enemy.
{169371}{169446}Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter,|as you may well find.
{169448}{169498}Seeing that you hold your office|from James...
{169503}{169575}it's even possible the charge of treason|lies against you.
{169577}{169601}But, my lord--
{169603}{169671}I'm not concerned to hear|your reasons, man.
{169675}{169737}-His Excellency the Governor will.|-The Governor?
{169739}{169778}You'll find him inside.
{169781}{169851}It rests entirely with him|whether you're hanged or not.
{169900}{169952}This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood.
{169954}{170013}What a reckoning|there'll be when we meet.
{170055}{170145}Have mercy, Your Excellency!
{170150}{170209}-Arabella, why are you here?|-Uncle!
{170247}{170309}I have been pleading|with the Governor on your behalf...
{170311}{170392}asking him to be as merciful|as you would be cruel.
{170447}{170523}Uncle, this is the Governor.
{170679}{170730}Good morning, Uncle.

Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Let us pray for His Most Excellent Majesty,
Henry VIII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, defender of the faith, now lying at the point of death.
Almighty and most merciful Father...
- How is the King?
- Three quarters dead, milord.
I doubt he will speak again soon.
Passing of a tyrant.
Before he came each man fought for himself under the white rose or the red.
When he goes...
...there will be many struggling to grasp the threads of power...
...that fall from those hands.
- And among them Milord Warrick.
- You should know me better, Gates.
I don't struggle.
- Well, brother?
- The Prince is still at Hertford.
We start for Hertford as soon as...
- Are the horses saddled?
- Waiting.
They'll not wait long.
Seymour's in the lands.
Edifying but unusual.
And Lord Edward prays...
...for the King's end, the next move, and his own hopes.
Let him pray.
What are those in the shadows?
Ghosts? Headless ghosts?
No, sire, your Council.
Oh, my Counselors.
With heads. Nothing in them.
Fetch them to me.
Milords!
Nearer! Nearer!
It grows dark.
The sound of my own voice is strange.
A last command for you...
Edward, the Prince, my son, succeeds me.
After him, his heirs.
Failing them, my daughter,
Mary Tudor and her heirs.
Failing them, my daughter Elizabeth and her heirs.
Failing them, my sister's grandchild,
Jane Grey.
Jane Grey on the throne?
And the bar behind them.
Who speaks?
Warrick.
No conscience and no fear.
And Edward Seymour.
So great a hypocrite you deceive me when yourself.
And brother Thomas, of some little wit but no judgment.
Thomas, go where your wit will serve you...
...and your lack of judgment not bring you to disaster.
I know you.
All of you!
And I know for what you wage.
But you heard my will!
Edward, Mary, Elizabeth, Jane.
And I lay my curse...
...on any that shall abuse their power over these children... and intrigue against the successors
I have named.
May everything he holds dear betray him!
May his soul perish in the everlasting fires!
May he die a traitor's death!
His head rot on London Bridge, the crows pick out his out his eyes!
Milords, the King is dead.
Why let them get to the start?
As a soldier, Gates,
I've won several campaigns...
...always by waiting till the enemy made a mistake.
There will be many mistakes made in this realm in the next few years.
And much profit to be gained by them.
That is why we wait.
For the moment.
For Edward the Fox and Thomas the Peacock.
They've hated each other from the cradle with nothing in common but their parents.
They'll fall out.
With a little help at the right time.
- They're children. I'm sorry for them.
- Spare your pity.
Their heads may wear the crown of England.
- If they have heads to put it on.
- A delicate point.
We must be behind the head that wears the crown.
- Aren't you afraid?
- You heard what he said.
- A man without fear.
- I heard more, his dying curse.
His curse?
What is a curse but words?
And what a word but breath...
...can be at his last breath?
What, man?
No, I am not afraid.
Your Highness.
Anyhow, the Captain of the Guard says that bows and arrows are done for.
Soon everybody will fight with these new guns.
As if anyone would ever fight with their guns instead of a bow and arrow.
But I want a gun.
Hello, uncle.
Why won't Father let me have a gun?
- Your father would know best.
- That's what he always says.
I'll get round him.
I can accept him when he has doubts.
Edward my boy,
I have news for you.
Sad news, Your Majesty.
Majesty?
Why do you call me that?
- Because you are the King.
- King?
My father's King.
God rest his soul.
- My f...
- Edward, my boy...
We must all die.
Your noble, gracious, and most pious father, in his dying breath entrusted you to my care.
- Indeed his last words...
- His last words were...
...that you should in all things obey me.
For your own good and for the good of the Kingdom over which you now rule.
- Uncle...
- Yes?
- If I am King...
- Well?
I can have a gun.
My Lords, it gives me great happiness...
...to name my beloved uncle,
Edward Seymour,
Lord Treasurer, Earl Marshall, and Duke of Somerset, and I do take him, as Lord Protector of this realm,
...to follow his advice in all things.
Duke of Somerset, Lord Treasurer,
Earl Marshall and Lord Protector.
How much we must indeed be proud of such a brother.
- My lord, you read my very thoughts.
- But your looks belie them.
Your many friends are disappointed in you, Thomas.
Have I so many?
All your brother's enemies.
- I'm fortunate.
- Then make the poise of it.
You lack ambition.
I thought better of you, Thomas.
A drop of poison.
It works.
Eduardus Rex.
That means Edward the King.
And what's the use of making you Protector if you won't let me do anything I want?
You keep me here in the country, you don't let me have any money.
And you won't even let me have that gun.
- One day you will thank me.
- What for?
For teaching you to have no wishes of your own.
No desires but to do your duty.
I'll not sign it!
I've written Eduardus Rex in hundreds and hundreds of papers and my hand aches.
And I don't know what they're about anyway.
And I've sat here for hours.
I don't want to sit here any longer.
And I'll not!
If I could get a new Protector, I would!
After all, I am the King.
What do you want?
Your Majesty.
A gun!
For me?
What's the use of being a king if you can't have everything you want?
And more and have it, and then one more and have that too.
And so helter-skelter to the top of the ladder till there's nothing more to want.
How do you load it?
For truth to tell I mistrust these new fangled things myself.
He'll return soon enough, chastened and obedient.
The voice of his own conscience will speak louder than anything we can say.
I hit it! Oh, look,
I hit it, I hit it!
Look, look!
- Edward, what is it?
- Nothing.
Only sometimes everything goes black. I can't get my breath...
...and my heart goes like horses galloping.
I'm hot and cold, and I'm wet through.
It's as if I'd fallen into the moat.
- Have you told your uncle Edward about this?
- No, I'd never tell him.
Let's shoot this again.
What is this?
It's a new gun Uncle Thomas has given me.
Thomas, I have to speak with you.
Barnaby!
Oh!
You heard my orders not to come here.
- Orders? But my dear brother,
I am also the King's uncle...
- Why have you come?
- To bring my nephew something he wanted.
Understand this!
While the King is in my care...
- Your loving and disinterested care?
- I intend to do my duty!
A most painful duty, Duke of Somerset,
Lord Treasurer,
Earl Marshall, Lord Protector, and anything else you can make yourself!
My lords!
Oh!
Edward, what ails you?
Nothing, uncle, nothing.
I must have bruised myself with the gun.
I'll not have you fire it again.
Barnaby! Barnaby, help His Majesty within.
Thomas, I give you warning.
Brother or no brother, a solemn warning.
Leave here at once, and you show yourself again at your peril.
Brother, the King is yours.
I'll not seek to see him.
So great is my concern for you and for him.
- This means a journey north.
- Milord, why so?
My brother looks so far ahead he fails to see what's under his very nose.
Edward VI will be dead within the year.
- Dead?
- I'll stake my future on it.
- Then it's Mary Tudor.
- A Papist, a Catholic?
- No, they'll not have her.
- Then Elizabeth.
The Commons have declared her illegitimate.
- It's Jane Grey.
- Jane Grey?
That poor child seems likely to be overlooked.
So, we ride north.
So you want to take my daughter back with you to London. May I ask why?
- Don't be a fool, Henry.
- I beg your pardon, my dear?
Don't beg my pardon, beg your daughter's.
For not realizing what Thomas is offering her.
He's offering to take her to London,
I realize that.
- But surely I'm entitled to ask why.
- Lord, give me patience.
You see, milord, I feel a lady so charming, so accomplished, so highly born as your daughter, should not spend all her youth away in the country, however charming her home.
Now, if she were to come to London, under my rule, bringing with her, of course, anyone you may choose to care for her, she might make a more than advantageous match.
- So you'd marry her to someone?
- In good time.
Anyone particular in view?
We can look as high as we will and need look no lower.
- So...
- I wish you wouldn't talk in riddles.
- I have the answer, my dear.
- Oh, you've no lack of answers.
May I remind you that my mother was a sister of Henry VIII?
- You do frequently.
- Blessed Mary!
My mind is naturally more attuned to Lord Thomas' than yours.
There is one other person who might perhaps be consulted.
- And who is that, my lord?
- Lady Jane herself.
What she thinks might be of some matter.
You mistake, my lord. What my daughter thinks is of no matter.
Caeser, De Bello Gallico.
Construe.
Caesar Upon the Gallic Wars.
Why the plural? Bello, Gallico, singular.
Caesar Upon the Gallic War.
Read.
I wonder who it is with Mother and Father.
I wonder who... what?
They're talking in there now.
Whatever they talk of can have no possible concern for a child like you.
That's all very well, but if Jane is to go to court, she'll want a lot of new dresses...
...money to spend. I'm not a rich man.
Milord, I wouldn't dream that you should be the loser.
If I'm granted so great a privilege,
Shall we say two thousand pounds?
Two thousand pounds?
Well, of course I...
No, I don't like it.
You're not asked to like it. Lord Thomas isn't offering to take you to town.
Confound it, she is my daughter.
I happen to know that's true but I often marvel at it.
- Well, the whole thing wants talking over.
- Shall I withdraw?
Leave him to me, my lord.
I have no doubt of the outcome.
- Construe.
- I mean, in our tongue, the Gauls.
They've been there for hours.
Ellen says it's a high personage.
May I enter?
And who may you be?
The high personage.
This is my tutor, Dr. Elmer.
Thomas Seymour, at your service.
I make a rule a lesson must not be interrupted.
I will not break your rule, Dr. Elmer.
I wish to examine her ladyship on her works of the great Cicero.
- Caesar.
- Caesar.
- I think her parents would not approve.
- I think I may answer for them.
If your lordship so desires.
Why did you do that?
Well, I thought perhaps you might like a holiday.
Ovid, Aristotle, Plato, Euclid.
Is that all you learn?
Oh, no!
But besides Latin and Greek,
Dr. Elmer teaches me French,
Italian, Spanish, and a little Hebrew.
And I have master heading for knowledge of divinity and gravity of manners.
Lord preserve us, I should be dead within a week.
Oh, no, you'd get used to it.
But I doubt you'd be good at gravity of manners.
Jane...
Would you like to take a holiday from gravity of manners?
- Most gladly.
- And come to London?
London!
Oh, no.
- No, my parents would never allow me.
- You see that door?
At any moment now it will open, and your father will come in, and he'll say...
'Jane, you are to go to London.
I've been talking it over with your mother and I've made up my mind.'
Oh, there you are, milord.
I, er...
I've been talking to my wife and...
I've made up my mind.
A night of ill omen, this.
You mark my words.
London's a place of sin.
Ellen, aren't you longing to be there?
If it wasn't to look after you, the whole
King's army wouldn't drag me there.
The devil's playground.
Mother!
Yes, I've come to say good night, but tomorrow's a great day for you.
Ellen says its day of ill omen and London's the devil's playground.
Ellen, how dare you put such ideas in the child's head!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
There's shame in me, but not for myself.
I forbid you to meddle with things you don't understand.
There are things I understand too well.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night, mother.
We're giving you a great chance, your father and I.
There's no knowing what may come of it.
Look. That's his barge.
And that's her.
- London Bridge.
- With hundreds of houses on it.
Ellen and I shall be happy here.
I know I shall.
Two hours without a bite.
- And when they do bite...
- They're not more than fish themselves.
My humble dwelling.
And you are very welcome.
I'll not hear it again.
The devil with it all.
...to be a thing repugnant to nature.
I mean not only that the Lord hath spoiled women of authority and dominion, but also that man hath seen, proved and pronounced... just cause is why that should be sought.
Men, I say, in many cases blind, tough in this behalf, see very clearly,
...for the causes be so manifest that they cannot be hidden.
For who can deny that it is repugnant to nature...
...that the blind shall be appointed to lead and conduct such as you see?
That the foolish, weak, and impotent persons...
...shall nourish and keep the full and strong.
And finally, that the foolish, mad, and fanatic... shall govern the discrete... and give counsel to such as the sovereign of my kingdom.
And such be all women, compared with men.
For their sight is of such blindness...
- Milord.
- We listen to godly words.
I have news for you.
No news can have such importance as godly news.
News of your brother.
- Jane Grey? He must be daft.
- Thomas is ambitious.
Not a word of this.
For the peace of the realm, keep silent.
- I know my duty.
- The godly words.
Listen yourself awhile.
You may derive much profit from them.
# Passetyme with gude companye #

- Well?
- The Lord Protector is here.
Shall I bring him to you?
No, I'll come to him.
- You know this air?
- Very well, my lord.
Then take my part.
It is a soothing sound.
# Youth wyll have nedes dalyaunce #
# Of gude or yll #
Edward!
Cheer, good brother.
An Italian design. I find it pleasing.
Jane Grey is with you.
Entrusted to me by her parents.
I warned you that I should stop at nothing if you dared interference.
Interference?
But you desired, if my memory serves, sole control of the King.
- And to that you're welcome.
- It is too near the throne.
It is a direct threat to the government.
Treason!
- Edward, how you jump to conclusions.
- Jump to conclusions? You drive me to them.
# So God be pleeyd #
# thus lyfe wyll I #
This is beyond forgiveness.
I've been long suffering beyond measure.
My patience is at an end.
And mine?
Edward, I'm tired.
You have a very pleasant home of your won.
- One last word.
- Let it be the last.
Last and very truthful.
And by your bearing, Thomas,
I think you have a little knowledge of what it is.
Clearly, say it and go!
You fool.
Many a thrashing have I given you as a boy.
And all to no purpose.
But this new folly will cost you more than a thrashing.
It will cost you...
...your head.
The last word has been said.
And this is the last time that we shall ever speak together alone.
My lady!
The guilt of this and the blood are upon your own head.
Guilty of what?
Whose blood?
No matter, my dear.
Nothing to worry your head about.
He seemed so strange.
Yes, a strange man.
He surprises me sometimes.
- I'm frightened.
- Frightened?
Is he going to do something dreadful to you?
Why should he?
After all, he is your brother.
A most loving brother.
Halt!
Thomas Seymour, I arrest you in the King's name.
So loving a brother that he sent his friends to fetch me.
- What does this mean?
- Jane, I believe your Ellen's right.
This place is indeed the devil's playground.
And the devil has some ugly tricks.
- But, My Lord, I...
- Now listen!
I may not return to this house... for some little time.
And if I do not, you must go back to the country.
- Don't you want me here?
- I think you'd be better in the country.
I want your solemn promise you'll go back.
If you'll come and see me.
- As often as I can.
- You sound so serious!
Serious? My dear child, there's nothing in life worth being serious about.
Or in death either, for that matter.
Captain, at your service.
The end of my master.
- The end?
- Tower Hill and the ax.
Milady, there's but one person in the whole world can save him, yourself.
- Me?
- You're the King's cousin, his own age.
Will you go to the King and beg mercy for my Lord Thomas?
- Oh, I will, I will!
- Your Ladyship!
He has shown me nothing but such goodness and kindness.
And now... now he's in danger of his life.
Oh, forgive me if I presume too much.
But you are the King.
You are my cousin.
I beg of you not to allow anything so unjust, so cruel, so wicked.
Have no fear, cousin Jane.
Lord Thomas shall be set free.
We give our royal word.
Send the Lord Protector to me.
And when he comes,
I'll be alone with him.
Hurry!
You sent for me?
I have been informed, my Lord Protector, that you have placed my uncle Thomas under arrest...
...and that you intend his execution.
Well, you mustn't do it.
You must let him go.
It is our royal command.
Edward.
- Do you know what Thomas has done?
- No, Uncle.
Do you suppose that I should stain my hands, perhaps my soul, with a brother's blood without good reason?
- But Uncle...
- Edward, my boy, in high politics...
...we have to set aside all thought of self.
And this you must learn from my example.
But what has he done?
That which in the eyes of men and of the angels cries out for death.
And now, before you weaken me in my resolve to do my duty, out of my sight.
Go to your room, to your bed!
Whereas Thomas Seymour,
Baron Seymour of Sudeley, is in stand of the tainted, convicted and condemned of high treason...
...and other high crimes.
The Court condemns that he be taken this day to the base of execution...
...upon Tower Hill to be put to death by the severing of his head from his body.
And that in the evening...
...his head be placed upon the gate of London Bridge.
This is not justice!
It must be stopped!
Pray, good friends, listen to me!
The King himself has pronounced against this wickedness.
- The King?
- The King.
If it goes forward it is because the tyrant
Edward Seymour overrules the King!
- Down with the Protector!
- Down!
High stakes already, Gates.
In a few minutes one Seymour will have lost his head the other his popularity.
As I foretold, we win by waiting.
Put that down! Do you hear me?
Put that down!
That's the property of milord
Thomas Seymour.
The property of Thomas Seymour traitor is forfeit to the Lord Protector.
Drunk wolves, vultures, ghouls!
Can you not even wait till the deed of shame is done?
But he's there, on the scaffold.
You'll hear the cannon any moment now.
- Cannon?
- They fire a cannon when the ax falls.
No, no, this can't happen. It won't!
The King said he would never allow it.
The King?
A message, milady.
- From the King?
- From milord Thomas.
I left him on the scaffold.
He reminds you of your promise and asks your forgiveness.
But the King said he wouldn't allow it.
He gave me his royal word.
The King my cousin gave me his royal word.
Even now, even this last moment he will stop it, he will. I know he will.
He'll send my lord to return to his home.
Why do you stand there staring at me like that?
Why don't you say something?
He'll set him free!
He'll come back to us! I know!
And it came to pass, when there was a gather in the fields, that Cain rose up against his brother...
...and slew him.
And the Lord said unto Cain, where is Abel thy brother?
He said, I know not.
I am nigh my brother's keeper.
And he said,
What hast thou done?
The voice of thy brother's blood cries onto me from the ground.
Get the King.
We start for Windsor.
I am in the place where I am demanded of my conscience that I speak truth.
So I ask of ye.
Is there no man who will turn the wrath of heaven and avenge a brother's blood?
Milord, Master Knox hurls his thunderbolts, and with shrewd aim.
He looks to you, milord, as do we all.
To me?
Seymour has gone to work, to Windsor with the King.
A strong man to lead us, and we'd hunt him to the death.
Milord, you take me off my guard.
I am no politician.
Nor do I wish to meddle with one.
A plain soldier.
The country bleeds under his toe nails.
You persuade me, Arundel, against myself.
So for the love that I bear you and this land of ours, make what use of me you can.
To your posts, all of you!
Captain, will you hand the castle over to Warrick?
Order your men to their posts.
Mutiny?
Place this officer under arrest.
You will assume his command.
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
- What's the matter?
There's going to be a fight.
Warrick and the Protector.
Come on, Look!
He's coming with his army.
Look!
Edward! Edward, you must come and speak to your soldiers.
- Me, why me? You're the Protector.
- Their King must speak to them.
They never heard me talking, now you do it yourself. You told me to keep quiet.
Listen, my boy, there's not a moment to be lost. Exact your royal authority.
There's mutiny in the castle but for you they'll defend it.
If they don't want to,
I don't see why they should.
- But we shall be in Warrick's hands.
- I'm not afraid.
Yes, but my boy, you don't understand.
It's on me that he'll have no mercy.
You showed no mercy for Uncle Thomas.
I shall lose everything.
In politics, Uncle, you set aside all thoughts of self.
- That I learned from your example.
- Your Majesty, my lead, my royal master, out of your great mercy, out of the gratitude that you owe me,
I implore you, come before it's too late.
It is too late.
A poor run you gave us,
Edward the Fox.
Take him away.
Your Majesty.
- Are you afraid?
- Not very.
I'm here to offer myself as your Protector.
I pray you, Edward the King, name me so.
Will there be any more sermons?
No, Your Majesty.
- May I shoot with my gun?
- You may, Your Majesty.
And may I ask cousin Jane to the palace?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
My Lord Warrick, you are a Protector after my own heart.
- That's good!
- Could you do that?
- Well, I've never tried.
- You could do it as well as they do.
They do it all the time where they come from.
My Captain's brought them from Hindustan.
I am glad you could come.
I wish you weren't going home tomorrow. Must you?
- Yes.
- Why?
I gave my promise.
I must keep it.
I like Warrick.
He's the best Protector I've had.
He lets me do everything I want.
He let me ask you here.
And you know, they wanted to cut off
Edward Seymour's head.
But I said no. Cutting off one uncle's head off is bad enough.
What are you looking like that for?
- Something I heard.
- What?
That something is going to happen.
And this banquet was arranged just to keep you out of the way.
No, no. Warrick would never do that.
I'm really King now.
I get my own way.
I even drink wine at banquets.
I don't like it but I'll get used to it.
You watch.
My Lord Warrick.
I drink to my Lord Warrick.
My Lord Warrick!
Here! I want you here!
Your Majesty.
What was that cannon?
An execution, Your Majesty.
Edward Seymour?
Your Majesty would be more correct to speak of the late Edward Seymour.
You said you wouldn't kill him.
You promised you wouldn't.
I told you not to!
I commanded you not to! I...
Well?
- Milord, the King's state is grave.
- How mean you grave?
There is a certain lymphatic humor in the blood.
- A certain...
- Enough! Will he die?
Assuredly, milords, as we all shall.
Oh, vanity words with me, you dolts, you...
You are one of the most learned physicians in the land.
Use all your skill, devise your most potent remedies.
The King must be restored and speedering.
See that I am obeyed.
Milord, we would obey you in all things.
But in all humility, the poor boy is beyond our physics.
You pack of senseless fools!
You dolts, you knaves!
Out of my sight!
I command you!
Your thoughts, Gates.
Well man, have you lost your tongue?
May his head rot on London Bridge.
May the crows pick up his eyes.
A man with no conscience...
...and no fear.
I should be well equipped to fight both the living and the dead.
This boy shall not cheat me by his death.
We shift our ground.
That's all.
I'm going now.
I came to see how you were.
Was it that I ate too much?
I could eat twice as much.
And I often faint.
I'll be well in the morning.
You were right about Warrick and wanting to go back to the country.
Wish only I could come with you.
- Couldn't you? Just for a while?
- He wouldn't let me.
Oh, cousin Jane, they use me for their own advantage.
I no longer know truth from lies.
But it'll be easier being King when you're older.
You go away from this place as soon as you may.
Nothing could keep me here.
Good night, cousin Edward.
Good night, cousin Jane.
Where do you go?
- Home, my Lord.
- I'll have you stay here awhile.
But my Lord...
Apartments will be prepared for you here in the palace.
- But, my Lord, I must go home.
- That is not possible.
- By what right do you speak?
- In the King's name.
- The King has just said I may go.
- The King is a sick boy.
I can have but one concern, his well-being.
My physicians tell me that your presence here in the palace will speed his recovery.
So... you will stay.
And so, milord, I ask for your consent to the betrothal of your daughter to my son.
My Lord, you do us great honor.
And your son, milord, is he of the same mind with yourself?
My son has not been told.
But when he is told, he will do as he is told.
Well, Arundel, horse-riding and here I am.
- And welcome.
- My father sent for me.
- He did?
- For what?
For what? Milord Warrick will tell you that himself.
Whenever my father sends for me
I have no pit to my stomach...
- ...and my blood runs cold.
- What mischief have you been about?
I?
It's what he's about.
- An intriguer from his birth.
- Milord!
Indeed I have little doubt that he selected his own parents...
...and arranged to be born in the best bed chamber.
- Where's Jane Grey?
- About the palace. Our men watch her.
- Why do you watch me?
- Watch you?
- Why should I watch you?
- You're one of Warrick's spies.
Most certainly I'm not.
Do you hate him too?
Well, er... He's not always easy to get on with.
- I ask your pardon, sir.
- Oh, don't go.
Tell me.
Why do you hate this Warrick with such violence?
He said it was for the King's sake
I should stay here.
Yet I have not seen the King, not once.
- And now everywhere I'm followed.
- Followed?
I reach a door my way is barred,
I know not why.
I'm afraid.
I wake up at night with the sound of his name in my ears.
My Lord Warrick, my Lord Warrick, my Lord Warrick!
My Lord Warrick will speak with you, milady.
- Arundel.
- Milord?
- Who is that girl?
- Jane Grey.
- Jane Grey? What do they want with her?
- Milord Warrick will acquaint you.
- When?
- In his own good time.
Mother, all my life till now
I've availed you in everything.
But I'll not avail you in this.
Jane, I'm amazed that you should be so willful, so headstrong, so undutiful!
- Father!
- My dear, you must be guided by us.
But I'm not being guided by you.
My Lord Warrick has arranged this for some purpose of his own.
- You will obey your parents in this.
- I will not!
- You will marry my son...
- I will not!
- ...the betrothal will take place tomorrow.
- I will not!
- At noon.
- I'll not!
- All arrangements have been made.
- I'll not, I'll not!
I'll not, I'll not, I'll not!
I'll not.
Guard!
Guard!
This way!
Who is it? Halt!
- Why do you follow me?
- Your pardon, my lord.
Thank you for saying it was you.
Well... it was me.
But, er...
What were you doing?
I was running away.
Warrick again?
They want me to marry his son.
I'll never marry him.
But... why haven't they told...
Warrick's son.
Haven't they?
No.
How did you know that?
Well... I know him.
My Lord, who are you?
Ask me more of Warrick's son.
Don't mention his name again.
I hate him as I hate his father.
I'll not marry him.
If you'll not marry him, he'll not marry you.
I know this Guildford Dudley better than anyone in the world. I'll vouch for him.
So... your word you'll not try and escape tonight.
Your word, I pray you!
You have it.
And I'll keep it.
As I know you will.
The solemn deed of covenant and betrothment... between, on the first part, the Lord Guildford Dudley, son to Sir John Dudley,
Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warrick and Duke of Northumberland,
Knight to the most noble
Order of the Garter, and in the second part,
Lady Jane Grey, daughter to Sir Henry Grey,
Baron of Ashley, Bonneville and Harrington.
Marquess of Dorset, and Duke of Suffolk,
Knight of the most noble
Order of the Garter, and of his wife, the Lady Frances Brandon. daughter to Mary, Queen Dowager of France, and sister to His Late Excellent
Majesty Henry VIII,
King of England and Lord of Ireland.
How is it with Your Majesty?
Sleepy, Warrick, I couldn't sleep.
You must rouse yourself to sign your name.
What is it?
A deed naming as your successor,
Jane Grey.
I'll not sign it!
I'll not sign it.
She should never be Queen, never!
She wants to live in the country where she's left alone and she's happy.
And she shall!
I won't make her Queen!
To be treated as I have by people like you!
Who care nothing for us, nothing for England, nothing for the people!
Only your own power.
I'll not sign it!
I'll not sign it!
You can't make me!
I'll die first!
Die!
I'll beat you that way!
Paste the King's signature on this.
You shan't do it!
Come back!
Come back! You shan't do it!
I'll tell them what you've done.
I'll tell everyone in England.
I'll tell them all what you are!
I'll tell them...
How lovely it is. How peaceful.
And most blessed of all, how far away from London.
I feel I never want to see
London again.
You're happy, aren't you?
It's lovely to be able to look into the future.
It can be so full of joiety one wants to laugh.
I'll race you back to breakfast.
What means this?
It means His Majesty Edward VI is dead...
...and that your wife is Queen.
Queen Jane of England.
Queen?
No... it can't be.
It can't be.
Your Majesty, your cousin before his death made his last will...
...naming you as his heir.
But I don't wish to be Queen.
In the name of all here present, we swear ourselves as your loyal and faithful subjects, ready to serve you in all things.
My lords and gentlemen, I thank you, all of you.
But I refuse.
A refusal is impossible.
There is no escape from this.
My Lord, I'm no longer still a child.
- No longer in your palace.
- Your Majesty, hitherto we have met only, I fear, as enemies.
But today there is a vital need that we should act in complete accord.
I have no wish to act in accord with you.
Your Majesty, you must think of your country, not of yourself.
Today you are acclaimed Queen in London.
The bells are ringing, the streets are full with people shouting your name.
If you refuse, though Mary Tudor is hated by the people, there are those that will raise an army on her behalf.
It would mean... civil war.
Will you bear the responsibility for that?
Your Majesty, it is not only your right, it is your sacred duty to take your place on the throne.
If so be, it is my duty.
I will rule over my people...
...as well as I'm able.
And as gently...
This I can promise you.
There will be no more of revenge, and cruelty, and bloodshed.
Amen to that.
God bless Your Majesty.
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Long live the Queen!
- Who comes?
- Whose men are you?
- Mary Tudor's.
- Lead me to her.
My Lord.
You must go no further down the road, madam.
Warrick's men wait for you in ambush.
It is my duty. My brother has sent letters desiring to see me.
Your brother is dead.
Dead?
- But the letters?
- Forged by the milord Warrick.
He has put the child Jane on the throne and seeks to entrap you while he may.
Those forged letters were the bait, so I beseech you go not a step further.
Back now to safety. Then you can raise the eastern counties to your cause.
- This will mean blood.
- Peace, Father.
Have I not courage to shed blood if it be my duty?
In God's sight I am Queen.
And in His name will I raise my standards.
You have earned our thanks.
Let the torches be put out.
We ride back.
Tomorrow we hold Council... and shall be proclaimed Queen.
Whereas our most mighty sovereign and ruler
Jane, Queen of England and of Ireland, does this day intend and purpose to enter into her capital city of London, and proceed to her palace of the Tower,
- The Queen's most excellent...
- God bless Queen Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the...
Your Majesty's keys.
I'll tell you, milord, what it will be like if not.
Last night bonfires burnt in every street...
...and the people danced around them shouting Mary.
- Mary the Queen.
- And take over an English fool?
Mary Queen might be a danger.
I have sent Gates to put her under arrest.
- Even now she is his prisoner.
- Milord!
She had tidings of my approach and fled to Suffolk.
The eastern counties have flocked to her support. We are as good as lost!
- Unless we act at once!
- How would milord Arundel act?
Take course for Mary's camp.
Throw ourselves on her mercy.
That from the man who's the first to kneel to my daughter.
Our decision was a wrong one, we have yet time to undo it!
Quiet, milords!
You are losing your heads now in such a way...
...as to make sure of losing them later on the scaffolds.
If by your pleasure in deceit you stray to Mary, which one of you will be able to wipe your hands clean...
...of what you have already done?
So...
If there is any one of you that will feel more safe with Mary, let him go now.
Good.
I ride this this hour to meet the rebel army.
If you remain united behind me,
I have no doubt of the result.
I leave the Queen's majesty here in your keep.
Why did this have to happen?
When will we run our horses now...
...galloping back to breakfast?
We were looking into the future then.
How little we knew.
But the future's still ours.
Have your horses saddled and be prepared to ride full-armed within the hour.
My Lord!
The rebel Mary has dared to raise an army against your men.
But must you take my husband?
Jane... he is my son.
And I believe my love for him is as great as yours.
I take him with me because that's where his duty lies.
Say your goodbyes and come.
Must you go?
If I did not go, I should be a coward.
Jane, we're both doing what we must.
Our duty.
And we must help each other, without flinching.
Fair you well.
Your Majesty.
- No news, no sign? Nothing?
- Nothing, Your Majesty.
But there's no need for you to fret.
Milord Warrick never yet lost a battle.
Thank you.
Warrick is taken!
Mary's army marches on London!
Milords!
The bells! That means he's back.
My husband's back!
I pray so. Nine days a queen and little but trouble to show for it.
- My Council's sitting. I must ask them.
- My dear, best stay where you are.
A queen doesn't go ask for news, it is brought to her.
No, I can't wait.
You can come down from there, my dear.
You're no longer Queen.
Warrick is defeated, Mary is proclaimed, and all your counselors have deserted you.
- And my husband?
- Alive and unhurt.
Then... we can go home.
Jane Dudley, I arrest you in the name of Her Majesty Queen Mary.
- A pretty end, milord.
- Not quite the end.
- Ellen!
- My dear, you must be patient.
Now that Mary is crowned Queen, she will be merciful.
I'm not patient.
I fear for my own courage.
Her Majesty, Queen Mary.
Cousin, you have done that for which I as Queen can have but one answer.
There must be no shadow of doubt in the mind of any...
...that for high treason there can be but one punishment.
- You wish my death?
- I do not wish it.
You are young and I think less guilty than those around you.
Though I may feel pity,
I can show no mercy.
Your Majesty, myself I admit my fault.
I have done a great wrong against you.
But my husband, what has he done?
- He is your husband.
- It's his father's business.
- Which makes his case the poorer.
- He had no choice.
I have no choice. Security of my kingdom demands that he shall die.
Why must you all build your greatness on the graves of others?
Why cannot there be triumph without...
...suffering?
Child, you speak out of your ignorance.
You forget the verities of government.
If I should spare your husband and yourself, there are those who would lead an army on your behalf...
...and then two thousand would die in the place of two.
Now you understand.
You and your husband must die.
Then...
...he will meet his end bravely.
As I hope I shall.
Cousin Mary.
Bare me no malice.
In what I did I meant you no harm.
I was Queen...
...for so short a while.
We're ready... milady.
Is it cold today?
It is, milady. Bitter cold.
My cloak.
I mustn't seem to shiver...
...lest they think I'm afraid.
Will your ladyship forgive me?
Most willingly.
Jane, would you like to take a holiday from gravity of manners and come to London?
We're giving you a great chance, your father and I.
There's no knowing what may come of it.
The devil's playground.
I think you'd be better in the country.
I want your solemn promise that you'll go.
You were right about Warrick and wanting to go back to the country tomorrow.
So, you will stay.
You will obey your parents in this.
You will marry my son.
So, your word you will not try and escape tonight.
We're only doing what we must.
Our duty.
Long live the Queen!
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills...
...from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved, and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord Himself is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy defense upon thy right hand
The sun shall not smite thee by day...
...neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil.
Yea, It is even he that shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in...
...from this time forth.

Now, look here. That's a river.
Water. Ganges.
Is that the Mutier escarpment?
What river is that?
No one ever crosses that river... because beyond that is the Mutier escarpment.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time with him.
He's working himself into a juju.
All right, Riano. Take him away.
Very helpful, I don't think.
Always the same old tales.
Mutier escarpment too strong, too high.
What they mean is if the elephants have a burial place... that's the elephants' business, and we've no right to butt in.
- Perhaps we haven't.
- What?
And let $1,000,000 of ivory go to rot under the earth?
Just how keen are you on this idea?
It means escape from this cursed hole.
- I'm keen, all right.
- So am I.
Excuse me, miss. Can I help you?
I'm Mrs. Cutten. Mrs. Dr. Cutten.
How do you do? Thank you so much.
I'm looking for my father.
I can't think why he isn't here.
I cabled him.
My name's Parker. Jane Parker.
- Excuse me. Did you say Miss Parker?
- Yes.
How exciting.
What a good chance we came down here.
Why, this is Mr. Holt, your father's partner.
- How do you do?
- What marvelous luck.
How do you do? He's still here, my father?
- He hasn't gone away or anything?
- No, he hasn't gone.
You caught him just in time.
Shall we walk along together this way, then?
- What about your baggage?
- It's here.
- I'll take care of it.
- I forgot my sketching paper.
- Will you bring it along?
- Yes, of course.
Shall we start now?
It's just a few steps along.
You see that big building on the right?
- How is my father?
- He's very well. He's always well.
- You're not letting your hair grow again?
- I beg your pardon. I didn't hear you.
I wonder if I could get that haircut, but the doctor hates old fashions.
Here we are. I don't want to butt in.
- If you'd rather see your father alone...
- Yes, I would.
I see. If there's anything that you want, let me know.
- In a community like this...
- Thank you.
Perhaps I shall see you this afternoon.
Come over to have a cup of tea...
Hello.
Jane. Whatever...
What on earth.
Darling, don't ask questions.
Don't do anything. Just be glad to see me.
What's this mean, dear? You're crying.
You mustn't do that.
No, but you're going to have to wait till I get through.
There.
There.
All through.
Let me look at you.
You're just the same.
Yes, but a bit more grizzled and moth-eaten.
That's only because you've been missing me.
- You have been missing me, haven't you?
- Missing you, my darling.
That's better.
Now say you're glad to see me, or I shall go right back.
I'm afraid you'll have to do that in any case.
Shall I?
Listen, Dad, from now on,
I'm through with civilization.
I'm going to be a savage just like you.
We'll talk about that later.
Now let me have a look at you.
Attractive.
Mighty attractive.
I don't know how I managed it.
Cable for you, sir.
Just came in by the boat.
Hello, Beamish. See who's arrived.
It isn't. It is.
Knock me for a row at ninepins if it isn't little Miss Jane.
Hello, Beamish, old boy.
But I say, what brings you to this awful hole?
That's a perfect criticism of Africa.
- What's the cable, darling?
- From you to say you arrive today.
I call that perfect service.
Hello, Holt.
What do you say to this for a surprise?
- My daughter, Mr. Holt.
- We have already met.
He was kind and got my baggage.
Did you find it?
- I did.
- Tell them to bring them in here.
- Here?
- Yes. I'll show you where to put them.
Boy, put this down here.
The dressing case down there.
And put those trunks somewhere around here.
That's grand.
Just pile them up wherever you can find room.
Look, you can just leave those there, anywhere.
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Good heavens.
I told you I'd come to stay.
But what have you got in there in all that?
Just the necessaries of life.
Can I get you a nice cup of tea, miss?
Isn't that English?
I come 6,000 miles and all I'm offered is a cup of tea.
What's wrong with a drink?
All right, I'll get you one.
- Shall I send the rest of the baggage?
- What?
I like your Mr. Holt. He's nice. Don't you?
- Six big...
- What?
I was talking about Mr. Holt.
Yes, he's a nice fellow.
We get along splendidly.
He hates Africa, too.
- Hates Africa?
- Yes.
- I don't believe it.
- Why not?
He's too strong and sturdy-looking, like you.
- I don't like Africa, either.
- I don't believe that, either.
Yes, I think I'd better be...
Darling, don't be silly.
You're not embarrassed by me.
Why, you've bathed me sometimes... and very nearly spanked me, too, several times.
Very nearly.
Perhaps if you actually had,
I wouldn't be so obstinate.
And I am very obstinate.
- What are you trying to do?
- Clean my face.
- But what's wrong with soap and water?
- Everything, darling.
Must preserve that schoolgirl complexion.
What's that?
Who are they?
The Wakumbas.
- The ones with the big hats, who are they?
- No, they're Kabaranda.
There are a couple of hundred ostrich feathers... in each of those headdresses.
What you might call putting a feather in your cap with a vengeance.
- What are they doing here?
- They come to trade.
All right, let's trade them.
You're butting into my business.
Butting in? You're mistaken.
I'm managing it.
Beamish, bring me my hat.
Do they always sing like that when they come to trade?
That's not a song.
They're invoking their gods to give them the best of the bargain.
I don't blame them.
Darling, you've done far too well out of one small store.
I don't think it's quite nice.
Look, here, young lady.
I resent that.
I must see your lady customers.
It looks as if their shopping's been successful, anyhow.
How women suffer to be beautiful.
I see you're breaking into society.
These are our very best people.
I know. I feel quite out of fashion.
Now let me show you what the well-dressed men are wearing.
Those markings on the shield mean they're the foremost warriors of the tribe.
Not really?
Why, that little fellow there, he seems quite harmless.
On the contrary.
If you read his shield, it shows that he's killed five lions.
- Really?
- Or men.
Yes, over here we have the Wakumbas.
You'll notice that their dress is entirely different.
And these natives here, are they of the same tribe?
Yes, they are.
Here's your hat.
You'll be catching your death of sun.
Thank you.
Bit early for him to start dancing, isn't it?
- Who?
- The baby. Look at him.
Jane, suppose we get a move on.
- You do think I'm a child, don't you?
- No, I've ample proof that you're not.
Look, every man his own feather duster.
Who are they?
The council of the Aloas.
Say, Parker, there's old Chief Oomtelli.
Possibly he can tell us about the Mutier escarpment.
Not a chance, Holt.
I've been trying him for years.
Darling, what is this Mutier escarpment?
When they get past this falderal... let's hope they'll be in a mood for substantial trading.
- Come on.
- Let's get along.
Father, you still haven't told me about the Mutier escarpment.
Remember my telling you a fairytale about the elephants?
Hundreds. Which one?
The one about why one never finds a dead elephant in the jungle.
Let me think.
Why, of course.
I remember.
An elephant can always tell when death is coming for him... and when he hears the call... there's a secret place to which he wanders.
A place where he can lay his bones with his ancestors.
- A place of rest.
- That's it.
The secret graveyard of the elephants.
Somewhere to the east, there's a mysterious barrier of mountains... called the Mutier escarpment.
And the natives won't say where that Mutier escarpment is.
It's sacred. Taboo.
If one of them is found even to have looked at it... he's put to death by the witch man of the tribe.
Now, Holt and I believe... that beyond that Mutier escarpment somewhere... lies the burial place of the elephants.
You do? But why?
Of course. Ivory.
Enough ivory to supply the world.
There's a €1,000,000 for the man who finds it.
- And how much do I get for helping you?
- You're not going to help. You can't.
Mr. Holt, I know you'll understand.
I do want to go so terribly.
I think if she wants to go as much as all that... she won't be a hindrance.
I think you're probably the nicest man I ever met.
Anyone's nice who gives in to you.
You disagreeable old darling.
I'm mad about you.
Leave me alone. I'm not used to this.
Can you shoot?
Like an angel.
Riano, let me have that rifle.
- Beamish.
- Yes, miss?
Hat.
Satisfied?
Quite.
I'm tired. I'm going to turn in.
Good night, Holt. Good night, my girl.
- Good night, Dad.
- Sleep well.
Tell me, am I a nuisance?
Do I get in the way at all?
Not in the least.
You've shaken down to it marvelously.
- Better put this around your shoulders.
- Thanks.
The altitude plays funny tricks with the temperature.
I'm not cold.
You may think you're not.
- You're very silent.
- I feel very silent.
You know, Jane...
I'm not a romantic sort of a person or anything like that... but if we get through this all right... is there any kind of a chance for me?
With me?
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it much.
Will you?
I thought I hated this country.
Since you're here I almost love it.
Do you, Harry?
- I'm very glad.
- Are you?
Glad you like Africa.
Oh, poof.
Now you're laughing at me.
A little bit, perhaps.
But very tenderly.
- Old man hyena sounds pretty lively.
- Horrible noise, isn't it?
Yet, I don't know. It's part of it all.
- Love it, don't you?
- Love it. Who wouldn't?
Look.
Isn't it marvelous?
And the funny part is
I feel so completely at home.
Really?
Good night, Harry.
Funny little hand... so capable and so strong... and yet, so soft and so white.
Don't crush it, Harry.
I might want to use it again.
I'm sorry.
Good night, dear. Sleep soundly.
Soundly? With all this noise?
Isn't he grand?
So proud, so fierce, and yet, so infinitely soothing.
Why, there's another one quite close.
Yes, much too close.
Keep a man on the fire all night.
Keep them going.
Yes, bwana.
Hello.
Must be a village near here somewhere.
That drum doesn't seem stationary.
It seems to be coming closer.
- It is.
- Help, bwana!
What was that?
Didn't sound like an animal.
Hold it there.
Get him some water.
- He say he look at Mutier escarpment.
- Mutier escarpment?
Make him tell you which direction. Where?
Did you get that?
We have to get him under cover.
Head back to your fires.
- What's the matter?
- They're after him. They're close.
Who are they, Harry?
What did he say?
He's looking for some fellow that's broken the big law of the tribe.
No man's passed here.
We should have seen him.
I told him that.
- They're like evil ghosts.
- Those are the Ubangis... one of the most feared and courageous tribes.
Yet they're afraid of the Mutier escarpment.
It may not be fear. It may be superstition.
To some of them, the elephant is sacred even alive.
How much more so in death?
- Have they gone?
- Far enough.
One good turn deserves another.
He'll tell us now.
Come on, get up.
He's dead.
Anyone would die who look at Mutier escarpment.
Poor fellow.
- He died too soon.
- Did he? I wonder.
He was crazy with fear, yet he managed to point.
And that's the direction in which he pointed.
And that's the Mutier escarpment, eh?
Yeah, and all we've got to do now is climb it.
Mother Earth must have some very particular secret up there...
putting up a wall like that.
Here.
- Why? Is this going to be dangerous?
- No.
All has to be done according to Hoyle, though.
Look out back there.
It's a bit tricky here.
You all right, Jane?
At the moment.
Be careful.
Steady, Jane. Don't lose your nerve.
We're all right.
What was in that pack, Parker?
Medicines, trade goods.
Poor devil.
That's too bad.
I don't suppose it could be helped.
You all right, now?
Yeah, I'm all right.
How are the rest of the boys?
- All right, bwana.
- All right. Start them going.
Now, Jane, take it easy.
Easy now.
Give me your hand.
Hold her, Holt!
- Parker. Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
Quiet, now.
All right.
- Give me your hand.
- Easy, now.
Give me your hand, dear.
Good girl!
Aren't I a fool, Harry? I'm sorry.
I'll promise to forgive you if you don't do it again.
Would you like to sit down and rest for a while?
No, really. I'd rather go on.
- You're quite sure?
- Sure.
Good girl. Come on.
- How are the rest of the boys, Riano?
- All right, bwana.
I don't think we need this anymore.
Let me help you.
Darling, you mind if I flop for a little while?
It'd do us all good to flop for a little while.
Anything you want?
Yes, a nice hot bath.
What was that?
Can't say.
- What do you make of it, Riano?
- Maybe hyena, bwana.
Maybe.
Come on.
- That was a human cry.
- Human?
Say, Parker, how do you feel about...
- going on?
- I've had enough.
I know why you're saying that.
And I'm not going to be made an encumbrance of.
I'm not frightened of a few weird cries.
Now let's get that ivory.
- Riano, come on.
- Yes, master.
- All right, Riano, come on.
- Yes, bwana.
- What's the matter?
- Boys scared, bwana.
You've got your whip.
Give them something else to think about.
- Let's be on our way, come on.
- Quick.
Another barrier.
Does that mean we lose the elephant tracks?
Yes, but with good luck we'll pick them up on the other side.
Hold on.
My gun.
They may be tough customers.
Father, without prejudice... would you say that was a friendly noise?
I'm afraid we're intruding.
- Riano, you better get the boys back.
- Yes, bwana.
Gently, dear. Slowly.
Look out. We're in for it.
Gently, Jane. The river's alive with them.
The dying elephant has to swim this.
Look there.
I'll feel much better when we've put all this behind us.
Rafts?
- Riano.
- Yes, bwana?
Cut wood for rafts. Two.
Father, look.
How's that for a touching domestic scene?
You can't tell me she's dangerous.
Dangerous? I'd hate to interfere with that child of hers.
- How are they getting on?
- All right, I guess.
Come on, Riano. We can't be here all day.
And the long one. There we are.
- Come here.
- Give me your hand.
- All right, Riano. Push off.
- Yes, bwana.
Harry, aren't you coming with us?
The boys will need a little firsthand persuasion... in order to keep going.
We'll be close all the way across.
All right, Riano. Come on. Shove off.
Watch the end here.
I don't think we'll be able to pole a straight course.
I'm willing to detour.
After all, they live here.
Get in the middle of the raft, Jane, and stay there.
All right.
I think they're just curious, don't you?
I hope so.
- Riano, gun.
- Yes, master.
- Getting nervous, Jane?
- No, not a bit.
Don't shoot wildly, Jane.
Get them around the ears, otherwise you just tickle them...
- then they're dangerous.
- I know, Harry. I'll try.
- Get him?
- I think so.
I hope so.
- We'll take the lead, Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
Come on, boys. Pole faster.
- Still like it, Jane?
- I'm crazy about it.
No, I'm crazy to have brought you here.
Why, Father, they look just like catfish on a rainy day.
Good girl!
Kill him, Holt. I missed him.
Stop poling.
Hold up, Parker. They're getting too thick.
Stay, boys, stop poling now.
What's the matter?
- Fire, Harry, fire.
- I can't. My gun's jammed.
Get him, Holt.
Get going before he comes back.
All right, now. Hurry.
Come on, boys. Push this.
Harry, look out!
He's going under your raft!
Watch out, Holt.
He's coming up underneath you.
Hurry, boys. Pole quicker.
Pole away to the other end.
Never mind me. Help this boy here.
Is he on?
It's too late to do anything about him.
Look out, boys. Here comes the herd.
Pole for shore. Come on.
Let me have your hand, Jane.
- Again, Holt.
- Right.
Here we are now.
Father, come on.
Give me a hand.
Get back in there.
Come on, Riano, let me have a gun.
They're still coming, Parker.
Don't shoot. They'll stampede.
That was friendly of someone.
- Riano, who else is gone?
- Musaki gone, bwana.
- That cry we heard from the river.
- Yes, it must have been.
You get the boys to make camp here.
I'll go see if I can pick up the trail.
- Harry, don't get lost.
- I'll try not to.
Thanks. Tooch, you come along with me.
Come on, Jane.
We'll get a little bit further from the river.
Make way, boys.
- Good. We'll camp here, Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
Put one tent there... a couple here.
- You boys can camp up there.
- Yes, bwana.
What was that?
Ape.
Look.
White, too.
Father, that cry.
Father, look.
Hello there.
Come down.
Riano, you speak to him.
He can't understand.
Call one of the boys. Try another dialect.
Come down, I tell you, or I'll shoot.
I don't think he even knows what a gun is.
After him, Riano, or we'll have the whole tribe on us.
Where'd they go, Riano?
Jane, you'd better stick close to us.
Jane, where are you?
Answer me, Jane.
- Parker.
- Why don't you answer?
- Jane, where are you?
- Parker.
What's the matter, Parker?
- Jane. He's taken her.
- What are you talking about?
Don't let me go.
Hold onto me.
He's come to get me!
Don't let him take me!
Let me...
Don't. Let me go.
Let me go, you wild beast!
Get off me! Let go!
Stop!
Let me go, you brute.
Take your hands off me.
Take him away.
Thank you.
- Thank you for protecting me.
- Me?
I said, thank you for protecting me.
- Me.
- No.
- I'm only me for me.
- Me.
No. To you, I'm you.
You.
No.
I'm Jane Parker. Understand?
Jane.
Yes. Jane. You?
And you?
- You.
- Tarzan.
That's right.
Please stop. Let me go. I can't bear this.
What's the use?
Yes. I am hungry.
Hungry.
Tarzan, where are you going?
Tarzan, don't go without me.
I'm afraid of her.
Tarzan, take me with you.
Wait. I'm coming.
Jane! Hello!
Father, here I am! Here in the tree!
I'm here. Father.
Hold it.
Father, here I am. Here in the tree.
Bwana, look there.
All right, Jane. We're coming.
We're coming. Keep still now.
Don't come down, dear.
Stay where you are. We'll help you down.
- Quick, Riano. Get up the tree.
- Yes, bwana.
Go, Riano. Look out for that big ape.
Harry, don't shoot!
There now.
It's all right, dear. Don't cry.
Get the boys together, and let's get away from here.
Wait a minute, Parker. He may come back.
No, let's go quickly, please.
Hurry.
All right. Come on, boys.
You're in a queer mood, Jane.
Yes, I know.
It must have been a terrible shock.
I've been reproaching myself all the time.
Reproaching yourself? Why?
My dear, you don't need to.
What is it?
- Were you very frightened?
- At first.
I thought he was a savage.
Now I find out he wasn't. That's all.
I can't make it out. How did he get here?
What does it matter? He's happy and...
At least he was until...
Father, did you hear his cry when that ape was shot?
- He'd probably never been unhappy before.
- My dear, he's not like us.
He's white.
Whether white or not, those people, living a life like that... they've no emotions.
- They're hardly human.
- Human.
He's human, all right.
Riano, send some of the boys out for firewood.
Am I interrupting anything serious?
Jane's got a theory that you were wrong in killing that ape.
- Wrong?
- Cruel.
To whom?
To him.
Why do you laugh, Harry?
Isn't that the best thing to do?
- Is it funny?
- Funny? Extremely.
That you should be considering the feelings of a man-ape.
It's a pity I didn't put two bullets into him and finish the job.
I wouldn't talk like that.
Don't you think it's being melodramatic and absurd?
- Absurd?
- Extremely.
Bwana, Mohammed dead in water.
- How did it happen?
- Riano find man's footprint in mud.
You better call the rest of the boys back into camp.
You don't think he did it?
I don't know.
Harry, you can't do that.
- He isn't a wild animal.
- He's a murderer.
So were you to him when you killed that ape.
We can't stay here and do nothing while he picks us off one by one.
We've to make him understand we mean him no harm.
- I could make him listen to me.
- You can't even talk to him.
I know I could make him understand me.
Please let me try.
- It's ridiculous.
- Please let me try. It's worth it, Harry.
Shall we risk it?
- Perhaps if you think it's all right. Yes.
- All right. Go on.
You mustn't do that. You promised.
Harry, let me speak to him.
Harry, you mustn't.
Bwana.
Blood. I got him.
Tarzan.
Jane?
I wish you'd knock before you enter my boudoir.
I suppose you know that's going to make your head worse.
- Head?
- Yes, head.
Head. That thick bit under your hair.
No, Tarzan.
Oh, dear.
I really can't make you any more bandages.
You'll get dizzy. You'll fall.
You'll hurt yourself.
Stop it at once. I'm not a bit amused.
Tarzan. You see, you'll fall.
Tarzan, where are you?
Come up. Where are you?
That wasn't a bit charming.
It was just like a nasty, little boy.
- Boy?
- Yes.
Please let me go.
- Go?
- Yes, go.
- Go?
- Yes. No.
Don't let me go. Tarzan, don't.
I didn't say dunk. I said don't.
Tarzan, don't.
Nice Tarzan.
Take Jane bank.
Yeah. Bank.
Fooled you that time.
Tarzan! Watch out!
Help! Tarzan, save me!
What was that?
Where are you going?
Don't take me up. Stop.
Help, Tarzan. Don't.
I think you're the most horrible man
I ever knew.
What color are your eyes?
Yes, I know.
The color of the forest. Gray-green.
I wonder what you'd look like dressed.
Pretty good.
You'd be a great success in London... and I believe you'd love it.
Or would you?
Women are such fools.
They'd spoil you.
I don't think you'd better look at me like that.
You're far too attractive.
I love saying things to a man who can't understand... who doesn't even know what kisses are.
Love it.
I daresay you would.
I think we'd better land.
Bank. Land.
Let go, Tarzan.
Go under.
Got you.
Where are my boots?
I do wish you wouldn't be so playful.
Give me those boots.
Tarzan, please give me those boots.
Tarzan, let go of my foot.
That hurt me.
Don't be so funny. Now let go.
All right. When you've quite finished,
I'll put my boots on.
Tarzan, you're tickling. Stop.
- Love it?
- No such thing.
You can't get round me like that.
There's quite a difference, isn't there?
Do you like that difference?
You've never seen anyone like me before, have you?
Tarzan, where are you going? Don't go.
Tarzan, please.
- What's going on here?
- Boys tired, bwana.
Tired? Give me that thing.
You tired?
Is anybody else tired?
Come on.
What am I doing here... alone, with you?
Perhaps I better not think too much about that.
Just be here... be happy.
And I am happy.
Not a bit afraid.
Not a bit sorry.
I wish I could make you understand.
Perhaps I can. Gradually.
Come here.
What are we going to do about us?
- Us?
- You and I.
Darling, you got that right.
Tarzan. Jane.
Hurt me. Boy.
Love it. Jane.
Darling, that's quite a sentence.
Tarzan, what is it?
Riano, we'll camp here.
- Yes, bwana.
- What?
You're not fit to go on.
It's time you had a rest.
- I'm the best judge of that.
- Rest today. Go on tomorrow.
- What's the good of tomorrow to me?
- Tomorrow good like today.
You can do what you like. I'm going on.
Come on now, Parker.
Just 10 minutes will refresh you.
Come on. Please.
Just 10 minutes, but no more.
- All right. Riano, some water.
- Yes, bwana.
Those are tears, Tarzan.
You've never seen tears before, have you?
You know why they're there?
We must say goodbye.
I must go to him.
Yes, I must.
I can't do it. He loves me.
Love?
He loves me, too. I'm all he's got.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye?
Yes.
Tarzan, don't look at me, not like that.
If you do, I shan't be able to go, and I must.
Don't you see?
Goodbye, my dear.
Why, he's brought me back.
Daddy.
There. You're all right, dear.
Don't go!
Come with us. We'll all go back together.
Jane, dear, you belong to us, and he brought you back.
Now you must let him go.
- He belongs to the jungle.
- Not now.
He belongs to me.
No, my child.
Stay where you are.
Not a move out of anyone.
Can't stay here and be taken.
If we resist, we'll be butchered.
- Hand over your gun, Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
If we do nothing, we stand a better chance of getting away.
Perhaps you're right.
Are these pygmies?
No, they're dwarves.
Ready, Jane?
Yes, I'm ready.
- The drums are getting louder.
- We're getting nearer.
- Nearer what?
- I wish I knew.
Go to Tarzan, Cheetah!
Give me your hand, dear. It's dark in here.
- It is dark, isn't it?
- Don't show any fear.
I'll try not to.
Father, stay close.
Harry, look!
Bwana!
Why have we stopped?
Is something wrong?
Tarzan, what is it? Look, he's wounded.
He wants them to change mounts.
No, we must go on.
But, Daddy, he's dying.
I know. Our one chance...
The elephants' graveyard.
If he's dying, he'll take us there.
But, Daddy, you can't. You're hurt.
No, I'm all right.
He's our one chance.
Tarzan, we must go, too. Understand?
Tarzan, with him.
It's beautiful.
Solemn and beautiful.
We shouldn't be here.
It's riches. Millions.
Parker, it's true.
We knew, didn't we?
Father, what is it?
We came this way once before.
There's something sad about retracing.
You've been very brave, Jane.
He found what he was looking for.
I know that somewhere, wherever the great hunters go, he's happy.
I can't bear to let you say goodbye like this.
Goodbye?
You'll be coming back, Harry.
I can see a huge safari with you at the head... bearing ivory down to the coast.
Only this time, there'll be no danger... because we'll be there to protect you every step of the way.
I am sorry Gentlemen.
I realize this places you in an awkward position.
But I know these Comanche's.
Particularly I know Chief Stand Alone.
If he has made up his mind to fight,
He is going to fight.
- That is all there to it.
-We are sent here to talk peace with the Indians.
What are we to say to the president?
I can't take responsibility, of permitting you to go any further into Indian country.
Col! Our instructions from president clearly states that you will provide us with an army escort!
An escort?
You see that ridge over there.
The first one...
Our entire force couldn't move a mile beyond that without a pitch battle.
I don't think that you would be much use to the president without your scalps.
Sentry reports amount of force in Indian form.
Looks like an attack.
They two in front.
They look like white men.
Those Indians were escorts!
Hold your fire.
Howdy colonel!
- What's the meaning of this corporal?
Meet colonel Grant!
- How do you do colonel?
Who are you?
My name is Stanley.
I am a reporter for The New York Herald.
Newspaperman?
Didn't you know better that to take this...
Civilian into Indian territory?
I tried to talk him out of it. But he is so dead set on seeing the old chief...
- Chief San Tata?
- Yep!
You mean to say you saw chief san tata?
I am sorry I cannot tell you that.
Come on Jeff! We got to get the railroad and telegraph our story back to New York
Just a moment Mr. Stanley!
This is field head quarters for the United States army.
These two gentlemen are the
Presidents' peace commissioners.
You will oblige me by answering their questions.
- Sorry colonel! I cant do that.
- You cant? Or you wont?
Well if you want to put it that way colonel.
I wont.
Suppose I place you under arrest.
Maybe that will change your mind.
You can't arrest me colonel. I know my rights.
My paper sent me to get a story and I got it.
All of this is the exclusive property of our boss. James Bennet.
Presidents going to hear about this.
He will hear about, when everybody else does.
When he will read the New York Herald.
- Come on Jeff!
- Good day Colonel.
What's the matter? Roughness?
No, I take these to help me mind my own business
Just a moment gentlemen.
I have listened to you with patience.
Now, apparently you don't like the way
I run my paper.
But it's my paper and that's the way
I intend to run it.
I intend to feature in the Herald first and upto the minute news of sensational events.
And for your information senator, I intend to go on telling the truth
About graft and corruption in high places.
More prominent the rascal.
The bigger the news.
And furthermore gentlemen I intend to continue making news
While my competitor sit around waiting for it to happen.
Now suppose we get down to the business that brought you here.
You came to buy me out. Didn't you?
Well that is more or less what we planned to discuss with you.
And now if you would let us know your lowest price of the herald.
One-cent daily and 5 cents on Sundays.
What is it Albert?
- Mr. Stanley is here Sir!
- Well, show him in.
Hello Stanley! That was a great story.
- Thanks!
Welcome back!
Bennet is waiting to pin a leather medal on you.
Hello, Mr. Stanley!
-Well, how are you?
Say were those real Indians?
-It's the realest Indians that you ever saw.
Billy, I want you to meet Jeff Slogan.
The best Indian scout in whole Wyoming territory
Keep an eye on him for me but don't believe everything that he tells you
As a matter of fact Billy, don't believe anything that he tells you.
- Glad you are back Mr. Stanley!
-How are you?
Mr.Bennet's waiting for you.
Stanley! Glad to see you.
Sit down.
Another delegation from Boss Tweed still trying to buy me out.
How about letting me do a series on the graft sometime
The job you did in Wyoming. Great story.
Reaped the town with it. Reaped the whole country.
You happen to have a man Sloke still in your expense account.
He took care of me like a baby there.
I promised him a trip to New York.
If we came out with our hair where it should be. It's on you.
All right! All right! I am glad that you are still alive.
- Me too!
- Have a cigar!
- Thanks!
Stanley! What do you know about Livingstone?
- Living. You mean the new bar tender at Joe's?
- No, no, Dr. Livingstone. The missionary, explorer
- Dr. Livingstone.
Like to read a good newspaper once in a while.
Like the London Globe.
Read that. Just came over the Atlantic cable.
The London Globe's expedition to Africa to find Dr.Livingstone.
Has just returned to Zanzibar, the African interior.
Mr.Garreth Tyce the leader of the expedition
And son of the publisher has prostrated the tropical fever.
The expedition however reports that it has obtained positive truth That Dr. Livingstone is dead.
Well that settles the old boy.
If I can prove that Tyce is wrong about Dr. Livingstone..
I will make him a laughing stock of every newspaper office.
- Now get ready... you are going to Africa.
- What?
I will have that old fool on toast.
- Oh now, wait a minute! Wait a minute.
While you are having that old on toast what am I supposed to be doing?
- Finding Livingstone!
- Oh I see! Is that all?
You are not losing your nerve, are you?
-Now wait a minute Mr.Bennet...
I have got a little reputation of my own.
Where do I come off?
Suppose this old 'what's his name' is alive and I prove it..
Where is your reader's interest?
Where is your story?
You don't suppose that I will be sending you all the way to Africa, if there weren't any story?
For a whack at Tyce, you send me ... you know it
- Oh, no, forget about Tyce, he is nothing to me.
- It's the story I am interested in.
- Well where is it?
How many people have ever heard about Livingstone?
A great many more than you think.
Christians who believe in spreading the
Word of God, among the heathen.
Enemies of slavery, who know how a magnificent fight he is making against the slave traders.
How many of those people read The Herald?
In all the millions. The plain common
Everyday people, who derive excitement...
From reading the adventures of a heroic figure in the dark places of the earth.
There is your reader interest, Mr. Stanley.
Dr. Livingstone is a great adventurer.
One of the greatest. Come here.
I will show you something.
The Dark Continent.
Mystery, heat, fever, cannibals
A vast jungle in which
You can loose half of America.
A land in which even the greatest conquerors never dared to penetrate.
Alexander, Ceaser, The Pharos of Egypt.
None of them unchanged, untouched.
Since the dawn of history.
Somewhere, somewhere in there a grand old man, a man of God
Who has given his life to spreading his light in darkness.
There is your story!
A real story.
But if you don't think so...
Besides it would be extremely dangerous.
So perhaps its just better you forget about it.
Lets see. You said you wanted to do a series on Boss Tweed...
Harper's Weekly has a young artist named Thomas Nast.
Who has been doing some sensational cartoons
On the Tweed ring.. Better have a talk with him
Where was he heard of last?
- Who Tweed?    - Livingstone.
Somewhere in Tanganyika district.
You will find Nast up at Harper's.
- How long will it take to get there and back?
-Harpers?
-Tanganyika!
- Maybe a year two or three
You think it will make a great story?
I mean finding Livingstone.
The greatest story in the history of journalism.
If you get it.
- I will go.
- The steamer sails from London on Saturday.
I have already reserved passage for you.
Draw 5000 dollars now and when it's gone
Draw another 5000, and when it's gone draw another and another and another.
But find Livingstone.
- Suppose Tyce is right and Livingstone is dead?
Well then there is no story.
- I think there is.
I will bring him back on alcohol for new museum on 14th street.
Might call it green, might call it blue but doggone you just can't call it red.
- Howdy!
- Beg your pardon?
I just said howdy.
- Oh! How do you do!
- Is it always that color?
- What color?
- Well it ain't red!
- As a matter of fact it isn't.
I ain't seen you before.
When did you get on board?
I came about last night on Suez.
- You live in this part of the country?
Beg your pardon!
- I said, you live down in this part of country?
- No my home is in London.
-London! That's where those Englishmen come from. Ain't it?           -I am afraid so.
- Hello! There Stan! Where have you been?
I want to introduce you to my young friend Mr. Stanley. This is.. Mr..Mr..
I didn't quite catch your name partner!
- It's Tyce. How do you do!
Did he said Tyce?
- Well I thought that he said
Jeff! If Mr.Tyce is who I think he is
Then I am going to raise your salary.
Mosey around at the back.
-Beautiful weather. Isn't it?
- Yes! It's delightful.    - A little hot.
Is that the London Globe? Well.. Well..
Do you mind if I look at this?
- No of course not.
- Thank you.
I will be lost without my Globe!
- You read the Globe. Do you?
- Religiously!
- Quite a good paper don't you think?
- Finest in the world of its kind.
- But you are an American aren't you?
- Yes. Quite a large percentage of Americans read.
- Really! You don't say so.
I guess you don't remember me!
Stanley... Henry. M. Stanley.
Yes! We just met. I am the publisher of The Globe you know.
- Really! Well you certainly should be proud of it.
- Thank you. Thank you..
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yes. Thanks. Thanks...
This expedition of yours to find
Dr.Livingstone
Few publishers would have had the courage and the editorial shrewdness to attempt it.
Yes! We like to be progressive in life.
My son you know led the expedition.
He is desperately ill ever since. Poor lad!
I am on my way to Zanzibar to bring him home.
At least his illness wasn't in vain. Since he solved
The mystery of Dr.Livingdston's disappearance.
- Then your son did find him?
- Well ... virtually. It won't incline to split hairs...
He didn't actually find the grave. But he did
Interview people who were present at his death.
You mean he took their word for it, that
Dr.Livingstone is dead?
- Well yes. Why do you ask?
- Well. I was wondering if...
There were any more evidence of his death than that had already appeared in The Globe?
It's not our policy to withhold news from public.
The Globe prints all the facts & nothing but the facts.
- Even when all of them are rumors.
- Rumors? What do you mean rumors?
Well I mean. The evidence like that will hardly hold in the court of law.
- Are you a lawyer?
- No.. no.. I am a newspaperman.
- A newspaperman!
- Yes, I am a reporter at New York Herald.
For Bennet! That sensational mongrel with his pushy Yankee ride?
Would you mind telling me Sir, what are you doing here on your way to Zanzibar?
Well no...Mr.Bennet has send me to try to find Dr.Livingstone.
Lord Tyce! ... You forgot your paper.
- Got a matchstick?
- Yeah1
This isn't any different color from Mother Ocean.
Made no difference for me then
Nice and quiet now, but I get a feeling that I ain't going to enjoy this trip.
Jeff, I have a got a hunch better than any.
Globes story about Livingstone death is nothing but a trumped up lie from start to finish.
Some people just ain't got any respect for the truth.
Now son, if you will excuse me.
I have got some business.
Missy! Missy!
Yes, what is it?
- Big ship... she come.
- Send the carriage to the dock immediately.
- Father! The boat is in.
- Splendid... splendid.
Darling do be a dear and change your clothes and be brushed up before Lord Tyce gets here.
-Who my dear?
- Lord Tyce.
- We are expecting him, aren't we?
- Yes. And you must make a good appearance.
After all while the counselor is away.
You are the representative of Her Majesty's govt.
Yes, yes my dear...
To be sure I am, I will wear my uniform
Father your uniform is appropriate when you are in China.
But I have your other suit all washed and ironed.
That would be so much better.
- Yes. Yes. My dear. You are right. Quite right.
- All right now. Come along and please hurry.
The ship is already in. I have send the coach for your father.
- Good
- Did you take your quinine?
Is that all you have to say to me.
While it is almost an hour since I have seen you?
-Did you take your quinine?
- No!
- Must you leave everything for me to think off?
I was reading and the time slipped by.
Gareeth, do you think your father will be able to have us transferred back home?
No question he has the influence.. but a tough old bird is the Governor.
Doesn't believe in doing any favors. He expects everybody to be aggressive & self-reliant as he is.
That's why I am in such a constant trial.
- I am frightened to death of him already
- You needn't be.
He wont be able to resist you.
As if anyone could.
I beg your pardon!
Is this Mr.Kingsley's house?
I have some business with him.
Are you Mrs.Kingsley?
- Miss Kingsley.
- I am Stanley. I am a reporter at New York Herald
- I see. Mr. Stanley,
Could you possibly come tomorrow instead?
I could possibly. But I would like to see him tonight.
- We are dining here.
- I envy you.
- We have guests here... excuse me.
- Oh! Here you are. Pls help me tie this tie.
- Father you promised you would wear white suit.
- Oh yes. Of course I am.
- Goodnight Miss Stanley. I am sorry if
I have disturbed you.
Oh! There is someone at the door.
- How do you do!
- How do you do Sir!
This is Mr. Stanley. He has business with you but I told him that you are dining..
Oh of course of course. Delighted to have you
Any friend of Eve is welcome.
By all means stay and dine with us.
Happy to have you.
Well thank you! It's very kind of you.
If you wish to stay Mr. Stanley you are welcome.
Did you remember to open the wine?
The wine? Oh! Yes, yes. I will see to it at once.
You will make Mr. Stanley at home. Wont you!
Perhaps you better come in and meet the other guests.
And once we get out of this abominable climate just as soon as possible.
This is Mr. Stanley. Lord Tyce.
- Yes I already had the pleasure of meeting him.
- And Mr.Tyce.. Mr. Stanley.
- How do you do!
Lord Tyce and I had a very interesting chat on the boat coming down.
This is the gentleman who as good as insinuated that we are both liars.
Come father! What you told me the worst
Mr. Stanley thinks we are poor newspapermen.
So you intend to have a whack at it yourself?
- Certainly. Why not!
- I wish you luck.
- Thank you.
- I hope you don't have to be carried out.
- That's a stupid waste of time and money.
Why should we worry about Bennet money?
I have got nothing but a...
Well, well, well! Here we are.
I see you all know each other.
Mr.Tyce led the expedition to find Dr.Livingstone.
- Mr. Stanley is here for the same purpose.
Oh really! Bless my soul. Splendid. Splendid.
I knew the Doctor well, very well.
Great man! Of course you know this was his house. He lived here.
He still lives here. ...
You know so many things he brought back.
I am sure you all are starving.
We are dining in the garden.
Lord Tyce! You haven't eaten anything.
Can I get you something else?
Mr. Stanley, may I enquire, where the idea originated of this wild goose chase in Africa?
It was Bennett's idea. I think he got it from the London Globe.
I thought so. I knew it.
Another of his cheap Yankee tricks.
The man who finds Dr.Livingstone, will be doing a great service to the world.
I am glad you said that Mr.Kingsley!
Because I need your help.
I would like to get a pass to go to the island of Pimply
I understand while the councilor is away
You are the man giving one.
They say Pimply is unhealthy for white men.
- I will take my chances on that. -
- How about it Mr.Kingsley?
- What?
- The pass... to Pimply!
- Oh yes, yes yes. By all means.
- I shall be happy to provide you with a pass.
- May I remind you.
You forgive me for intruding Mr.Kingsley.
But it seems to me
That you are taking you on an extremely grave responsibility.
Mr. Stanley is not a British subject... and if anything unpleasant should happen to him
Mr.Bennet, his employer is quite capable of asking embarrassing questions of the foreign office.
Thank you Lord Tyce.
I appreciate your concern.
I relieve you of all responsibility Mr.Kingsley.
Well in that case their cant be any possible objection.
- Father Mr. Stanley is a newcomer here.
He knows nothing about Pimply or its dangers.
If anything would happen to him you would still be responsible.
Oh yes! You are right. I think it's a matter for the councilor himself to decide...
- But Mr.Kingsley...
- No, no no my boy! Eve is right.
When the councilor returns
I will put in a good word for you.
Thank you Miss Kingsley. It was nice of you to take in a poor fellow and treat him so gently.
My respects to your father and the guests...
I would just go out this way.
Thank you again for your help.
A pass would have meant a great deal to me.
Mr. Stanley!
I am sorry if I have ruined your plans.
- You have plans of your own Miss Kingsley.
I had to do it to please Lord Tyce.
It's desperately urgent. About my father.
What's your father has got to do with this?
- I simply got to get him back to England.
- Why?
You have seen him. You have talked with him.
You know how he is.
I didn't see anything unusual for a man of his age. of his age? He is barely fifty.
Africa has done this to him.
It's killing him
Just as it killed my mother.
And the cruel pitiful thing about it is.
He still thinks he loves the place.
He doesn't want to leave it. It's in his blood.
Just as it was with Livingstone and all the rest.
That's what I meant when I said
Livingstone still lives here.
There is never a moment when his shadow is not over this house.
I know what he has done. He is a humanitarian.
But everybody can't follow in his footsteps.
And look at father... it has only made him sick...and made none happy.
I must get him away before its too late.
I am sorry. If I knew I wouldn't have butted in.
Don't worry about the pass. I will get along.
- Stan!
- Where have you been?
I was with everything from
Jackass to wagon train
But never had no such trouble with
Half of these Janzabarians...
All right, lets shove off
- Mr. Stanley.
- Wait a minute
- Are you completely out of your mind?
- Maybe, why?
You are going to Pimperley without a pass.
- That's where the slave buyers go. Isn't it?
Yes. But not white men. They hate the white
For trying to stop the slave trade.
And worst of all they hate Dr.Livingstone.
If they were ever to find out the information that you are after
What else did Lord Tyce asked you to say.
I am sorry, I am sorry.
I didn't mean that.
You are not the kind to do anybody's dirty work.
I realize you are trying to help me and I appreciate.
But I guess you better save your advice for somebody who has sense enough to take it.
I knew when you left me last night that you are that kind of fool
Sure. I admit it.
It didn't mean it as a compliment
I guess I am just another kind.
But if anything happens to you.
Don't hold my father responsible.
See now... black beads for. Egg beads for
Uguha. But they are not worth anything in Ufifa.
And of course brass wire and cheap cloth
Mirrors are as good as gold or anything.
Well that's all. No. No.
There is something I wanted to tell you
A letter for Dr.Livingstone and please give him my warmest regards.
That's true. I don't know where he is now.
Or even if he is still alive
Oh! And Eve said she wants to see you.
She is out in the garden
Speaking of howling savages. I remember once up in the Dakota bad land back in 58.
58! Really I remember the year well.
Let me see now. Was it 59
No that's right 58... I was making a short journey up in search of geological specimen
On the third day I began to hear war drum.
We were being pursued by large war parties.
Several tribes... their witch doctor said that
We were first class devils
I could hear them howling now. Whooo!
So you are really going?
-Yes. Thanks to you for getting me that pass.
- I wish I had never given it to you
- Why?
Because I don't want the credit for what's going to happen to you
Nothings going to happen to me.
You don't realize what's ahead of you.
Do you want to come back like all the others?
Broken.. Old before the time.
Shattered by something far too big for any of us to conquer.
Do you think you can fight Africa alone?
And win?
I guess I better make myself clear.
Conquering Africa alone or with help doesn't interest me least.
I am no explorer and I am certainly no missionary.
I am not crazy about the idea of spending the next couple of years of my life
Scouring for an old missionary with a Bible on one hand and a bag of beans on the other.
But if Livingstone alive I am going to find him.
That's my assignment.
I have got my reasons to want to fulfill it.
It is nice to know that you care of what happens to me.
- Wish me luck
- I do with all my heart.
- I wont forget that.
- Make way for her majesty's force marine
- Oh Garetth! That's wonderful
- Well how does it seem walking again?
It gives me an earnest desire to sit down.
So you are really going eh!
You should have heard the Governor
When he learned that you are about ready to start.
He thinks that you are trying to blast the foundations of British Journalism.
- He would soon think of blowing up West Ministers abbey.
- Oh! You needn't explain it to me.
I am not a journalist and I have already proved that I am not an explorer.
When I was in school in Switzerland I climbed
A matador to win a 5-pound bet.
Which gave my father the brilliant idea that I was just the man
To scour the wilds of Africa for
Dr.Livingstone.
When are you leaving?
-Tomorrow morning from the mainland
- I wish you luck!
- I guess this is goodbye.
I will write to you.
Where you are going you will find quite a scarcity of post offices.
Well all right. I will deliver the letters personally when I come back.
Oh I see! Well if she isn't here
I suggest you try London.
All right I will. I hope that everything turns out the way you wanted for your father.
And by that time there were only 10 of us left.
And 6 of those were so weak from fever
That they could hardly stand... the tribes were closing in..
And when we camped that night we were completely surrounded.
- Oh! Must you be going?
- Yes! We will be moving to mainland tonight.
Have you engaged all the bearers you need? .
- The American Consulate at Bargepole has taken care of that.
Mr.Kingsley, I wish I could ell you how much
I appreciate all you have done for me.
Not at all Sir! Not at all.
I wish I could go with you.
But they tell me that I am not quite up to for the trip through the jungle now.
There is nothing to match it son. nothing to match it.
Evenings in the camp.
The breeze cool of the plateau.
A tropical river gleaming like silver in moonlight. and the feeling of life around you everywhere.
And more than anything else the knowledge that you are that you are thousands of miles away from the civilization..
As close to nature as God made it.
Well goodbye Mr. Stanley and good luck.
- Goodbye to you Sir!
- Goodbye.
- Are we following his advice?
- Of course. He is an experienced explorer.
I know nothing about his exploring but
He sure is experienced in telling warpaths.
5 days out. Weather clear but hot
Easing march in the country.
We have been climbing steadily ever since we left the coast
And the coolness of the night proves that we have already reached considerable elevation.
Ahead lies the great plateau of
Equatorial Africa. A vast area of open country.
We are the first to enter if from the point so far from the south.
We are carrying what in here in Africa
What amounts to a small fortune in trade goods.
We are hoping to conserve our food supplies as much as possible by living of the country
Water is no the problem.
This morning we saw our first game a small herd of antelope.
Although we have ran across no dangerous animals during the day.
Their tracks are everywhere
And in the night we have heard the lions hunting close to our camps. setting up a great coughing but apparently afraid of our fires.
Our guide tells us that they will only attack men when starving.
So we have little to fear from them in this land of plenty.
I would call this hunter's paradise.
The valleys are alive with antelope other game.
Including some new species that are not yet been listed by the Naturalists.
Lately we have begun to see giraffes.
Although Mr.Slokan claims that are no such animal.
Kingsley was right when he said that
There was nothing to match it.
This is no empty wilderness but swamping with life.
What old P.T.Barna will give to these specimens.
This is the greatest show on Earth.
I am afraid Miss Kingsley was inclined to exaggerate the dangers of the journey.
We have quite days and peaceful nights in camp.
Way up on a high hill with a cliff thousand feet down.. Tell them that.
Here was 500 Comanche's.
- Say.. You sure you are telling this exactly right?
- Yes Merci!
The 1000 Comanche's...
Coming closer, closer and closer...
How you say scalping in your lingo?
Now tell them that Injuns were trying to get mine.
All the Comanche's skiddale like billy blue here.
- What are they saying?
- They are saying you the biggest liar in Africa.
I had always thought of Africa in terms of jungles and swarming heat
But this open mountainous country is little different from our own great west.
Only the profusion of game. Only insects occasional strange tropical growth
Reminds us that we are approaching the heart of the Dark Continent.
Today we reached 'Chicago'
A well-populated region inhabited by
A thick chested bumptious tribe.
Who introduced us to the ancient African custom of Honga... Honga means tribute. beads cloth and wire. Grafts from the chief of all caravans passing through his territory.
Apparently the spoiled system is well established in Africa as in New York.
But the local boss treat us as a friendly group
And willing to provide us with food and guide for the next stage of our journey.
At just double the regular price.
Merci! He say that he know where the white man is.
- Where?
- In village Mombassa, two moon march.
Tell the men to start packing.
Find out all he knows.
We have been making rapid progress on the last two marches.
Gaining new strength and belief that our search is nearing an end.
In only a few weeks I should be back in Zanzibar.
I wondered whether Miss. Kingsley will be surprised to see me.
I wish she was here.
I am sure the beauties of this vast country will take away all her fears of Africa.
Thousands of flamingoes flying off towards the sunset
An omen for our success.
I find myself thinking of her often.
At last the village.
What would Dr.Livingstone be like?
White man is in there.
I don't know what to say. What do you say when you meet people in the middle of Africa?
Well you just say howdy partner.
How are things?
He is not white man.
He is Alvano.
- Lets get out of here.
- You mean he is black white man.
No. He is a white black man.
Our disappointment at Mbashi was apparently the signal for our luck to turn against us.
Last night another man was carried off by a lion and 2 more died of dysentery.
Our worst enemy.. When it strikes the men drop like flies.
The vultures follow us expectantly.
Our men are beginning to desert.
Poor devils! I wondered whether they will ever reach the coast alive.
We tramped on day after day.
Week after week .. from village to village.
Endlessly questioning. endlessly receiving the same answer 'not know' 'not know'.
It is so long since we have heard a single word of hope
That now even a false rumor will be welcome.
I am beginning to get some conception about the immensity of this country.
It is as if we have left New York on foot, hoping to find Livingstone
Somewhere between
Chicago and New Orleans.
We haven't seen any human being and savage life was all around us.
The fierce equatorial Sun was always above our heads.
I apologize to Eve Kingsley
I thought she was wrong but she wasn't.
I wonder why she was so anxious to help me.
Me a stranger who is never anything but a nuisance to her. She tried to save me..
I wonder why.. Maybe because she knew that
White men don't belong in this country.
Livingstone must be crazy. If he is alive and that I am beginning to doubt.
But I must never confess my doubt. I don't want the men to know I am getting discouraged.
They call me "Buno Nwathare' which means breaker of the path.
I will not betray their confidence in me.
Today we saw our first human beings in over 3 months.
- Slave caravan
- Them slaves?
You and Hasan stay with the men.
How do you do? Speak English?
Hasan!
He says he is surprised that there is
White men in this country.
Ask him if he knows the way to Tanganyika.
He says he just come from there.
A place they call Yum Yumbe. 4 moon nights.
He says the only best way to go there is to go through the Yum Yumbe valley.
Ask him if he saw another white man?
He said he never seen before white men in this country.
Give him my thanks and go back to the men.
That's a funny lingo.
I never heard that before.
- War drums. What they are going to gain from us?
- Figure it out for yourself.
That slavers caravan passed through this country.
- Maybe they are pow wow
- Maybe.
They are up there somewhere.
Lets take them on the far side.
Come on son.. Don't stand here in the open.
This isn't Injun fighting.
If we can only tell them that we come in peace.
Look there must be millions of them.
Should anyone ever find this diary take it to
Mr. James Gordon Bennet of the New York Herald.
Tell him that the story is written in blood of the men I am leading to their deaths. and say to Miss. Kingsley that there is a message in these pages for her alone to read.
I never should have left her. Now it is too late
When I know that I will never see her again.
I can't go back. While I can walk, I am going on and I will not leave Africa without Livingstone.
Hasan! What's the matter with the men?
- They say they stay here.. Won't go no further.
Are they crazy?
- They say they stay here and will not die.
Say that if they stay here they will die quicker there is fever here.
- Yes Master?
- Who are these men?
Native from Tanganyika. They are hunters.
- Tanganyika.. Tanganyika..
Yes Master. They want food, they are hungry and the other white man always give them food.
- Other white man... when? Where?
- In Yugigi.
What's white mans name?
Doctor...
- Dr.Livingstone...
Give them food.. Give them whatever they wanted if they guide me to Yugigi.
You stay here with sick ones until I send for you or come back. I push on with few men.
- Tomorrow.
- Now.
Our guide say that this is Tanganyika, this village Yugigi.
Livingstone's hiding place for which we have searched so long.
It's hard to believe. I am afraid it is only a feverish mirage, that will vanish before my eyes.
After all these months of disappointment, can I dare believe that I have won?
The next few moments will give me the answer.
Dr.Livingstone.. I presume.
- Yes.
Thank God doctor.
I have waited to see you.
I am thankful that I am here to welcome you Mr...
- Stanley..
You are not well Mr. Stanley
Come in.
I have had fever
I have been traveling day and night since I found out that you are here.
It's over a year since we left Zanzibar.
Sit down.
Then it isn't merely luck that you came.
No. No. I came to find you Doctor.
We have a guest for our dinner.
Set another place.
So long since I entertained that I...
Nothing short of a banquet can do justice
This is an occasion. We will have that patted pig for dinner.
You come from Zanzibar you say.
Now tell me Mr. Stanley, were you are sent by
The govt or The Royal Geographical society.
Neither I was sent by the
New York Herald.
- Newspaper?
- You are front-page news Doctor!
The whole world has been wondering of what became of you.
There are dozen rumors about your death, even that you have married a native princess.
We will settle all those rumors
When I take you back... and alive.
Then the only reason that you are sent here is to get news for your paper.
That's right Doctor.
- How can I help you?
We want the exclusive right to publish all your signed articles. Naturally we will pay you
When we are through building you up
You will be a sensation, a hero in 3 continents.
Of course you will make your own engagements.
Lectures, appearances.  Whatever you like.
I am little ungrateful. You see that I am neither lost and nor am I hiding..
If I had intended to go back
I should have done it a long time ago.
I have no intention of leaving Africa until my work here is finished.
I know how you must feel after
Undergoing such hardships to discover
That the man you are sent to rescue has no desire to be rescued.
But you see.. I have been disappointed too.
I thought that you have been sent out to help me.
No matter I mustn't quarrel with the good fortune that brought you here.
For the blessings and the bounties though have placed upon this table
Lord make me.. make us .. truly grateful.
What are you doing there?
Come on.. What did you take?
Give it to me.
What has happened Mr. Stanley?
- I caught him going through my baggage.
- Did you strike him?
- Yes. Of course.
You shouldn't have done that Mr. Stanley.
Mongo! You promised you would stop stealing.
Mongo says, that he is sorry and asks your pardon Mr. Stanley.
Forgive me for speaking to you so sharply you should never strike these simple people.
They respond in kind to the treatment they receive.
They know enough brutality without white men teaching them more.
Mongo is making excellent progress. His good behavior used to be a matter of days.
Now he can go almost a whole month without backsliding.
I am sorry that you were inconvenienced.
Goodnight Mr. Stanley.
Splendid. Splendid.
Good morning Mr. Stanley.
- Good morning Doctor
- I hope our prayer didn't disturb you.
No. Oh no. I enjoyed it.
I have send escorts for the rest of your caravan.
- Thank you.
When you want your breakfast
Just call Juma.
Well. Well. Well. What's this?
-Susie..
-Yes master
- Susie.. Fetch medicine box. lets have a look at it.
- Juma plenty of hot water.
- Yes master.
Where did you find a big thorn like that?
The other side Susie.
- Would you mind lending a little moral support?
- Gladly.
Hombre here is a soldier but here he has got a thorn on his foot.
It's gone pretty deep.
Even a soldier needs a little encouragement.
We will give all the support we got.
What can I do to help?
I think it would be better if you hold his hands. there is nothing to be afraid of.
Mr. Stanley is our friend.
Hombre is not used to strangers.
Are you Hombre?
You see in the language of his tribe stranger and enemy are the same words.
We ran out of carbolic two years ago.
We have found that the bark of one of our native...
... The bark of one of our native trees has remarkable healing qualities.
We haven't had one case of infection since we used it.
Now then.. Lets see what we have got here.
There all of it. Good boy Hombre.
Good boy.. Nice and clean.
Disinfectant!
Hombre is in splendid physical condition.
His father was a Manyewa cannibal.
If Hombre hadn't come to live here his teeth would have been plowed by now.
They are fine people the Maniyeea in many ways.
Has strict sense of honor.
Magnificent physical specimens.
They have a great capacity of leadership.
Some day Hombre will be a great leader.
Teacher...
Now keep the bandage on or you will get dirt on the wound.
Very proud of Homber.
He has real talent.
What I have seen of Africa
I say you got a job in your hand.
It's the same in all countries. How do you suppose America looked to the first settlers
Who saw it as unknown wilderness steaming with hostile savages. That's the trouble here in Africa.
Susie.. Bring my map case.
- Yes master.
White men have seen Africa only through the eyes of ignorance.
That means through the eyes of fear.
You are a newspaperman Mr. Stanley.
You know something of human nature.
I may be in the mark up to learn something more.
- What keeps the white men away from Africa?
- Lot of things I guess.
- Fear. ... Fear of the unknown.
Fear of a blank space on the map. Fill in the blank space, drive away that fear
Let me show you.
This is the watershed for the whole continent. from here spring the great rivers
That find their way to the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. solve the mystery of those rivers the Congo and the rest
Above all solve the mystery of the source of Nile which puzzled the geographers
Since the time of Ptolemy. and you drive away the clouds of ignorance and fear.
Give the world  ... an honest. Accurate
Map of Africa.
It is no longer the Dark Continent.
Then others will come...
Not only the missionaries
Doctors, teachers, pioneers...
They will bring civilization drive away the slave traders.
Spread word of brotherhood of man in the continent.
Which never before in all its history has heard one single syllable of kindness or hope.
Well I must say Dr.Livingstone you are not exactly my idea of a missionary.
Mine is a much malign profession
It is possible you know to serve ones god without entirely loosing one's human perspective.
Now if you will excuse me, its time for Sunday school.
I have persuaded Dr.Livingstone to take me with him on a visiting trip around what he calls his parish.
This is undoubtedly the largest parish
In the world, including as it does some
Thousands of square miles.
The Doctor is remarkable...
Not only does he care about
For the souls and bodies of the people of the villages where we stop
But he takes a keen interest in natural history.
Classifying the flora and fauna we come across.
Yesterday we found a new and beautiful kind of bird whom we named Eve Kingsley.
After the daughter of the Doctors old friend. also we have made several side trips and explorations
His eternal quest of filling those blank spaces on the map.
There! Now we know for certain that the Ujiji river runs into lake Tanganyika
- The lion is getting mighty inquisitive
- He won't come near as long the fire is burning.
Guess I go and make sure that it is burning good and dry
- Are we moving out in the morning?
- Yes.
The rumors of an Arab slave raid around the Unandu Territory. To the north.
- Doctor!
- It is just the current fever.
Jeff! Come on lie down a little.
Get some quinine Jeff, quick.
You have quinine?
- Yes! Yes!
My supply ran out a year ago.
You never told me you had fever.
I haven't had an attack for some months now.
I suppose it's in the bones.
Well I know one thing Doctor. When I am leaving Africa you are going with me.
No my son. If I left here
I shall never come back.
This is my life, my work.
I shall stay here until I die.
We are returning to Yujiji. Never in my life have I known a man so uncomplaining.
Even though he has fever, he is already planning his next expedition.
His next achievement. I thank God
I have been permitted to know him.
Weeks have passed quickly. Too quickly.
But all good things must come to an end.
Tomorrow Jeff and I are leaving on our return journey to our coast and all of Ujiji has turned up for a farewell party on our honor.
If we are leaving in the dawn we better be getting a shown eye. don't you think..
I have the letters for you and one for Mr.Bennet as well.
Thank you Doctor.
You know Doctor, I was thinking what a great story it would make
Doctor Livingstone discovers the source of Nile.
New York Herald expedition was with him.
You mean you will go to Lualabi with me?
- I would have if you had me.
I should be proud to have you.
You aren't planning to go to
Lualabu river.. Are you?
When can we start?
- In about six months.
- Six months!
- We can't start until the rainy season is over.
After all my son, the river has been there for thousands of centuries
And it is not likely to run away from us.
No.. But I am afraid if we are stalled for
6 months by the time we get back
Bennet will have another expedition looking for me.
But you can help if you want to.
You know what I am trying to do here.
When you write your story about how you found me here, write mine too. Be my voice.
Tell them that I need assistants.
Tell them that I need medicine.
Supplies and even geographers if it is possible.
Tell them how much work is to be done.
- Will you do that?
- Of course Doctor.
This time I know that my message will go through.
I have found myself grating in the farewell.
That sorrowful word. 'We are parting'.
I to civilization. He to his lone battle against incredible danger and hardships
Weak as he his, he thinks only of his duty and dream.
With nothing to sustain him but his own high spirit and
His enduring faith in God. Who he believes will bring all things right at last.
My guides will take you as far as Yumyum
From there you follow the watershed keeping the mountain onto your left
Till you strike the main trade route.
You should reach Zanzibar in one fifth of time that it took you to come in.
- I am counting on you my son.
- I will do my best sir. I promise you that.
I leave it with you.
May God bring you to safety.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye Doctor.
Oh Doctor! I almost forgot. Would you give this to Bongo, if you think he would like it.
I am sure he will be most grateful.
Thank You.
- Henry M. Stanley?
- Looks like there is someone to meet you son.
She must have got my cablegram
Are you Mr. Stanley?
- Yes.
- Cablegram for you.
- Thank you.
There she is. Come on.
Gentlemen I will give you my story later.
Here talk to Mr. Jeff.
Jeff! Look after the baggage.
Eve.. I beg your pardon
I mean Miss Kingsley.
I beg your pardon old man.
You mean Mrs.Tyce.
Congratulations! I knew you would do it.
- Thanks.
- What have you done about your luggage?
- Jeff's looking at it.
You get inside and talk to Eve
I will help him.
We are putting you up here you know.
- Well I am glad to see you back.
- I am glad to be back.
How stupid of me.. I forgot to congratulate Garreth.
Well then congratulate me.
- I wish you all the happiness in the world.
- Are you going to be in England long?
- No. Just long enough to take care some business.
For Doctor Livingstone
- Oh you say that so casually.
Isn't it the most wonderful thing that ever happened, finding him.
But Garreth and I were sure that you wouldn't fail.
I had help.
At times when I nearly turned back.
Something, I can't explain you what it was.
Something kept me going ahead. It was an inspiration that never failed me.
You have changed. I was wondering what is it about you, that reminded me of someone
Now I know who it is.
Its doctor Livingstone.
Doctor Livingstone?
- Yes.
You have that same look about you.
No I am afraid that you are imagining things.
I haven't changed.
I am still a reporter waiting for his next assignment.
Let me handle this. There is nothing I enjoy more than a whack at the seats of mighty.
- Sir Oliver!   - Yes! Oh Yes! Tyce..
- Forgive me for intruding Sir!
But I feel that this is truly a historic moment.
Sir Oliver French, I have the great honor to present the man who found Dr.Livingstone.
- Mr. Stanley I presume.
- Yes Sir! I am Stanley.
Mr. Stanley, this is Mr. Veil.
- How do you do sir!
Permit me to congratulate you upon your incredible accomplishment.
Incredible perhaps, but none the less accomplished.
If we seem a bit hesitant to accept Mr. Stanley's story in face value, please don't...
- I know you want the proof. Mr. Stanley has it.
- Has he?
-Mr. Stanley!
- Lord Tyce!
Did I understand that my son to say that you have proof that you found Dr.Livingstone?
Yes Sir. I have the documents here.
Dr.Livingstone instructed me to give you these Sir.
- An imposing mass of evidence I must say.
- If it was compiled by Dr.Livingstone.
-Oh father, for heavens sake be reasonable.
- I be glad to accept the judgment of the society.
- Well nothing can be fairer than that.
Very well Mr. Stanley. I will appoint a committee to examine these documents
And instruct them to make their reports at our next general meeting at Brighton.
-Thank you Sir.
- I am certain that the meeting will be 
Long remembered by all of us.
- I am certain it will. and I have here one of the letters Dr.Livingstone have supposed to entrust to Mr. Stanley and here is a letter which I personally know was written by Dr.Livingstone some 15 yrs ago when he was in England. I have carefully
compared and in all honesty I cannot conclude that they were written by the same hand.
Would you say Mr.Kringsten that they were written by two different hands?
Yes. I should say so.
But can't we assume that the trembling hand
of an old man, wracked with fever would produce a different character of writing than composed by a man in his prime. as Dr.Livingstone was 15 years ago.
- That's an assumption Sir. Not proof.
And now gentlemen the maps which Mr. Stanley claims, were drawn by Dr.Livingstone have been examined by the expert 
Cartographer Mr. Fredric Holkham.
As to the other maps of this unexplored territory and of which to compare these
Naturally I cannot accept them as correct.
Mr. Chairman!  .... - Mr.Kingsley!
- By the same reasoning
Mr.Holkham could not possibly have accepted the maps of Christopher Columbus.
Isn't it true Mr.Holkham that those maps could have been drawn as well or as poorly by a child who have never been 10 miles from London?
That's putting it rather strongly Lord Tyce.
Would you say that the rivers and mountains so generously indicated on those maps. might not exist outside of 
Mr. Stanley's imagination?
No I shouldn't care put myself in position saying they are purely pigment of Stanley's imagination.
But there is 1 point of fact, or of error that should certainly cause us to question these records.
Here is a river called the Lualava river indicated as flowing North and being the true source of Nile.
And further gentlemen...
Indicated as being at an elevation of 2000 ft above sea level. ... 2000 feet!
As we all know our eminent colleague Mr.Hantton measured the elevation of the Nile as 2169 ft.
Therefore it seems that if we are to believe these records that we must also believe, that water could flow over 700 miles uphill.
Dr.Livingstone indicated the Lualava as possible and not the actual source of the Nile.
The word possible Mr. Stanley does not appear on the maps.
Dr.Livingstone said it was possible
That it is not the Nile but the Congo.
And as to that Mr. Stanley, even an elementary knowledge of Geography should tell you
That the Congo flows not North but West.
Mr. Chairman, assuming that anybody found
Anybody, is it not likely that Stanley
Did not discover Livingstone but that
Livingstone discovered Stanley.
It must be obvious to even the most gullible of us that Mr. Stanley has attempted to make this honorable gathering
The victim of a colossal fraud.
You ought to know about fraud you old Rhinosausarus.
It was my privilege to spend some time with Mr. Stanley at Zanzibar. where I gone to meet my son, who courageously led, a bona-fide expedition to find Dr.Livingstone.
When I told Mr. Stanley that Dr.Livingstone was dead, he refused to believe me.
Why I ask you. Why?
Because it wasn't true.
Wasn't it because that 'The London Globe' had stolen a march on the 'New York Herald'. or is it because Mr. Stanley had come
11,000 miles for a story and couldn't find one.
Gentlemen. Among unscrupulous publishers, the method is as old as a newspaper business itself
If you can't find a story, you hide yourself away with pen and paper and you make one.
I have before me a copy of 'New York Herald'.
With your kind indulgence
I will read a small portion of an editorial appearing in it.
.. And I intend to continue making news while my competitors sit around waiting it to happen.
That editorial gentlemen is signed by Mr. James
Gordon Bennet, publisher of the 'New York Herald'.
An employer of Mr. Henry. M. Stanley.
Do you have anything further to say Mr. Stanley?
Before this meeting votes on your report.
- Go on. Get up and give it to them.
- You must please.
Mr. Chairman. And I feel that I should say
Gentlemen of the jury
Since you have seen fit to turn this hearing into a trial
I stand before you accused of being a cheat a liar and a forger.
Unfortunately gentlemen, when you question my integrity
You nullify at the same time the discoveries of Dr.Livingstone.
And you condemn a great man to oblivion
A great man, whom this honorable gathering seem determined to wipe out with a vote. although today he is still roaming the jungle and swamp, alone and fevering. accomplishing more in every single day than you and your combined lives will ever accomplish.
You arm chaired Geographers, who have never explored anything deeper than a plump pudding
I realize that this hall is charged with prejudice
And to raise my voice here is to cry out in the wilderness.
But I would be violating a sacred trust if I did not cry out.
Even though only the walls heard me.
The walls of a handful of faithful friends.
Gentlemen, I do not like to think that I am expecting too much when I ask tolerance and fair play from my fellow countrymen.
Yes. I was born in England. went to school here, not Eton, Herald but workhouse of Children poppers
All I ever knew of England was the poverty and the brutality of the workhouse.
I grew up with the lesson of my youth burned into my soul
I ask nothing of other men than that I gave them.
A year ago, in darkest Africa, I met a man who restored my faith
In the England I had learned to hate as a child.
And you gentlemen are destroying the faith he built in me.
As you seem bent on destroying every other great accomplishment
Of the greatest man I have ever known.
Dr.Livingstone is out there.
He is old and he is sick. and he needs your help to carry on the great work he has undertaken. the work that is indicated, however inadequately upon those maps.
Reject those maps, withhold your aid and you destroy him.
Reject those maps and you close Africa for generations to come.
Reject those maps gentlemen and you pelt faith with the greatest geographer and one of the greatest man of our times.
Gentlemen, the choice is yours.
Take your vote.
I am sure that Dr.Livingstone himself would say ... 'I live it with you'.
-Oh! That was glorious.
- Fine words Mr. Chairman
But still not one word of proof.
I move that this meeting to go on record by putting Mr. Stanley's report to a vote.
Gentlemen, all those who are in favor of accepting Mr. Stanley's report please rise.
All those who are opposed to accepting
Mr.Stanleys report, please rise.
Gentleman, the verdict is clear.
It is the sense of this meeting that Mr. Stanley's claim be rejected.
The table entertains the motion adjourned.
-Sir John    - Yes! What is it? 
- A message  
Well Stanley, guess you know now, how I feel when people wont believe what I tell them.
Stanley.. Stanley.. They are calling the meeting back to order.
- What happened?
- Something's happened. We better go back.
I have just received a communication from
London which I feel, is of utmost importance
I will read it to you without comment
It is from Lord Bill Hampton and it is addressed to me
Sir, a message has just been received from Zanzibar
The body of Doctor David Livingstone has been brought to the coast by native bearers
Doctor Livingstone died several months ago on a journey to Lualava river.
That is not all gentlemen! The letter goes on, bearers also delivered to the British consulate of Zanzibar
A last message written by Dr.Livingstone in which the Doctor mentioned Mr.Henry.Stanley.
The following message contains 
Dr.Livingstone's last request and is addressed to Mr. Stanley.
'Too weak to go on. Have asked my heart be buried here, together with my dreams'
My son, the torch has fallen from my hand.
Come and relight it.
Mr. Chairman! .... - Lord Tyce
- Mr. Chairman
I have the great honor to propose, the previous resolution be stricken from minutes of this meeting
And that we accept Mr. Stanley's report.
And with our acceptance tender him our humble apologies, for our stupidity and bad manners.
In which I Mr. Stanley, have been
The greatest offender.
From Bennett. The 3rd today. I don't seem able to convince him that I am not coming to New York.
I guess I will have to name a mountain something after him.
Well, I guess, I better get aboard.
I wont try to tell you how wonderful
It's been to be able to know you
You see I was right. I wasn't imagining things.
You are going to follow in
Doctor Livingstone's footsteps.
No man alive could hope to follow his footsteps.
I can at least try to finish the work he started.
And I wont be alone when I reach the spot.
Where the Lualava meets the sea.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye Henry! And God bless you.
The End
Uncover. Uncover.
Uncover.
Uncover.
-Captain Swanson of His Majesty's forces.
-Lieutenant Fouchier.
Fifteen English prisoners for 15 French prisoners.
Sergeant, deliver the prisoners to Lieutenant Fouchier.
Yes, sir. This way, sir.
One of these days, l'm gonna push the open end of a musket down your throat.
Step back into line there.
My apologies, Lieutenant. lt is customary for His Majesty's soldiers, if l may call you that without maligning my sense of proportion, to observe the rules of civilized warfare.
-Yes, sir.
-Tripe.
-Who said that?
-l did.
Did you ever see a white man teach an lndian to walk up under a flag of truce and blast a soldier from a gun hidden under a blanket?
-What's your name?
-His name is James Smith.
What do you mean by talking for him?
Professor sometimes talks for me.
Corporal, hold these men for court-martial.
They'll pluck those cocky rooster feathers out of your tail
-for court-martialing civilians.
-Civilians indeed.
-Deserters, more likely.
-We're civilians!
Born in Pennsylvania, taken three years ago by Caughnawaga lndians.
We're initiated to the tribe.
You can tell your story to a court-martial. lf you're not a fool, l reckon you'll listen to it here!
We escaped while the tribe visited Quebec.
The French caught us and here we are.
Shackle these men with the rest of the deserters.
We're civilians!
You've no right to hold us here!
Colonel Clapp, Captain Swanson. l'd like to get you behind a barn, back home in Pennsylvania !
Jim !
And the Professor.
-Where have you been?
-We were taken by the Caughnawagas.
-You still got your scalps.
-They made us blood brothers.
-Are these friends of yours?
-Aye. Let me introduce you.
There's Jim Smith and the Professor.
From Pennsylvania. l thought they were dead.
They've been missing these three years.
The best lndian fighters in the colonies.
All right, Corporal, you may release them.
You'd better read your dispatch, Captain.
Gentlemen, Quebec is English.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Quebec is British.
That closes the frontier.
There's no more stirring up the lndians against us.
No more massacres.
Thank God.
General Wolfe said he'd do it and he's done it.
General Wolfe is dead, sir.
He died with his face to the enemy. l guess we can go home now, Mac.
Maybe our stomachs found a friend.
All right, come on, boys.
You've had your hot meal.
Now back to work.
Break stone, Teagle, help Spode with that axle.
-MacDougall.
-Hiya, laddie. l heard you was up in Canada with
General Wolfe, fighting the French. l was just showing the General how to fight lndians. l killed 30 Onondagas in one day. Aye.
-No.
-Aye.
How dead lndians do multiply!
Well, maybe it was 20 Onondagas, but that's not to be saying that a MacDougall like myself couldn't have killed 30 if he had a mind to.
They're bosom cronies of mine.
-This is Jim Smith and the Professor.
-How are you?
-Strangers around here, ain't you?
-We've been away a little while.
This is Gary Smith's laddie.
-Oh, yeah.
-Could you spare a mite of that grub?
Oh, fall to, lads. We've had ours, but there's plenty hanging. l suppose you wouldn't be having a snifter of whiskey, just a wee drop?
You know, my appetite's not so good without a bit of a tonic just to wet my whistle.
No, Mac, we don't traffic in firewater.
We only carry trade goods for the lndians.
-Trade goods?
-l thought the border was closed.
Don't have to be, now that the French have surrendered Quebec.
Colonel Brady's out in Ohio making treaties with the lnjuns now.
They're real friendly-like, the lnjuns.
The only friendly lndians are dead lndians, l say. lf we don't trade with them, the French will.
You know how they stir them up against us, with firewater. lt's a patriotic duty we're doing.
Did you ask Tom Lowther about this patriotism?
The lndians beat in his boy's head with a musket and left it sticking in his skull.
Rum !
So you don't carry any spirits.
Stop! Where are my spoons?
Stop, thief! Stop!
Five pewter spoons missing and a tankard.
Blast them for the thieves that they are and blast me for the trusting woman l am !
Now, Janie, that'll do, l'll have no swearing from a daughter of mine.
So, you're back.
Now, now, lassie, it was no fault of mine. l was coming home, sober as a judge, when, bang, without even a word of apology, a patrol got hold of me and pressed me into the army.
Against my will.
Even when l told them what a beautiful and dutiful daughter l had.
Who'd tend the tavern while you're away, swilling army rum?
What, me?
Why, l've got the best here in the cellar at home.
That you can't get at.
Oh, Mac, don't go away and leave me again.
Take me with you like you used to.
Oh, you contrary female MacDougall!
No.
Hello, Janie.
Put me down, Mac.
And the Professor, they're back from the very mouth of the grave.
They'd all say,
''He's dead, you'd better forget him.''
And l'd say ''Sure, he's dead, he's forgotten,'' but l knew it wasn't so. l didn't let myself know anything else, l knew you'd come back.
And just where were you, and what were you doing?
-Well, a...
-Oh, no, no, l don't care.
You're here now.
Blast it, Mac, do you have to stand around and watch a girl make a fool of herself?
Get in and get your rum.
And you, too, Professor. lt is a wee bit chilly.
You've grown up, Janie. lsn't that much nicer, for both of us?
Still the same shameless wench.
Am l supposed to be ashamed? l will be if you want me to, but l don't feel ashamed,
-not before the man l'm going to marry.
-Marry?
Yes, you gave me your word, you promised, don't you remember?
There's another girl!
Somewhere you've hitched yourself to another girl!
Blast you for a bigamist scoundrel!
-Your temper is no better.
-l'll have the law on you! l'll have you put in stocks for breaking your promise!
-l promised a half-grown girl.
-Half-grown? Half-grown?
Stop whimpering about marriage.
We're very hungry and tired men.
Come inside, Jim.
Half-grown, am l?
Well, l'm full-grown, now. l killed 40 Onondagas in one day.
The barrel of my gun, it got so hot, l used it to warm up the rum toddies. lt got so hot, l...
The war is over, Mac. Come on, get behind the bar and work for your keep.
Woe is me. l'm a victim of the skirling blood of the MacDougalls.
Janie, are you happy?
Oh, mind your pig.
What am l to do?
The whole town knows we were going to be married.
Now you've changed your mind.
Why don't you put a rein to your nimble imagination, girl?
Let him do his own talking.
The Professor always talks for me.
You only thought he promised.
They'll point me out as a girl who was left.
Well, then, marry and fool them.
Who'll have me after you've tossed me aside?
Well, l don't know.
You're not bad to look at. l think so, too.
But maybe it's because we've lived with lndians so long.
You're an lndian, cruel and merciless!
Janie, l'm no man for you.
-He's going over the far hills too much.
-l wouldn't care! l wouldn't ask for anything except to go with you.
You can't die once, and then come alive and go away again. lt's like making me see you die twice, l couldn't stand it.
Jed, Tom... lndians. lndians. They're all around Fort Pitt.
Shawnee and Delaware.
They've burned the town and they've scalped the kids in school at McDowell's Mill.
Let's be on the way, boys.
McDowell's Mill is 20 miles from here.
-Any more guns in the house?
-Two long rifles.
Well, l know where we can get some more.
You're not going again, Jim, you're not!
Mac, Mac, tell him not to go!
Don't be a fool, lassie, you know what we have to do.
All dead, Jim. Horrible.
Dirty, murdering heathens. l'm taking my family and leaving while we're still alive.
Aye. l'm fair sick of it.
A remarkably fine season and what good is it?
You can't harvest for fear of bloodthirsty barbarians.
Men, if the Conococheague settlements stand firm the country will have some little sort of safety.
Safe for the blasted tradesmen.
For the fields of corn you planted.
For the plenty we've taken and will take from this land. l will water it with my blood before l give it up.
-And l.
-And l.
Everybody accounted for?
All except Jacob Miller's two kids.
They must have taken them alive.
Mrs. Lewis, do you know if Jacob Miller's kids got taken?
Mrs. Lewis? l picked up the tracks.
About 20 of them. Delawares, l think. l'm not sure, but they seem to have a couple of youngsters with them.
-Any missing?
-Yes. l want about 10 men with me.
Stewart, Calhoon, M'Cammon, Professor.
You got plenty of charcoal over there,
M'Cammon?
Yes, and plenty of bear grease.
Now, we're traveling light, so are the Delawares but they'll be held back because they're carrying the kids along.
Twenty of them. lt's just the odds l like. l'll kill them myself like l did them Onondagas in one day. l wanna see your guns.
Trade musket. They're no good.
They misfire too often.
Sorry, M'Cammon, we can't take you with us. lf it misfires, Jim, l'll use my knife. l'm only taking men with long rifles, M'Cammon.
-Mac! Mac!
-Janie, lassie. What brought you here?
With lndians loose, you might have been scalped from your eyebrows to your shoulder blades.
Here, l'll get somebody to take you back. l'm not going back. l've seen what the lndians did and l'm going with you.
-l forbid it.
-What?
Positively.
You forbid it?
How much is this valley your home?
Did you see those bullet holes in the walls of the tavern?
Who fought off the lndians? Not you.
You were always busy somewhere else fighting somebody else's fight.
And now you're forbidding me to fight my own.
-Get back to the tavern, girl.
-Let her come along.
Oh, Jim.
Jim, you're a fine and generous man.
All right, off with your shirts.
Smear your bodies.
We're lndians, you know.
Well, off with your shirt. lf you travel with us you travel like the rest of us.
How sly. How very sly.
We'll need your long rifle.
-Here's your weapon, M'Cammon.
-Thanks.
Some of you boys see that Janie gets home.
They didn't come out here.
We'll have to split up, Jim.
Delawares. They've gone upstream.
Mac, you take the right bank, l'll take the left. l want him alive.
Jim, 20 lndians a day has always been my minimum.
Don't leave me at 19. l'll never be able to hold me head up again.
Come on, we'll get the water out of him.
Oh, darn, Jim, laddie.
They trade muskets and trade tomahawks.
-Everybody all right?
-All right.
All here.
Gather up the rifles and the powder horns.
English cartouche box.
What regiment is it, Tom?
Why, that's Colonel Brady's regiment.
He's supposed to be out on the Ohio making treaties.
He said they wiped out Brady and the men.
We teach them everything, don't we, Tom?
His Excellency, Governor Penn, will see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
What is the meaning of this intrusion? l sent word l'd see you tomorrow.
What we've got to say can't wait till tomorrow.
-Why, how dare...
-Our apologies, Your Excellency,
-we're Conococheague Valley men.
-l see.
Frightful tragedy, frightful.
This is General Gage, in command of His Majesty's forces.
We've come to request Your Excellency to forbid trade with the lndians, and to ask military protection for the valley. l understand and sympathize with you, but l have judged it consistent with the good of His Majesty's service to order all available troops westward to meet the lndians on their own grounds.
While they murder us on our grounds.
We're carrying out a military policy designed to guarantee the permanent security of the frontier.
Haven't you eyes enough to see that?
We've eyes enough to see only our own dead.
Colonel Brady has received the lndian chieftains...
Colonel Brady will receive no more chieftains...
What's that? What's that?
Dead men make no peace treaties.
-What are you saying?
-Colonel Brady and his men are dead.
Dead?
Their heads split open with tomahawks made by white men.
''A proclamation. From this day all persons whosoever they may be,
''are forbidden to trade with lndians.
''Anyone failing to heed this warning, does so at his own peril.
''The Valley of the Conococheague is forthwith taxed £1 per capita
''for the erection of Fort Loudoun, and the maintenance of His Majesty's troop
''to be permanently stationed there for the protection of said valley.
''John Penn. God save the King.''
This is the reward of aiding the mother country with her trade.
Warehouses filled with goods.
Goods that cost us hard cash, fetched 3,000 miles from England.
Must we endure it?
What's the army for, if not to protect business?
And what's government for, if not to protect business?
Certainly not to interfere with it.
Gentlemen, you still do business with the army, don't you? lt will take 20 years for the army to buy up the supplies we have on hand, and furthermore, there's no profit in it. l wasn't thinking of that.
You'll have a military permit to take goods through to the outlying forts, won't you?
Yes.
Now, if a shipping clerk made a mistake, and sent a few wagonloads of trade goods through with the military supplies, they'd be traveling under the protection of a military pass, wouldn't they?
-Barmaid, barmaid!
-Yes, sir.
Another for each of us.
All right, boys. Get out the musket balls.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt. Right.
Put the musket balls aside.
We load them on the top. l'll kill the man that drops a keg of that rum.
-This is it, sir.
-Give the order to halt, Sergeant.
-Company, halt!
-Company, halt!
A tavern?
Their magistrates and commissioners meet in a tavern?
Yes, sir.
Most every place in the outlying sections, the tavern's sort of community public house,
-government quarters, newspaper...
-Accompany me inside, Sergeant.
Yes, sir. l'm Captain Swanson.
Who's in charge here?
Magistrate Duncan and Magistrate Morris, they're in charge.
Glad to meet you, gentlemen. l'm sure we shall get on.
May l say how grateful we are to have you and your men, Captain?
Your gratitude belongs to the Crown,
Mr. Magistrate.
We're all servants of His Majesty.
Now, as to provisions,
Sergeant McGlashan will weekly requisition our needs.
You'll be given army certificates redeemable in cash.
-That ought to be satisfactory.
-We'll be happy to accommodate you, sir.
All provisions delivered to the fort are to be in prime condition.
Any attempts to supply provisions of inferior quality will be met by severe rebuke.
Severe rebuke.
Do l make myself clear, gentlemen?
You don't know us, sir, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.
You will notify me each week when the provisions arrive.
-Yes, sir.
-l will make the inspections myself.
That's all, gentlemen.
Why, the uppish gamecock.
-l demand that man's arrest.
-On what charge?
The man was in contempt of court.
You're not sitting in a military session, exchanging prisoners now,
Captain Swanson.
For which l'm grateful. l rather resent the army gambling on exchange and losing.
This is a civil court.
And l advise you to keep that kind of a tongue in your head.
Jim, Captain Jim !
Them blackguards has took up the trade again.
They come through Shippensburg this morning, three wagons.
-You mean with trade goods?
-Yes.
They wouldn't dare, they wouldn't dare.
With the King's proclamation on the door of every inn and every magistrate's house.
-lt must be army goods.
-lt ain't. l seen them. lt's paint, knives and hatchets and powder.
You'll turn them back, of course.
Are you sure of your information?
Sure of it? l tried to reason with them.
They said, ''Get the devil out of the valley if you're scared of lndians.''
-Why weren't they stopped at Carlisle?
-Stop them?
They've got a military permit signed by the Commanding Officer in Philadelphia.
You must be mistaken. lf the goods are under permit, they're military supplies. l ain't mistaken.
Are you implying that my commanding officer is corrupt?
You'd best mind your tongue.
He's implying nothing, but for us to let those goods go through would be committing suicide. l'll arrest any man that interferes with a military permit.
Then you're going to let the goods go through?
My orders were to protect the frontier, and to teach a wholesome respect for the
Sovereign law and His Majesty's forces.
Those orders will be carried out, even if l have to declare martial law.
And to think we asked for them.
The swine, the crooked swine.
We'll stop them ourselves. lf it's force you're thinking of using, you'd best forget it.
-You'll end in hanging.
-Then we'll hang.
At least we'll die with our scalps intact.
Calhoon, l think you could do with a drink,
-as can Mac...
-Aye.
...and the Professor.
M'Cammon and a few of you other boys, come to my room.
Janie, bring some hot toddies.
Looks like it's going to be a cold night out.
We've work to do.
-Ready?
-Aye.
Aye.
Blankets off.
Each man 10 feet apart.
Shoot over their heads.
Get rid of that blanket.
What's the matter with you?
-Are you drunk?
-You're choking me.
Janie, what kind of a joke is this? lt's not a joke, Jim. lf you're going to hang, l'll hang with you.
That's the least you can let me do.
Ah, the female MacDougalls were all famed for their tenderness.
The lass is fair daft about you, Jimmy.
All right, men.
Hold it!
Steady down these horses!
Listen to me!
Take these loads out in the clearing and pile them all in one place.
And be fast about it.
Take whatever government property you may be carrying and clear out. Get out!
All right, boys.
Pile the rest of this stuff up, boys.
We're going to light a little fire of our own.
Get all the stuff out of all those wagons. l don't think the government is going to like very much this destruction of their property.
Come in.
-Sorry to disturb you, sir, but...
-l'm Callendar. l pack train for Poole and Simmons,
Philadelphia.
-Charmed.
-We contract army supplies.
Go on, get on with it, get on with it.
A pack of blasted settlers, dressed like lndians, attacked my train and burned the army goods.
Army goods?
There's a cartouche box.
That's all that's left.
The shot's melted down, the powder is...
-McGlashan, call out the squad.
-Yes, sir.
-Nearly murdered me and my men.
-Rabble, cutthroats, criminals!
Destroy His Majesty's goods, will they? l'll teach them the meaning of the King's name, if l have to write it across their backs with a lash!
Look alive, men.
-Quick, get him.
-Aye, he's one of them. l'll brook no escape.
You can still see the black paint behind his ears.
That's dirt. l never wash behind the ears.
Let go! lt's a girl!
Hold her.
The man that loosens her receives 30 days' bread and water.
Who were the others with you?
What were their names?
Just like that.
You'll wear the seat out of those silk britches before l talk.
Janie!
What did you take her for?
-For destroying King's property.
-She's destroyed no King's property.
McGlashan, clear this rabble.
You'll not take the lass to Fort Loudoun without a warrant.
By the living Jehoshaphat, l'll blow out your heart.
You'll do what, you treasonable dog?
Disarm them.
Now, shall we get on to the fort, McGlashan?
Yes, sir.
Company, halt!
What do you mean by halting the King's men with an armed mob?
We want those prisoners, Captain.
You took them without warrant.
-There's still English law in the valley.
-They're British and freeborn. lf they're to stand trial, it will be before 12 of their peers, not before the likes of you. l've an idea they'd be court-martialed for treason, is that true?
And suppose it is?
Suppose l send them to Carlisle for court-martial, what will you do about it?
We'll do this.
We'll be forced to fire on you.
No, Jim, Mac, we'll go with them.
Move the prisoners to the rear and fix bayonets.
No.
Perhaps you'll understand we mean to have those prisoners. l'll release them only to your magistrate under the condition they stand trial for treason. l'll see that they stand trial.
Release the prisoners.
Release the prisoners.
Will you promise to stop the traders?
You have this promise, that any man who interferes with a military permit will make the acquaintance of the hangman.
Shoulder your firelocks, quick step, march.
We'll sew up this valley so tight, a cricket can't get in or out without our say-so.
No. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
-Stop. The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
-The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
Turn back. The valley is closed. Turn back.
''Men of the Conococheague,
''you are to come to MacDougall's Tavern
''and fill yourselves with liquor and swearing.
''There is a large bounty for everyone, military goods.
''We'll have Captain Swanson whipped or hanged.''
Don't you think this is a little obvious?
You gotta make it plain.
Them people are thick-headed.
''We may do as we please for we have the law and government in our hands.
''Any bounty captured must be spent in our town,
''the only town tolerating drinking, swearing, Sabbath-breaking,
''and any outrage we have a mind to do.
''Signed, James Smith and his
Black Boys of the Conococheague.''
Well, it should convince the Governor he's dealing with rioters and rebels.
They've blockaded the valley.
No word can get through except what they choose.
They wouldn't dare treat
His Majesty's troops with such indignity.
They've no respect for law.
Their magistrates are with them, leading them.
Have Magistrate Duncan come in. l've called their magistrate to Philadelphia.
Magistrate Duncan.
This gentleman informs me that you've encouraged and protected rioters in the Conococheague Valley in their illegal and disorderly proceedings.
There have been no illegal nor disorderly proceedings.
Burned my goods. They burned my goods.
The pack train was illegal,
Your Excellency, contrary to your proclamation.
There's what's left of the military supplies.
Does that look like trade goods?
This gentleman has been misinformed.
They were not government goods.
Were government troops fired upon?
Not one shot has been fired against the royal garrison, Your Excellency. l swear those goods were lndian trade goods.
More than that l cannot say.
More than that l will say.
My pack leader managed to evade the blockade.
Callendar.
Where's that advertisement?
These were found nailed to the trees all through the Conococheague Valley.
The one you have in your hand was taken from the wall of MacDougall's Tavern.
Sound reason for everything they've done, indeed.
Bloody-minded cutthroats!
May l see it, sir?
There's something queer about this advertisement, mighty queer.
No Conococheague man ever did this. l find it disagreeably necessary to apply to General Gage for the assistance of His Majesty's troops.
Reinforcements will be ready to march in a week. l demand military escort for my supply train.
You shall have it.
You will issue a warrant for the apprehension of James Smith.
You will lend your assistance in discovering and apprehending all persons who may be concerned. l issue no warrants against Jim Smith or any of the valley men.
-Jim? Where's Jim?
-There he is.
Jim, they're issuing a warrant for your arrest. You've got to leave.
Governor Penn himself is issuing it.
And General Gage is sending reinforcements in a few days to put down the insurrection.
-You must go, Jim.
-No.
Those traders will do anything to hang you.
And Gage has promised them military escort for their pack trains.
Callendar will probably rush through a train before the reinforcements arrive.
He'll be afraid to wait with too many soldiers about.
He will that, if he's carrying lndian trade goods.
-Well, we'll let the train through.
-Let it through?
Jim, are you crazy?
What is it, Jim?
What are you thinking about?
We'll use him as bait for a trap. lf Fort Loudoun becomes a warehouse for illegal goods, its commandant is done for. lt'll be proof that he's unlawfully conniving with traders.
We'll prove we're not rebels.
We have him now. He's taken the bait.
Tell the valley men to come to MacDougall's.
Jim Smith wants you to come to MacDougall's!
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's.''
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-MacDougall's.
Come to MacDougall's.
James, there's your search warrant, and it's all in order.
You'd better come along to serve it.
Just a minute, men.
M'Cammon, Calhoon, Stewart,
Lewis and Janie here are out on bail.
We promised the Captain they'd be tried for treason.
Now it isn't beholden for men out on bail to be appearing before a fort making demands. lf you think it'll be hurting you, then l'll stay.
That won't be necessary, Tom.
We'll try you immediately.
Jim, you can appear for the defense. l'll choose a jury, and if it isn't to your liking you can object.
The prisoners over there before the bar and the jurymen down here on this side of the table, as l call off your names.
Burke, Callahan, Brown, Reynolds,
Allison, Bouquet, Forbes, Spears,
Josephs, Owens, Grant, Pierry.
-Jim, have you any objections?
-No objections.
Gentlemen, what is your verdict on Tom Calhoon?
Not guilty.
-John M'Cammon?
-Not guilty.
-Stewart?
-Not guilty.
-Lewis?
-Not guilty.
-Janie McDougall?
-Guilty.
-What?
-Guilty as charged.
MacDougall, the court charges you to lock your daughter in the wine cellar until the court has time to pass sentence.
-You...
-Come along, lassie.
The moment you began whispering, l knew it was some filthy lndian trick! l think you'd best forget him.
He's bad medicine for lasses.
Mac, what, what's the matter with me?
Why does he treat me like this?
Janie-wanie, you called him right, lndian.
To him a squaw belongs at home. l hate him.
Aye, and if you're like your mother, you'll break your heart with your hate.
Go on with ye, you MacDougall, you.
Something must be amiss. They let me by.
They've no stomach for firing on troops.
They had the look of cats that had just swallowed a flock of birds.
They're all about the fort, sir, close to 300 of them, armed.
-Shut and bolt the gates.
-l've already done that, sir.
Order full garrison on the wall.
What do you mean by coming here with that rabble? ln the name of public safety, we want permission to inspect the trader's goods stored in your fort.
You've a rare appreciation of public order with an armed mob at your back. l have a search warrant to inspect the goods.
The goods are under my protection. l've orders from General Gage.
Here, do you see this?
That's General Gage's own order.
What more do you want?
Here, do you see this? lt's the King's proclamation.
We want to see the goods.
Nothing short of that will satisfy the people around here.
You'll inspect no goods in my care. l've my orders. lt might be as well to remember, this road is not a military road.
And while we're talking, you might get it through your head.
We built your fort.
We'll not have it used against us.
Now, will you let us in? l will not.
You're using our fort as a storehouse for illegal goods.
According to the King's proclamation, you're a criminal.
And we'll deal with you as a criminal.
Back, boys.
Be back, boys.
We'll kill every mother's son of them, the dirty rattlesnakes!
Come on, let's get him out of the road.
McGlashan, those men were under a flag of truce.
-Arrest the man who fired that shot.
-Yes, sir.
Don't jiggle him so much, lads. l'll put a torch to that fort myself, if l die doing it.
That was no army musket, Tom. lt was a long rifle.
That's right, it couldn't have been a soldier. lt was one of Callendar's men. l never even shot an lndian in the back.
Jim, we'd better ride you back to the doctor.
No, we gotta take that fort before reinforcements get here.
We must have the proof.
Then let's charge them.
That's what they expect.
Their muskets won't carry this far, our long rifles will.
So we'll fire on the fort, and keep firing. ln shifts.
One shift will rest while the other keeps firing.
They won't dare go to sleep waiting for us to charge.
But we won't.
We'll just keep firing.
Jim, could we no kill two or three of them maybe?
There'll be no killings, Mac.
Don't you think you'd better get back to the surgeon, Jim?
Give the order to fire.
-Full garrison on the wall, sir.
-Keep your men ready, Sergeant.
Tell them to hold their fire and watch for the assault.
Yes, sir.
Hold your fire, and watch for the assault!
Sergeant McGlashan.
Yes, sir.
Tell the men to get to the bottom of the barricade where the logs are the thickest.
Yes, sir.
And tell them that the first man that falls asleep
-gets 20 lashes to keep him awake.
-Yes, sir.
Stay awake, men. Stay awake.
They'll attack the moment you fall asleep.
Stay awake. Come along there. Wake up.
Wake up there. Wake up.
Sorry, sir.
-That's all right, lad, just stay awake.
-Yes, sir.
Two hour shifts today.
-How's Jim?
-He's all right. Let's keep going.
Come on. Two hour shifts today.
We need more powder and ball. l've got 50 kegs at the tavern.
-Take 20 horses, men, and go get them.
-Aye.
Good morning, lass.
Did you have a good night last night?
You men do it well, tormenting a girl.
-You must be born with the gift.
-Now, now, lassie.
Jim Smith and the magistrate's put you here for your own safety.
The powder is through there, lads.
-Mac, is a fight on?
-Aye, a grand fight. l killed 20 of 'em me self.
A great pity you can't scalp them. lt's no civilized to scalp white men.
Put some vigor in it, lads.
Jim Smith's waiting.
Jim Smith.
Put those kegs down.
Are ye crazy?
We're running short of ammunition.
Tell Jim Smith to get it somewhere else.
This is my powder and it stays here.
Now, put them down.
Just as things were going our way.
You'll be run out of the valley.
Well, maybe l will, but l'll be here long enough to see that, that white lndian hanging from a gallows.
Now, now, lassie, that's no way to be talking of a man who's half dead from a soldier's bullet.
-Oh, no, Mac, no.
-Aye, Janie, aye. lt'll be a miracle if he lasts out the day. lf you've let him be killed, l'll shoot the lot of you, every last man of you.
Heave ho, me lads, heave ho.
Jim !
-Where's Jim?
-Right there, by the fire.
Jim !
Darling, darling, darling.
How did you get out?
Do you think anything would keep me?
Do you think l'd let you die alone?
Die? Who said l was going to die?
Mac said so.
Oh, it's only in the shoulder, but if you're really set, l might die...
You wouldn't be doing that if l wasn't just a little bit helpless.
Now, what kind of a fool would l be, if l didn't take advantage of my opportunities?
Let's look at that.
Go away. lf he's a bit warm, it's that kissing business, not the bullet.
A white flag! Hold your fire. A white flag!
Jim, Jim. The white flag.
First we want the trade goods.
Second, he and his men are to get out of the valley.
We asked for them here, now we don't want them. They're to git.
Yes, sir.
And they may keep their weapons.
They agreed, Jim.
Heads up, lads. Heads up.
Show this rabble our heads are up.
Open the gates.
-Give the order to march, Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.
Squads right, march!
Forward, march!
Captain Swanson.
Company, halt.
Jim Smith would like words with you.
The goods are in the fort.
There's one thing we want you to understand.
We're law-abiding men.
There is one thing l do understand.
You're a lot of blasted traitors.
We whipped him !
We whipped the saucy peacock. l claim his scalp. ln the name of the law, l'll lift his scalp from his eyebrows to his shoulder blades!
Mac!
Let me at him.
He's worse than the black lndian devil. ln the name of the law.
Law-abiding men, loyal subjects.
Drunken rabble you are, but l'll be back! l'll be back and you'll pay for this!
Forward march.
-Forward...
-Forward.
...march!
Stop where you are, Callendar.
We're free to go with Swanson.
You'll go with Swanson later.
Get back to the fort.
Listen, men, wait a minute. l'm just a driver. l didn't have anything to do with the goods.
Thank you.
Jim better this morning?
He thinks he is, but he's not. l say we stay and fight.
We've whipped them once, and we'll whip them again.
Fight 200 regulars?
They'll probably come with cannon.
Magistrate Morris, load a wagon full of the trade goods.
Take it to General Gage in Philadelphia.
M'Cammon knows the south hills.
You'll avoid the troops that way.
But that might take several weeks.
The rest of us can hide in Martin's Rock.
They're 10 miles away, Jim.
That cock-sparrow Swanson is with them.
We'd better get started.
Then we'll have to tie you on your horse, Jim.
He can't hide in a cave. He'll die. l won't let him go.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke.
Back to the tavern, girl.
Back to the tavern.
Let men go about the work they've got to do.
Easy, lad, let us do most of the work.
When you get to Philadelphia, speak to no one but General Gage or Governor Penn.
And God go with you.
Come on, men, put some backbone into it.
Give me your foot. Put your arm around my shoulders. Careful!
-Put him in the cart, men.
-Janie.
-Put that gun down.
-l won't. l'm not going to be a widow before l'm even a wife. l forbid you to use such talk before all these men. lt's no becoming to a female McDougall.
Do you think l care what's becoming and what's not?
He'll die and just because he wants to be a big, brave, loyal chief.
He won't leave his men.
Well, his men can go hang for all of me.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke, if l have to kill you and him to do it!
Well, there's something in what the lass says.
She's a hysterical, arrogant shrew, and shouldn't be trusted with a lethal weapon.
Take it away from her.
Now, now, lassie, calm yourself, calm yourself.
You wouldn't shoot your loving father, would you?
The last male member of the fine line of the MacDougalls.
One more step, Mac, and the fine line is finished.
Wait, Janie,
Dr. Stoke is 15 miles from here. l can take him through.
What else do you think l want with him but to see him alive and safe?
Why do you treat me like a witless child?
Put him in the wagon.
-Put me astride.
-No, Jim, the lass is right.
She'll get you through.
You're being twisted about by a comely face.
She loves you, Jim.
Are we to be the victims of a girl's springtime fancy?
-l'm going with you.
-And me.
You'd do best, Mac, to stay far away from Jim for a while. l'm sorry, Janie, terribly sorry.
Rum and lndian fighting makes a poor mixture for the father of a young lassie. lf l had it to do all over, Mac, l'd pick you again.
''Whereas l have received information that sundry persons have,
''at several times, assembled themselves in armed bodies,
''and have in a most riotous and illegal manner
''presumed to interrupt the passage of supplies to the fort,
''l do hereby require all His Majesty's subjects
''to give such evidence as to apprehend all persons
''concerned in the leading of these riots
''so that the offenders may be prosecuted according to law.
''Signed, John Penn.''
God save the King.
Disperse them and get on with it.
Next prisoner.
Driving his cattle into the swamp and refused to billet. lsn't he one of the scum that whipped me? lt looks like him.
Put him in irons.
Turn them over.
-Another one.
-All right, stand in line. Stand up.
Put his leg irons on first.
Heave ho, here we go.
All right, get the other one.
Stay on your feet!
All right, stand over there.
Come over there.
Prepared to talk, gentlemen? l want James Smith.
The man that tells me where he is, wins full pardon. lf you'd serve your King with one-tenth the loyalty you serve that treasonable dog Smith, you wouldn't be in jail this moment!
Jim, Jim Smith! Jim !
He's not here. l know he's here, Janie. l've got to see him.
-He's not here. ls he, Doctor?
-No, he's not here.
-Jim, Jim Smith, it's Anderson.
-Shut up, you blasted...
-Will Anderson! Will Anderson!
-He's not here, l tell you.
-Shut up!
-You looking for me, Will?
Jim, they've got half the valley in irons.
No warrants, no trials.
Just a trader's word and you're in chains.
They're even paying off men that ain't had nothing to do with it.
You just don't have to like them to find yourself accused and convicted of riot, arson and armed robbery. l'll be right down.
Dr. Stoke said you're not well enough to go. lt's finally come. l knew it would, and now's as good a time as any. lt's been so pleasant here, Jim. l sometimes even thought that...
They think more of money than they do of men. l said, l sometimes thought that you thought...
No more trading with lndians.
Jim, Jim, please don't go.
Don't let me have to stay behind and die inside of me.
Troops sit in forts and the settlers die.
Let us get up to save ourselves, and they move fast enough.
All right, go ahead.
Go ahead, l don't care!
Get shot or hung from a scaffold!
We've obeyed the law, they've broken it.
You've always torn and twisted the heart out of me. l've loved you from the first minute l can remember, and you've brought me nothing but misery.
Well, l didn't expect much more, so l asked for nothing, and l'm not asking for much now.
You fool. You cruel, merciless fool.
Come, magistrate, join the fun.
What are you men going to do?
We are going to stand the red coats on their thick heads.
Your stomach's got to be right to take a whore.
They've gone to report to the fort.
We'll give them a half-hour start.
They are all drunk at McDougall's, bragging that they are going to take the fort.
McGlashan, take a squad and bring those men here.
Yes, sir.
Nine men are going to take the fort.
And nine drunks are going to take the fort.
The garrison's all asleep. The gate's open.
There are only three sentries on the wall, this side.
The guard's away across the parade ground, by the kitchen.
They're getting the morning rum ration. lt's grand rum. l could almost taste the smell of it.
The guns are stacked together, full 40 paces nearer to the gate than what they are.
All right, when we run, run crouched in the mist.
Put down those muskets.
Come on down and join the party.
Calhoon, stand at the barracks door and keep them inside.
Shoot the first one that shows his head.
Find your commandant.
Tell him if there's one move, l'll blow daylight through these men.
Yes, sir.
Mac, open the guardhouse.
Get those prisoners out here.
Will, get the flints out of those muskets.
Now, Corporal, find your blacksmith and fetch him here.
Yes, sir.
All right, lads, all right.
That's the last one, Mac.
Let me do for him, Jim !
Let me do for him once and for all!
Why not add murder to your traitorous acts?
You'll never learn, will you?
You'll never learn to know us.
Take him to his quarters.
We'll give him back his fort.
That's a mistake, Jim. l said we'll give it back.
All right, men, you can return to your homes.
And leave those muskets here.
Nine men.
Only nine men.
Nine men.
Nine men!
You'd best give up. We've got you now.
One move and you're dead men.
The boldness of the swine.
He's dead.
Now we have got you, Smith.
You've murdered him.
We'll see you hanged for that.
You killed him. My shot went wild.
You fired and he fell. That's murder.
So that's it.
Tie him to a horse.
We'll take him to jail in Carlisle.
Get the stiff one.
We'll bring him along, too.
What shall l do? They'll tear the jail down.
Well, can't you reason with them?
You're the jailer.
But it's a mob. Can't you do something?
Well, l can talk to them, but they aren't going to like these.
Briggs, Briggs, come here.
Bring your chisel. Take these irons off. l've got a wife and children.
Please, tell them l'm on your side.
Here, Briggs, here, here. Right over here.
Hi, Jim, hi.
Just hang on. We'll get you out.
Mac, much obliged to you and the boys, but it'd look bad if l ran away. lt'd look like l was guilty.
Best way you can help me is to break up.
They're planning to take you back to the fort and court-martial you.
They want you out of the way.
We've done everything according to law up to now.
Make way.
Law? What law?
This kind of law, the law of bayonets? l say burn the jail down.
Burn it down around their ears!
Aye!
Men! Men! l'll talk for Jim Smith. l know what he thinks.
He doesn't want anybody to get fired on by the soldiers.
But if any of us were in there, he'd go in and get us, soldiers or no soldiers!
Janie, hold your tongue.
Tell them, Professor, tell them for me.
Men, we've fought and won, but in winning we've lost something. ln defending one law, we've come to despise all law!
And if you go on like this, we'll destroy the very thing we fight for!
Men, disband.
Go home and let me stand my trial.
-Bring in the accused.
-Yes, sir.
Bring in the prisoner.
You may remove that barbarian from the courtroom.
-He's a witness.
-Remove him.
Step out, you.
Now, laddie, l was only clearing my throat. lt's the right of every free-born Scotsman to clear his throat if he's a mind to. l clear mine a wee bit noisily perhaps.
Now, do not push. Do not push, laddie.
Any lout who feels the need of airing his spleen at the expense of the Court's decorum will find himself dining on bread and water.
Proceed.
-You're sure he's the same man?
-He made no pretense about it.
His attitude throughout was a contempt for authority. He was openly seditious. l object. The defendant is on trial for murder, not for treason. lt is our intention to establish a connection between the two.
He fired on His Majesty's troops, destroyed army supplies, interfered with the King's messengers, released prisoners held by us for court-martial.
The pack-train leader.
Ralph Callendar!
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear or affirm that the evidence you shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? l do.
Did you hear Tom Calhoon offer to turn
King's evidence against James Smith? l did, sir.
When Tom Calhoon said he was going to Philadelphia to swear to the Governor about Jim Smith's treason,
Jim Smith shot him dead. l tried to stop him but Jim fired that shot so sudden and unexpected.
And he was Tom Calhoon's best friend.
Your witness.
Can you identify this, Mr. Callendar?
That there is the shirt that Tom Calhoon was wearing when Jim Smith killed him.
There's the bullet hole.
Can you identify this?
That looks like the gun he shot him with.
Now, how far would you say
Jim Smith was standing from Tom Calhoon, when you say he shot him?
About four feet.
He just put the gun up against him and shot him.
About that?
You're certain of all else you saw, why aren't you certain of this?
That's how far it was, l'm certain.
May l have the Court's permission to make an experiment?
An experiment? l should have thought the facts were sufficiently plain to speak for themselves.
Well, why try my client at all? Why not just hang him and be done with it?
Oh, all right, proceed with the experiment.
All right, Janie. ls that young person loading that weapon?
That young person is a dead shot.
There's no cause for alarm. l shall be personally responsible for any acts committed here.
Get on with it.
This is decidedly irregular and smelly.
How many more of these detonations are we to endure?
Just one.
You will note the shot fired at 20 paces carries a clean hole.
That fired at six inches is deeply studded with powder burns.
You will also notice, gentlemen, that the shirt Tom Calhoon wore carries a clean hole with no evidences of a burn.
Gentlemen, that shot was fired by some other in the crowd, someone else standing many paces away.
Order, order.
Will you permit a scoundrel to go free?
A scoundrel who leads treason and sedition and defies England? ls there to be a stench in this courtroom that will linger for centuries? l protest.
-The man is innocent of the crime.
-You are under arrest, for revealing your decision before a majority vote.
Captain Swanson.
Captain Holmes, place Mr. Poole, Ralph Callendar and the drivers under arrest for breaking the King's proclamation and transporting illegal trade-goods.
Captain Swanson, you'll retire to your quarters.
-l'll talk to you there.
-Yes, sir. l am a soldier, sir.
They could have been carrying the murderer of my own father, if they'd had a permit for it. l would have defended him with my life.
There is such a thing as understanding, Captain.
-Yes but...
-l know, l know.
We haven't taught soldiers to soften themselves at understanding.
We'll probably suffer for it.
Well, l've ordered the release of Jim Smith.
And l'm sorry, Captain Swanson, but l must relieve you of your command.
You'll report to Philadelphia and prepare to leave for England.
Yes, sir.
-Goodbye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye.
Sure you don't want to go, Mac?
Those Tennessee hills are big, wild and away from the crowd.
There'll be you and me and Professor and our surveyor friend.
Mac, are you thinking of leaving me?
This is your home, Jim.
You'll be back, l know.
Make it soon lad. We'll miss you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, Janie, even the worst of enemies must part.
Don't forget us, Jim.
Don't ever forget us.
Not for one small minute.
-Now, lass.
-l'll do my own talking.
There's so much for a man to do that there's no time for, well, other things.
But if there was time, l mean, if l was inclined, l mean... lt wouldn't be any other woman.
Only you.
-Bye, boys.
-Bye, lad.
Janie, where are you going?
With my man.
You've the skirling blood of the... lf she ain't a contrary female MacDougall!

I, Lemuel Gulliver
give thee a faithful history
of my most interesting adventure
in the South Sea.
On the 5th day of November, 1699,
having reached latitude 30 degrees,
two minutes south,
a storm of great fury suddenly...
All's well!
All's well!
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #
Why do they make me sing that song?
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.
All's well!
My feet are wet and my bunions ache, and yet I've to keep wide awake, all night!
I wake folks up to tell them things are all right!
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?
The king has visitors.
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?
There's a giant on the beach!
There, there's a giant out there!
Your majesty.
Thank you, your majesty.
Marriage Contract
King Little of Lilliput
Does this 5th day of November 1699 give the hand of his daughter
Princess Glory to Prince David son of Bombo
King of Blefuscu!
Quite in order, fine.
King Bombo!
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!
Exquisite taste, exquisite!
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.
Ahh!
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!
Oh!
May I?
Oh, please do!
Magnificent!
Oh! A masterpiece!
Vanilla. Wow!
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #
# who came from heaven above. #
# We'll dance tonight together, on a world with me we'll find. #
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not losing a daughter. You’re gaining a son.
My son!
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be, and you'll be for all mine. #
Hmm. Lovely melody.
Yes, we like it.
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.
Of course. Of course.
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!
The song of Blefuscu must be played at the wedding.
But Bombo, Faithful is always played at our weddings.
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty, oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!
Faithful will be played.
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!
No wedding? But the cake and the pretty flowers and.. oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.
Ahh!
It's war!
There's a giant on the beach!
It's war!
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!
War isn't nice.
It was, was this big!
No, no. It was this big!
People get hurt in wars.
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..
Wait your majesty!
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.
But Glory, poor little Glory.
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.
War? Whoopee!
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# You'll share in everything I do, #
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #
# So, forever, forever, #
# My guiding angel you will be. #
# So always have faith in me. #
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
War. Ha. Ha. Rolls off my back like a duck.
But, but I'm, but I'm trying to tell ya!
I'm telling ya there's, there's a...
What's on your mind?
I said..
Speak up, man.
There's a giant on the beach!
There's a giant on the beach!
For heaven's sake, Gabby.
Button your mouth.
Can't you see I have a war on my hands?
Be off with you. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
A war?
Do you suppose he could be a, a spy?
Who's a spy? Who's a spy?
THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!
A giant? Giant? Why don't you tell me things?
Do something. Don't stand there.
Go. Sic the dogs on him.
Fetch him to me at once!
Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!
Wake up, I tell ya! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!
Wake up! Wake up!
Giant on the beach!
Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!
Wake up, I tell ya! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!
Wake up! Wake up!
Giant on the beach!
Wake up! Wake up! There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!
Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!
A giant, on the beach?
A giant?
On the beach?
T-T-There's a, there's a, there's, there's a...
Giant on the beach!
Giant!

Giant, huh! Dragging us out into the dead of the night.
Yeah, chasing wild geese.
Gabby must have been seeing things.
Maybe it just got up and flew away.
Yeah, and breathing fire.
Look out Gabby.
Your giant's gonna bite ya!
Hey, hey fellas, maybe it was me he saw.
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!

Huh?
HE SAID, "THAT'S THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!"
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
There isn't a moment to waste.
Every last man must do all that he can.
Work with the greatest of haste.
So bind up its hands, its arms, its chest, its neck, its feet!

Ohhhh!
Heave! Heave!
Faithful was always played at our weddings... Faithful.
Faithful.
Your, your, your majesty.
Huh?
I've got the giant!
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.
Okay. Okay.
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?
Well where is he?
Out there, your majesty.
Now, then.
Humph! Not good enough for him!
Well, where is he?
From here. On!
Call out the guards, the army, the navy, women and children first, I'll see you later.
Search him, men. He may be armed.
Ohhhh!
Ugh! Why do I get out held?
Your majesty! Let me in!
Look your majesty! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!

Well, well. what have we got here?
Help! Help!
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.
A man. A tiny man.
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.
Millions of kids.
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Help! Put me down! Help! Help!
Drop that! Drop that!
Well, another one. Who are you?
Who me? What? I'm king around here.
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!
Archers! Surround the giant!

Huh! You'll pay for this.

It's Bom
Bo!
Force the gates! Man the battlements!
Defend the city!
We're attacked! We're attacked!
Stop! Stop you swine!
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!
We of Blefuscu are not!
... afraid of anything.
Well, where's everyone gone?
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.
Hello there.
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.
You, your majesty, surely you're not afraid of me?
Nuh uh.
Well, good. Then let me present myself.
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.
At your service.
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.
Ah, splendid, splendid!
I don't think Bombo will give us any further trouble while you're around here.
No sir!
He's on our side, Gabby.
He's on our side!
There's nothing to fear!
The man mountain's on our side!

You understand that not until that giant is removed can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!
Now then, it is up to you to carry this message to my spies in Lilliput.
Be off and may luck be with you!
Too-de-loo!
Get going!
Your majesty, I'm sorry the little princess isn't with us.
Yes, too bad. Too much excitement for one day.
Dear spies: Get rid of that Giant or else... Cordially yours King Bombo

I see that you're a sailor boy.
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.
Fifty times as big as your a, as big as your a, as big as your shoe.
My, my.
Hoy, hoy.
Lost her though in a glorious gale, but I came home on the back of a whale.
But tell me though how you caught the whale.
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.
My, my.
I, I,
I climbed a mountain peak so high.
I bumped my head against the sky.
And there I was, where was I?
On the Island of Alibi.
Hoy, hoy.
My, my.
Hi, hi.
But now my life is very dull.
They ought to make me an admiral.
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!
My, my, my.
You put that ball in there.
And then it goes down and around.
Pull that thing.
And it comes out here.
The g-g-g-g-giant!
Wow!
The light. The light.
Douse the light!
He's gone.
Phew!
Hello! Anybody in there?
Nobody here but just us spi...

Forever! Forever!
That's the song of Blefuscu!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy! A spy!
Charge!
Where is he? Where did he go?
Concealing a spy.
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!
Carry on the search men!
Mind you, your father will hear of this.
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.
..is a dead duck.
P.S. What do we do with the body?
Two hearts and a wedding broken by a melody?
Incredible!
Wait a minute.
I have an idea that might turn this malice to a melody!
Sing Faithful and Forever together, as one song.
The giant will be a dead duck.
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!
Kill him!
I will attack at dawn!
Affectionately yours, Bombo.
Whatcha got there?
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...
Guards! Guards! Guards!
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking at dawn!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!
It's the end of the ending!
To the beach! To the beach!
Bomb.. attacking!
What?
Bombo attacking!
It's war! It's war!
To the beach! To the beach!
The enemy attacks!
To defend Lilliput.
To defend Lilliput!
Yes, forward march.
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?
Bombo's attacking.
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!
Gulliver where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Put me down.
Hah! Well, where you been you lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?
Now, get down there to that beach and wipe out that Bombo and that bunch of Blefuscuians.
And tear em to pieces and don't leave a man alive to tell the tale.
Forward march! Get going!
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.
Hey! Wait for me.
Gulliver, wait for me!
Wait for me, Gulliver!
No note.
Where is it?
What did you done with it?
Where did you lose it?
Who's got it now?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!
Gulliver! Gulliver!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let's go!
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.
Listen!
Hold you fire!
Hear what I have to say.
Bombo, order your men to lay down their arms.
Must I make you listen?
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.
Wait here, Glory.
David!
Fire!
Fire!
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!
David!
Poor, poor, foolish little people.
Look what you've done.
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads over your songs!
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little, because you are thoughtless and selfish?
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior, what have you won?
You were too stubborn to think, too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the harmony that might have been yours.
But now in your sorrow and despair, perhaps you will listen to your songs as they might be sung.

Man: Holly.
Holly.
What time is it now?
Just ten minutes later
Than when you asked before.
And do you think he'll get here in time?
He'll be here any minute now.
Take it easy, John.
Do you really have to tell him tonight?
Yes. Tonight.
I feel that it may be my last.
Now, now, now.
You know you're going to get better.
Holly...
What's become of your passion
For cold, scientific fact?
There he is now.
Hurry.
I believe my uncle's expecting me.
I'm Leo Vincey.
Yes, I can see that.
Hi, Vincey.
Come on in.
Thank you.
My name's Holly, Horace Holly.
Glad to know you.
Confound your English fog.
Our ship was a whole day late.
Well, thank heavens you're-- you're here in time.
Time?
What's all the rush?
Your cable said,
"catch first boat,
Greatest adventure in the world."
What's all the mystery?
You'll hear all about that from your uncle.
But there's one thing my cable didn't say--
John Vincey's dying.
Good lord.
What of?
Radium poisoning.
Hmm.
I haven't seen the old man since I was a kid.
He never quite got over
Our side of the family going american.
Why did he send for me?
There's no time to explain that now, every minute counts.
Come along in.
I'm sorry, sir, I couldn't get here any sooner.
Never mind that, my boy.
There's no time for explanations now.
Come closer.
Holly, did you ever see such a striking resemblance?
Extraordinary.
I'd already noticed it.
Look at that portrait.
Holly, turn on that light.
He does resemble me at that.
Or should I say that I resemble him?
That is your ancestor of a dozen generations ago.
Really?
John Vincey in the 15th century.
Wow. I must say we Vinceys
Have a way of looking like each other.
I have no time for explanations now, my boy.
I'm a man of science.
I'm not superstitious.
If I were,
I might imagine
That your resemblance to a man dead nearly 500 years
Is fate's way of showing me
That you will find again what he discovered.
What is that, sir?
The means of overcoming man's enemy.
Man's enemy?
My enemy, your enemy,
The enemy of all living things.
Careful, John.
That is what I mean, Leo.
That is the swinging march of man's enemy.
Time, bringing death--
Invisible, relentless death.
I guess nobody can stop that.
Who knows?
A lot of men have believed that they could--
Ponce de Leon,
Who searched for the fountain of youth,
Or those 15th-century alchemists
Who tried to discover the elixir of life.
But what connection has all this with me
Or John Vincey over there on the wall?
That's what your uncle's going to tell you.
Holly, get me the box.
Listen to me carefully, Leo.
I haven't time left to tell you more than once.
Uncle John, I don't think you should exert yourself--
Please, please.
What I am going to tell you is a secret
Handed down in our family from father to son.
The first John Vincey there
Did not go on his last great adventure alone.
His wife left their son in England to go with him.
For five years, they vanished from the world.
Then, one night in a town in northern Poland,
A woman-- ill, starving, dying--
Collapsed at the door of an English merchant.
He took her in and heard her ravings of hardship
And fantastic terror.
And that woman was
John Vincey's widow.
Before she died, she became more coherent,
Begged for someone to write a letter
To her family in England.
Here's the letter,
Dictated by that dying woman
Almost five centuries ago.
Yes, it is something of a puzzle.
Doesn't she tell what happened to John Vincey?
Here.
"so he was killed
Because he refused to abandon me."
Does it give any idea where they went to?
Not much, mentions the land of muscovy.
Russia, eh?
Or siberia or kamchatka--
All known as muscovy in the 15th century.
The place where he was killed
Was far, far north.
She escaped with their English servant.
They fell in with some natives
Who guided them back across a glacier
Over what she calls the schugle barrier.
And there, death struck again.
Holly, read it.
"then a great beast sprang on our guides
"and killed them all.
"my servant giles killed the beast,
"but died of his grievous wounds.
So I was left alone."
But what about the discovery you spoke of?
What'd they find?
John: Read on.
"in this strange land, we saw the flame.
"and he who stands therein comes forth unharmed
To triumph over death."
But John Vincey died there.
Why, if he found this, uh, this flame?
Because he was murdered.
But you are scientists.
Do you really take all this seriously?
Seriously?
Come, my boy.
I'll show you how seriously.
Come into the laboratory where Holly and I
Have done our lifework.
In the beginning,
I was as skeptical as you.
Then Holly and I,
Years ago...
In this very room,
Began our efforts to reproduce
John Vincey's life-prolonging flame.
We failed.
But our researches in radioactivity
Carried us far enough to make us believe
That such an element really exists.
An element to preserve life?
Yes.
Seventeen years in this room.
There's one other thing we ought to show him, John.
Here.
Can you make out the inscription?
Holly: It means, "here burns the flame of life."
That is the sole possession
Vincey's wife had left.
She sent it to the son she never saw again.
It's all so mysterious, it doesn't make sense.
This thing's gold, not an unknown element.
To be sure, it's gold.
It's only the symbol of the flame of life
John Vincey found.
Don't you understand?
I'm afraid I don't.
Flame destroys life.
A thousand volts of electricity will destroy life.
But increase the frequency,
And you may safely take a million volts
Through your body.
And the radiation from this unknown element,
This flame of life,
May be a million degrees hotter than any fire we know,
Or it may be as cold as ice. that's too much.
A cold flame?
Did you ever hear of a man being burned
By x-rays or radium?
Mm-hmm.
Did he feel himself being burned?
No. No more than I did myself.
This flame of life, Vincey, is pure radiation,
The most intense and flame-like radiation
In the whole universe.
Radiation from what?
From the unknown element.
Do you really believe such a thing exists?
We no longer believe, we know it exists.
Our experiments prove that.
That's right.
And they also prove something else.
This element cannot be artificially produced.
Only nature, only god can produce it.
But where?
In a glacial region of volcanic character.
That's largely guesswork, isn't it?
No!
Not if the family legend is true,
And I believe that it is.
I believe that John Vincey found that flame
And that it still burns
Somewhere remote and mysterious,
Offering eternal life.
That's why I've sent for you.
You're a Vincey,
The last of us.
Holly can't do it alone,
But he'll go with you.
John Vincey was an explorer.
It's in your blood, too,
And the love of-- of adventure.
Don't look upon this as a deathbed wish.
If you should try,
If you succeed,
I shan't be here.
But I hope that somehow I shall know
And somehow share in your triumph
When you say...
"here burns...
The flame of life."
Uncle John?
John?
John!
Holly: Let's hope this chap has some tea.
Leo: I'll take mine with a big reindeer steak.
Fine old northern hospitality--
Nothing in the world like it, they tell me.
Northern hospitality, eh?
Well, I'm blown.
I thought you were some of those
Infernal wandering chantos.
Can't take any chances with them.
Don't we know it-- stayed with a tribe of 'em last week.
Planning to stay here the night, I take it.
We hope so. Come 20 miles today.
Come in.
Come in.
Sit down, both of you.
There's a big stew on the stove just about ready,
Plenty to go around. yeah,
I'm--I'm glad of that.
Hey!
How about supper?!
Do we eat or don't we?!
Huh? Oh, that's my daughter Tanya.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now, then, gents,
Do I understand you want to do business with me?
We heard you had the post furthest up country.
We thought you might be able
To help us get some natives to go on.
Where do you want to go?
Did you ever hear of the schugle barrier?
Why, yes. I've heard natives talk of it.
Leo, at last, we're on our way.
On your way where?
Over the schugle.
You're crazy.
Why?
You'll never get a native to guide you there.
We'll pay him well.
That ain't the point.
They're afraid to go, I tell ya.
Why?
Because no one who got over ever came back,
So far as I know.
Well, why didn't they come back?
What lies beyond the schugle?
More of the same, I suppose.
Of course, the natives have tales about it.
Well, what do they say?
I never paid much attention to their foolishness.
I can tell you.
You can? What is it?
The natives say that beyond the schugle,
There are terrible dangers.
They say--
Bah!
Yes? Go on.
Why, it's just a sort of legend.
Holly: What is the legend?
A long time ago, they believe,
A woman came out of the country
That lies far beyond the schugle.
What sort of woman?
A white woman.
She told them that she had escaped from a strange place.
Strange?
And if a man finds the way there,
He will never die. the catch in that
Is he dies before he gets there!
Hold your trap, Tanya, you gab too much.
Wait.
Is there anything in the story about fire?
A flame?
Anything you can connect with this?
No, I don't think so.
What's that?
Gold, ain't it?
Yes.
It is gold.
I see.
Well, now you begin to make sense.
So that's what lies beyond the schugle.
No. You don't understand.
Gold isn't what we're interested in.
Ah.
Suppose I could get a few natives to go on.
How much could you pay them?
Anything they asked.
Well, that's liberal enough.
Money no object, eh?
Lads...
No one can say old Dugmore ever let a white man down.
I'll get natives to go.
I'll run the outfit myself,
And you needn't pay me a penny.
How's that for an offer?
What?
What about those dangers you talked about?
I'll be frank with you gents--
I figure it's worth some risk
To be a partner in what you're after.
My dear sir, that's absurd.
You can't be a part in what we're looking for.
I said a partner.
You try to keep me out of this,
And I'll fix it so that no native in these parts
Will come within a thousand miles of ya. take it or leave it.
Dugmore: Tanya, here.
I tell you again, Dugmore, you're crazy.
You can't take a girl up there.
Oh, stop rowing about it.
I'm sick of hearing it.
We don't know what we're getting into.
What's your idea, then?
To leave her here alone
With no one around for 400 miles
Except a lot of wandering chantos
Who'd like to get even with me?
Anyhow, we want somebody to cook.
My dear, has anybody taken the trouble
To ask you what-- what you want to do?
I want to go.
There, you see?
She wouldn't leave her poor old pa.
Well, if there were anyplace to leave her,
I wouldn't let her come along.
Think you'll be all right?
I'm all right.
Come along, let's go.
Let's go.
Leo: Hey, Dugmore!
Look.
That may lead to a way over the schugle barrier.
What do you think?
Well, let's hope so.
We've followed that cliff for a week
Without finding a way through it.
Anyhow, it'll be a shelter from the wind,
And the dogs can't go on without a rest.
Hurry up with that food, Tanya.
It'll be ready as soon as I get it thawed out.
Hmm.
I wouldn't mind being thawed out myself.
Leo, this is no place to camp.
But Dugmore says the dogs need a rest.
I don't like it.
Sitting down here under this wall of ice,
It's--it's dangerous.
What's the matter with you now?
What's dangerous?
There you are.
Well, what of it?
You've heard that several times lately.
In this narrow place,
Any noise might start vibrations
Which might cause an avalanche.
Merely shouting might do it.
Aw, pipe down.
Who's lived in the north for 20 years, me or you?
Lecture yourself out of that, professor.
You...
Hurry up with that grub.
I still don't like it.
Mmm, smells good.
Tastes good, too-- snow rabbits.
The ones I shot?
Oh, I'll fix that.
You don't have to help me.
But I want to.
You think having me along is a nuisance.
Oh.
We couldn't get along without you.
I wish you really meant that.
I do, honest.
Because I can cook? well, not only that,
But there's another reason...
Your father.
If it weren't for you, I couldn't get along with him for a minute.
But with you here, I find him at least bearable.
I know.
That isn't very nice of me, is it?
I can't blame you, but...
I understand.
He's your father.
You see, I was brought up
By the Russian sisters at Yuroshi.
The convent broke up about a year ago,
And--and he came and took me to the trading post.
He said he was my father.
Oh, I begin to understand.
Well, it's all right, really.
But it isn't all right.
When we get back from this trip,
I'll teach him how a girl like you ought to be treated.
If I had a daughter like you,
Don't you think I'd love her and show her that I do?
Would you?
Why, of course I would.
I don't see how he can help loving you.
Why, you're...You're--
Vincey!
Vincey! Holly! Holly!
What's up?
The natives have just come down from the glacier,
Shrieking something about a white man.
Let's go up and see what it's about.
They'll show us the way.
Come on.
By the lord Harry.
What a beast.
Holly, what is it?
Unless I'm barmy, it's-- it's a saber-toothed tiger.
Think of it, man!
That's a new one on me.
Saber-toothed tiger--
They've been extinct for thousands of years, haven't they?
In all known parts of the world, yes.
But here...
They must've been preserved in that ice for-- for 400 to 500 years.
They must've camped in this glacier.
Look how that man's dressed!
Holly, the servant--
The faithful servant who was with John Vincey's wife.
What'd the parchment say, remember?
By Jove, Leo, you're right.
He killed the great beast, but died of the wounds it gave him.
And she escaped alone, remember?
Holly, we found our way, the way to the flame.
Look.
That stiff's got a chain around his neck,
And there's a ripped canvas bag.
It's gold.
This ice ain't so thick, and with this ax--
Don't be a fool!
You heard what Holly said
About any vibration causing an avalanche.
Oh, the professor says a lot of things.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Dugmore!
Dugmore!
Dugmore!!!
Stop it, you fool!
Aah!!
Ohh!! Aah!!
There's no hope for the others.
You know that.
I know.
No sledges, no food, and no way back.
And no way forward.
Holly, look.
This was covered by the glacier.
It may lead through the barrier.
Tanya?
All right.
At least this is a shelter from the wind.
Interesting formation.
Pity there isn't more light.
Oh, I'm tired.
Poor kid, you've had a tough time of it.
Leo! Leo, Tanya!
Come quick!
Look.
There's our way.
Our way? Where?
What are you talking about?
Don't you understand?
They're fumeroles, volcanic formation--
One hour ago, ice, glacial ice--
And now, volcanic heat.
I get it-- what uncle John talked about.
We could never get through.
Of course we can.
Listen, Tanya,
When I wanted to leave you at the trading post,
What'd you say?
Why, I said I wanted to go.
All right, come on.
Sulfur, of course.
Phosphorus, too.
That accounts for the glow.
Well, that's the last of 'em.
Can't we rest a bit?
Look, there's more light.
Yes, and another opening.
Aah!
Just a minute, Leo, give 'em a chance to show if they're friendly.
Try your lingo, Tanya.
We--we greet you, my friend.
Nagu-da.
Other natives:
Nagu-da, nagu-da.
Nagu-da.
Thank you.
Nagu-da.
Say it to him, Leo.
Well, what does it mean?
"good day" or "how are you?" or "greetings"
Or something of the kind.
Don't--don't judge
'em by their looks.
They're most probably a very friendly people.
Show your confidence in them.
You know what it means, Tanya?
No.
It's all right, we're coming.
Well, they seem awfully pleased to see us, don't they?
Thank you, thank you.
Nagu-da.
Nagu-da.
You see?
I was right.
They're just kind, hospitable, simple people.
I'm not sure they're so simple.
Leo, do you realize what we're eating?
Some sort of melon.
It's a pre-melon, something like papaya.
What of it?
What of it?
Tropical fruit here in the arctic?
It means there's some sort of fertile country
Somewhere beyond these caves.
It may be what we're looking for.
All: huh.
Huh!
Huh!
This doesn't look so good to me.
Huh!
Nonsense.
I suspect it's a ceremony of welcome.
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh! Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Leo.
Steady, Tanya, steady.
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
What's up now?
As I told you, a ceremony of welcome.
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh! Huh! Huh!
I don't like this.
Oh, nonsense, it's-- it's most interesting.
Come with me.
Aah!!!
Uhh!
Leo!
Are you all right, Leo?
Nagu-da?
I...I-I-I thought...
Steady, Leo.
Leo, you are hurt.
Holly, watch him.
Tanya: Wait, please!
Old gentleman...
My friend, him very sick.
No can walk.
You get out...Out.
Let him...Ride.
Oh, Holly, I'm trying to tell him
That Leo can't walk any further.
Holly: You old idiot,
Can't you see for yourself he's hurt?
Oh!
Holly, he's dying.
No, no, Tanya.
Bad concussion, I'm afraid. do not be afraid.
He will not die.
But--but how can you know English?
I have a wise teacher who knows all tongues.
But wait, wait.
Who--who was your teacher?
What is this place?
Where are we going?
What--what's gonna happen?
You will learn your fate from hash-a-mo-tep.
Tanya, Tanya.
It's all right, Leo.
I say, this is incredible!
What is this place?
Country of kor.
Kor?
Tanya, think of it--
You're seeing something
That nobody ever dreamed existed.
Hush.
Aren't you interested?
No.
That mountain...
There are stairs and a great door.
What is it?
It's the palace of hash-a-mo-tep,
Hollowed in the heart of the mountain.
Woman:
Speak in English, then,
So the strangers may understand.
Returning from the journey on which you sent me,
I passed the place where dwelled the peoples
Of the caves.
I weary of those people.
There, I found these strangers fighting for their lives.
The cave people would have killed them.
Against my order, known these many years
That any stranger must be brought to me unharmed?
Have not their fathers and their fathers' fathers
Taught them that my word is law?
They await your judgment, o queen.
They shall not go unpunished.
What is your name, stranger?
Holly, o queen.
Welcome, Holly,
Though you are not he for whom I wait.
But I don't understand.
Why should you?
What do you know of immortal dreams,
Immortal memories?
But who are you?
I am yesterday and today and tomorrow.
I am sorrow and longing and hope unfulfilled.
I am hash-a-mo-tep, she--
She who must be obeyed.
I am...I.
But you speak my language.
How is that?
I learned it from a countryman of yours
Long ago.
What's that?
You mean there's been another Englishman here
In your lifetime?
Who? How long ago?
See that the strangers are well-treated, Billali.
I will decide later what they shall do.
And the other one?
The other?
A young man, wounded in the fight.
I thought-- you thought?!
Bring him to me at once!
It's not enough that I should wait in hope
Unending years in pain.
Then you forget my orders, disobey my commands.
Who gives you leave to think contrary to my will?!
Nearer, bring him nearer.
That's it!
Aah!!!
John Vincey...John Vincey!
Oh, my love...
My dearest love.
At last.
You're hurt.
Billali...
Billali, take him to my chamber.
Through the forbidden door?
Yes.
And bear him gently.
Please let me go with him!
Who are you?
You are his wife?
No! I'm nothing to him!
But he needs someone!
He will not be alone.
Tanya: No!! Leo!!
Oh, please, please let me go!
Let me go with him, I tell you!
Let me go! Leo!
Leo!
I--I just had to see how he is.
What gives you so much courage?
Can you help him?
He will wake from his sleep refreshed and well.
There's no need to fear.
Are you sure?
Yes. Look if you will.
Then leave.
How often have I watched beside him lying so.
But now, this is warm.
Flesh.
He needs nothing you have to give.
Go now.
Go before he wakes.
And forget him.
He is not for you.
Why do you hate me?
Hate you?
Why, you're nothing.
Nothing.
Once, long ago,
A woman like you destroyed my happiness.
The same thing shall not happen again.
How's Leo?
Leo?
You know, my friend.
Vincey.
Vincey. Oh, yes.
Have no fear.
She will heal him.
I see.
Look here...
You're the most important man in the country, aren't you?
I have served she continuously for more than half a century.
What?! Half a century?
You're joking.
You think I'm too young?
Oddly enough, I wasn't thinking about you.
What are you doing?
It's an old English custom.
What is it?
Smoking. Don't you smoke?
Smoke and fire.
Do you worship the flame?
Of course, old boy.
Don't you?
It will soon be time for the yearly offering
In the hall of kings.
There you may see the sacred fires rekindled
If she permits you to be present.
You think if I showed her this?
What's the matter?
What does it mean?
Are you tired of life?
Then question she concerning that.
But tell me...
Who is this who stands in fire?
Ask no more questions,
I tell you.
It is she's own secret.
Put it away.
Very well.
I thought that you might know.
How should I know?
She goes alone.
Alone?
On such a long journey?
Long journey?
No. There in the hall of--
You're cunning.
I said too much already.
Well, just tell me one more thing.
How long has she ruled over kor?
All her life.
But...
Tanya, what's happened?
She wouldn't let me stay.
She is with Leo.
You saw him?
He's still asleep.
She says he'll be well when he wakes.
Oh, but, Holly, Holly, I'm afraid.
I--I feel something evil about her.
She would not let you stay to speak with him?
You mean that she is planning to keep us apart?
What nonsense.
Leo will have something to say about that.
You think so?
But you may see him.
She has commanded that you both be present at the trial.
You mean the trial of the men who attacked us?
Punishment of the men who injured him.
What does it mean?
She knows Leo.
She says he belongs to her.
She called him John Vincey.
But, Holly, how could she know John Vincey?
How could she?
I want to believe it.
Suppose it's true?
Suppose it's true?!
Did you dream I was watching while you slept?
I dreamed of a man dead for centuries.
And you called me by his name.
Dreams are only memories
In the endless flow of time.
Who are you?
Drink.
Had I known you were coming,
You would've been welcomed like a king.
Where are my friends?
Take the food.
Be strong again.
But Tanya, the girl who was--
She is here in my palace.
I remember vaguely.
Someone brought us here...
And you said-- what?
It's all foggy now.
Who are you?
You do not remember?
How can I?
I've never seen you before.
I was so sure when you came at last
You would remember.
I was so sure you could not forget.
I have summoned slaves to attend you.
Later, you will hear my judgment on those
Who dared attack you.
But wait...
Tell me, how is it you speak my language?
And still, you do not understand.
I say, Tanya, what-- what's the meaning of this?
Where'd you get that outfit?
From the old man.
Billali?
He said I was to put it on and look as well as I could.
I wonder why he cares how you look.
Good. Young man will be pleased.
How is Leo?
That, you will soon discover for yourself.
Come.
If he's well, he will go back to his own country?
Oh, yes.
Why, of course he will.
Then, I hope he'll soon be well enough to travel.
Tanya...And Holly.
Glad to see ya, how are ya?
That's just what
I was gonna ask you,
But there's no need.
Listen, Leo, I think
I've got some big news for you.
Leo, are you sure you're all right?
How do I look?
Want me to squeeze ya and try my strength?
Listen to this, I pumped old Billali about the flame--
Shh!
She summons you.
Sit near the throne.
Go ahead, o king.
Aw. Come on, the both of ya.
You alone.
You two, come with me.
Huh?
Well, Leo, I'll see you later.
Got lots to tell you.
There are marvels to be seen today.
A stranger shares the throne,
Where I may scarce approach.
Hmm.
Come.
I've summoned you, Holly,
That you may observe how justice is meted out in kor.
Let the prisoners stand forth.
You earth-born people...
You haunters of darkness,
How you try my patience.
Point out those who were reckless enough
To lay hands upon you.
Well, I'll point out those I'm sure of.
Those two men there.
And this one.
This man.
I believe he was the leader.
That's all.
Only four, out of all those men, attacked you?
That's all I'm sure of.
They will die.
What?
They shall be put to death.
But I don't want that.
Would you spare them?
Oh, yes...A christian.
I'd almost forgotten.
I remember in the market place of Jerusalem,
They spoke of a man who taught mercy and forgiveness.
A man who died
So that others might live,
As though death could beget life.
Tell them to stand up, Billali.
Aah!!
No!!
How could you be so calm
And send people to their deaths like that?
Silence!
Is the girl also tired of life?
I'm not afraid of you.
Tanya.
She: There is an end of my indulgence.
Come away, Tanya.
Leo: Yes, Holly, go with her.
I'm the one who spoke out of turn.
We don't want these fellows butchered
Just because we had a fight with them.
Punish them if you like, but-- but not that.
Do you think I'm cruel for the sake of cruelty?
Then why do you torture them?
How do you think I rule these people?
It's not by force.
It's by terror.
My empire is of the imagination.
Still, I beg you, stop this.
Thanks. That makes me feel a lot better,
All of us.
And don't hold anything against Tanya.
What is that girl to you?
Nothing, I...I feel responsible for her.
May I--do you mind if I go now?
I'd like to tell her everything's all right.
Go, then.
Yes, Billali?
The prisoners...
Are they to be turned back to the caves?
No. Kill them.
All?
All. Kill them.
Make an end.
Would I could kill my fears so easily.
She's wicked, I tell you.
Don't be too hard on her, Tanya.
She's strange...
And wonderful.
Well, after all, she didn't go through with it.
She would've killed them, except for you.
Listen, Leo, I've got it.
Got what?
We're going to find out everything we want to know
Through you.
Good idea, huh?
What is there to find out
Except how to escape from this horrible place?
You should've seen Billali when I showed him this.
Almost knocked his forehead on the floor,
Frightened out of his wits.
Said it was she's secret.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
All in good time.
We don't know the secret yet,
But I'll wager pounds to pence
That you're the one person who can get it from her.
Leo, please don't go to her.
Don't you worry, Tanya.
Holly, I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
If she knows where the flame burns,
We're going to find it.
Leo...
It's hard to be kept waiting when one has waited so long.
You must have known I'd come.
Do you think blind chance brought you here?
I came because of an old story.
A woman escaped from this country
And told of a strange adventure
And died.
She left this for her son.
This woman was the wife of--
John Vincey.
John Vincey died 500 years ago.
How can you know his name?
Think back, far back.
Oh, my beloved...
You will, you can--
Another life, a far-off forgotten place...
This place.
And my voice uttering words you vowed to remember
Through endless time.
Think.
Your voice?
You...Were you the same?
Always to you, always,
Offering all, wanting all.
You mean, we...
I can't believe...
I have no memories.
I will show you how to look across the mist of time.
That one moment out of all the centuries.
That one instant when
I felt myself beloved.
Who was that man?
You do not know?
No, it can't be.
I dare not believe it.
You will believe.
Come.
Do you wonder whose feet have worn away this rock?
Once, this stair was new and level.
But I've passed here day by day.
And, see, my sandals
Have eaten off the solid stone.
Now, in a moment, you will remember that other life.
I...I see myself.
Swept by the tides of time
Back to my arms.
Centuries ago, you were someone else,
As I was this man here.
No, no. I'm the same.
My life and youth endured.
All through the years,
I've mourned here where your body lay.
But now...
You are reborn,
And my mourning has ended.
Your coming is the sign of my forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
For what?
I know why you've come to call.
You seek the flame of life.
Even as I came, a young girl,
So many lives ago.
I took the burden of immortality upon my shoulders
And wore it through unbelievable years--
Dark, with a loneliness
Through which there shone a single light,
Fixed and unwavering--
The hope of love...
And so I waited,
Waited for a bridegroom
Whose passion for life would be as fierce as my own.
You came, John Vincey,
And I loved you.
For one moment, you were mine.
Then you turned from me.
You had not come alone.
And, in my jealousy, I...
I killed you.
Again, I waited, seeming longer than before.
But I knew you must return.
Your love of life must be stronger than death.
And now you're here,
Nothing shall stand between us.
But I'm not John Vincey.
Oh, my love.
Take away my eyes.
Let darkness utterly shut me in,
And still my ears would know the sound
Of your unforgotten voice.
If I could only remember.
If you've forgotten me,
Then that woman who held you in spite of me...
You've forgotten her as well?
Yes.
I've forgotten.
She wasn't beautiful.
She had no wisdom such as mine.
Yet, you could never quite leave her.
I've forgotten everything but you.
Everything-- no, no.
Now, as then, we two are made of different clay.
Until you are as I am, come no nearer.
Today, in the hall of kings,
The priest makes sacrifice in gratitude
For my enduring youth.
Then you shall come with me
And share my secret.
Leo!
I say, Leo, what did you find out?
I've seen John Vincey.
What?
I tell you, I saw him!
Now, be reasonable.
John Vincey's been dead for--for 500 years.
I--I tell you, I--
I saw him lying there.
Holly, it was I, myself.
Now, one thing at a time.
You mean a mummified body that looked like you?
No, no, Holly.
I saw myself lying there.
Are you trying to make me believe in reincarnation?
Rats! You knew before
That you were the image of John Vincey.
We both knew that.
She has been waiting for me to come back.
She says I am John Vincey.
Leo, don't listen to her!
Let's get away while there's time.
Holly, she is going to show me the flame.
What? Do you hear that, Tanya?
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
When?
When do we go?
You are not to see it.
But you said--
I said she promised me the secret.
Well, then, I see.
Only you?
Yes.
Oh.
You can't stay here.
You'll go back the way we came, you and Tanya,
As soon as the temple ceremony is over.
You'll be protected.
Then I go to the flame.
Leo...
Don't lose your head,
Use it!
I haven't lost my head.
I've found memories you can't even imagine.
I've seen strangeness, beauty, power--
Yes, immortality--
And I can share it.
But only I.
Those are her terms.
What man would say no?
Be fair.
Very well.
I'll take Tanya back with me.
But let me tell you one thing, Leo--
You're a fool,
And you'll die for your folly
Like your ancestor
John Vincey.
Leo.
I'm sorry, Tanya.
Don't think of me, think of yourself.
I am thinking of myself.
To live forever, it's--
It's what all men have dreamed of.
What's the use of living a thousand years,
If you're going on being cruel and selfish?
Is a thousand years of that any better than 70?
But people would change, grow good.
Has she grown good?
Yes.
Did she let
John Vincey escape?
Would she let you escape if...
If you loved me?
Tanya, I...
You're not tempted as I am.
Think of it-- never to grow old, never to feel age.
I can't give it up.
You will live here in this--this tomb...
Always young with her.
You will never know age nor grief.
That isn't the kind of love I want.
What is it you want?
Why...
Why..
Just two people to live together
And to love each other.
To laugh at little things and--
And sometimes cry over big ones.
To share what-- whatever comes along.
And to grow old together.
And, someday,
When one is gone...
To hope to be together again somewhere.
That isn't much to offer, is it?
Compared to kingdoms and power and glory
That will never change.
Tanya...
Hail, Vincey!
Hash-a-mo-tep sends me to tell you
That the festival of the sacred well
Will begin at the setting of the sun.
You and Holly will be guided through the hall of kings.
And Tanya?
The lady may not come.
No woman may view the ceremony of the well
But the maidens of the temple.
I don't want to see any more ceremonies.
I'm going to talk to Holly again.
Tanya...
Man: Stop--
Tanya: I must,
I've got to talk to her!
Oh, why can't I make you understand?
I'm sorry, I...
They wouldn't let me pass, and I had to see you.
Well?
You--you are sending us away.
You will return to your own country.
Yes, I know.
Leo told us.
But...Please...
What is it you want?
Let Leo come with us.
Send him away, too.
Send him away?
Are you mad?
Please.
He came here following a dream--
A dream men have followed
Since the first son saw his father die.
He alone, of all men, has realized that dream,
And you ask me to send him away,
To send him back to you
And your little mortal love.
No, no. Even if he never loves me...
Why, I have to make you understand.
It's not for myself.
I'm pleading for him.
You're pleading for him?
What can you or the world you live in offer him
That will last longer than a miserable human life?
After the festival in the hall of kings,
There will be slaves waiting at the outer wall
To guide you in safety to your little world.
Go now.
Go if you fear my anger.
Then if you won't send him back,
Well, will you let me stay here
Where I can see him sometimes?
What harm can that do?
What can it take away from you?
You will have everything.
You will have him.
I shall have nothing
If you take away being near him.
I'm taking nothing away from you that was ever yours.
He has been mine since...
Why do I stand here talking with you?
Go now!
Why are you afraid of me?
Afraid?
You are afraid.
And now I see why.
Because I'm human, and you're not.
Because I'm young,
And you know love belongs to the young.
Your magic makes you seem young,
But in your heart, you're old, old!
You were young once like me, but now you're old,
And it's too late for love forever.
He will never love you.
I know that now.
Keep him here!
Make him king over your slaves and savages!
But he will never love you!
Never! Never! Never!
Go!
She came here from his arms.
The sacrifice within the hour
In the hall of kings...
He shall sit beside you on the throne
And watch her die
And not know.
Who can be blamed if she wanders away,
And no one can find her?
Send men to search.
Show concern for his sorrow.
All the while knowing that he watched her die.
And she, through her veil,
Saw him watching.
Tanya: What is this?!
Where are you taking me?!
What is this?
What are they doing?
It is she's command.
She sends you as an offering to the flame.
No! Leo!
Leo!
Foolish one.
Would you destroy him, too?
If he could hear you, if he knew your fate,
What could he do?
Let him try to save you,
And he will be set upon by soldiers and priests.
He will die with you.
But he shall not know.
This is a happy festival for kor...
The happiest of all for me.
That girl they're bringing in,
What does she do?
She carries to the gods my gratitude
For the gift of enduring life.
Carries to the...How?
You shall see.
Is she a dancer, too?
No...
She will not dance.
Is this a human sacrifice?
It's the immemorial custom of the people of kor.
Is that...?
No, it can't be.
Who is that girl?
Who is it?
Is it Tanya?
It's Tanya!!
Take her to the stairs.
Through those doors!
Ohh!!
Aah!!
Aah!!
Ohh! Ohh!
You found my temple,
But you came the dangerous way.
Here is what you sought.
So the flame of life has leapt from the earth
Since time began.
What does the flame or anything else matter now?
I want no power you have to give.
I want nothing you have to give.
He thinks he loves you now.
I can wait.
Wait?
For what?
For you to grow old.
Until then, you will be cared for
As my dearest possession.
And he?
He will bathe in the flame and be as I am.
You will grow old, withered, ugly.
And when at last, repelled, he turns from you,
I shall be standing by his side unchanged.
And if I won't go in the flame?
You have no choice.
If you refuse, the girl shall die.
Kill me, then!
You mean, if I refuse to go in the flame,
You'll have her killed?
Oh, Leo,
I'd rather die now.
I'll always love you,
Tanya.
No, no.
Trust me.
Believe in my love.
I'm ready.
No, Leo, it's a trick!
How do you know you won't be burned alive?
If I stand in the flame
And come forth unharmed,
Then will you follow?
I will.
Don't think you can go unpunished forever.
Somewhere, there's a power
That won't let such wickedness and cruelty go on.
Your hair will whiten.
Your eyes will lose their brightness.
Your cheeks will wrinkle.
Your limbs will wither...
While I defy the years and laugh at time.
I call upon the flame most powerful, most swift--
Preserver of life and youth and beauty.
Your eyes will lose their brightness.
Your cheeks will wrinkle.
Your limbs will wither.
While I defy the years
And laugh at time.
Now do you believe
I spoke the truth?
My love.
I can't see you clearly.
My eyes...
The flame.
My voice sounds strange to my ears.
I die.
I die!
Have pity on my shame.
I remember, long ago,
A garden...
In the sun.
Dead?
Dead!
She cannot die!
A party of slaves that were to guide you.
The gold symbol...
We'll be safe.
She told me.
The greatest secret in the world,
And we're turning our backs on it.
Holly: "she staggered to the ground,
"a withered creature, incredibly old.
"and so she died terribly and pitifully
"even as her lips spoke of eternal life.
"but though she was dead,
"the power of her golden symbol reached out and held us safe.
"and so, after incredible adventures,
"we escaped to the outer world.
"and thus we lived to record the story
In this manuscript."
It seems as though it couldn't have happened.
Why, no one could believe it
Unless they'd been there with us.
Now that we're safe in this friendly world,
Do you know, I feel sorry for her.
We never shall know what really did happen.
I sometimes think
That her bathing in the flame a second time
Was an overexposure
To that terrifically powerful unknown element.
And sometimes I think that such--
Such inhuman immortality was never meant to be,
And some greater power than she
Reached out and-- and destroyed her.
After all, Holly,
Perhaps there is no real flame of life.
I think there is.
What?
Yes. Right here.
Holly: Here?
In this fireplace--
The flame in any fireplace
In any home where two people live and love each other...
And in their hearts.
Gentlemen, 1949 marks the 25th anniversary...
...of the FBI as it exists today.
Like many another success story, this one had humble beginnings.
The first G-men worked under staggering disadvantages.
Do you realize that not many years ago, a fleeing kidnapper or bank robber...
...could take one step across a state line and thumb his nose at us?
Often when we made an arrest we had to walk...
...into a rain of hoodlum machine-gun fire...
...though we were forbidden by law to carry a revolver.
But, gentlemen, the bureau did have as weapons...
...truth, drive and vitality.
Even before the government armed us with guns and laws...
...G- men became a dreaded underworld whisper.
I'm going to take you back to those days...
...and show you a motion picture about a man named "Brick" Davis.
It's the daddy of all FBI pictures.
It's the first one that called us G-men.
The cars are old, you won't see women wearing the new look...
...but you will see something that the bureau has never forgotten.
That while times change and habits change and styles change...
...one thing is constant:
The man who want to get more out of life than he puts into it...
...the hoodlum...
...he's the same today as he was then.
He is still a public enemy.
All right, Vince.
Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you must know what justice can mean...
...to a man who is defenseless because he is poor.
How would you feel if a huge corporation bulldozed you...
...into selling your life's work...
...an invention that has made them millions, and selling it for what?
A paltry $5000.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to look upon my client.
A man who has stood silently at a workbench for years...
...planning, working, striving to create...
- Are you Davis?
- Yeah, come in.
Glad to meet you.
My name is Joseph Kratz.
- Oh, yes. Sixth Ward.
- Oh, you know me, eh?
- Heard of you. Sit down.
- Thanks.
Got a good case for you, Davis. One that'll make you a lot of friends if you take it.
That's fine. What do you get out of it?
Me? Nothing. A friend of mine's in jail on a bum rap.
- I want you to defend him.
- What'd he do?
Why, he got drunk last night and beat up his old lady.
- His mother?
- Yeah.
- Nice fella.
- Well, you know how things like that are.
- They book him on assault and battery?
- They're gonna hook him on the Sullivan Act.
The sap was carrying a gun and beat her with the butt of it.
- Accidentally?
- Yeah, accidental.
But if she kicks off, he's up for murder.
Do you think I'd defend a guy like that?
- Why not?
- I'd rather beat his brains out.
I don't want the case, Kratz.
It smells.
Now, wait a minute, just a minute,
Davis, before you turn this down.
There are a lot of boys around my ward who'll play ball with you if you take it.
You don't want a lawyer, Kratz, you want a crook.
Take your dirty work to somebody else.
Now, don't pull any of that honest lawyer stuff on me.
"Big Shot" McKay didn't pick you out of the gutter...
...and send you through college for nothing.
- Out.
- All right, all right.
When you change your mind, let me know.
Call me up. You'll never get anywhere playing shyster for that rat.
Hey!
- Eddie!
- Yeah, Eddie.
That's a swell way to treat a customer.
Just a greaseball!
Well, if it isn't old man
Department of Justice himself.
- When'd you get here?
- Flew up this morning.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Sit down. Park yourself.
Well, well. What, no brass button, no badge? What is this?
Nobody has any time to polish them.
Too busy going around with a big badge frightening people.
What a lawyer. A year out of school, you're using the same argument.
And it's still good.
What's the use of going to law school...
...if you're gonna throw it over and play cops and robbers.
If you had gone into practice, you'd be at the top now...
...instead of flatfooting around.
Law's a great game.
Maybe so. But you sure look funny sitting behind a desk.
I suppose I have to entertain while you're here.
Not for a couple of days. I have an appointment with a chap named Durfee.
- After that, okay.
- That's swell.
I'll try to clean up most of my work.
I think I can get a whole day off.
Are you getting much business?
Business is terrific.
I have to throw half of it out.
What's the use of kidding, Brick?
Kidding?
You ought to keep your law books dusted off.
Old eagle-eye.
- Things are pretty tough, aren't they?
- Yeah.
But only because
I don't wanna be a shyster.
Which means blackmailing and ambulance chasing.
I've been in too many back alleys as a kid to wanna go back.
You've gotta have a West Side office to get decent business.
And I've got the East Side and...
The elevated.
I wish you were in the department.
You'd make a good G-man.
- You starting that again?
- Yeah. What's more, you'd like it.
You'd be out seeing some action...
...instead of sitting in a law office getting fat between the ears.
It's a great department, Brick.
A great bunch of fellas.
When they tackle a job, they stick to it till it's finished...
...and no fat-faced politician standing around telling them what to do.
I brought a department report along and an application I want you to read.
Now, think it over, mule. I have to shove along. I'll see you Thursday.
All right, Eddie, I'll be here.
- Well, I'm out.
- Same here.
- Let you two guys fight it out.
- Check.
Well, 200.
- Two more.
- You're called.
Ace full.
The guy's right, the gardenia does bring him luck.
This keeps up, I'll believe it.
- Who is it?
- Durfee.
Hello, Leggett.
- Hello, fellas.
- Hello. What's eating you?
The heat's on me.
Will you lend me some dough?
- Dough? You wouldn't try to rib us?
- No, on the level.
How about that counterfeit you been printing?
- I haven't got any.
- What?
A government guy tailing me for the post-office job wrecked the plant.
- I've gotta get across the state line.
- Tough break.
- Okay, Dan?
- Yeah.
- Let us know when you're light.
- Thanks.
- I'll pay you back, double. So long.
- Don't forget that.
- No, I won't.
- Deal me out.
It's a tough break.
He ought to get himself an arsenal and stick around.
Why, those government guys don't even carry rods.
You're under arrest, Durfee.
Kill the lights.
Give me a reacher.
- What's the matter?
- Copper's got him.
Louie.
- How are you, Mr. Davis?
- Is Mr. McKay in?
- He's in his office, sir.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Oh, hello, Brick.
- Busy, Mac?
- No, come on in.
Well, sit down.
- Have a cigar?
- No, thanks.
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I've been sticking pretty close to the office.
- Much business?
- No, no.
Well, come on, kid, spill it.
What's on your chest?
- I wanna talk some things over with you.
- Go ahead, shoot.
Tell me, Mac, how much did you spend on me?
- I mean, education and everything?
- About 20 grand. Why?
That's an awful lot of dough.
Chicken feed when you like a guy.
Was that the only reason?
Well, maybe I wanted to see a kid that had the same start in life that I had...
...make a real success.
Haven't had much success.
Nobody gets ahead fast when they play the game on the level.
- That's the way you want me to play it?
- That's the only way to play it.
I been in rackets all my life, Brick.
They don't pay off. Except in dough.
Well, Mac, it looks like I'm gonna cross you.
- You wouldn't turn crook?
- No, no.
But I am giving up the law business.
I've tried to make a go of it, but it's no use.
Guess I wasn't cut out to warm a desk chair.
Well, maybe that's right.
What are you gonna do?
I've joined the Department of Justice.
They accepted my application yesterday.
How'd you happen to do this?
Buchanan.
I got you.
They want you in Washington.
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
That puts me on the other side of the fence from you.
That's where you ought to be.
But they're out to get you.
You and everybody else in your racket.
If they assign me to go after you,
I've gotta use everything I know.
You got to play ball with them, Brick.
Go to it.
Now, Mac...
You won't get me, Brick.
I'm going to quit.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
But what about Collins and Leggett and all the rest? Will they let you quit?
They still take orders from me whether they know it or not.
- Hi, Louie.
- Gentlemen. Hi, boys.
Hi, Ruby.
Yeah, you can put them both on one.
- May I check your hat, sir?
- No, thanks.
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
- Come on, hurry up.
- Okay.
- Are you ready, Jean?
- Okay.
- Hello, Brad.
- How are you, Louise?
Hello, baby, how are you?
- Busy. Ever think of knocking?
- I never knock.
It does save getting splinters in your knuckles.
- Someday someone's gonna knock you flat.
- What are you doing tonight?
- I think I've got a date.
- With me?
- Nope. Brick Davis.
- Oh, is he here?
Yes.
- See you sometime.
- So long, Mac.
Don't hit any foul balls.
I'll try not to.
How are you?
- I heard something about you, lawyer.
- You did? What?
- That you're gonna be a big G-man.
- That's right.
- You ought to be dumped in a ditch.
- Keep your tin badge in Washington.
If you stick your puss in our affairs, you'll get a bellyful of this. Now beat it.
You made up your mind about that plant in Brooklyn?
Yep. I'm gonna sell it.
- Sell it?
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna retire.
- What's gonna happen to us?
That's your affair.
You can take over and keep going if you want to, but you'd be suckers.
- This game is washed up.
- Yeah, maybe.
We're not gonna let the Mob bust up. There are plenty of rackets we can move into.
Not for me. I'm selling out.
- What if we don't want you to sell out?
- I sell out anyway.
I've spent all the time I want to trying to keep you guys in line.
From now on, you can run things to suit yourself.
If they catch up with you, it's your grief. I'm selling out.
- Does that make sense to you guys?
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Hello, stranger.
- Oh, how are you, Jean?
Well, I feel fine. I was beginning to think I had the measles...
...the way you've been staying away.
- I've been awfully busy.
Yeah, I know.
That's the way it always happens.
Mac puts my name up in lights, and the only person I wanna see gets tangled up.
Don't you get eye strain reading law books?
Yeah, that's why I'm giving it all up.
I'm leaving for Washington tomorrow.
I just stopped in to see you.
- Got a law case down there?
- No, I'm closing the office.
I've joined the Department of Justice.
- Then you'll be staying there?
- Yeah, for a while anyway.
Well, that makes things different, doesn't it?
Yeah, a whole lot different.
You could almost call it a flying broad jump, couldn't you?
I just told Mac about it.
- What did he say?
- He thought it was a grand idea.
Well, I think it's swell, Brick, getting into work like that.
You'll like it a lot better than a law office.
Yeah, that's the way I feel about it.
I've gotta get going.
- Sorry you can't see the show.
- Yeah, so am I, but you understand.
Yeah. Goodbyes are sort of silly, aren't they?
- Yeah.
- Well, we can send you...
...a bulletproof vest for Christmas.
- Yeah. So long, kid.
Say, there's no rule that a G-man can't kiss an old friend goodbye, is there?
Get a comparison on those test bullets yet?
Just checking them.
You're out of luck, Jeff.
They don't match.
- Which one killed Buchanan?
- The one on the left.
I'll tell the chief.
- Morning.
- Morning.
The rifle we found isn't the one.
The slugs don't check.
The fingerprints on the handcuff match Durfee's.
Buchanan had him collared when he was killed.
Put that in your wire to the New York division.
- Report back here at 3:00.
- Yes, sir.
Let me go up to New York, chief.
I'd like a crack at this case.
No, I'm sending Smith up. I need you here in charge of training these new men.
- More law-school graduates?
- Three of them.
Oh, have a heart, chief. Give this grief to somebody else. I've been doing it for a year.
I made a decent record in the field for nine years.
Do I have to spend the rest of my life combing these kids out of my hair?
You're familiar with the work. And there aren't enough old hands to go around.
I'm the one should be yelling, not you.
We need those men. Lots of them.
I know. But why can't we get more guys with police experience?
Guys that know the underworld, not just how to spout law.
These kids have as much chance of pulling through a dangerous assignment...
...as Buchanan had.
That depends on how well you train them, Jeff.
That's your assignment. Go to it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Davis is here, Mr. Gregory.
Yes, sir.
He says you're to report to Mr. McCord, the man who just left.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Well, you look like...
...you're not going to New York.
- I'm not going.
I'm gonna keep on pounding the ABC's of crime...
...into the skulls of these babes-in-arms.
Law-school graduate. Law-school graduate. Law-school graduate.
Listen: Mr. James Davis, doctor of law, doctor of philosophy, Phi Beta Kappa.
Now, isn't that sweet?
- Phi Beta Kappa.
- What's yours, "Flatfooter Copper"?
Who said that? Who are you?
I'm Davis. But don't let that spoil your fun. Go right ahead.
So you're Mr. Davis.
- And you're McCord.
- That's right.
- And this is Mr. Farrell.
- Hiya.
- Hello.
- And we're not Phi Beta Kappas.
- No, I gathered that.
- A very funny remark.
Lay off him, Jeff.
He seems to be all right.
Sure, a perfect legal specimen.
But I don't think I like you,
Mr. Davis.
And I can't work up much of a sweat over that kisser of yours either.
However, my personal attitude will have no bearing on your advancement.
I think I'll take charge of your training personally.
There you go.
I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage of you in this...
...but the first requirement is an excellent physical condition.
Second, to know how to take care of yourself in a fight.
I've noticed that you lawyers talk most of your fights in court.
Now, the first is the balance.
Keep your feet wide apart...
...so that you won't be bowled over if somebody says "boo."
Like this.
So?
Very good. Now, the left lead.
Keep your right well up and guard my lead.
Well, keep it cocked. Keep it up there.
Keep the right hand high.
That's very, very good.
Now we'll trade rights.
You mean, like this.
Nice going, Brick.
Hey, he's a darn good lawyer.
- Yeah. How was that, better?
- That's fine, Davis. Fine.
Your leverages are practically the same as in wrestling.
- Hello, Jeff.
- Hi.
Jujitsu isn't hard to learn once you get used to the uses of the shifting balance.
Now, try those last two attacks
I showed you.
Watch out for yourself.
I'm gonna give you the works on defense.
- All right. Here we go.
- All right.
- I wasn't expecting that one.
- You'll get on to it.
- Now, try the second one.
- Second one?
Well...
...I'd like to try that one again.
- Sure. Come ahead.
Gee, I'm sorry, Davis.
I didn't mean to throw you off the mat.
Oh, that's all right.
Are you okay?
Listen, maybe you'd better call it a day...
...and go and wash up.
- Yeah.
That's kind of a good idea. Well...
...thanks for the workout.
- Not at all.
Hey, that kid can take it, Jeff.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Very good.
Mr. Davis...
...you're next.
The noise may frighten you, but we want you to get used to it.
In case they change the laws so that government agents can carry guns.
Keep a stiff wrist.
The idea is to look along the barrel...
...and try and put the bullet somewhere near the dummies over there.
I see.
Like this?
That's it.
Would you mind reloading that?
I get a bit frightened.
Where did you learn to shoot?
I used to be marble champion of the Bronx.
What's the..?
- I'm awfully sorry.
- You should be.
No, I... I really am. So sorry.
- Are you waiting for someone?
- Obviously.
- Perhaps I can help you.
- No, thank you.
You're very welcome.
Are you waiting to see somebody?
Oh, pardon me for staring.
I'm studying character in faces...
...and I find yours interesting.
- So it appears.
Chin type number two.
"Does not make friends easily...
...and resents strangers."
Yeah, that's right.
"Eyes far apart indicates cruelty to animals.
The tendency of the skin to get purple with anger indicates high blood pressure...
...common among people with hot tempers."
What does it say about rifles and ammunition?
- "Most effective when used on offensive."
- Does it say how offensive?
Well, we...
We all look at things differently.
Jeff!
Hello, Kay.
- How are you?
- Just fine.
- Have a good trip down?
- Wonderful.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Same here. Where's Hugh?
- He went to look for you.
- He met you at the station?
- I wanted to come myself.
- I know. Hugh told me.
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I'm sorry to keep you waiting...
...but this brother of yours jumps around like a grasshopper.
- Have you seen the apartment?
- I left my bags there. It's grand.
- Pretty good-looking for a graduate nurse.
- Oh, not bad.
And they advanced you to night supervisor?
I'm getting this vacation on full salary.
- Swell. You can buy our lunch. Come on.
- Well, I should say.
Extra! Federal bank truck robbed!
Half a million dollars!
Read all about the big robbery!
Two murdered by bank bandits!
Hop on these. They're the bullets that killed the bank truck guards.
Check them against all the gun-marking records.
Okay, Jeff.
Where did you get this?
From the right-hand front door of the car they did the shooting from.
Pull me the file on Twin Loops, B-6.
Fat chance those guards had.
Guy next to the driver had a shotgun and a rifle...
...and two guys in the back blazing at them with machine guns.
Twin Loops, B-6.
- Were there any marks on that car?
- Not one.
We traced the license, but it was stolen.
Oh, yes, there was one clue:
A mashed flower on the floor of the front seat, a gardenia.
A gardenia?
- Yes, a gardenia.
- On the side where the man...
...with the shotgun was sitting?
- That's right, hawkshaw.
See if you have prints on Danny Leggett, a New York gangster. Please, a hunch.
They might check up with this one.
Find out if we got any prints on Danny Leggett, a New York gangster.
- Yes, let me have them.
- You're marvelous.
All you have to do is hear about a gardenia, and out of 4 million prints...
...you pick the right one, just like that. What a detective.
So nice to have you realize it.
Prints on Leggett. New York record.
Thanks, Joe.
Well, we'll see how good you are.
It's a long shot.
Four million to one.
Ought to be a cinch. I'm dying.
Almost too good to be true.
He's right, Jeff. Leggett's your man.
Don't you think you better run along and tell Gregory, Mr. McCord?
Wait a minute, Davis.
How do you know so much about this Leggett?
We were raised together on the
East Side in the same neighborhood.
- An East Side mug with a gardenia?
- Yeah.
- What?
- He always wears one. It's a superstition.
- Did you find anything?
- I'll say I did.
This rifle bullet is the same as the one that killed Buchanan.
- Yeah?
- Positive check, same rifle.
That means Leggett.
He used it in the bank robbery.
Yeah, but that's no proof he's the one who used it on Buchanan.
No, but I know how to get him and find out.
- Let me go to New York.
- Forget it. You haven't finished your course.
- But you can recommend me.
- Well, I'm not going to. You're not ready.
Then you won't do it because you don't like me. You never have.
But you're not man enough to say so.
If Leggett killed Buchanan, I want him.
I'm going over your head, McCord.
I'm going to ask Gregory myself.
McCord is right, Davis, and personal differences have nothing to do with it.
We have definite rules governing procedure here, and we stick to them.
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't send you or any other new man.
Farrell has this assignment. You'll have your chance when you're ready for it.
That's all, Davis.
Thank you, sir.
I'm not going to assign you to New York.
That would tie you up in case Leggett gets across any state lines.
You'll be assigned to the district where you find him.
I want only one thing:
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- See you at the airport, Jeff.
- Right.
- Well, I hope you get him, Farrell.
- Thanks.
You wanted this assignment bad, didn't you?
Yeah. Buchanan and I were close friends.
I'll remember that.
You might keep an eye on the flower shops.
Leggett buys a gardenia every day.
- Thanks, Davis.
- Oh, and...
...watch that derby of his.
He doesn't wear a hard hat for nothing.
- I'll remember that too.
- Good luck.
- Well, how do you do, Miss McCord?
- Oh, it's you.
Yeah. My name's Davis.
So you're Mr. Davis.
- You've heard of me?
- My brother mentioned you.
- Oh, yes. We're good friends.
- Didn't sound like that to me.
You mustn't mind him, he's a great kidder.
You know, you're looking better today.
- You've lost that purple angry look.
- I'm glad to hear it.
- I was worried about you.
- About me? Why?
Well, we can't discuss that here.
- Couldn't I see you this evening?
- No, I'm leaving for Chicago tonight.
Well, that's too bad.
Just what did you want to talk to me about?
Why, I might like to have a picture of you.
- Did you think I'd give you one?
- Wouldn't you?
- No.
- Well, I just thought I'd ask.
- Are you as nice to everybody you hate?
- Yes. And they don't get pictures.
Well, thanks for letting me have it.
- I said I wouldn't give you one.
- But you have.
Hey, Davis, telegram for you.
Oh, thanks.
- Mac!
- Brick, come on in.
Well, gee, I'm glad to see you.
- I'm glad to see you.
- Come on. Sit down.
What a surprise. Tell me, what are you doing here?
Me? I'm heading west.
"Joseph Lynch" and "heading west"?
What..?
I didn't want anybody to connect you with me, get you in a jam.
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, how you getting along?
Fine, fine. I just finished my training course.
- Never mind about me, what are you doing?
- I'm in the hotel business.
- You, in the hotel business?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- I bought a summer place up in Wisconsin.
It's called Pinecrest.
Fishing, tourists...
- And mosquitoes.
- Yeah, mosquitoes. All that kind of thing.
- Well, what about New York?
- I sold everything out. I'm gonna forget it.
- And you threw the Mob overboard?
- Yep.
Well, I'm still looking for Leggett.
- Wanna tell me anything?
- You wouldn't want me to, would you?
No. Forget it.
You know, I can't play ball with either side.
I'm kind of sitting on top of the fence.
Swell place to spend a nice quiet life, but rather dull.
- Yeah.
- What about Jean?
I don't know. She kind of dropped out of sight after I closed the cabaret.
- I haven't seen her in months.
- I'd like to see her. A swell kid.
- Yeah.
- Board!
Well, that's me.
Guess I've gotta shove off.
I just wanted to tell you, if you get out west, come look the place over.
- I'll give you a real blowout.
- Sold.
It's a date. I'm glad you let me know you were passing through.
I just wanted to check on how you're getting on.
- I'll see you sometime.
- You bet you will. I'll see to that.
- Bye, Mac.
- Goodbye.
- You send for me?
- Yes. Just making out a report on you.
Before I send it to Gregory, I want the right answers to some questions.
- Riding me again?
- If I am, it's for the last time.
You've been making a few slips,
I've been checking up on you.
- What are you trying to get away with?
- Nothing.
Then why did you falsify your personal history in your entrance papers?
I didn't. There's not one false statement in those papers.
They've been checked and passed.
You can't nail me on that, McCord.
I've told them everything.
Runaway from the orphanage, arrests for vagrancy and fighting, law school, all of it.
All but the one thing you knew would keep you out of here...
...and I've just uncovered it.
You've been hooked up with a big bootleg outfit in New York.
The leader paid your way through law school, undercover.
Set you up in law business. A very smart way for a Mob to get a stool pigeon...
...in the Department of Justice.
- That's a lie.
- The same Mob that Leggett's in.
No wonder you could tell us all you knew about him.
It didn't hurt McKay, and it got you in here solid.
McKay had absolutely nothing to do with my coming here.
And once more,
I've never worked for him!
I haven't seen him or been in contact with him for months!
Well, until...
Go on.
Until you reported to him on the 3:45 train, drawing room A.
You've been under observation for a week, Davis.
Well, I guess that takes care of everything.
You can break me out of the service with that.
Yeah.
That seems to be what you want.
You've been riding me for a long time...
...but I'll give you some straight answers.
- Go ahead.
- I'll tell you about McKay.
I was a gutter rat when he found me...
...and would probably still be one if it hadn't been for him.
He gave me a chance to go straight, do the right thing. I took it.
But he's never asked anything of me.
- Why did you join the department?
- Because of Buchanan.
Buchanan was my friend.
He was my roommate at college.
And I wanted to get the guy who killed him.
McCord, I studied law because I wanted to work for the law...
...and for no other reason.
Now, I've taken an awful lot from you since I've been here...
...and you're the last man I'd ask anything of unless it meant a great deal to me.
The service does.
Please don't kick me out.
- Thanks.
- Thanks, nothing!
Make one more fake pass, and out you go for good!
- You know the ropes around here, huh?
- Yeah, I made some contacts.
- Collins come out with you?
- No, he'll join us in about a month.
- Any of the rest of the Mob come out?
- Six of them.
They got a hideout in Kansas City.
- I got one here in case you need it.
- Probably will.
We figured on staying around for a while.
Thinking of opening up a bank.
Maybe a couple of them.
- Nice country around here.
- Yeah, I was thinking that myself.
Calling all cars. Attention, all cars.
Be on the lookout for a man identified as Leggett...
...heading west on Highway 66.
You sure this is the place?
The second cabin.
He buy gardenia from me...
Yeah, yeah, sure. I know all about that.
Come on, boys.
- Tony, you stay here. All right.
- Yes, sir.
- Stick them up!
- Not this time, Leggett.
Come on, get up.
Move it.
Put your gun up, copper.
You're not gonna get hurt.
I wish I could use it on you,
I'd save the state a lot of money.
Come on, Leggett. Get into your coat.
Too bad you didn't have that on when it happened.
Who told you about that?
Oh, a friend of mine.
Come on, get going.
- They've got Danny.
- Wait a minute. There's too many of them.
We'd better get the Mob. Go on, scram.
I don't know anything about it.
- You killed Buchanan.
- You're crazy.
You used the same gun to kill that bank guard.
Oh, save your breath.
You'll talk when you get inside that jail.
- You won't keep me in any jail.
- No? We'll see.
Yeah. We'll see.
- Paper!
- Tonight's final!
- Paper here!
- Tonight's final!
- Hello, chief.
- How are you?
- Car ready, Al?
- We've got two of them.
Okay. Let's go.
Paper. Paper. Tonight's final.
Get readied up. They're here.
Come on, let's go.
Up, coppers, up!
Leggett! The car's across the street!
Scram!
The state police cannot combat these criminals.
Neither can city police.
The law prohibits them from pursuing criminals across the state line.
With the automobile and airplane...
...these gangs can get from state to state in a few hours.
The Department of Justice is handicapped.
When Hugh Farrell died in that slaughter...
...he didn't even have a gun to defend himself.
A federal agent is not permitted to have a gun.
He can't even make an arrest without first obtaining a local warrant.
Gentlemen, give us national laws with teeth in them...
...covering the whole field of interstate crime.
Permit us to work to full effect with the state police agencies...
...and these gangs will be wiped out.
What laws do you need most?
Make bank robbery and kidnapping federal crimes.
Make it a federal crime to kill a government agent...
...or to flee across a state line to avoid arrest...
...or to avoid testifying as a witness.
Arm your agents.
And not just with revolvers.
If these gangsters wanna use machine guns...
...then give your special agents machine guns, shotguns, tear gas.
Everything else. This is war!
Now, understand, I don't wanna make them a group of quick-trigger men...
...but I do want the underworld to know that when a federal agent draws his gun...
...he's ready and equipped to shoot to kill with the least possible waste of bullets.
I know how you feel about Hugh, Jeff, and I've decided to let you take over.
You're giving me his assignment?
I'm putting you in charge of the Chicago office.
This list is to be posted in all districts...
...and not to come down until every name on it is accounted for.
More will be added. Take the plane.
I'm assigning five agents to go with you.
- You pick your own men and let me know.
- Yes, sir.
Send Davis in. And tell Henderson to report here at once.
Yes, I wanna talk to you.
You've been yelling for months for action.
We'll see how your nerves stand up under fire.
You're assigned to Chicago.
Be at the airport at 4:00.
Now, go on home and get packed.
It's part of the money taken in that
East Chicago bank robbery.
- How much did you get?
- Two $20 bills.
Their serial numbers check with the list you gave us.
- Who banked them?
- J.E. Blattner.
Here's the deposit slip and the address.
"J.E. Blattner, 43..."
- When did you get them?
- One last night. The other four days ago.
I didn't know it was hot dough, honest.
I'm on the level.
- Never mind that, who gave them to you?
- I don't know him.
- What'd he look like?
- Oh, medium size.
Black hair. He's a swell dresser.
That's all I know...
- Buys a flower every day?
- Yeah, a gardenia.
- He buys lots.
- All with $20 bills?
Yeah. He always carries a roll.
All right, that's all.
Keep your mouth shut.
You bet. I don't wanna get tangled up with you G-guys.
- So long.
- So long.
Hold your fire!
I've been waiting for this.
Come on. On your feet.
On your feet.
Yeah.
He's taking a shower.
Any message?
There ain't any shower there, copper.
- I'll bet that was Collins.
- Yeah? Get him out of here.
I can't help it. Every time I see you,
I wonder if it's gonna be the last.
Now, listen. There's no sense in you reading the papers...
...and then coming down here all in an uproar. I'm all right.
- I'll keep on being all right.
- That's what Hugh said.
- He never had a chance.
- I know.
But he didn't have a gun either.
Those guys don't like it now that we're able to give them a dose of their own medicine.
You should have seen the way Davis manhandled this Leggett.
- I'm not interested in Davis.
- Yeah, well, it was a sweet job.
- But don't tell him I said so.
- Don't worry, I won't.
I don't even wanna talk to him.
- You're beginning to like him, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.
And I wish you'd keep him away from the hospital too.
- Do you mean to say he's been up there?
- Yes, he has.
He said he wanted to look over the rooms in case he ever got sick.
Excuse me. There's a man here wants to see you.
- Says it's important.
- Who is it?
- He won't say.
- All right.
Wait outside, will you, Kay?
What do you want?
- Well, I got a message for you.
- All right, go ahead.
Do you guarantee not to arrest me?
Oh, that kind, eh?
I promise you nothing.
What have you got to say?
The paper says youse guys is gonna take
Leggett down to the state pen tomorrow...
...keep him there till his trial, right?
- Yeah. That's right.
Well, Gerard says...
...to tell you G-guys if you stick your nose out trying to take him to the pen...
...there'll be another massacre.
And doubles.
- He said that, did he?
- Yeah.
Well, you go back and tell Gerard...
...that I've decided to talk Leggett to the pen myself.
Tell him I'll leave here with him at 7:15 tomorrow morning.
I'll go to the station by car, take the 7:40 train...
...and then a car to the prison.
Tell him I'll be alone.
And if he's looking for trouble, he can have it at any of those times and places.
Get out!
- You can't do that, Jeff. They'll kill you.
- Nonsense.
- You can't take chances like that.
- Forget it.
Think I'm gonna let that Mob get away with sending their orders into this office?
They're not playing with a bunch of helpless bank tellers.
The sooner they learn that, the better.
We're gonna make the word "government" poison to them if it's the last thing we do.
What does that matter to me?
I... I can't lose you, Jeff.
You can I are alone, and I haven't got anybody.
There, there.
You're not going to lose me.
Oh, come on, sis.
You don't know what this is all about.
You go back to your hospital and help take care of all those cromos with the mumps.
What's the matter?
It's Jeff. He can't go through with it.
He'll get killed.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, please don't let him do it.
He's gonna try and take Leggett to prison alone. You can stop him. Please!
Now, you mustn't worry about that.
He'll do it beautifully.
Now, you keep your little head right there, and...
Get going.
Nice prison.
Too bad your Mob didn't keep their promise.
You won't live long, McCord.
Step on it, driver.
Sit tight, Leggett.
If they start something, remember, you get it first.
Watch that car.
Are they dumb enough to think they can get you here?
Get him inside.
Hello.
What's the idea of trailing me?
Just wanted to see if you could get here.
Any report from Division L?
Yeah, there's no trace of Collins or Gerard.
It looks as though the Mob has disappeared.
- They've got a great hideout, wherever it is.
- I'll say they have.
Unless you fellas have been taking a vacation for two weeks.
You haven't had an attack of brilliance lately. Why don't you try guessing?
They're in that circle somewhere.
Only six states.
We've got them cornered.
Cut out the wisecracks.
What time did that..?
- Any luck?
- We found Collins' wife.
- Where is she?
- Outside. Wanna question her?
I'll say I do.
Bring her in, Bill.
Sit down.
- We located the apartment he rented.
- The boys have been drinking varnish.
- The landlady identifies her as Mrs. Grover.
- She's crazy.
She identifies her as Mrs. Grover.
That's the name they've been using.
You're lucky that's all you heard.
You should hear her tell about the tenants in 106.
Cut out the funny stuff. Where's Collins?
- You frighten me.
- Answer the question.
I haven't the slightest idea.
He's just a friend.
I dropped in and he wasn't there.
These gentlemen were.
They looked at me and I looked at them.
They invited me down here and here we are.
Now, are you happy?
Or shall I tell you about my operation?
- Gonna keep on stalling, eh?
- You are so bright.
McCord, I'd like to speak to you for a moment.
We won't get anywhere that way.
Let me have a few minutes alone with her.
- Why do you think you can get her to talk?
- I know her.
Come on out, guys.
No reason why old friends shouldn't shake hands.
Thanks for calling off the wolf.
Funny meeting this way, isn't it?
Yeah. Not even a floor show.
Tell me, why did you marry him?
Why not?
Oh, yeah, I know, but why Collins?
Brad's always been pretty swell to me.
I've been happy.
Oh, now, come on, don't give me that.
- Let's stop the kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
All right.
When did you see him last?
You heard me tell them. A month ago.
- I didn't expect you to tell the truth.
- Then why ask me?
Because I can't understand protecting that guy.
You know what he is and what he's done.
You know that since he's been out here he's killed two officers in cold blood.
And you tell me you've been happy with him?
No, I'm not.
When I read that, I decided to quit.
I'm not going back to him.
There, that's better.
When did you marry him?
A couple of months after the cabaret closed.
And you never told McKay?
He's one person I didn't want to know about it.
He'll probably learn it from Brad, though.
He'll learn it from Brad?
- Is Collins with McKay?
- No.
- He's hiding out at McKay's lodge!
- I never told you that!
- Brick! Brick, you can't!
- You wait there.
- Well?
- Collins is hiding...
...at McKay's summer hotel in Pinecrest.
- Gerard and the rest are probably with him.
- I thought you said McKay quit.
- I did, but...
- Drake, pick seven more men.
Get guns for all of them.
Martin, call the police at Pinecrest.
Ask them to have three cars waiting.
- Get a transport plane.
- Right.
I could go for this north woods stuff.
- It does something to you.
- You're telling me.
The idea of Mac trying to keep us out of here.
- Say, I thought you said he was a pal.
- Sure, he is. But he's a bad host.
Imagine him calling this poison good liquor.
He don't even like it himself.
Give us a speech, Mac, and tell the girls what a big shot you used to be.
Go on, talk!
You wouldn't like what I have to say.
Closed for the season.
We'd better stop here.
There it is.
Get to the positions you were assigned on that map.
Davis, you watch the side door.
I've got 12:17. Five minutes will give you time to get around the back.
When we're ready to crash in,
I'll fire two shots.
You fellas go through those windows and doors, and go fast. All right.
Come on, let's see if you can still stand on those heels.
Excuse us, will you, Mr. McKay?
Say, what's that?
- They've spotted us.
- No use waiting.
Come on! We gotta move!
We might as well quit.
We're not hitting anything.
Keep that gun working!
Keep them in the woods!
Give me noise! Give me lots of noise!
Come on.
- We can't make it this way!
- Side door's nearer to the cars.
Okay!
You've gotta help us out of here!
Shut up! Get upstairs and lay low.
We gotta make a run for it.
Give them the tear gas.
Tear gas!
Gas!
Come on, we gotta make a break for the cars!
- Who's going out and take it first, you?
- No, none of us.
Come on, Big Shot.
You're big enough to be a good shield.
Mac!
- Hello, Brick.
- Mac, I didn't know it was you.
It wasn't your fault.
You're okay, kid.
Funny, I was thinking about you the other day...
...wondering when you were coming up for that...
Oh, Mac.
- Nice work tonight, Brick.
- Road between here and Chicago is blocked.
What's the idea?
I'm washed up.
I'll mail my resignation in to the Chicago office tomorrow.
Davis.
One time you told me I was the last guy...
...you'd ever beg anything from unless it meant something to you. Remember that?
- Yeah.
- Personally, that goes double with me.
But I'm talking to you now as the head of this division.
I don't wanna report you as the first guy that left this service...
...before his job was finished.
That time it meant something to you to stay.
Now it means something to me to have you stay.
Oh, I know how you feel about McKay.
I'd feel the same way in your spot, but you didn't kill him.
Those rats could have left him inside.
They murdered him when they forced him out.
And Collins got away with it.
Think it over.
- Who is it?
- Brad. Open up.
What's the idea of moving?
I was afraid they'd find me.
They were looking everywhere for you.
I'll say they were looking.
They raided the lodge and knocked over everybody but me.
I know, I read the papers.
You got away.
Well, what are you staring about?
You don't look very glad about it.
Oh, I am, Brad.
But, gee, I've been scared to death.
- That's why I didn't leave word.
- I'll say you didn't.
I had to trace you through the trucking outfit that moved your stuff.
I'd still like to know how those coppers found us up there.
- They didn't get to you, did they?
- Oh, no. No, I've been safe here.
Yeah, sure.
You're a smart kid.
I just got the jumps.
Forget it. Crack open a bottle of whiskey and we'll celebrate.
There isn't any in the house.
Well, beat it down to the store and get some.
- And get me some cigarettes, will you?
- All right.
- You'll find some food in the icebox.
- Okay.
He may be doubling back now.
- I wanna warn Jean.
- I wanna ask her a few questions myself.
- All highways, driving black touring car.
License 391284.
Collins escaped from apartment house at 2934 Modena.
Collins in Chicago? Okay, Burns.
Collins driving black touring car.
License 391284.
- Oh, hello, Brad.
- Get rid of that car, it's hot.
- Where you going?
- Oh, hello, Jeff.
- Why, I... I heard that Mr. Davis was here.
- Mr. Davis, huh?
- Was he badly hurt?
- Nothing serious.
They took one slug out of his chest and another creased his skull.
There's nothing to worry about.
He's squawking about having to stay.
- I gotta beat it, kid.
- Jeff?
- How'd he get shot?
- Wait a minute.
He did it saving my life, and he showed a lot of nerve doing it too.
He's a great guy, Kay.
But don't tell him I said so.
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, sure, fine. He just winged me.
If I'd come out a few minutes later,
I'd have seen you. I could have warned you.
No, you did the right thing getting out of there as fast you could.
Come in.
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.
- Oh, please don't go. Come in.
- Miss Morgan, Miss McCord.
- How do you do?
Hello.
I heard what happened. I wanted to thank you for saving Jeff's life.
Oh, it wasn't much.
We had a lucky break, that's all.
Did he tell you that?
No.
I wondered.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Well, I won't intrude any longer.
- Good night, Miss Morgan.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, I think I better go and let you get some sleep.
All right, Jean.
Don't go back to that apartment.
- You can't afford to take any chances.
- It was swell of you to try to help me, Brick.
- I was a little bit late.
- Yes, but it makes things different.
I used to think that at least
I owed loyalty to Brad...
...but I realize now
I don't owe him anything.
He's done enough harm without doing any more.
Wait a minute. What do you mean?
- I think I know where to find him.
- No, don't try it. Stay away from him!
Good night, Brick.
- Got the guns?
- He'll have them in the shop.
You can get them at 2:00.
You'll need them.
McCord and his G-men are knocking every place in town.
- They're gunning for you.
- They are?
They'll make somebody talk.
When they do, they'll be down here quick.
- You better duck for Canada.
- Yeah.
- They'll blockade the roads.
- Don't worry about that.
I got a way of making McCord call off his dogs. Open that door.
Want me to phone if Mr. Davis starts running a temperature?
You stay away from him.
He'll be better with the doctor.
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Miss McCord.
- Yes?
- Get in that sedan.
Get in that sedan.
Yeah, this is Collins. And you can tell
McCord to get all patrols off the highways.
I've got his sister! And if they try to stop me, I'll dump her into their laps.
And she won't be talking.
Calling car 121. Car 121.
Urgent. To Special Agent McCord.
Special Agent McCord.
Collins has kidnapped your sister.
Threatens to kill her
if attempt made to capture.
Don't get impatient, baby.
He won't be gone long.
Oh, hiya, Mrs. Collins. Come on in.
- I'm looking for Brad. Have you seen him?
- Yeah, he was here.
He'll be back pretty soon.
Say, you sure were lucky getting out just before the cops jumped him.
- He told you?
- Yeah.
Close, wasn't it?
- Who's the dame?
- That? That's the G-guy's sister.
They got the heat on Brad, but they'll lay off...
...when they find out he's liable to bump this chicken.
- Lose all your guns at the lodge?
- Yeah.
Well, it was a good hideout.
Too bad the cops got hold of your wife.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you know?
- No, I didn't.
- Why, it's a cinch she spilled it.
They had her at government headquarters the morning before they raided you.
Thanks.
What's the idea of leaving?
He's coming soon.
I know. I'll be right back.
I wanna get a few things.
- I'm going with him.
- That's up to you.
Oh, hello there, good-looking.
- Your wife was just here.
- When?
She just left a few minutes ago.
- She see the dame?
- Sure. She said she's going with you.
She's gonna rat to the cops.
Which way did she go?
Well, that way.
Wait!
Come on back, they'll get you!
You got time to get away!
You can't make it!
- Did a dame go by here?
- One just went in the lunchroom.
Hello, General Hospital?
Brick Davis, please. Hurry.
- Hello, Brick? Jean. I found him.
- At it again, huh?
Police!
Operator, where's that receiver down?
Wait a minute, Mr. Davis.
You can't get up yet.
- You can't get up yet!
- Shut up and get my clothes!
Look here, Mr. Davis.
You can't leave here.
There she is, in there.
- Special agent.
- Yes, sir.
- How is she?
- I don't think she has a chance.
Jean.
Jean.
Brick.
You've got to get there. Garage.
809 Allen Street.
Brad's got the McCord girl in his car.
Collins has Kay?
He's gonna try to get to Canada.
You've got to get there first.
I wouldn't make her talk too much.
I'll see you later.
I won't be around.
Sure you will.
Say...
...there's no rule that says a G-man...
...can't kiss an old friend goodbye, is there?
Hello, police headquarters?
Special Agent Davis speaking.
Yeah, I've located Collins.
In a garage, 809 Allen Street.
809. Yeah, send cars.
He's holding Chief McCord's sister.
I'm going there now. Hurry!
Calling all cars, Division Six.
All cars, Division Six.
Collins located, 809 Allen Street.
809 Allen Street. A garage.
- Come on, step on it!
- Better give them time to clear the roads.
Down.
Come on, copper.
Are you gonna let her have it...
...or am I? Come on, copper!
Come on out and get it.
- You all right?
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, where's Kay?
- Inside.
- Is she all right?
- She's all right.
- Did they get him?
- Yes, with a machine gun.
- He crashed into a building down the street.
- Kay.
- Are you okay, kid?
- I'm all right. But where's Brick?
Oh, Jeff, he was wonderful.
- Thanks, Davis.
- A pleasure.
Don't you think you better be getting back to the hospital?
Yeah, I guess that's a good idea.
- I'm going with him.
- Take good care of him, sis.
He's a great guy.
Shall I tell him you said so?
Yeah.
- How you feeling, Brick?
- Fine.
- Take care of yourself, Brick.
- Thanks.
I'm going over to get the car.
I'm gonna handle your case personally.
It's gonna be nice having a nurse in the family.

It's a boy!
A prince is born!
Long live the Prince of Wales!
Sit up and drink hearty.
The only cost of a tankard is that it's drunk to His wee Royal Highness...
The Prince of Wales!
Long live His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales!
Here.
Milords and ladies...
I ask you to toast my son...
Edward Tudor.
One moment.
You drink too fast.
I advise you that as you drink, you pray for your own sakes... that my son be a good king.
Because good or bad, sickly or hale... craven or brave, he will be King!
You drank sparingly, my good Norfolk.
Wine does not agree with me,
Your Majesty.
A pity.
Because losing one's head from wine... is so much less permanent than losing it from treason.
Surely, Your Majesty does not think me guilty of that.
Not at all, my good Norfolk.
Merely capable of it.
- It's a boy, Henry.
- So I've been informed.
- You're glad?
- Very.
And grateful to you, madam... not only for furnishing the House of Tudor with an heir... but also for freeing your King from further necessity of your being.
Poor little thing.
Brought into this world to wear a crown whether it fits him or not.
It shall weigh him down... until he'll wish he'd been born to the meanest pauper in London.
Poor little thing.
Poor nothing.
He's a healthy brat.
Healthy, is he?
You'd have an healthy son, when all the time... you know it's only the sickly ones who can beg a farthing nowadays.
A prince was born tonight, too, little baby.
So go to sleep and pretend the bells are for you.
Here he is. I think this cur ought to have his head whacked off!
Boil him in oil, I says, Your Highness.
A good stewing is what he needs.
Let's give it to him.
- What has he done, my good lords?
- He won't play, that's what.
Let this miscreant kneel before me.
Down, you scurvy nipper.
Why don't you want to play, bumpkin?
'Cause I don't want to be boiled in oil.
It'd hurt.
Coward!
Hold your tongue. He's right. It would hurt.
A good king is a merciful king.
I will show mercy.
If I make you one of my lords, will you play?
Yes, I will.
I dub thee Sir Hawkins.
Arise.
Absit invidia'
What's that?
It's Latin. And it means:
Let there be no malice.
Father Andrew taught it to me.
He'd do better to teach you how to bring home a farthing.
I'll knock them royal ideas out of your head!
You drooling beast,
I'll cuff your mouth and like it!
Now, then!
He's certainly thumping the King good.
Maybe that'll keep the tears in your eyes long enough to beg a penny for food.
Now, be off with you!
May I come in?
But you are in.
Thomas, have you been crying?
No, sir. It's sweat.
You see, I've been running.
And how did you come by that?
Your father?
No, sir. My father wouldn't beat me.
He likes me.
I apologize.
Thank you.
Someday I'm going to discuss you with your father.
No, I wouldn't, sir.
You see, he doesn't like to see anyone... on account of he feels so badly about me having to beg.
I thought maybe you'd let me read some more out of that Latin book.
Of course.
The more you read, the greater opportunity you'll have... of escaping Offal Court when you grow up.
But you've read most everything, and you're still in Offal Court, Father.
God's will and the whimsy of a king are two things... it isn't for ordinary people to understand,
I presume, Tom.
Why did His Majesty turn you out of your house... and take away your pension, when you didn't do anything to him?
I'm afraid nowadays, the King knows very little about his subjects.
Except those in his court... who take great pains he shouldn't learn... the plight of others less fortunate than themselves.
Do you know what I'd do if I were the King?
I'd send the Prince out to play with other little boys.
Then he'd learn about the people and be a good king when he grew up.
A rather unlikely suggestion.
Get on with your reading while the light is good.
Perhaps I'd better, because I've been at it two days now... and I haven't got Caesar across the Rubicon yet.
Tell me all about it.
I'll tell you, there's more gold there than you ever thought was in the world... just dying to be took.
- What's that you're reading?
- A book.
- Stole it?
- No.
Father Andrew gave it to me. To keep.
Wasn't that kind of him?
I should say so. It's very valuable.
Only rich people can afford to buy books.
- Give it here.
- Please don't tear it.
Tear it, you barmy mooncalf? I'll sell it.
This'll fetch a nice bit of meat and ale.
Please, give me back my book.
Come on, Hugo.
We're going to the thieves market.
A windfall from heaven, I calls it.
And if I catch you with that smirking priest again...
I'll peel the hide off both of you!
My book.
Go away! Get out of here! Go on!
Penny, please?
But it is time we spoke of certain things,
Your Majesty.
My death among them, I suppose.
Death?
What made you think of death, sire?
For one thing, finding a carrion crow flying around my bed.
Banish the thought, sire.
- You're still a hale man.
- I'm not a man at all.
I'm a disease.
An infernally painful one. Go on.
It occurred to me, sire, that when
Prince Edward comes to the throne...
The court may impose the Duke of Norfolk on him... as Lord High Protector.
And with reason, Hertford.
What a sorry thing it is to be a bad king.
To worry on your deathbed about your dynasty... and not about your people.
To be able to forgive a man his sins, and not his virtues.
And Norfolk has virtue.
And the House of Tudor has sins.
But they won't be judged by the Howards.
You are very right, Your Majesty.
The protector will be a man who nibbles at the hand of the court.
Whose power frightens only the ladies.
And whose chief ambition is to build a safe nest in the throne.
You'll forgive me if I say the description resembles that of a palace rat.
- You mean...
- I mean you.
I am unable to tell my gratitude for this honor, sire.
But it will enable me to...
To regret my passing with the greatest possible pleasure.
There is one thing, sire... which may prevent your selection of me from being carried out.
- Who? Warwick?
- No, sire.
The Prince himself.
Norfolk has bewitched him.
He worships the man, calls him uncle.
But for some strange reason,
His Highness has taken a dislike to me.
If you let the selection go, until your death...
His little Highness will undoubtedly appoint Norfolk.
No.
Because I intend to arrange matters... so that Norfolk's death will precede my own.
- Indeed, Your Majesty?
- Indeed.
Now, ask His Highness to come here.
I think I'd like to play now.
May we play charades, Your Highness?
Lady Jane, I've told you I hate charades.
I'm sorry.
All right. We'll play charades later.
After we play something I like.
Quill, you suggest something.
And if it doesn't suit me, I'll beat you.
And if it does suit you, it'll be a game you'll beat me at anyway.
Therefore, it might as well be... blind man's buff.
Good. That would amuse me.
- I'm it.
- Here's my handkerchief.
- Should I be first, sir?
- Shout so I know where you are.
All right.
Spin him round and around.
There you are.
Now, guess where we are.
Your Highness.
- Are you hurt, Edward?
- Edward?
Pardon me, Your Highness.
Someday I'll have your head cut off for calling me that.
But perhaps your feet would be better.
They're more in the way.
Why are you here, milord?
His Majesty awaits, Your Highness.
Very well.
You are not dismissed. I'm coming back.
I'm glad you sent for me, Father.
They wouldn't let me see you this afternoon.
- You tried?
- Yes.
- What did you want?
- Nothing. Just wanted to see you.
Come here.
Sit down.
One of these days, Edward...
- I'll be going away.
- To war, Father?
No. To peace, I hope.
But where?
To face the one being... who knows there is no
Divine Right of Kings.
After I've gone, Edward, you'll wear the crown.
- But...
- Be still. Listen and remember.
There is only one crown in England.
But there are many heads it will fit.
So a wise king removes those heads.
That is politics.
When you sit in judgment... remember your seat is but a chair... made by the English oak, hewn by English yeomen... and made into a throne only... by the will of the English people.
That is patriotism.
There's one thing more.
A king may answer to no man.
Not even to himself.
To have a conscience is to have a chink in your armor... to let in the knives of those you love... and trust, and need.
Remember what I am saying.
Never trust so much...
Love so much... or need anyone so much... that you can't betray them with a smile.
That is the paradox of power.
I suppose you're too young to understand that.
No, Father. I can even understand Aristotle in the original Greek.
You're like your mother.
- What was my mother like?
- A dull woman.
- She'd have bored you.
- No, she wouldn't. I'd have loved her.
Where is she?
Got another biscuit?
Your Majesty forgot to mention your selection to His Highness.
Bring me that casket.
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, Father. The Great Seal of England.
There's strange magic in it, Edward.
It can make a royal whim a law.
An innocent man guilty.
A poor man rich.
A dangerous toy for a child... and a fool.
I advise you to use it sparingly and seldom.
Lest it seal your own doom.
I am entrusting it to you.
When the time comes for you to use it...
I want you to consult...
- Doctors again.
- Your Majesty.
You must be left undisturbed.
Milords, you must leave
His Majesty at once.
- Rest is the only physic that will cure him.
- Is there no escape from you?
After a lifetime of dodging cannonballs, am I to be done in by pills?
Your Majesty, can that be a biscuit?
What do you think it is, the Archbishop's head?
May I ask, Your Highness, and you, Lord Hertford... to retire, for the King's good?
Yes, of course.
Your Majesty.
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
- But, Your Majesty...
Get out!
All of you!
- You, too.
- Yes, Father.
Yes, Father.
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.
Where are Lady Jane and Lady Elizabeth?
Their nurse came to inform them that it was their bedtime.
- My dog, where is he?
- He's been taken to the kennels.
- Fetch him.
- Your Highness, this is our post.
If we leave it, we would have to answer to the King himself.
Is that a dog under there?
- A boy.
- Out of there, you little tyke.
- Out of there!
- Yes, Father.
Impertinent from the likes of you.
A sneak thief? How did you get in here?
I'm not a thief, sir. I just beg.
You've just begged yourself a skinful of broken bones this time.
Maybe this will teach you respect for His Majesty's Guard.
Maybe that will teach you respect for His Majesty's subjects.
- Your Highness, forgive me, I...
- Keep quiet.
Are you hurt, boy?
- Are you hurt?
- No, sir, Your Highness, sir.
- What are you doing here, boy?
- It was raining, Your Highness.
I just slipped through, milord, because...
So I could sleep under the bench where it was dry, Your Highness.
I'm not a desperate character,
Your Highness. Honest, I'm not.
I'm certain you're not.
Had you been, the Captain would've been under the bench, not you.
- Your Highness, you don't understand.
- Keep quiet.
You annoy me enough when you're silent.
You're not thinking of beheading me, are you, Your Majesty?
No.
I was wondering whether or not you were too dirty to play with.
You couldn't play with me.
I'm a beggar boy.
I can play with anyone I please.
I'm the Prince.
Come along.
We'll wait for him to come out from beneath His Highness' wing.
And when he does, we'll skin him.
I didn't think that if I were very good all my life... and died and went to heaven,
I'd ever see anything like this.
- Or meet a real prince, either.
- Don't bother to flatter me.
I get enough of that from the court.
I must remember to have the Captain beheaded when I'm king.
No, you mustn't.
Not on account of me, at least.
Damnant quod non intelligunt'
- You know Latin?
- Yes. Father Andrew taught me.
Never heard of the man.
Your father has, and he doesn't like him at all.
- He took away his house and his pension.
- Must be a priest.
Yes, he is.
- I thought so.
- You'd like him.
We Tudors hate priests.
- Why?
- Because we...
Just because we don't like them,
I suppose.
I don't think that's a very good reason.
I did hear Warwick saying something to Uncle Thomas... that's the Duke of Norfolk... about Father wanting to get a new queen... and the priest not wanting him to.
Father must have won the argument.
Because we had two queens that year... and another new one now, Lady Parr.
But you can't have three mothers.
Neither can you.
I haven't even got one mother.
- She died when I was a baby.
- So did mine.
But anyway, a queen is a prince's mother.
And you say there's been three.
Six.
Six queens?
Then, you'd have six mothers, but you couldn't have six mothers.
I can't figure it out.
Neither can I.
You may have a pear if you like.
A pear? Which is the pear?
- Haven't you ever seen a pear before?
- No, but I've read about them.
- Nice, aren't they?
- Eat it, lad.
Like it?
Crikey.
It tastes so good,
I almost feel like a prince myself.
You certainly don't look like one.
Unless it would be a prince of paupers.
I will be when I get back to Offal Court... and tell them I've been in the palace and talked to you.
The only trouble is they won't believe me.
Why not, pray?
You see, in Offal Court, a prince is... kind of like Saint Nicholas.
You hear about him, but you never see him... because you couldn't expect him to come to see poor people.
The Prince of Offal Court.
It would be amusing to see their faces.
They'll believe you because when you arrive, you shall be wearing my clothes.
- Sword and all.
- Your clothes?
Why not? Clothes make the prince.
Are there any vermin in this?
So few you'll hardly notice them at all,
Your Highness.
You go wash your face. Over there.
Use the towel.
Penny, please. Please give me a penny.
Don't bother me, my lad.
Why, you look like me.
On the contrary, you look like me.
That's what I said, Your Highness.
We look alike.
- Do you know any games, boy?
- Yes, Your Highness, lots of them:
- Duck and drake, robber and constable.
- How do you play that?
It takes three to play it: A robber, somebody to be robbed, and a constable.
You see, I rob you of something, hide it.
Then you tell the constable, and he and you try to find it.
While you're looking for it, I hide.
Then you and he have to find me to make the arrest, just as in real life.
- Good. I like that. We'll play it.
- But we have no constable.
I'll get my dog.
He'll be a marvelous constable.
He can find anybody no matter where they hide.
Wait here. I'll get him.
- There he goes, running for it.
- After him.
If he gets away, you'll sweat for it.
Not so fast, me lad.
- Captain wants to pay his respects to you.
- Are you mad?
Do you want to lose your heads?
How dare you touch me!
Listen to that.
The Prince must have knighted him.
Now for your lesson, you filthy little beggar.
Beggar? Are you insane?
I'm Prince Edward!
Make way for His Royal Highness, the Prince of Pewy.
I'll have your blood for this, and on my own sword.
Come back whenever you like. The Guard prides itself on entertaining royalty.
Why wasn't His Highness prepared for bed last night?
Because, Your Grace, he didn't ring.
Your Highness.
Where's the Prince?
The Prince?
Yes, the Prince.
Where is he?
But, Your Highness, you are the Prince.
Please, milords, I'm not the Prince.
He went out to get a constable.
I mean, his dog.
And he didn't come back.
I'm a beggar boy.
Don't behead me. Say you won't.
This is not the time for jesting,
Your Highness.
Indeed, it isn't, because I'm in a pickle.
It's all so muddled. The Prince will have my head because I have his clothes.
If the King finds out, he'll have me boiled in oil.
The Prince isn't here right now, but I'm sure he'll come back.
Please, Your Highness, discontinue this whimsy at our expense.
That's just it. I'm not your highness.
I'm Tom Canty, a beggar boy, and I wish I were at it now.
I'm afraid His Highness is ill.
Very ill.
- This will be a death blow to His Majesty.
- We mustn't tell him.
Please, Your Highness, get up from your knees.
What would your father say if he saw you?
In here?
He'd say somebody boosted me through a window.
'Tis true. His Majesty is gravely ailing.
That is God's will.
To inform him that his sins are to rule and live after him... in a daft boy, would be murder.
Neither alchemy nor prayer can cheat death of His Majesty's soul much longer.
But England can be cheated of a rightful king... should His Majesty not proclaim his son... and appoint a Lord Protector before his death.
And who might that be?
One who might not forget a favor done now.
What? Treason!
I talked to him last night, and he was sane as a bishop.
I know, Your Majesty. I saw him then, too.
- 'Tis an evil miracle.
- You lie, I tell you!
I would I did, Your Majesty, that you might be spared the proof.
Stop croaking! Fetch the boy!
Mad, they say.
Too much study.
Sane one minute...
Taken complete leave of his senses.
Doesn't even recognize anyone.
Your Majesty.
The King.
I am done for.
Come, my son.
Sit by me.
Let us talk, you and I.
But I'm not me.
I'm Tom Canty, Your Majesty. Sir.
Tom, sir.
Come, lad.
Would you deny that I am your father?
Yes, sire.
I wouldn't dare let anyone think such a thing.
What envenomed irony fate has wrought.
He doesn't know his own father.
But I do, Your Majesty.
A thief he is and was sorely mean to me.
Please, don't behead me.
Please, let me go home.
You've done this, you pedantic fools.
Whipping his mind with Latin and Greek till it's broken its halter and run wild.
Now take him, cure him, amuse him, freshen him.
Teach him the good English oaths of the hunting field.
Oaths that a man may use in ruling a country.
Not the foreign prattle of priests and scholars!
It shan't be long before you'll know me, little Edward.
Please, Your Majesty.
I'm not Edward. I'm Tom.
These aren't even my clothes.
I'm a beggar boy.
They won't believe me.
Please tell them I'm not your little boy.
This, milords... is my son... who shall sit on the throne and rule.
If not by reason of his wit... then by reason of the name of Tudor.
Summon the entire court to the Throne Room.
And bid them... hurry.
Milords and ladies.
In the past... you have jealously kept my bounty to yourselves.
But soon you'll be sharing it with the worms.
And what is left will probably rattle... in the posits of time.
England... could not shed enough tears to cleanse the name of Henry.
But I promise you... neither can England shed enough blood... to wash the name of Tudor from the roll of kings.
Don't deceive yourselves.
I am not threatening you from the grave.
My power will be buried with my body... and disintegrate as soon.
I'm threatening you with your own weakness... which I've nurtured for years.
Feeding one's greed with another's deceit.
Tolerating treachery.
Until, milords and ladies, you've grown so corrupt... that each could only conceal his guilt in the shadow of the others.
Hence, your heads remain on your shoulders... only as long as a Tudor sits on the throne... to cloak your infamies from the people... behind the purple robes of royalty.
The old dog dies... and the lice daren't desert his pup... lest they starve!
It is my will... that my son, Edward... shall succeed me to the throne.
And that his tutelage and counsel... be entrusted... to a Lord...
High... to a Lord...
High Protector.
And that he... be...
Your Majesty.
The Protector is to be who?
Who?
And now... to face them... all.
The King is dead.
Long live the King.
Let us pray.
The body which was Henry's... will once again become with the earth from which it was molded.
The soul we relegate to God.
The reign, to his royal Majesty, Edward VI.
Can I go home now, please?
Permit me, Your Majesty.
Repeat after me, and when you have finished... strike my shoulder with your sword.
- Aren't your afraid it will cut you?
- With the flat of it, Your Majesty.
Repeat: Let it be known to all my subjects...
"Let it be known to all my subjects..."
- But I'm not the Prince.
...and throughout my realm...
"And throughout my realm..."
...that I hereby designate the Earl of Hertford...
"That I hereby designate the Earl of Hertford..."
...as my Lord High Protector, to direct... with adult advice, my untried judgment.
"As my Lord High Protector, to direct, with adult advice..."
- My untried judgment.
- "My untried judgment."
Death may have been on Norfolk's side, but a brain was on ours.
But fortunately, an addled one.
I'm honored by your selection,
Your Majesty.
- Did I select you for something?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Henceforth, it is I, not Norfolk, in whom you will confide and trust.
Who's Norfolk?
You can't recall him? That's a pity.
Such a little time remains to make his acquaintance.
I bid you good day, sire.
Please, my lord.
You said I was to confide in you.
Mayn't I do it now?
Wait outside.
His Majesty has some affairs of state which he wishes to discuss.
Yes, milord.
Now, Edward, what is it?
Please, won't you believe that I'm just me and not the Prince?
You're no longer the Prince, Your Majesty.
You're the King.
I'm Tom Canty, I tell you, and I went to sleep in the palace garden.
His Highness brought me in because...
I imagine he was sorry that the Captain of the Guard bashed me.
And what became of the Prince, pray?
I don't know. That kind of worries me.
People won't believe him, either, because he was wearing my clothes... and didn't look at all like a prince.
He looked so much like me, that it made us laugh.
I suppose it wasn't so very funny, though.
You don't believe me?
I believe that you've been studying too hard, Your Majesty.
You won't even ask the Captain about what I said?
If you wish it.
I do, because if he doesn't say the same thing... then I must be out of my wits.
What did the boy look like?
Just another street urchin, milord.
The size and age of His Majesty.
Are you sure it wasn't His Majesty?
Of course. This boy was dirty, in tatters.
Then he was the King.
I don't know.
He said he was, and I thought it was impudence.
But he might have been?
He might have been.
There is either a mad prince or a beggar boy on the throne.
Now, I must know which.
That will be easy to tell, milord.
I pray the crime won't be on my head.
- How?
- His dog.
The brute will not suffer anyone to touch him except His Majesty.
Milord, should it not be, use your influence in my defense.
If you can only save me for the present...
If I save you, Captain, it shan't be for the present... but for the future, in which I may find you useful.
I've brought you a playmate, Edward.
- A dog. Mine?
- Yours.
He didn't like me.
No, my little Potentate of Poverty, he didn't like you.
- Then, you know who I am?
- Yes.
- When can I go?
- Never.
Never?
- But, if I'm not the King...
- You are the King.
The only way to lose the crown now is to lose your head with it.
- But I told the truth.
- And committed treason.
Do you know what that means?
You don't want that pretty little head of yours chopped off, do you?
Nor to have your mother see the crows tearing tufts... from a skull on London Bridge... and know that it's her son's hair in which they will nest?
Then never forget that you are Edward VI of England.
And that to ever again become Tom Canty... is to die.
Yes, sir.
- Your men will miss you, Captain.
- No.
I'm sending you away to execute a little mission for both of us.
Yes, milord?
It seems you expelled a king.
Then it was he.
Your syntax is poor, Captain.
"Was" is in the past tense.
It is he.
When he returns, he'll have my blood.
I remember that threat.
And should he return...
Norfolk would be appointed
Lord High Protector in my stead.
- I cannot defend you from a dungeon.
- What's to be done?
Our difficulties would be resolved by His Majesty's permanent absence.
But, milord... that would be murder.
His life or yours, Captain.
He'll be fairly easy to locate.
Your leave starts tonight.
The passing bell.
In good faith, they toll for Henry... little knowing they're sounding the knell of the House of Tudor.
Let us kneel to ask comfort and solace from Almighty God... when the burden of sorrow is upon us, my people.
Comfort us, O Lord... for we are as a child without a father... or as a ship without a rudder, or as a body without a head.
We mourn him whose statesmanship... and wisdom in counsel... have been as a bulwark against the enemies of England.
Thy will, not ours, be done, O Lord.
But strengthen us in this, our time of grief.
Thy people's sorrow and their destiny perish... for Henry, our King, is dead.
And a child sits upon the throne of England.
Imbue him with thy wisdom... thy strength, and thy mercy, O Lord.
Amen.
Father.
Long live the King.
All I hopes is this King ain't... the drunken fool the last was.
What was that scurrilous remark you made about my father?
You deny that you insulted the late King, my father?
Get away, or I'll fetch you one on the side of the head.
I'll have you drawn and quartered for this.
Do you realize you're addressing your King?
The King, are you? Look what's the King.
This ha'penny worth of cat's meat is none other than His Majesty.
Ho there! Lay off!
Didn't you hear me? I said lay off the lad.
Do you know what happens when you stick your nose where it ain't wanted?
Yes, this.
Back, my good people.
- Why don't we consider this situation?
- You'll all rot in chains for this.
Make way for the King's messenger!
Time for us to leave, I think.
- Where does Your Majesty deign to reside?
- In the palace, of course.
- Charboy?
- King.
Let's not play that game anymore.
It's too strenuous.
You dare disclaim me?
No, Your Majesty, only... it'll be a lot easier if you could be something a trifle more sedentary.
Like the Archbishop of Canterbury.
I tell you I am the King.
As you'll learn much to your regret if you don't keep a civil tone.
Very good, sire.
You're a bit done in after that joust.
You need some sleep to straighten you out.
You're too familiar, my man.
I will honor your hospitality tonight.
In the morning, you shall return to the palace with me for your reward.
Thank you, sire.
A drear hovel.
Yes, but then Windsor is so drafty.
I'm hungry.
What have you to tempt my appetite?
That depends on what didn't tempt the mices.
- Mice?
- Yes. I had to fatten them all up.
You see, the cat threatened to leave.
You're making a joke.
The humor of being short of rations, my friend, has always escaped me.
Then, you're poor?
Would you believe it? I am.
Who are you, fellow?
Miles Hendon, Your Majesty.
The name is not familiar.
What is your trade?
- Soldiering, sire.
- In my service?
In the service of anyone who can afford enemies.
Soldier of fortune. Strange profession.
Of the three open to a gentleman without means, it's the most amusing.
Cheating at cards means associating with dull people.
Preaching the gospel means wearing funny hats.
- Better eat, lad.
- Lad?
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
I hope you don't think this is a leg of mutton.
A sheep walked around on it for some time under that impression.
Would you sit in the presence of your King?
- See here...
- I will no longer tolerate your manner.
I ask your pardon, Your Majesty.
But after that chase we led them, it would be good to sit down.
Perhaps.
No, custom must be preserved.
You will stand.
I was very hungry.
- I feel better now.
- I'm gratified, Your Majesty.
Come to think of it,
I'm under obligation to you in many ways.
- Your service demands rich reward.
- A mere nothing, Your Majesty.
You may have any reward you wish.
Name it.
The privilege of sitting in your Majesty's presence.
Advance, fellow, and give me your sword.
- Is it that you find the mutton tough, sire?
- Kneel.
While England remains and the Crown continues... you and your heirs forever may sit in the presence of the Majesty of England.
Arise, Sir Miles Hendon.
For pity's sake, sit down.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Beginning to ache from the hammering they gave you?
Why do you ask?
You seem to be batting away at a few tears.
I'm not the man to snivel at a few bruises.
In fact, we Tudors never cry.
- What's the matter?
- My dad's dead.
Good morning, Your Majesty.
I hope Your Majesty slept well.
Yes, sir.
- Playing follow-the-leader?
- No, sire. We've come to dress you.
Have I enough clothes to go around?
Indeed, sire, everything has been assigned.
Are you ready to perform your ablutions?
His Majesty's towel and bowl.
His Grace the Lord High Protector, awaits your pleasure... and asks that you be informed that a note on the treasury has to be signed.
The household account being depleted.
- There's no money to pay for the palace?
- No, Your Majesty.
I suppose we'll just have to move to a smaller house.
I remember quite a nice one right next to the fish market in Billingsgate.
The rose water, milord.
It has a nice flavor.
Please, sir, how much longer must I do this?
This is the last, sire.
"Authorizes an increased tax on windows."
Do you mean to say we have a tax on windows?
May I suggest that Your Majesty cease troubling himself about...
I'm head of the government. It's my job to be troubled about these things.
And I think a tax on windows is cruel, unjust.
The royal treasury is empty, sire.
Every means of replenishing it must be taken.
Yes, but windows?
When poor people are sick, windows are the only outside they have.
They wouldn't have anything nice to look at if it weren't for windows.
And besides, that's taxing sunshine and light... which don't belong to us at all, but to God.
His Majesty's made a point there.
We will discuss this privately at some later time.
Have we Your Majesty's permission to withdraw?
Yes.
I'll try to think of some better way to raise money.
Did you see an urchin slide out of here?
He left, but sliding wasn't the way he done it.
He says to me,
"Out of my way, fellow," and stalked.
- Where'd he go?
- Good morning, Pam.
- How are the little ones?
- Where did he go?
It wasn't a he, it was a they.
A slimy looking fella come after the lad.
I heard him telling him you'd sent for him.
- I thought it was a bit fishy, but...
- Cut it short. Which way did he go?
Across the street and to the Thieves Booth, and got dragged off.
By whom?
By a foul old croak with a face that looked as if... it had been suckled on the handle of an headman's ax.
- Never mind the face.
- I didn't. I daresay he did.
He sold a candlestick to the receiver.
- I saw him.
- Who sold a candlestick?
The bloke with the face.
- Good day to you, sir.
- The good sir is looking for a bargain?
Yes, I have a skin I'd like to trade in exchange for a little information.
- A skin? Ermine or sable?
- Neither.
- Rodent.
- A rat skin isn't worth anything.
No? Except to the rat, of course.
You see, the skin happens to be yours.
If you want to save it, tell me who that man was...
- who dragged off the beggar boy.
- What man?
The man from whom you bought the candlestick.
- I don't know.
- No? Too bad.
Wait! Mercy.
I daren't tell you. He'd have every thief in London out to slit my throat.
Then I'll save him some trouble.
I'll tell you.
His name is John Canty.
He lives in Offal Court.
The boy is his son, Tom, a little daft on the subject of royalty.
A thousand thanks, sir. Good day, sir.
You must know I'm not Tom because you couldn't be this mean to your own boy!
You dare strike me?
Smash your own father, will you?
I'll show you!
What's the meaning of this?
I'm his father, and you don't happen to be mine.
So keep your holy nose out of it.
- Lf you strike that boy again, I'II...
- You'll do what?
I'll forget that the laying on of hands should be done gently.
I warned you, you meddling old fool!
- Is he dead?
- Shut up.
Come on!
He just sits there and says nothing.
The boy's potty.
And it's because of that Father Andrew always teaching him...
Be quiet about Father Andrew, can't you?
- Were you seen doing anything?
- Shut up.
- What's the pack?
- Father Andrew.
- What about him?
- Dead as a salted herring.
And it's gossip you done him in.
How do you suppose that got about?
From you bashing him over the head and him not getting up again.
You best take to the road.
Blowing hot, is it?
It'll be scorching your heels soon if you don't make to the Roost.
I'm on the run to see the Ruffler.
Don't open your mouth to no one who ain't in on the know.
- We'll head to the river dike.
- Ain't you taking him?
- What for?
- He seen it, didn't he?
That's right, he did.
He'd be a hindrance, but it's better than having him a witness.
He might come in handy, too.
He's the size that can be lifted through a window easy and quiet.
That's right.
It's time I was breaking him for a retriever.
Come here!
If you see such a beggar boy, you'll get five pounds.
Five pounds for a beggar boy?
What'd he do?
Steal the Throne Room out of Windsor?
Another of His Majesty's whims.
He's a bit addlepated, you know.
Remember, look sharp.
Sharp, at five pounds!
A glance from me will nail him to the wall.
Is John about?
I have a bit of business with him.
It wouldn't have to do with the law, would it?
It might have if I don't see him.
You see, he and I...
Just who are you?
His mother.
And for all the drink it gets me,
I might better have begat an empty bottle.
Well, then... perhaps you can use his share of a candlestick we lifted together.
This is once I get my share.
I'm beholden to you, indeed.
Not at all. Where can I find John?
Him and that crazed brat of his had to take to the road.
- Making for the Roost, they are.
- The Roost?
An empty barn near Stullington.
They all holes up there with the Ruffler when it gets hot for 'em.
Yes, of course. The Ruffler.
You say his son is a little unhinged?
Like a gate, he is. Thinks he's a king.
- Has he been this way long?
- No.
John fetched him home like that just today.
Probably gave him one over the head... and cracked it like a nut.
I need money to maintain the palaces, courts, and royal establishments... that His Majesty's dignity be upheld.
May I remark, milord, that it might be more important... to uphold the dignity of England upon the sea?
Let me remind you,
England still has ships afloat.
Barely afloat.
Some of them we daren't fire a cannon aboard for fear of opening up seams.
With the thousands of pounds you've spent on one stable at Windsor... we could've increased the fleet by one-fourth.
You will observe, my lords... how amusingly futile is the bark of an old sea dog... when his teeth have been pulled.
Am I to understand, then, that the Navy is to get nothing?
And that you intend to wheedle a demented boy... into signing these looting demands on the treasury?
That is my intention.
Following the dictates of my judgment and honor.
You admit to honor?
- I boast of it.
- Excellent.
Then you have no alternative but to defend it.
It does not please me to be awakened yet.
You'll wake up, beggar, and pay heed.
- Am I not King anymore?
- Certainly, my most gracious liege.
Good. I'm getting so I kind of enjoy it.
Send for the Lord of the Chamber.
I want something to eat.
- Sign this order.
- What is it?
Sign it.
- Have you seen the Great Seal?
- Great Seal? No.
The great big ones are called walruses.
Stamp, you little fool! A big stamp!
No, I didn't see it. Did you lose it?
The Prince hid it.
When you find the Prince, maybe he'll remember.
- You are looking for him, aren't you?
- Yes, we're looking for him.
"It's our will that Thomas Howard, second Duke of Norfolk...
"steward of the Household, and Lord High Admiral of the fleet...
"be placed under arrest, incarcerated in the Tower...
"and there held for execution for his treasonous plottings...
"against the Crown and the public weal."
Signed Edward Rex.
May I see it?
This order is signed by His Majesty... but not stamped with the Great Seal.
You cannot execute me.
True, but we can keep you in prison... until the Great Seal, which has been mislaid, is found.
And I assure Your Grace, that will be shortly.
You've chosen an excellent way to avoid meeting me in a duel.
A way worthy of you, Hertford.
We await your attendance, milord.
Poor little boy.
Bereft of reason and made the pawn of an unscrupulous scoundrel.
May history learn the truth and forgive Edward.
That song reminds me of Molly One-Eye.
It was her favorite.
What happened to old Molly One-Eye?
Died of honesty, she did.
Tried to turn a penny by telling fortunes... and swiftly, they burned her for a witch.
And a merry blaze she made... with her marrow all soaked in spirits.
Her mistake was in changing her trade.
No, her mistake was being born in England.
Here! No treason, now.
What's wrong with England?
- Her laws.
- What do you know about English law?
Think you're a magistrate?
No.
A human being for whom they're made.
An honest farmer... who had self-respect, a wife, three children, a mother.
All of which have been legislated into potter's field by English law.
Our first sin was committed by my mother... when she went to nurse her sick neighbor.
When the woman died, the doctors couldn't find the cause.
So they solved it... by calling my mother a witch and boiling her in oil... while I and my babes looked on... and learned the meaning of English justice.
We begged from house to house.
I, with two children stumbling and whimpering on either end.
Finally, I stole.
To keep my little Joseph from starving.
But English law decreed otherwise.
I was caught, sold for a slave... and branded on the cheek with the letter "S".
"S" for slave!
An English slave.
Understand? An English slave.
The most contemptuous title any Englishman can bear... still conferred by English law.
But I'll be relieved of it.
One day I'll be caught and hanged.
You shall not!
Furthermore, on this day, that law is ended.
What's that?
Who is this?
I am Edward, King of England.
You mannerless vagrants.
Is this the thanks I get for the royal boon I have promised?
He's my son and stark mad.
Thinks he's King.
I am the King.
As you, a confessed murderer, shall soon learn on the gallows!
You'd try your own father, will you?
If you have no respect for your king, have some for the Ruffler... or I'll teach you respect at the end of a rope.
Now, lad, if you must be king... humor yourself, but not as King of England.
It's treason, and we'll have none of that here.
We may be a scurvy lot... but at least we're scurvy Englishmen, and loyal to the Crown.
God bless Edward, King of England!
I thank you, my good people.
Drop it, I said.
Choose yourself another handle.
- Foo-Foo the First!
- King of mooncalves!
Here you are! Your robe, sire!
- A crown!
- Here's one.
He's disappeared, plain and simple.
Why should His Grace still be worried about him?
Because it would put England in revolt and half its head on the chopping block... should there be two Edwards at the coronation tomorrow.
What's that to us? We're still the King's Guard, whether the King is...
Edward or Bobo the butcher boy.
One o'clock and all's well!
Drink up and be off to your rooms.
It's closing time. Come on.
That's good advice.
You'll be on the road at sunrise. Up!
Right, sir.
About three more swallows will do it.
Take your time, sir.
I wouldn't want you to get the hiccups.
No. They're noisy things.
Here's to the end of your long day.
It'd be a pleasure to get you another, sir.
Would it? But how about your sleep?
I can manage to keep my eyes open.
Especially when there's something handsome to look at.
Are you staying the night?
- No. Worse luck.
- Why not?
- The curse of money, my dear.
- You mean you're strapped?
I only wish I were.
Then I couldn't have flipped that coin.
- But where are you going?
- A place called the Roost, near here.
That thieves' den?
But you're not going there at this time of night?
You'll have your throat cut sure.
They'll commit murder for a penny.
It looks bad for me with my shilling.
Remember, if you don't do like you've been told... we'll put climes on you.
Twenty of them.
You know what climes are?
Tell him, Hugo.
They're little bandages with a bit of paste on them... made of soap and quicklime and rust off old iron.
And when you take some off, there's the nastiest looking sore... that ever made a citizen sick.
Sores that don't get well, but spread like a disease.
No.
I'll steal.
Let's get at it, then.
Help! Murder! Call the watch!
Stop!
Where'd they go?
Help!
Who was that?
Murder!
Boy, stop. It is I, Miles Hendon.
What happened there?
- I've been murdered.
- Murdered?
They killed me.
- All right, what happened?
- I don't know.
You don't know? I have a pretty fair idea.
You got into the room and didn't do what you was told.
Now you'll get what's coming to you.
I'm deeply grateful to you, Sir Miles.
You certainly make some delightful acquaintances.
Is he dead?
I don't anticipate hearing an apology from him much before Judgment Day.
It is just. He was a confessed murderer.
Come. I wish to be gone from here.
What have you been doing since I last saw you?
Learning a great deal about England.
- It doesn't seem to please you.
- No, it doesn't.
- Hold or I'll fire!
- That's them.
No doubt! What are they doing about this time of night?
String 'em both up.
- Stop that! What would you with us?
- You're under arrest for robbery.
We know nothing of any robbery.
We'll take you back to the Running Fox.
We'll find out soon enough.
- They're the thieves, all right.
- No doubt of it.
All right, here they are. We nabbed them.
No, sir. It wasn't this gentleman, sir.
I happen to know it was otherwise...
You speak when you're spoke to.
If you can recognize them... they'll soon be on their way to learn it's harder to break out than in.
I can recognize them. Just point them out.
Get over there.
I can identify him.
He was the one with the musket.
No, sir. I was the one that led the cavalry charge. Don't you remember?
My dapper friend, you'd be more respectful lashed to a whipping post.
You, my fat friend, would look more natural tied to a hitching post.
- Where are all the others?
- All the others is him.
He's right here, sir.
It's him.
His Majesty.
- Get the horses ready.
- Right, sir.
- It's he. I'm positive.
- Take your hands from me, pig!
- Pig? I'll teach you.
- What?
- You're a pretty pair of cutthroats.
- Take them away.
One moment.
- We'll take charge of the boy.
- Captain, l...
And who might you be to be taking charge of my prisoner?
The Captain of His Majesty's Guard.
Let's see that.
The boy has escaped from a London madhouse.
And has a strange insanity offensive to the Crown.
Naturally, this is our responsibility.
Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Your prisoner, sir.
Take him along.
- Glad to have been of service, Captain.
- Good night.
Captain, what do you suggest doing with this one, sir?
He seems capable of digesting about 20 lashes.
Thank you, Captain.
When next we meet, I trust you'll be capable of digesting 20 inches of steel.
Here.
How dare you indulge this outrage on my person?
It wouldn't do to let people know there's been no king on the throne... until the day before the coronation.
Forgive me. It was the best ruse I knew to get you away.
But what of the man Hendon?
I want him freed.
He shall be in the morning.
Tonight we get closer to London to arrive in time tomorrow.
Very well.
But should any harm come to Miles Hendon, your life shall pay for it.
- Understand?
- Yes, Your Majesty. My life.
- Why are we stopping here, Captain?
- To let you get some sleep, Your Majesty.
I felt my making camp for a few hours... would freshen you for the coronation ceremonies in the morning.
Very considerate, Captain. I am sleepy.
This way, Your Majesty.
This place will be ideal.
May I have your cloak, Captain?
Give me your cloak.
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- What have you done?
It's what I must do, poor little Edward.
Is that any way to address your King?
Or for the Captain of my Guard to act?
Cowering like a woman?
Out with it, fellow. What is it?
You are to join your father, Your Majesty.
You're going to kill me?
You can't.
You just can't.
There's no one to take the throne, except Mary or Elizabeth.
And they're girls and not even grown up.
Say your prayers, Your Majesty.
I hope my father's asleep in heaven.
I don't want him to know that a Tudor died at the hands of a traitorous Englishman.
He'd be so ashamed of you.
But he won't be ashamed of me.
"Our father, who art in heaven...
"hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come...
"thy will be done...
"on earth as it is in heaven."
And me what calls myself an Englishman.
Be still, can't you?
"Forgive us our trespasses...
"as we forgive those who trespass against us.
"Lead us not into temptation...
"but deliver us from evil."
How's your digestion now, Captain?
Ready for that 20 inches of steel
I promised you?
Miles Hendon!
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty?
- Then you believe me?
- Without a doubt, sire.
What's the matter?
I was frightened.
Sirs, here I present King Edward... rightful and undoubted inheritor by the laws of God and man... to the royal dignity and crown imperial of this realm... whose consecration, inunction, and coronation... is appointed to be this day.
Will ye nobles, peers, and commons serve at this time... and give your good wills in a sense... to the same consecration, inunction, and coronation... as by your duty ye are bound to do?
Yes!
Smile, you little fool.
Smile and bow to them.
O God, who dwellest in the high and holy place... with them also who are of a humble spirit...
Look down mercifully upon this, thy servant Edward, our King... here humbling himself before thee at thy footstool... and graciously receive these oblations... which in humble acknowledgment of thy sovereignty over all... and of thy great bounty to him in particular... he hath offered up unto thee... through Jesus Christ, our only mediator and advocate.
Amen.
Will you, Edward, grant to the people of England... the laws and liberties of this realm?
"I do grant and so promise."
Will you keep to the Church and people holy peace and concord?
"I shall keep."
Will you make to be done to the best of your strength and power... equal and rightful justice in all your dooms and judgments with mercy and truth?
"I shall do."
The things which I have here before promised I will perform and keep.
So help me God and the contents of this book.
Kiss the book.
Let these hands be anointed with holy oil.
Let this breast... be anointed with holy oil.
And let this head be anointed with holy oil.
As kings and prophets were anointed... and as Samuel did anoint David to be king.
So that thou mayest be blessed and established... a king in this kingdom, over this people... whom the Lord thy God have given thee to rule and govern.
Amen.
O Lord... who receivest thy good and faithful servants... with mercy and loving kindness...
Look down upon this, thy servant Edward, our King...
- Get out of here.
- Look here, my good fellow...
Something of the utmost importance to the entire realm has arisen...
You'll have your ears taken off if you don't go.
- I demand to speak to your captain.
- He'll give you 40 lashes.
...having a right faith and manifold fruit of good works... mayest obtain the crown of an everlasting Kingdom.
Stop!
What is this?
What is he doing?
Stop! I forbid it.
Who dares this sacrilege?
I, Edward, the King.
Truly, he is the King.
His Majesty's malady is upon him again.
- Seize the impostor.
- Hold!
O my lord and King, forgive me.
What you have done is shameful treason.
It wasn't my doing, Your Majesty.
Cross my heart.
I believe you, Tom Canty.
But others shall answer.
- Outrage...
- Softly.
Your Majesty, perhaps we could proceed with the coronation... if you were assured no harm would come to this lad.
What a striking resemblance.
Some of you have already forfeited your heads.
But others may be spared by paying homage now.
Please, milord. Please believe us.
Truly, he is the King.
By your favor, sire, might I ask some questions... which may allay our doubts?
I command you to do so, that I may answer them... and end your stupid perplexity.
What stands near the right-hand door of our late King's apartment?
The Great Herring.
A model of the warship designed by my late father.
God rest his soul.
Of what did Lady Jane eat so many that she became...
- discommoded?
- Pomegranates.
And got ill on the Steward of the Household.
Which man did you wrongly but affectionately call uncle?
Milord Norfolk, whose absence displeases me.
- All these things are true, milord.
- Unbelievably.
Astonishing.
Quite astonishing indeed, but the King can do the same. They are not proofs.
It is perilous to the state and to us all, to entertain such a mystery as this.
It could undermine the throne, divide the nation.
- Arrest this...
- One moment.
The mystery may be easily solved.
There's one question which only the Prince of Wales can answer.
- Where is the Great Seal of England?
- That'll settle it.
I must have put it with all things of value which had been entrusted to me.
Of course. Milord St. John... go to my private cabinet.
Close to the floor in the left corner is a nailhead.
Press it and a jeweled closet will fly open.
There you will find the Great Seal. Fetch it.
- At once!
- And do hurry.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your mount, Captain!
- Yes, milord.
The seal, Your Majesty, is not there.
Cast this beggar into the streets.
Stone the impostor. Take him away.
Let him alone!
Please, sir. Maybe His Majesty has just misplaced the seal.
- He might have, mightn't he?
- Hardly likely, sire.
A massive golden disk isn't a thing to escape notice.
Was it round and thick?
And did it have letters carved in it?
That would describe it, my liege.
Blimey. So that's the thing that's been worrying everybody.
If you'd described it to me, you could have had it sooner.
Your Majesty, knowing where the great seal lies... does nothing to establish this lad's spurious claim.
Perhaps we'd better continue the ceremony.
But with the real King, because he put away the seal himself.
Remember, Your Majesty?
You must. You've got to be king.
Because I wouldn't like it anymore.
Think.
I just can't.
- It seems so long ago.
- We exchanged clothes, you remember?
That I'll never forget.
And you asked me if I knew any games, and I said, Constable.
And you went out to get your dog.
But before you left, what did you do?
Think.
- Harder, Your Majesty.
- I just can't.
Listen, and try and see it.
You started for the door.
You passed a table.
That old thing you called a seal was on it.
You picked it up and looked about for some place to hide it.
Your eyes caught sight of...
The suit of armor by the door, in the leg-piece.
Your Majesty. Coming through.
- Your mount again, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
He's a busy bloke, ain't he?
Come here, lad.
Yes, Your Majesty?
I owe my throne to you, Tom.
A debt which I shall pay.
But tell me, how could you remember where I hid the seal... when I couldn't myself?
You see, Your Majesty,
I found it and used it.
Used it? For what?
To crack nuts with.
My father told me the night he died... that a wise king removes the heads of those... who try to remove the crown.
But I suppose I'm not a wise king.
Because I don't want you to be killed.
Instead, I hereby order you to be banished from England... for the rest of your life.
May I learn generosity from you, sire.
The acts, Your Majesty.
Milords and ladies, my dad...
I mean, the late King... told me to use the Great Seal sparingly in making laws.
But if he had gone out among his people without his crown...
I know he'd have told me not to spare it in breaking them.
So these acts abolish the begging laws... modify the laws of eminent domain, and do away with slavery.
Churl, you dare sit in the presence of your King?
Yes. But you mustn't.
- Your Majesty!
- Let's not take affront.
It is his right, afforded by a grateful King, whose life he saved.
- Also, Sir Miles Hendon...
- Yes, sire?
There is among these papers a commission for you.
- As Captain of my Guard.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
You aren't pleased by my appointment?
You see, Your Majesty, the enemy will never come to Windsor.
And a Captain of the Guard can't go looking for them.
So, as my trade's soldiering, I don't see when I'll get a chance to practice it.
Very well.
- But I owe you something.
- Three crowns to be exact, sire.
You shall have them. A hundredfold.
Yes, and an earldom, castles, lands...
- and a retinue of servants.
- Your Majesty.
I hope Your Majesty won't think me ungrateful... but please may I be permitted to forgo all these honors... with which Your Majesty threatens me?
To one of my temperament, riches are a curse.
Possessions, a veritable scourge.
All I ask is an obscure life and a peaceful one.
But not too peaceful, of course.
Anything to content you, Sir Miles.
But remember, I'm eternally in your debt.
I'll seal these, and you may send for them later.
- Please dismiss the court.
- Yes, sire.
You have His Majesty's permission to withdraw.
- Tom.
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Come here.
- Yes, sire.
They're gone.
Sit down.
Are you sure it's all right?
You sat down all the time you were King, so I suppose it won't matter now.
- This one's about you.
- Me?
- It makes you my ward.
- Ward?
That means all your life you'll have money to live on.
And if anybody's unkind or cruel to you... they've committed an offense against the Crown.
- Oh, Your Majesty.
- What's the matter?
- I just don't know what to say.
- Just say thank you.
This is good for cracking nuts, isn't it?

Conway!
We can't take more than seven.
All right. I'm sorry.
Another plane in a minute.
All right.
Wait, everybody.
Plenty of planes are coming.
Have patience, we'll be all right.
- It won't be long!
- Don't worry.
Leave everything to my brother.
- Yes, sir, 10 passengers aboard.
-10 passengers. Good.
Say, get me Shanghai.
- Is Colonel Marsh there?
- Right here, Conway. Go ahead.
I need more planes.
I've still about 30 people to get out.
- Where are the planes you promised?
- We sent all we could find.
They better get here, or I can't be responsible...
- I think I hear motors.
- Wait a minute, they may be here now.
George, get down on the field and guide those planes in.
Be sure none of the natives get in.
- Hello, Colonel?
- Hello, Conway.
- Thanks, and take care of your liver.
- My word!
Get ready, everyone. Planes are here.
One at a time. Children first.
Where are they? Come stand over here.
Where's the mother?
- They're orphans.
- I see. You come here, and you...
- What about us, Mr. Conway?
- Wait your turn. Come on, you.
Take some of those squealing men with you first.
They might faint on you. I'll wait.
Just as you say. You, madam.
Come through here. Wait on one side.
- Don't lose your heads!
- What was that explosion?
They've blown up the powerhouse!
The planes can't land without lights.
We'll burn the hangar.
That will make light for them.
There's going to be a big fire.
All right. Go ahead!
We go on the next plane.
Bring out any people that are left.
- Hello, Fenner.
- Hello, Conway. Having a little trouble?
Never mind me.
Get this gadget off the ground.
- Bob, these are all that are left.
- Quick.
You can't leave me here, you blighter!
I'm a British subject.
Look out, Bob!
All right, Fenner. Go ahead!
Down on the floor!
Go ahead, Fenner!
Let's go!
I guess we're out of range.
- Everybody all right?
- That was close.
I've never been in a situation like this in my life.
- Where do you come from?
- I'm Alexander P. Lovett.
- Why aren't you registered?
- It'd serve you right to be left behind.
How could I know a war was going to break out over my head?
Right over my head. My word!
Those Chinese were pouncing on me.
I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
- Where were you hiding?
- Hiding? No.
Hunting. I was in the interior hunting fossils.
- This morning I looked up suddenly...
- And a war broke out right over your head!
Next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British consul.
Very good, Freshie.
Put his name on the list and make out a report later.
I beg your pardon, brother.
- What did you say you were hunting?
- Fossils.
- Fossils?
- I'm a palaeontologist.
- A what?
- A palaeontologist.
I see.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world.
It's the vertebra from the lumbar of a Megatherium, found in Asia.
- What do you know about that?
- Found in Asia.
When I get home,
I'll probably be knighted for it.
You don't say!
- Do you mind if I take a look at it?
- Not at all.
Sorry.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
From this vertebra,
I'll be able to reconstruct...
...the entire skeleton...
You expect to be knighted for finding that soup bone?
This is the vertebra of a Megatherium found in Asia.
I remember. You said that before.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted.
He never got beyond the Mesozoic era.
- Poor fellow!
- Yes, it just shows...
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Who are you?
- Okay, brother.
- Don't call me "brother. "
Okay, sister.
No offence.
Cigarette?
- I say, will you have a cigarette?
- No.
You're an American, aren't you?
Go and annoy the rest of your playmates.
Let me alone.
Look what I found.
Just what I needed, too.
You.
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating.
Think of it. A cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England.
You know what it means? Here you are.
Don't bother about those cables now.
I want you to drink with me.
Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway,
England's new Foreign Secretary.
Hooray!
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory.
People will point to me and say:
"There goes George Conway, brother of the Foreign Secretary. "
- Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
- That's why they're sending for you.
With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen.
You can laugh if you want to.
But whom else can they get?
Who else in England is half the fighter and half the diplomat...
...who has half your knowledge of the foreign situation?
They can't stop you now.
Hello, Freshie.
- Did you make that report out yet?
- Yes, Bob.
- Did you say we saved 90 white people?
- Yes.
Hooray for us.
Did you say that we left 10,000 natives down there to be annihilated?
No, you wouldn't say that.
They don't count.
You'd better try to get some sleep.
Just you wait until I'm foreign secretary.
Can't you just see me with all those other shrewd little foreign secretaries?
The trick is to see who can outtalk the other.
Everybody wants something for nothing.
If you can't get it with smooth talk, you send your army in.
I'm going to fool them.
I'm not going to have an army.
I am going to disband mine.
I'm going to sink my battleships.
I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft.
When the enemy approaches, we'll say:
"Come in, gentlemen.
What can we do for you?"
So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think.
And what will they think?
They'll say, "Something's wrong here, we've been duped!
"This is not according to form.
"These people seem quite friendly.
Why should we shoot them?"
Then they'll lay down their arms.
You see how simple the whole thing is?
Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants.
And I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
You'd better not drink anymore.
You're not talking sense.
Don't worry, George, nothing's going to happen.
I'll fall right into line.
I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be.
I'll be the best little foreign secretary we've ever had.
Just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
- Do try to sleep, Bob.
- Yes. Good thing, sleep.
Ever notice the sunrise in China?
You should. It's beautiful.
Good morning, Lovey.
- I beg your pardon?
- I say, "Good morning, Lovey. "
Good morning. Look here, young man.
I didn't care for "sister" last night, and I don't like "Lovey" this morning.
- My name is Lovett, Alexander P.
- I see.
- It's a good morning, anyway.
- I'm never conversational before coffee.
Wait a minute.
Is it a good morning?
We're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we?
- Of course.
- It looks to me as if we're travelling west.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
It certainly is.
Any child knows how to tell direction.
I don't care where the child is, in the air, on the earth, or in the sea.
If you face the rising sun, your right hand is north, your left hand is south.
I get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
- Really?
- Yes.
Just reverse it. Your left hand is...
What difference does it make?
The north is the north.
All I know is the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Now you're irritating and absurd.
Of course. Boy!
We're travelling in the wrong direction.
- We're going in the wrong direction.
- Couldn't you make less noise?
We're going west, and Shanghai is way east of here.
Quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China.
- It's Fenner.
- He may have lost his way.
That's what I told him.
You can't expect him to sail in the dark.
Calm yourself. I'll speak to Fenner.
Fenner! I say...
- Bob, it isn't Fenner in the cockpit!
- Stop it.
The bloke up there looks Chinese or Mongolian.
We're nowhere near Shanghai.
We're going in the opposite direction.
We're over the desert. That's funny.
Charming chap.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
- That's that.
- I wonder what happened to Fenner.
Who is he? How'd he get there?
Do you think we stopped last night and changed pilots?
That's not possible.
If we'd landed, we would've awakened.
We never left the air.
I didn't sleep the whole night long.
- That fellow got on at Baskul.
- Where's he taking us?
He may be a maniac for all we know.
What are you going to do?
- I'll make him tell us his game.
- What if he refuses?
- We'll smash his face in.
- Brilliant!
Can anyone here fly a plane?
That's no good.
- I guess we're in for it.
- In for what?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane.
- When he lands, we'll find out.
- You won't do anything till we land?
- What do you suggest?
- Why, you...
- He may dash us to pieces.
- It might afford you a great deal of relief.
I am going back to sleep.
I was having such a peaceful dream.
As soon as he lands, let me know.
We're heading down! We're going to land.
We're coming to a village.
- What are these people?
- I don't know. I can't get their dialect.
They're loading up with gasoline.
Imagine having that fuel there, waiting for us!
Something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Where are we going?
If you ask me, we're heading straight for those mountains.
Douglas plane from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard still missing.
Unreported between here and Baskul.
Make it very emphatic that His Majesty's government...
...will hold the Chinese government and all governors of Chinese provinces...
...responsible for the complete safety of Robert Conway.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- No news yet, sir?
- It's fantastic.
The plane couldn't disappear into thin air.
Cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai.
Leave no stone unturned to find Conway.
- Robertson?
- Yes, sir.
Postpone the Far East conference.
We can't meet those nations...
...without Conway.
This can't be kidnapping.
They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it.
What do you make of it, Bob?
You must have some idea.
I give it up.
Not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Mr. Conway, for a man who's supposed to be a leader...
...your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing.
- What do you want him to do?
- I don't know.
I'm a palaeontologist, not a foreign secretary.
- George, come on.
- It's not knowing that's so awful.
Not knowing where you're going, why, or what's waiting when you get there.
We got above that storm.
I can't stand it any longer! Take us down!
I can't stand the pain any longer.
Let me out of here!
I can't stand it any longer!
Let me out of here!
It's oxygen.
- Take this in your teeth.
- Let me alone.
Come on. That's right. Bite on that.
What's that?
- What's happening?
- He must have run out of fuel.
Look! Look down there!
George! Everybody!
Better get back towards the tail.
He may nose her over. Into the corner!
Quick, George! Cushions! Blankets!
Take that behind you.
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.
- He's fainted?
- Looks like it. You smell those fumes?
Here, George, take the gun.
Hold the light.
I'll search him before he comes to.
We might find something interesting.
There's a map.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
It must have happened when he hit the ground.
Let's take a look at this map.
What is it?
- See that spot?
- Yes.
That's where we were this morning.
He had it marked.
Right on the border of Tibet.
Here's where civilisation ends.
We must be 1,000 miles beyond it.
Just a blank on the map.
- What does it mean?
- It means we're in unexplored country.
Country nobody ever reached.
Conway! What's happening?
Our chances of getting out of this are slim, but it's up to us.
We can't have three hysterical people on our hands.
- What do you say?
- Everything's all right.
The pilot won't trouble us anymore.
He's dead.
- Dead?
- Probably a heart attack.
What are we going to do?
Nothing until the morning. The storm will probably die down before then.
My suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night's rest.
Why not tell them the truth.
We're a million miles from civilisation...
...without a chance of getting out of here alive?
It's slow starvation.
It's slow horrible death.
That's perfect. Just perfect.
What a kick I'm going to get out of this.
A year ago, a doctor gave me six months to live. That was a year ago.
I'm already six months to the good.
I'm on velvet. I haven't got a thing to lose.
But, you, the noble animals of the human race...
...what a kick I'll get out of watching you squirm for a change.
What a kick!
They've been gone for hours.
Left us here to rot.
That's what they've done.
- Heroes of the newspapers.
- All right. Keep quiet.
Here they come.
Hello, everybody. We found some food.
No chance of starving now.
- What is that?
- Mountain grass. It's good. Have some.
I've read of people lasting 30 days on this stuff.
My brother and I have worked out a plan.
If we use our heads we'll keep alive for weeks, till he gets back.
- Gets back?
- Where's he gone?
He's starting out right away in the direction of India.
Sooner or later, he's bound to run into a tribe or something.
Here's the idea.
We found a cave over that small hill.
As soon as we bury the pilot, we'll move in. We can have a fire.
I shouldn't be surprised to see Bob back within a week.
You haven't a Chinaman's chance of getting out of here alive. You know it.
- Cave? Where?
- Over by that hill.
Hey, look! Look, Bob!
- Where are they? Do you see them?
- Yes.
Do you think they're cannibals?
I am from the nearby lamasery.
My name is Chang.
He's speaking English.
- And mine's Conway.
- How do you do?
You've no idea how unexpected and very welcome you are.
My friends and l, and the lady in the plane...
...left Baskul the night before last for Shanghai.
But we were travelling in the opposite direction.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
- We'd be eternally grateful if you...
- Where is your "mad" pilot?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes.
When the plane landed he was dead.
We were going to bury him when you came along.
Pardon me.
If you will be good enough to direct us to your lamasery...
It is an honour to accompany you and your friends.
You'll need suitable clothes for the journey.
- It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
- Thank you.
Welcome to Shangri-La.
You see we are sheltered by mountains on every side.
A strange phenomenon for which we are very grateful.
It's magical.
- I definitely do not like this place.
- Will you quit squawking?
- Look at what they gave me to wear.
- You never looked better.
As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they'll give them back to us, Lovey.
Something tells me this means food.
Come on.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
If this be execution, lead me to it.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
- You're a scream, Lovey.
- Please don't call me "Lovey. "
That was refreshing.
The food looks good.
Some layout they got here.
You see the rooms?
Couldn't do better at the Ritz.
All the conveniences for the condemned.
- Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
- I don't like this place. It's too mysterious.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Is there something I can do for you?
- What do you want?
- I've ordered you some warm broth.
- I thought perhaps...
- Get out of here!
If any of you men think you can come busting in here...
Please.
Please calm yourself.
You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you.
Get me a doctor.
- I'm sorry, we have no doctors here.
- No doctors.
Well, that's just fine.
- Please let me help you.
- You can help me jump over that cliff.
I've been looking at the bottom of that mountain...
...but I haven't got the nerve to jump.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain.
Why don't you try looking up at the top sometime?
Don't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff to me.
Go on, beat it!
Beat it!
Peace be with you, my child.
Good evening, my friends.
Please sit down.
- I hope you found everything satisfactory.
- Swell.
Excellent.
- You shouldn't have waited for me.
- Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
She's remaining in her room.
She isn't feeling very well.
Please go on without me. I eat very little.
There's certainly nothing wrong with that meal.
Thank you.
- And the wine is excellent.
- I'm glad you like it.
It's made right here in the valley.
Now that dinner is over, we're very anxious...
...to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
First, we want to cable the Foreign Office.
England's waiting for news of my brother.
There's a cruiser at Shanghai to take him back.
Really?
As regards cabling, I'm afraid I can't help.
Unfortunately we have no wireless here.
As a matter of fact, we have no means of communication with the outside world.
- Not even a radio?
- It's been a source of deep regret...
...but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
We'd better make arrangements to get some porters immediately.
Some means to get us back to civilisation.
- Are you so certain you are away from it?
- As far away as I ever want to be.
The porters will be very well paid.
That is, within reason.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.
We have no porters here.
No porters here?
What about those men we met this morning?
Those are our own people.
They never venture beyond where you were met this morning.
It's much too hazardous.
How do you account for all this?
Who brought it in?
There is a tribe of porters some 500 miles from here.
That is our only contact with the outside world.
Every now and again, depending upon favourable weather, they make the journey.
- How can we get in touch with them?
- In that respect you are very fortunate.
We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now.
What do you mean by "almost any time now"?
We've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
- Two years?
- Yes.
Well...
But I assure you, gentlemen, if there is a prolonged delay...
...Shangri-La will endeavour to make your stay as pleasant as possible.
And now, if you will excuse me, it is getting late.
I do hope you all sleep well.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Conway.
Good night, sir.
That's what I mean, mysterious.
I don't like that man. He's too vague.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we?
It seems we should be grateful.
We were in a bad mess this morning.
After all, this is quite pleasant.
Why not make ourselves comfortable until the porters do arrive?
That's what I say.
What do you say to a rubber of bridge?
- I saw some cards in the other room.
- Not for me, thanks. I'm too weary.
How about you, Lovey? Come on.
Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
- I'm thinking.
- Thinking?
- What about some double solitaire?
- In fact, I'm very good at it.
- No kidding?
- Yes.
Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots.
- Hello, George. Cigarette?
- Thanks.
I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
There's been plenty of it in the last few days.
It's far from over from what I can see.
This place gives me the creeps.
Hidden away like this, no contact with civilisation.
You don't seem concerned at all.
I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.
I think I'm going to like it here.
You talk as if you intend on staying.
Something happened to me when we arrived here that...
Did you ever go to a strange place and feel sure you'd been there before?
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
You're a strange bird.
No wonder Gainsford calls you:
"The man who always wanted to see the other side of the hill. "
Do you ever want to see what's on the other side?
What else could there be, except another hill?
In any event, I'm not curious.
It seems to me we should be concerned about getting home.
- I'd give anything to be in London now.
- Of course you would.
If ever we get out of this place, you should take that job with Helen's father.
What do you mean, "lf"?
- Did I say, "lf"?
- That's what you said.
Well, I mean...
You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
I've been putting things together.
Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot?
Why did those clothes materialise so conveniently when they met us?
Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point.
What brought them there, unless it was to meet us?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place.
They must have deliberately brought us here.
What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
It's 3,000 feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley.
The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it.
There are over 2,000 people in the valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Goodness, no.
- So there are others?
- Yes.
- Who, for instance?
- In time you will meet them all.
For a man who talks a lot, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things, my dear Conway,
I deeply regret I may not discuss.
That's the fourth time you've said that.
You should record it.
Let's go inside.
I'd like to show you our rare treasures.
- Good afternoon.
- Excuse me, l...
Please, don't go.
Tea will be served any moment.
Won't you come in?
My name is Maria.
Won't you sit down?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation.
We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind.
Even including excess of virtue itself.
That's intelligent.
In the valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives.
We rule with moderate strictness...
...and in return, we are satisfied with moderate obedience.
As a result, our people are moderately honest, moderately chaste...
...and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order?
You have no soldiers or police?
Good heavens, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles, criminals?
We have no crime here.
What makes a criminal?
Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy.
The desire to possess something owned by another.
There can be no crime when there is a sufficiency of everything.
You have no disputes over women?
Only very rarely.
It wouldn't be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Suppose he wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang...
...if it was good manners or not.
In that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man...
...to let him have her.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
You'd be surprised how a little courtesy all around...
...helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
At some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her.
Some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me.
Mr. Chang, all these things, books, instruments, sculpture...
...were they all brought in over those mountains by porters?
They were.
- That must have taken...
- Centuries.
Centuries.
Where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures?
We have no money as you know it.
We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes...
...because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
That would suit me perfectly.
I'm always broke.
How did you pay for them?
Our valley is very rich in a metal called gold...
...which, fortunately for us, is valued very highly in the outside world.
- So, we merely...
- Buy and sell.
Buy and sell...
Pardon me. Exchange.
I see. Gold for ideas.
There's something so simple and naive about all this...
...that I suspect there's been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere.
Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Who?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault.
The first European to find this place and a very great man indeed.
He is responsible for everything you see here.
He built Shangri-La, taught the natives...
...and began our collection of art.
In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
When was all this?
Way back in 1713, I think it was...
...that Father Perrault stumbled into the valley, half-frozen to death.
It was typical of the man that one leg being frozen...
...and there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
He amputated his own leg?
Oddly enough, when he had learned to understand their language...
...the natives told him he could have saved his leg.
It would've healed without amputation.
- They didn't actually mean that?
- Yes. They were very sincere about it, too.
You see, a perfect body in perfect health was the rule here.
They've never known anything different.
What was true for them, they thought would be true for anyone else living here.
Well, is it?
Rather astonishingly so, yes.
Particularly in the case of Father Perrault himself.
When he and the natives had finished building Shangri-La...
...he was 108 years old and still very active...
...in spite of having only one leg.
108 and still active?
You're startled.
No, I'm just a little bowled over, that's all.
Forgive me.
I should've told you it's quite common here to live to a very ripe old age.
Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say.
But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live.
In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression:
"He worried himself to death," or, "This thing or that killed him"?
- Very often.
- And very true.
Your lives are, therefore, as a rule, shorter.
Not so much by natural death, as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out.
A little amazing, of course.
You surprise me.
I surprise you! Now, that's news.
I mean your amazement.
I could've understood it in any of your companions, but you...
...who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds.
Or is it that you fail to recognise one of your own dreams when you see it?
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go on being amazed...
- ... in moderation, of course.
- Then everything's quite all right?
It's terrific!
I just saw something that'd make your hair stand on end.
You see those hills over there? Gold.
Popping right out of them. Tons of it.
You keep this under your hat.
If the others hear about it, they'll declare themselves in.
But if I can mine that stuff,
I'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street.
Now look, I've got a plan and if l...
Say, honey...
...you ain't feeling so well, are you?
Don't pay attention to what those doctors tell you.
I've seen a lot of people fool 'em.
And I've got a hunch this place is gonna be good for you. Honest I have.
Come on, you be a good kid and snap out of it.
And I'll cut you in on the gold deal.
I'm going up and make a deal with Chang right now.
Oh, my!
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Conway.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Would you like to take a ride?
- No, thanks. Not just now.
Well, I think I'll take that ride.
Fossils! Why? What for?
Running around digging up a lot of old bones.
You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance?
You seem gay. Did you find out anything?
I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours if he's got any manners.
- Nothing about the porters yet?
- Porters?
We've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.
Guess we'll never know why we're here or how long we'll be held prisoners.
Hurry up, you slowpokes. I'm starved.
"Please, do not wait for me.
"I eat so very little. "
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'm glad to see us all finally organised.
Okay, handsome.
Dish it out and make it snappy.
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing. Why?
You look beautiful.
That's unkind.
Miss Stone always looks beautiful.
I got it. It's your make-up.
You've got none on.
Honey, you look a million percent better.
Wholesome, kind of, and clean.
Take a tip from me, don't ever put that stuff on your face again.
It's like hiding behind a mask.
Who're you to talk about a mask?
What do you mean?
You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Have I?
Strange, you've never told us anything about yourself.
Who are you, anyway?
Why not take your mask off for once?
Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.
All right, I will.
I'll let my hair down.
Why not?
It can't make any real difference now.
Lovey...
- ... were you ever chased by the police?
- Certainly not!
Believe me, it's no fun.
When you picked me up at Baskul, they were on my tail for a year.
The police?
Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Chalmers Bryant?
Bryant Utilities. That's me.
I knew it.
I knew I had a reason for hating you.
Sir, you're a thief!
He never stole from you, did he?
I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities
I bought with money...
...l'd saved for 20 years, teaching school.
Now, I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares.
My whole foundation. Now look at me.
The nerve you have sitting there, talking about it so calmly.
The swindler of thousands of people.
That's what makes the whole thing so funny.
A guy like me, starts out in life as a plumber.
An ordinary, everyday slew-footed plumber.
And by the use of a little brains, he builds up a gigantic institution.
Employs thousands of people.
Becomes a great civic leader.
Then the crash comes.
Overnight, he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
You're a thief and a swindler...
...and I'll be glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
"When we get back! "
What makes you think we'll ever get back?
You're all prisoners here.
We were kidnapped and brought here and nobody knows why.
I don't want to be a prisoner.
I'm finding out when we're leaving here.
I'll make that Chinese talk if it's the last thing I do.
Where's Chang?
Where's Chang or I'll blow your brains out?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let me go.
Come here!
Come here, you!
You idiot!
Had to sock him?
- Let me up.
- You all right?
Sorry.
Is it true about us being kidnapped?
I say, is it true about us being kidnapped?
Mr. Chang!
Do you mind stepping in here for a moment?
Won't you sit down?
You have been very kind to us and we appreciate it.
But for some reason we're being held prisoners here...
...and we want to know why.
Personally, I don't mind at all.
I'm enjoying every minute of it.
But my brother is not of the same opinion, nor are the others.
It's time we were told what it's all about.
We want to know why we were kidnapped, why we're being kept here...
...but most important of all, do we get the porters and when?
Until we get this information...
...l'm very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room.
You know, it's very strange...
...but when you saw me in the corridor,
I was actually on my way to you.
I bring the most amazing news.
The High Lama wishes to see you.
- The High Lama? Who in blazes is he?
- I thought you ran this joint.
High lamas or low lamas, do we get the porters?
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
- Don't believe him.
- Sounds like a stall to me.
- Better have him talk...
- One moment.
You say the High Lama's the only one who can give us information?
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything.
Then he's the man I want to see.
Will you come along?
Better wait here until I get back.
We'll soon know where we stand.
Good evening.
Please, come in.
Sit here, near me.
I'm an old man and can do no one any harm.
Are you the High Lama?
Yes.
I trust you've been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much.
But my friends do not care for this mystery.
They are determined to leave as soon as...
It's astonishing and incredible, but...
What is it, my son?
You're the man.
Chang told me. You're the first who...
Two hundred years ago.
You're still alive, Father Perrault.
Sit down, my son.
You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours...
...for a great many years.
Not of Conway, the empire builder and public hero.
I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books said:
"There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal. "
That Conway seemed to belong here.
In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
That I be brought here?
Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
The girl at the piano?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you.
As have we all.
Of course, I've suspected that our being here was no accident.
Furthermore, I have a feeling we're never supposed to leave.
But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly.
I'll meet that when it comes.
What particularly interests me at present is why was I brought here?
What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
We need men like you here...
...to be sure that our community will continue to thrive.
In return for which
Shangri-La has much to give you.
You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man.
Yet in the normal course of existence...
...you can expect 20 or 30 years...
...of gradually diminishing activity.
Here, however, in Shangri-La...
...by our standards, your life has just begun.
And may go on and on.
To be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me.
It would have to have a point.
I sometimes doubted whether life itself has any.
If that is so, then long life must be even more pointless.
I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
We have reason.
It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La.
It came to me in a vision...
...long ago.
I saw all the nations strengthening...
...not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy.
I saw their machine power multiplying...
...until a single-weaponed man might match a whole army.
I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder...
...would rage so hotly over the world...
...that every book, every treasure would be doomed to destruction.
This vision was so vivid and so moving...
...that I determined to gather together all things of beauty...
...and culture that I could and preserve them here...
...against the doom toward which the world is rushing.
Look at the world today.
Is there anything more pitiful?
What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership.
A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other...
...compelled by an orgy of greed and brutality.
The time must come, my friend...
...when this orgy will spend itself.
When brutality and the lust for power...
...must perish by its own sword.
Against that time is why I avoided death and am here...
...and why you were brought here.
For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life.
And it is our hope that they may find it here.
For here, we shall be with their books...
...and their music and the way of life...
...based on one simple rule:
Be kind.
When that day comes...
...it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La...
...will spread throughout the world.
Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other...
...the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled...
...and the meek shall inherit the earth.
I understand you, Father.
You must come again, my son.
Good night.
Well?
- What did you find out?
- We thought you were never coming back.
- When do we leave?
- What about the porters?
Porters?
- Didn't you find out about the porters?
- Why, I'm sorry, but l...
What were you doing all this time?
What's the matter with you?
You went there...
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Hello.
Good morning.
"Lay thee down now, and rest
"May thy slumber be blessed
"Lullaby, and good night
"Thy mother's delight
"Bright angels around
"My darling shall sound
"They will guard thee from harm"
Do you mind?
"They will guard thee from harm
"Thou shall wake in my arms"
This is Mr. Conway, children.
Good morning, Mr. Conway.
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.
Children, Teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon.
So, school's dismissed.
Please.
I hope you're not going to run away this time.
My name's Sondra.
I hope you'll forgive me for...
You know, each time I see you,
I hear that music.
What is it?
You mean my pigeons.
It's these little flutes that I attached to their tails. See?
Come along with me and I'll show you how I put them on.
This is how we tie them on.
By varying the size of the flutes,
I can get any notes I wish.
The wind does the rest.
Here's a little fellow who has lost his.
- Was this your idea?
- Yes.
Hold this pigeon.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you?
What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
- That was easy. I'd read your books.
- You've read my books?
You do more things.
What have my books got to do with it?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
"A man whose life was empty. "
I know, it was full of this and full of that.
But you were accomplishing nothing.
You were going nowhere and you knew it.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
"A little boy whistling... "
Do you realise that there was a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai...
...smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings...
...waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London.
Do you know right now there are headlines shrieking the news...
...that Conway's missing? Does that look like a man who's life was empty?
Yes.
You're absolutely right.
I had to come to a pigeon house in
Shangri-La to find the only other person...
...who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I only brought you here to show you my pigeons.
Don't worry about them.
Now you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet.
I've so many questions I'd like to ask,
I don't know where to begin.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here.
- That I was born here.
- Thank you.
Well, I was almost born here.
It took place in that wild country beyond the pass.
My parents were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered for a year.
When Chang found us only father and I were alive.
He was too weak to climb the pass.
He died on the way.
I was brought up by Father Perrault.
I envy you.
- I talked to him last night.
- I know.
I can't quite get used to this age thing.
I'm 30.
You're going to make life very simple.
It's inconceivable.
- What?
- All of it.
Father Perrault and his magnificent history.
This place, hidden away from the rest of the world...
...with its glorious concepts.
And now you come along and confuse me entirely.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light.
Why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
On the contrary, you're not strange.
And that in itself is confusing.
I had the same idea about Shangri-La.
The sense I've been here before, that I belonged here.
I'm so glad.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow...
...familiar.
The very air that I breathe. The lamasery...
...with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley...
...while its head explores the eternal.
All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you...
...all somehow are familiar.
I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will.
A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably.
With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend.
Why? Can you tell me why?
Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
- I wonder.
- I'm sure of it.
Just as I am sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart.
I've never seen the outside world, but I understand there are many people...
...who are supposed to be mean and greedy.
I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot...
...where there is peace and security.
Where there's beauty and comfort.
Where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy.
I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
I don't know why I associate with you,
Mr. Barnard or Mr. Chalmers Bryant...
...or Mr. Embezzler, or whatever your name may be.
- Just call me Barney.
- Barney? Why should I?
Never, we have nothing in common.
What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley.
Why did I allow you to drag me here?
You don't know anything about these people.
We're not even armed.
They're very nice people, except that they've got horns.
- Horns?
- You know.
Horns.
What kind of horns?
Come on. They won't hurt you.
All I want is a glass of wine.
- Thanks.
- Sit down.
Now this is fine. This is swell.
No, thanks, just a drink.
I've been walking and I'm a little thirsty.
That's all right.
I just don't happen to be very hungry.
All I asked for was a glass of wine.
Look here, I've got to have some help with this.
Where is Lovey?
Look!
Mr. Barnard!
Come here!
I asked for a glass of wine, look what I got.
Come on, sit down.
This is where you are.
I might have known.
- No wonder you couldn't hear me.
- Relax and have a glass of wine.
- Sit down!
- And be poisoned out here in the open?
- Won't you please have a glass of wine?
- I never drink wine, in the daytime.
- There you are.
- This doesn't obligate me in any way.
No.
The bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
And then the mama bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
And then the big papa bear, he roared:
"And somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
You have to admit, the poor little bears were in a quandary.
Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed.
Come on, Lovey.
- They were in a quandary.
- Come on, Lovey.
Why, "Come on" all the time?
What's the matter, you going to be a fuss-budget all your life?
Drink it up. Aren't you having any fun?
- Where was I?
- In a quandary.
I'm telling this story.
The poor little bears...
...they didn't know what to do.
Somebody had been sleeping in their beds.
Who slept in their beds?
Who was it, Lovey?
You called me "Lovey"?
Look at those eyes.
There's the devil in those eyes.
"Here we go gathering nuts in May
"Here we go gathering nuts in May
Early on Tuesday morning
"Here we go, Shangri-La, Shangri-La
"Here you are in Shangri-La"
Hello, Maria.
You promised to come for tea yesterday.
I waited for so long.
Sorry.
- I haven't got any cigarettes left.
- I'll make some for you.
You will come today?
Perhaps.
Please say you will.
The days are very long and lonely without you.
Please.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
You'll tell me the things
I want to know, right?
Who's in charge? Why we were kidnapped and what will happen to us?
Chang's been lying about those porters, hasn't he?
Beautiful.
- I'm waiting for the bump.
- "Bump"?
When the plane lands at Shanghai and wakes us all up.
You see. It's not a dream.
I sometimes think that the other is the dream.
The outside world.
- Have you never wanted to go there?
- Goodness, no!
From what you tell me, it doesn't sound very attractive.
It's not so bad really.
Some phases of it are sordid, of course.
That's only to be expected.
Why?
Usual reasons.
- A world of people struggling for existence.
- Struggling? Why?
Everyone naturally wants to make a place for himself.
- Accumulate a nest egg and so on.
- Why?
If you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere.
- And don't ask me why.
- I was just going to.
It's the most annoying word in the English language.
Ever hear a child torture his parent with it?
"Mother's darling mustn't stuff her fingers in the salad bowl. "
"Why?"
"Because it isn't ladylike to do that. "
"Why?"
"That's what forks are made for, darling. "
- "Why, Mother?"
- "Mother read it in a book somewhere.
"If Mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers...
"... out of the salad bowl this instant,
Mother's going to wring her little neck. "
- Would you like to wring my little neck?
- I'd love it.
Why?
I'm sorry.
I've thought about it for years.
I knew you'd come.
And I knew when you did, you'd never leave.
Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Forgiven.
When we were on that plane...
...I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it.
That silly shadow...
...racing along over mountains and valleys...
...covering 10 times the distance of the plane.
Yet always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed.
I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane...
...and I'm that silly shadow.
That all my life,
I've been rushing up and down hills...
...leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles...
...never dreaming that one day, that beautiful thing in flight...
...could land on this earth and into my arms.
This place is amazing.
That marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent.
I've looked around. I've seen everything.
Your woodworkers and your cloth weavers are all so happy.
You may not know it, but right here you have Utopia.
- You're very kind.
- I don't mean it in that sense.
I only give credit where credit is due.
I'm very anxious to have you realise that I never for a moment believed...
...that ridiculous kidnapping story.
- I'm so glad.
- Simply preposterous.
Do you know what I did last night?
I held a sort of a self inventory.
I said to myself last night,
"Lovey, Mr. Lovett... "
- I said, "You are an ungrateful fool. "
- No.
Those are my very words to myself last night.
"These people here are doing everything to make your stay comfortable...
"... and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation. "
What would you like to do?
I thought with your permission and while I'm waiting for these porters...
...l'd like to organise classes for the children in the valley...
...and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
- Splendid.
- Isn't it?
I was a professor for 20 years.
- And a very good one.
- I'm sure you were.
- When would you like to start?
- Immediately.
Then it's done.
Thank you.
You get the idea?
From this reservoir here,
I can pipe the whole works.
I'm going to get a kick out of this.
It's just to keep my hand in.
With the equipment we have here...
...I can put a plumbing system in the whole village. Rig it up in no time.
Do you realise those people are still going to the well for water?
- It's unbelievable.
- Think of it! In times like these!
What about that gold deal?
- Gold, you know...
- Oh, that.
That can wait.
Nobody's going to run off with it.
I've got to get busy.
I want to show this layout to Chang.
- Don't you take any wooden nickels.
- All right.
You're acting like a child.
You haven't talked for two weeks.
There's nothing to say.
- I'm afraid that does it.
- I'm afraid it does.
Shall we have another?
Not tonight, if you don't mind.
Come in, my dear.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here.
Excuse me.
Charming, isn't she?
Yes. Charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Why not?
She's an attractive young woman.
Young? She arrived here in 1888.
She was 20 at the time.
She was on her way to join her betrothed...
...when her carriers lost their way in the mountain.
The party would've perished, but for meeting some of our people.
Amazing. Still doesn't look over 20.
When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Suppose she should leave?
Leave Shangri-La?
That's not likely.
You couldn't drive her out.
I mean her appearance.
If she should leave the valley, what would happen?
She'd quickly revert in appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.
How old are you?
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves.
Each time you Westerners...
...celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
There you are! You're just the man
I'm looking for. A fine trick.
Smart, aren't you? What lies you told us about those porters!
The minute they arrive we can leave, if they'd take us.
- But you know you'd tell 'em not to.
- My dear boy...
You've been lying since we arrived.
It's worked for some people.
Because they lack the courage to do something. But not me.
You're up against the wrong man.
I'll leave, even if I have to blow this place into the valley.
I'll get out, porters or no porters!
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey.
He could never get through that country alive.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide.
Yes, of course your brother is a problem.
It was to be expected.
I knew you'd understand.
That's why I came to you for help.
You must not look to me for help.
Your brother is no longer my problem.
He is now your problem.
Mine?
Because, my son,
I'm placing in your hands...
...the future and destiny of Shangri-La...
...for I am going to die.
I knew my work was done, when I first set eyes upon you.
I've waited for you, my son, for a long time.
I've sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers.
I've looked into their eyes and heard their voices...
...always in hope that I might find you.
My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath...
...for our order knows only silken bonds.
To be gentle and patient.
To care for the riches of the mind.
To preside in wisdom...
...while the storm rages without.
Do you think this will come in my time?
You, my son, will live through the storm.
You will preserve the fragrance of our history...
...and add to it a touch of your own mind.
Beyond that, my vision weakens.
But I see at a great distance...
...a new world stirring in the ruins...
...stirring clumsily...
...but in hopefulness...
...seeking its lost and legendary treasures...
...and they will all be here, my son.
Hidden behind the mountains...
...in the Valley of the Blue Moon...
...preserved as by a miracle.
We run the pipes through here and connect with the main waterline here.
Where are you going to get pipes?
That's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
There you are. You'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
- Leaving?
- The porters are taking us back.
We've got clothing, food, everything.
When are you going to start?
This very minute.
They're waiting for us on the plateau.
That Chinaman thought he could stop me.
Come along.
I think I'll stick around.
I'll leave with the porters on the next trip.
You mean you don't want to go?
Well, I'm...
You're afraid of going to jail.
You see I've got this plumbing business.
If you insist being an idiot,
I won't coax you. How about you?
You don't want to go yet, honey.
She'll stick around, too. That right?
If you want me to.
Sure. Don't you worry.
I'll take care of you.
All right, suit yourself, but just remember you had your chance.
- How about you? Do you want to go?
- Where?
Home. I've got porters to take us back.
I'm sorry. That's impossible.
I have my classes.
I don't care what you've started.
Do you want to go?
No, I think I'd better wait.
- Yes, I'll wait.
- You'll wait until you rot!
- Hello, Gloria.
- Hello.
I've just finished translating an interesting old tablet.
It told me of the origin of the Masonic symbols...
- That's swell.
- What?
I want to show you something.
Isn't that pretty. What is it?
Plumbing. Everything modern.
I'm going to run pipes all through the village.
Hello, George.
You can stop worrying now.
I've made arrangements to leave.
If you let me close that window,
I can talk to you.
That noise is driving me crazy.
I said we're getting out of here.
Back to civilisation.
I made a deal with the porters.
They're leaving tomorrow at dawn.
They're waiting for us outside the valley.
Get your things together.
- Where's your topcoat?
- You can't leave.
What's going to stop me?
- You've got to stay here now.
- Stay here?
What's the matter with you?
You've acted strangely since we came.
I've never seen you like this.
What's stopping us from leaving?
Something grand and beautiful.
Something I've been searching for all my life.
The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime.
I've found it and I can't leave it.
You mustn't either.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're carrying around a secret that's eating you up.
- Tell me about it.
- I want to tell you.
I'll burst with it if I don't.
It's weird and fantastic and unbelievable...
...but so beautiful. As you know, we were kidnapped and brought here...
And that's the whole story.
He died, as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow. His last words were:
"I place in your hands, my son...
"... the future and destiny of Shangri-La. "
Now you know why I can't leave.
I really don't know what to say.
- Except that you must be completely mad.
- You think I'm mad?
What else can I think after a tale like that?
Things like that don't happen today.
- We're living in the 20th century.
- You think it's nonsense?
You've been hypnotised by fanatics.
I wouldn't believe it in England.
Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?
How do you know these things are true?
- Did they show you proof?
- I don't need proof.
I knew there was a reason why I hated this place.
I'd love to fly over it with bombs for what they've done to you.
All this talk about lamas being hundreds of years old.
How do you know?
Did you see their birth certificates?
I can't believe it.
A bunch of old men sit around and dream about reforming the world...
...and you, two-feet-on-the-ground Conway, want to join them.
It's horrible.
Is that all my story meant to you?
What else could it mean to me?
It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Then you'd better go.
This is no place for you.
It's no place for you.
Think of what's waiting for you.
Do you want to stay here till you're half dead?
Till your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.
- You've got to talk.
And me?
They stole the plane to bring you here.
I didn't want to come.
You owe me some responsibility.
I'm tired of owing you things.
You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's that girl.
- That girl has twisted and turned...
- That's enough. Never mind the girl.
Why don't you go?
Look here.
Ever since I can remember you've looked after me.
Now, you're the one that needs looking after.
I'm your brother.
If there's something wrong with you...
...let me help you.
I don't feel like making that trip alone.
You couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad.
I may be wrong. I may be a maniac...
...but I believe in this and I'm not going to lose it.
You know how much I want to help you...
...but this is bigger, stronger if you like, than brotherly love.
I'm sorry. I'm staying.
I can't think of anything more to say.
Goodbye.
Are you sure the porters will take care of you?
It's all set.
- Maria made the arrangements.
- Maria?
- The little Russian girl.
- How's she involved?
- She's going with me.
- You're crazy.
- You can't take her away from here.
- Why not?
You can't. Do you know what will happen if she leaves Shangri-La?
She's fragile and can only live where fragile things are loved.
Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
What do you mean,
"Fade away like an echo"?
She came here in 1888.
This'd be funny, if it weren't so pathetic.
She isn't a day over 20.
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. She told me so.
Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me.
I'd know anyway.
I found out a lot of things last night.
I'm not ashamed of it.
It's one of the few decent things...
...that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Everyone is happy in Shangri-La.
Nobody would ever think of leaving.
It's all just rot!
She's pleaded with me since I came to take her away from this place.
She's cried in my arms, for fear I'd leave her here.
She's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters. For me!
I don't believe a word of it.
All right, I'll prove it to you.
You've believed everything they're told you without proof. I'll prove my story.
Come in a minute.
I've got some bad news for you.
My brother and I've decided we can't take you along.
You can't take me?
You promised to take me with you!
It's all your fault.
It was all arranged until he spoke to you.
Why can't you leave us alone?
- You want to leave Shangri-La?
- I'll die if I have to stay another minute.
I've waited a long time for this chance and you're not going to stop me now.
If I have to, I'll go alone.
I brought the porters.
If it weren't for me, you'd never get out.
The High Lama told them not to take anyone.
The High Lama!
Who pays any attention to him?
The porters laugh at the High Lama.
They only want to know how much gold he'll give.
I gave them more gold.
I've been stealing it for a year.
I'd do anything to leave this place.
To leave the High Lama, who calls himself Father Perrault.
He's been insane for years.
- Father Perrault is dead.
- He's dead! That's fine.
You won't see me shedding any tears over him.
You must take me with you.
Aren't you afraid to leave?
You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman?
- Chang told you that, didn't he?
- Yes.
I thought so.
He tells everyone I'm old.
He wants them to stay away from me.
He gets mad when anyone comes near me.
He's punished me for every minute
I've spent with George.
If it weren't for him, I'd have left long ago.
But he always stops me.
Six months ago I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room.
I nearly went crazy.
Look at me! Do I look like an old woman?
Is this the skin of an old woman?
Look into my eyes.
Are these the eyes of an old woman?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were.
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.
She's lying.
You're lying.
Every word you've been saying is a lie.
Say it! You're lying, aren't you?
No, I'm not lying.
What reason could I have for lying?
Chances are we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive.
But I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm, be buried alive...
...than to stay here one more minute.
- You say the porters are waiting for us?
- Yes.
- Clothes?
- Yes, everything.
What about the others?
I've asked them.
They're afraid to make the trip.
We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Come on, we're wasting time.
- Are you taking me?
- Certainly. Come on.
It won't be long before we're in London.
Can't you just see everyone when we pop in out of the blue?
We'll have them breathless when we tell them our story.
You had me worried for a while.
I thought you were gone completely.
Lucky for me you snapped out of it.
You saved my life.
- I never could have made it alone.
- What was that?
- I was saying...
- Shut up! Must you go on babbling?
- What's happened? Where's Bob?
- He's going, my child.
- Going?
- But he will return.
No!
I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore.
I've got to rest.
How long is this going to go on?
I can't stand it.
Can't you get them to wait for us?
They're leaving us farther behind every day.
There's nothing that would suit 'em more than to lose us, but we must go on.
- Come on, darling.
- I can't. You've got to let me rest.
Target practice again.
One of these days they're going to hit us.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe. Come now.
Look at her face!
"Dropping from nowhere after a year! "
- Cable from Gainsford.
- Read it!
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria.
"Conway can tell nothing of his experiences.
"Is suffering from complete loss of memory. " Signed, Gainsford.
- "Loss of memory"?
- All right, give it to the press.
- All of it?
- Yes. Might as well all of it.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Conway's gone again.
Listen to this, from Gainsford.
Let me have it.
"Aboard S.S. Manchuria.
"Last night Conway recovered his memory.
Talked about Shangri-La.
"Telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet.
"Insisted upon returning there at once.
"Locked him in, but he escaped and jumped ship at Singapore.
"I'm leaving ship to overtake him, as fearful of his condition.
"Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La, which I am forwarding.
"Lord Gainsford. "
Here's Gainsford now.
- It's good to see you back.
- Glad to see you.
- It's good to see you again.
- Thought you would never come.
- Sit down. Have a drink.
- Scotch and soda. I'm parched.
Here you are. Ready and waiting.
- Any news of Conway?
- We're eager to know what you discovered.
Where is he?
Gentlemen, you see before you a very weary old man...
...who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly 10 months.
You never caught up with him?
Since that night he jumped off the ship, till two weeks ago...
- ... l've been missing him by inches.
- You don't mean it.
- Was he that determined to get back?
- Determined?
Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life,
I've never encountered anything so grim.
During those last 10 months, that man has done the most astounding things.
He learned how to fly, stole a plane, got caught, put in jail, escaped...
...in an amazingly short space of time.
This is only the beginning of his adventure.
He begged and fought, pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier.
Everywhere I heard these amazing stories of the man's adventures.
Positively astounding. Till eventually...
...I trailed him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.
Of course, he had already gone.
But his memory...
His memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives.
"The man who was not human," they called him.
They won't forget the stranger who tried six times...
...to climb a mountain pass that no other human being dared to travel.
And six times was forced back by the severest storms.
They won't forget the madman who stole their food and clothing.
Who they locked up in their barracks and who fought six guards to escape.
Their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him...
...and shuddering at the memory.
He led them the wildest chase through their own country.
Finally, he disappeared over that very mountain pass...
...that they themselves dared not travel.
And that, gentlemen...
...was the last that any known human being saw of Robert Conway.
That's what I call fortitude.
- Think of it.
- Tell me something, Gainsford.
What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it?
Yes. I believe it.
I believe it, because I want to believe it.
I give you a toast.
Here's my hope...
...that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La.
Here's my hope...
...that we all find our Shangri-La.
A rotten night under foot.
It's a rotten night overhead.
Ah, it's a rotten night every night this winter.
I hear the Amateur
Cracksman is at it again.
"Amateur Cracksman" my eye.
What's the good of giving him all these fancy names?
He's a common burglar. Why don't they call him a common burglar?
He ain't no common burglar.
He's an uncommon burglar.
He's getting to be a popular hero.
Well, hero or no hero.
We'll nab him yet.
They all get nabbed sooner or later.
Spring.
Spring fever.
- Peaceful disease.
Very peaceful.
Extra special! Read about the Amateur Cracksman!
Paper, Guvnor? Paper?
- No.
Read about the robbery at the British Museum.
Hear that?
The amateur cracksman again.
Won't he ever let up?
Ha.
It's blokes like him that ruin the business for blokes like us.
[ Doorbell ]
Good evening, Mr Bunny.
Is Mr Raffles in?
- No, sir.
When do you expect him back?
You know Mr Raffles, sir.
I've got to see him, Barraclough.
I've got to see him.
Forgive me asking, sir.
But trouble, sir?
- Yes.
Anything that I can do, sir?
- Not if you don't know where he is.
I wish I did, sir but ..
- Well, I'll wait for him.
I will just sit here and wait.
Oh, I shouldn't worry, Mr Bunny.
You couldn't be in any trouble ..
That Mr Raffles won't get you out of.
But you don't know what a fool I've been, Barraclough.
Such a fool.
Had enough?
Dancing?
Tired?
Of dancing?
Let's talk.
What about?
You.
Good.
Here is Gwen to look after, father.
Come, Priscilla. Let's dance.
Sit down Gwen, my dear.
Sit down, Raffles.
Be gay.
I ought to be gay.
By George, that's a .. that's a pretty woman over there. Do I know her?
Go over and find out, Lord Melrose.
- Yes. A good idea. I will.
Yes, yes, yes.
Ah, well, well.
Now. Go on about me.
I love you.
That's nice.
But I ..
I tell you that so often.
I rather like to hear it.
Why won't you take me seriously, huh?
What makes you think I don't?
- Hello, Gwen.
Hello Raffles. How is cricket?
- Fine.
Why aren't you in training?
- Oh, I shall be.
England has need of you.
I did. I did know her.
Hello my dear. How are you?
- Hello.
Surprised to see you in town.
Yes, I wish my children had left me in the country with their mother.
I don't like late hours.
I don't like London.
I don't like black cabs.
Waiter.
Have dinner next week?
- Love to.
Bring him.
I'm mad about him.
So am I.
Bye-bye. So long, Gwen.
- So long.
Cheerio, old boy.
- Bye.
What was that you just said?
Didn't you hear?
Marry me?
Why not?
- Oh, darling.
What's that?
I'm going to marry Mr Raffles.
Gwen dear, how thrilling.
- Isn't it marvellous.
Splendid, Raffles.
Are you pleased, Lord Melrose?
- Delighted.
Splendid. Fine fellow.
Top hole cricketer.
I would drink your health if I could get some more champagne.
Waiter.
Nasty stuff. My wife lives on it.
All bubbles and froth. No taste.
Well, that's right. Fill it up.
Well, bless you my children.
Thank you, sir.
Barraclough.
I say, Barraclough.
Barraclough, where are you?
Yes, sir?
- Here.
Have a watch.
A watch, sir?
- You're a stout fellow, Barraclough.
You've been a good servant and
I want you to have my watch.
Well.
A watch, anyway.
Thank you, sir.
I want you to have the chain too.
- Thank you, sir.
Get me a whiskey and soda, will you.
Where is that file of mine?
I'm turning over a new leaf, Barraclough.
More new leaves than you ever heard of.
You think I'm crazy but this is the sanest thing I've ever done.
I'm a different man from now on.
You don't know what it means and it's just as well you don't.
But I'll let you in on half of it, Barraclough.
I'm going to be married.
To the loveliest creature on God's green earth.
The loveliest creature, Barraclough.
- I am delighted to hear that, sir.
Thank you, Barraclough.
And Lady Melrose.
In you go with the lot of them.
I'm starting a new life tonight, Barraclough.
Here's to it.
- Yes, sir. By all means, sir.
Very fine, sir.
But Mr Bunny, sir?
What about Mr Bunny? Let's get Mr Bunny here. He should join in the celebration.
He is here, sir.
- Here? Where?
In the spare room, sir.
Well, why didn't you tell me? Say Bunny.
Have a cigarette case too.
Bunny.
Well, there's no-one here, Barraclough.
- That's very odd, sir.
He said he'd spend the night here, sir.
He can't have gone out, sir.
Why, there is his coat, sir.
Great Scott, Barraclough.
Do you smell ..?
Gas, sir.
- Bunny, Bunny!
Bunny. Good heavens!
Get him up.
Get the window open.
- Yes.
Lend a hand.
Is he dead, sir?
- No, thank heaven. We were in time.
I can't think.
He was behaving strangely, but I never dreamed ..
0pen the window. Give him some air.
Bunny. Wake up, Bunny.
Bunny. Bunny.
Wake up old man, it's Raffles.
- Shall I get doctor, sir?
No, no. Wait.
Wait. He's coming round.
We don't want any outsiders in on this.
Get some whiskey.
Bunny.
Raffles.
Bunny. My dear Bunny, what in heaven's name were you thinking of?
I'm a thief.
Well, way or another we're all thieves at times.
Quiet now.
I can't. I must talk. I must tell you.
- Quiet, quiet.
That's all, Barraclough.
He's alright now. You can go.
Yes, sir.
Now. Tell me.
I've written a cheque, Raffles.
A big cheque and it's no good.
What made you do it?
- Cards.
Yes. I've been playing again.
I know I promised you I wouldn't.
On Monday morning Raffles, when they get that cheque at the bank.
I'll be disgraced.
They'll treat me like a common cheat and I am a common cheat.
Now, now, Bunny.
They might even arrest me, Raffles.
Now Bunny, you know I'll never let them do anything like that to you.
I'm not asking you to help me.
I'm not worth helping.
Supposing you let me be the best judge of that, hmm?
I don't deserve your friendship.
I know what honesty and honour mean to you.
I got myself into this mess.
Let me get out of it.
Now Bunny, I will do no such thing. Keep quiet, now.
Now take it easy.
That's better.
Tell me, how much was the cheque?
A thousand pounds.
A thousand?
Whee.
Hmm.
Two days isn't much time to find a thousand pounds.
Well, don't you worry, Bunny.
You keep quiet and let me think.
We'll have to use our wits.
Our wits?
I should say "my wits".
Oh, Bunny.
- Yes?
Didn't you say that you were going down to Melrose House tomorrow?
I was, yes.
Would you ..
Could you take me with you?
Yes.
Why?
I was just thinking I would like to play some cricket.
Oh, that's easy.
Easy?
Easy.
Come on, Mr Raffles.
Let's have the hat-trick.
Knock out his stumps Mr Raffles.
Oh, he's some cricketer.
Well it didn't take him long to get rid of me.
Not long, old boy.
Well, what about a drink?
Might as well. It will soon be over now.
Well darling, you're just in time to see me bat.
To see you bat?
We came to see Mr Raffles.
Didn't we darlings.
Here, take Whiskey and Soda.
Put them somewhere near me.
And give me those glasses.
I want to see this Mr Raffles.
You're in now, father.
- Oh, Lord. Well, I ..
I'm sorry, darling.
I don't see anyone so very remarkable.
That's Raffles by the far wicket with Bunny.
Oh.
Oh.
Well, like a lamb to the slaughter I go.
Did you say lamb, Harry dear?
Well, mutton if you like, darling.
And take care not to get overheated.
Overheated? Ha.
I like that. Ha-ha.
Overheated indeed.
Up through the lips and over the gums.
Look out stomach, here it comes.
Well I declare, look who's coming in.
It's His Lordship.
Easy, easy Mr Raffles. Easy.
Are you ready for him, Mr Raffles?
Give him the best you've got, Mr Raffles.
Good old Raffles.
I'll let the old boy get a run on this and then finish things off with you.
I say, Raffles.
You make me look like a fool.
Sorry Bunny, but I've had about enough of this.
Give me ..
Give me middle and leg.
Middle and leg, Milord?
- Yes.
Off a little.
What?
- Off a little more.
That's it, Milord. Middle and leg.
Right.
Why does he keep saying
"middle and leg"?
Don't yo see mother? He wants the umpire to give him middle and leg.
Middle and leg?
Does he want more middle and leg?
Why, he's nothing but middle and leg.
Are you ready, Milord?
- Wait. Wait.
Will you tell your father to come away from there instantly.
He looks perfectly ridiculous.
Let's get on with it.
Now then. Ready.
Play.
Did you see that, Kitty?
Mother, do look at father.
My dear, I've been looking at him for the last thirty years.
Oh look, there is Bunny batting.
He'll get this one alright.
This one. This will win the game.
Magnificent bowling.
Come and play for us again, Mr Raffles.
Oh, I think it was great fun.
I hope to come again.
Lady Melrose asks for Mr Raffles.
Thank you all.
This is Mr Raffles.
Well young man, you've given me a great deal of pleasure this afternoon.
Thank you Lady Melrose.
Do you like cricket?
I don't care tuppence about it.
But I have entirely lost my heart to you.
So there.
Well Kitty, did you see me make my run?
I thought I told you not to get overheated.
Mr Raffles, will you kindly see me to my car?
Certainly, Lady Melrose.
Harry.
Harry dear, will you see to
Whisky-kins and Soda-kins?
Don't let the darlings overeat themselves.
You too.
[ Singing ]
[ Singing ]
Hey, hey, hey!
Stow it, stow it.
Can't you see that sign there?
"Drink your ale and be quiet."
Let's have one more look at that paper.
Now where is the window with the tree against it?
Here. Second floor and ..
At the end of the long corridor and the old lady's quarters ..
Open right over here.
It looks easy.
Like taking milk from a baby.
It will soon be dark enough.
Come on, let's go.
Don't stay too long over your port.
And be sure to come right back to me in the drawing room.
Nothing dear lady, could tear me from your side tonight.
There's a brave boy.
England is proud of you.
Well, Raffles.
Do you mean to say they
don't play cricket in America?
Ah, the savages wouldn't understand the game.
A gentleman to see Your Lordship.
I can't be bothered now.
Who is it? What is it?
Bless my soul. It's Scotland Yard.
Did you say Scotland Yard?
Well, that's what it says on the card.
"Inspector McKenzie."
What on earth does
Scotland Yard want here?
Lord Melrose, I can't possibly conceive.
Well, you had better tell him ..
Tell him to come in.
Lord Melrose.
Inspector McKenzie?
My business is brief and confidential.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
No. Mr Raffles.
Mr A.J. Raffles.
The cricketer? I recognise him.
Thank you.
You can ..
You can go, both of you.
And ..
Close those doors after you.
And now sir, you can speak freely.
I've come here to inform you that there are burglars in your neighbourhood.
Burglars?
Who have made definite plans to rob this house tonight.
Bless my soul.
- And mine. Don't forget mine.
I say.
- This is jolly.
Rather.
- Burglars?
Burglars?
More particularly, a burglar.
Did you say "a"?
- Aye.
That's not the fellow who calls himself the Amateur Cracksman?
Ha. Who knows about the Amateur Cracksman?
Who knows what he is?
Where he is or who he is?
Now, Inspector. There you raise a very pretty point. I can tell you what he is.
He is a myth. A phantom.
An up-to-date Jack-of-lantern invented by the police.
"Invented", Mr Raffles?
Certainly. Every time
Scotland Yard fails ..
To catch the perpetrator of some decently intelligent theft ..
They blame the Cracksman.
Ah, the Inspector doesn't seem convinced.
Do have a glass of brandy.
No, no.
This is most disturbing.
Lady Melrose is a very timid woman.
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
Come now, Lord Melrose. After all, the burglar hasn't got in yet.
The best thing is to thank the Inspector.
Show him over the possible field of action.
Would you like to take a look round, Inspector?
Why, Mr Raffles couldn't have suggested anything I would like better.
Well, finish your brandy, Raffles.
Come along now. This way.
Now be calm, gentlemen.
And above all things, remember.
Not a word to Lady Melrose.
No, not a word to her.
Ah, we start with the burglar alarm.
After you, Inspector, after you.
Gentlemen, listen if you please.
Now .. there are six bells.
They ring all over the house.
Once the thing is set .. there.
Let anybody try opening a window.
That should do very nicely.
- Quite a musical effect, I would think.
Well, I don't know much about music myself, but I ..
Where on earth do they keep the ashtrays, I wonder?
[ Alarm bell. Loud! ]
Bless my soul. What will Kitty say ..
Come with me, Raffles.
You can quiet her.
Bless my soul, bless my soul.
Don't leave me. I'm fainting.
Now don't be alarmed, my dear.
Don't be alarmed?
I am alarmed.
Who is that man?
This is Inspector McKenzie of Scotland Yard.
Scotland Yard?
What are you keeping from me?
Are the thieves here already?
Are we all to be murdered in our beds?
It's nothing for you to be concerned over, Lady Melrose.
Speak louder, please. I can't hear one word that you say.
I said it is nothing for you to be concerned about.
Certainly it is my business.
He didn't say it wasn't. He only said ..
I heard him distinctly.
Mr Raffles.
I count upon you to protect me.
I shall protect you
Lady Melrose, with my life.
Yes we'll all protect you, Kitty.
Not you.
You frighten me to death with your bells.
With your nonsense.
Bunny, give me that glass of brandy. I need it.
Men of your age drink too much anyway.
Calm yourself, calm yourself.
Who is protecting my bed?
I have not the slightest objection to you young things being murdered.
I have the greatest objection to it to myself.
Mr Raffles, will you help me upstairs?
And send me some more brandy to my room.
Send me no end of brandy.
If I can get enough brandy.
I may be able to embarrass Mr Raffles into staying by my side all night.
And if he will do that I do not care how many burglars come.
The more the merrier.
Now, now. My dear Kitty.
Don't talk such dreadful nonsense.
There is nothing in the house worth stealing but what I've got on.
You must take care of that, Lady Melrose.
What can I do?
How shall I take care of it?
Tell me, Mr Raffles.
I depend upon you. I lean upon you.
Not too heavily, Lady Melrose.
Not too heavily.
Why don't you play some soft music, my dear.
What shall I play?
Anything that will quiet her.
Of course my husband has a safe.
My dear Mr Raffles, but do you believe in safes?
Well, of course if thieves are coming.
The safe is certainly the first place they would go to.
You think of everything, don't you dear Mr Raffles.
Oh, I try to Lady Melrose.
Well.
My necklace does not leave my neck tonight.
Lady Melrose, I believe you are right.
And goodnight, dear lady.
I didn't .. quite catch that, Mr Raffles.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Dear Mr Raffles.
Goodnight.
Over here.
Careful.
Look out.
[ Car engine noises ]
Hey. Who is that?
Now listen.
Darling.
- Gwen, my dear.
You didn't expect me here, did you.
No.
No, I did not.
Well .. aren't you glad I came?
Oh, of course I am glad.
How happen to come here tonight?
It was Bethel's idea to surprise you.
Surprised?
Yes.
Oh, it's Gwen. Well, well.
I'm delighted to see you.
If you can find some way of quieting my good wife.
Hello Gwen.
You don't know what fun we're having.
Gwen dear, you are just in time.
The most thrilling thing has happened.
Yes, your mother doesn't think it's thrilling.
Go to her, Gwen. She loves you and she'll always listen to you.
Lord Melrose, what is it?
You go with her, Ethel. Go on.
Tell her. Tell her all about it.
Go on, go on, go on.
Is she .. is she calmer now?
Quite calm I think.
She is a formidable woman when she is roused.
I hope she sleeps.
There will be the devil to pay if she doesn't.
There is the devil to pay already.
Are you coming in, Raffles?
No. I think I will ..
I will just go outside.
What's on your mind, Mr Raffles?
Oh it's you, Inspector.
Do not let my presence here disturb you.
It isn't your presence disturbing me.
And do not let the burglars disturb you either.
And it isn't the burglars.
You leave me to worry about them.
I'm a match for any burglar that ever lived.
For any burglar?
There is a lot of sentimental nonsense talked about criminals.
They are stupid fellows really.
All of them, Inspector?
I have a very low opinion of the criminal class.
Well, so long as you have a high opinion of the police ..
Do not misunderstand me, Mr Raffles.
I have a high opinion of myself.
You see.
I am a criminologist.
And a Scotsman.
The Scots enjoy feeling they are cleverer than other people.
And they are cleverer.
My own cleverness often amazes me.
That's quite natural,
Inspector. Quite natural.
There is just one thing that I regret.
And what's that?
That you won't have the amateur cracksman here tonight.
What a sight. To see the great
McKenzie face-to-face with him.
We'll meet one of these days, Mr Raffles.
I'll catch the Amateur Cracksman.
I'll hook him.
And play him.
And land him like a fish.
Like a fish, did you say?
I'm a fisherman, Mr Raffles.
- Ah.
Well, it must be a rare sport.
Catching criminals.
I can only think of one rarer.
And what is that?
Dodging you fellows.
Well, you've made me realise that ..
I mustn't let anything disturb me tonight.
Thank you for this expression of your confidence.
Not at all, Inspector.
Not at all.
- Goodnight, Mr Raffles.
I'll leave you to your thoughts.
Goodnight, Inspector.
She's alright now, Lord Melrose.
She only speaks to me through a crack in the door but she's alright.
She gave me this for you lock in the safe.
Thank you, my dear.
- Where is McKenzie?
There you are.
Where is my famous cricketer?
- Raffles?
He's gone out for a breath of air.
You blokes wait here for me.
I won't be gone five minutes.
Just one big piece, and out.
Where is her room?
See that big tree?
See that window this side of the balcony?
I gets up the tree.
Right into the hall and into the old lady's room.
Ah, it's easy.
- Alright, Guvnor.
We'll be watching and if anybody comes, I'll whistle.
Righto.
- Shush. Quiet.
Oh, that dear Mr Raffles.
Here! What are you doing?
Get on you.
In there.
Now my friend.
We mustn't make a noise.
Or we'll awaken the whole house.
We mustn't have that, must we.
What's your game?
You are going to give me the necklace that you've just taken ..
From this poor defenceless, deaf old lady.
Well.
Strike me pink.
Have you heard anything?
- No, sir.
Now.
If you don't give up the jewels.
I shall kick up such a noise that you will be caught and sent to prison.
On the other hand.
If you give them up quietly.
You only have to make your getaway.
You do see my point don't you?
No .. I don't see it.
Shush.
You see.
The house is not as fast asleep as you thought.
Na.
They are in .. hurry.
They're in. Let's go.
Come on now. Which will it be?
The safe getaway or the police?
Come on now.
We haven't any time to wait.
Good.
And better luck next time.
Come on.
Darling.
I left it open.
You think the wind closed it?
The wind couldn't have locked it.
Great Scott!
[ Alarm bell ]
Quick! Get out, get out!
Break for it, through the house!
Through the triangle.
Here, you men.
Up the stairs.
Let me go, will you.
Hold him there.
- I ain't done nothing.
What a racket! I've never heard such a row in my life.
He's a plucky little blighter.
So that's the little blaggard, is it.
I congratulate you, Inspector.
You were not far wrong.
We are both to be congratulated, Lord Melrose.
He didn't get anything.
But, how did he get in?
Tell us. How did you get in?
None of your business.
None of your ..
What's his name?
You mean Mr Raffles?
Raffles?
So that's him.
Alright.
I won't say nothing.
You will hear from me again though.
Mr Raffles.
Take the little skunk away.
Yes, lock him up there.
I'm sorry, Raffles.
At any rate.
He didn't get the necklace, Lord Melrose.
You have still got that.
Good old Scotland Yard.
[ Telephone ]
Yes?
Get Mr Raffles car ready for the trip to London?
Very good.
Raffles.
I say, Raffles.
Come on down, Mr Raffles.
Hurry up.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Yes, sir?
- I'm going down.
Would you bring my bags and have the car sent around?
Very good, sir.
We are waiting.
- Are you coming?
Here he is.
- Where were you?
What about some tennis?
You and I against Bunny and Ethel.
I'm sorry. I'm going up to town.
To London? You're not.
What for?
I've got some very important business there.
It has to be gotten through before ..
Before tomorrow morning.
- Oh.
Yes, it is important, Gwen.
Well, I'll go up to town with you if you like.
If you like. Get your things together.
I want to talk to Gwen before we leave.
Alright. Come on, Ethel.
- I think it's mean of you.
Darling. What is the matter?
It's a problem.
Rather a difficult one.
Alright.
I'm good at problems.
Come on.
Now.
Tell me.
Well.
A man loves a girl.
She is radiant, straight ..
Fine, untouched.
He isn't worthy of her.
In every possible way he is most unworthy.
But for all that, he loves her.
Well, I ..
I hope she loves him.
She does.
That's the problem.
It isn't a very hard problem.
Oh yes it is. Because you see he wanted to lead a new life for her sake.
He's found that he can't do it.
The taint is still there.
On the first possible excuse he's gone wrong again.
And the excuse was good enough.
I suppose but ..
Just the same.
If she loves him, she must want to help him.
Ah, but he can't disillusion her, don't you see?
Goodbye, Gwen.
Dear.
I'm going away now.
You sound as if you weren't coming back.
I'm not.
Don't say such things.
Gwen my darling, I love you.
I shall always love you.
You've made me realize everything I've lost in life.
But it's too late now.
- Dearest.
Police! Murder! Terror!
What's that?
They robbed me in my sleep.
Don't go yet. I'll be right back.
Lady Melrose, what is it?
Lady Melrose! What is it?
Thieves!
Police! Help! I've been robbed in my sleep.
Help! Gwen! Police!
Mr Raffles.
They've taken my necklace.
They've taken it.    - What?
My necklace.
Why don't you do something?
Will somebody do something?
I want somebody arrested.
Kitty, my dear.
You are all undressed.
Go back to bed at once.
Don't look at her anybody.
You keep away.
It's all your fault.
I might have been murdered.
They found the necklace after all.
- What's that?
It can't be possible.
You've not been robbed.
- I've not been what?
I said you've not been robbed.
I ought to know whether
I've been robbed or not.
That necklace is in the safe.
- What?
Safe. S-A-F-E. Safe.
It's nothing of the sort.
- I put it there myself.
I'll go and get it for you.
You didn't put it there.
You put the case in there.
It wasn't in the case.
Not in the case?
Mr Raffles.
Where is Mr Raffles?
You promised to protect me.
Where were you?
- Yes, where were you?
Where was I when?
Why, when the alarm went off, Mr Raffles.
Where were you then?
Why ..
In my room.
In my room, writing letters.
In your room?
But you were ..
Come. You must take mother up to bed.
Yes. Oh yes, of course.
It's perfectly true, Inspector.
The necklace has gone.
This thing is empty.
I'll give a thousand pounds. A thousand pounds reward. Do you hear me?
To anyone who gets me that necklace back.
Why, that is a very liberal reward, Lord Melrose.
Too liberal.
I'll get the jewels back without it.
Meanwhile, I'd like a word with you in private.
Well, we'll be quite undisturbed in here.
No-one either enters or leaves this house.
Good heavens, Inspector.
- Everyone is under suspicion now.
But I won't have it.
I won't have my guests suspected.
I'll let them just go.
- It's too late for that.
The police are in charge here now.
I'm sorry Lord Melrose but I ..
Is that someone planning to leave now?
Yes. That's Mr Raffles.
He is going to London.
You will be good enough to let him go, Inspector.
Let Mr Raffles go?
Yes.
Why not?
Mr Raffles can go to
London if he wishes.
I've changed my mind.
You are all at liberty to come and go as you like.
Oh, are we? Hmm.
Oh my necklace. He stole my necklace.
Lady Melrose, what ever possessed you not to put your necklace in the safe?
What?
Whatever possessed not to put your necklace in the safe?
It was Mr Raffles idea.
Mr Raffles' idea?
I am certain he meant well, but ..
Oh yes. Yes, I'm sure he meant well.
Excuse me, Lady Melrose.
I've got to speak to him.
Now, you are not to scold him.
I won't have him scolded.
And now I suppose everyone will be leaving?
Yes, and mother is so upset.
- Well, it's not surprising.
Come on, Bunny.
- I'm coming.
You're not going to let them get away, are you?
I've got other plans for Mr Raffles.
You take the burglar Crawshay ..
Out of the village jail.
Take him by aeroplane to London.
When you have got him there, see that he escapes.
Then, follow him.
By Jove, Inspector.
It's not the first time I've set a thief to catch a thief.
So I'll go and see Mr Raffles safely on his way.
Say goodbye to Lord and
Lady Melrose for me, will you.
Of course I will. Yes, rather.
Sorry to run away.
- Goodbye.    - Bye.
Well, goodbye everybody.
- Goodbye, Raffles.
It isn't too late.
I love you.
I love you.
Mr Raffles. I didn't expect you back so soon, sir.
No? Well, one never knows, Barraclough.
Any news? Any letters?
Bills, sir.
A gentleman just called, sir.
- Oh, who?
He didn't give his name, sir.
An elderly gentleman.
A Scotchman.
Scotch?
Old, young, short, tall?
- Tall. Elderly.
He seemed to feel the weather, sir.
It's a rotten fog this, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Wait.
Don't unpack that bag, Barraclough.
- No, sir.               – Bunny.
Take my car.
Drive down to the Airways
Office in the Haymarket.
Book me a seat on the afternoon plane to Amsterdam.     - Amsterdam?
Here is 20 pounds and here are the keys. Hurry, hurry!
Wait!
Why, Gwen.
Hello, Gwen.
Don't stop to ask questions.
And don't answer any.
- Alright. I'll see you later.
That's alright, Barraclough.
Why, Gwen.
You'd better be leaving London.
So?
Yes.
But I wouldn't waste any time about it if I were you.
Why?
Crawshay has escaped.
No?
McKenzie let him go.
A thief to catch a ..
Thief. McKenzie said.
I see.
I heard Crawshay threaten you last night.
And Lady Melrose.
Only you knew the necklace wasn't in the case.
What else?
You weren't in your room when the alarm went off.
How do you know?
- Because I was there.
And this.
Where did you ..?
Where did you steal this?
Oh, how could you be such a fool?
McKenzie says that every criminal makes a false step.
Some time.
Such a fool was to turn criminal in the first place.
Now lately I've been wondering that myself.
I've practically confessed everything to you this morning.
Don't you see that now that you know everything about me.
I might just as well give myself up.
Oh, no.
I've come here to help you.
I don't care what you are.
I don't care what you've been.
I love you.
- Oh, Gwen.
I love the man you really are.
I'm going away with you to stay with you always.
Oh my dear, I can't let you do that.
You try and stop me.
We'd be refugees from justice.
Hiding from the police.
- What if we are?
I'll trust your wit to keep us from being caught.
And there isn't going to be any more of this.
Is there?
There are other kinds of adventure, you know.
Better kinds.
Are you trying to make an honest man of me?
Hmm.
And I shan't love you any less for being that.
[ Doorbell ]
Probably the police.
- Can you face them?
Oh, I can face anybody now.
What about this?
I'll find a way to return this later.
But they mustn't find you here.
- Where can I go?
Quick. In here.
You shouldn't have come.
You really shouldn't have come.
Oh, I'm not sorry I came.
You travel fast, Inspector.
I came by plane.
- In this fog?
I was in a hurry.
That's a bonnie cloak, Inspector.
Aye.
It's a fine cloak for this foggy weather.
Then let me give you a whiskey and soda.
No thanks.
There is fog enough outside.
I do not want it inside too.
Alright. I'll mix one for myself.
Crawshay has escaped.
Has he?
That sounds very careless of you, Inspector.
He is here in The Albany.
Is he? Well, I must be on the watch for him.
Aye. I'm on the watch for him.
I've got this place surrounded on every side.
Uhuh.
I'll get the necklace as soon as I've got Crawshay.
Has Crawshay got it?
No. But he knows who has.
- Oh.
Do you mind if I take a look around these rooms?
For Crawshay?
- Aye.
By all means.
- Thank you.
Do you mind if I look through my letters?
By all means?
Thank you.
A library, eh?
Yes .. for books.
I say, that's a nice vase you have here.
Yes. A nice vase.
Not large enough for
Crawshay to hide in though.
Which will be your room?
My room? Oh yes. Here.
This is the bath, eh?
- Yes.
Go straight in. I'm not bathing now.
And that room there.
That room is occupied by a lady.
A lady?
A lady.
Well, you can trust my discretion.
How do you do, Inspector.
How do you do, ma'am.
I'll ring for tea.
- Good.
That's a fine clock you have there.
- Yes.
See the works.
- Thanks.
I've seen all I came to see.
And a bit more.
Bring tea, Barraclough.
You know.
I think I'll stay and have a cup of tea with you.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Look. The skylight is open.
Keep a watch, until I get the Inspector.
Do you mind if I smoke my pipe?
- Not at all.
Thank you.
Have a cigarette?
- No thanks.
I never smoke them.
Can I have a fill of tobacco?
Why not let me give you one of my cigars.
I have some of the best cigars you've ever smoked.
I'll smoke this after dinner.
Take another for now.
- No thanks.
When this Scotsman makes up his mind, there is nothing that can dissuade him.
Oh.
I hope you won't find that mixture too mild.
Oh no. No.
[ Doorbell ]
We're having a lot of callers this afternoon.
For Mr McKenzie, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
We've spotted Crawshay.
He's somewhere on the roof.
On the roof, eh?
Just as I expected.
Yes, sir.
He came up the service stairs and then crawled on the roof through a skylight.
Well, I'd better come along.
Right, sir.
- And ..
You had better watch outside
Mr Raffles' door in case ..
In case ..?
In case Crawshay tries breaking in that way.
Or in case Mr Raffles tries breaking out.
My dear, I must ..
- Look out!
You didn't expect me, did you?
What do you want?
My share. That's what I want.
Mr Crawshay you tempt me strongly to call in the police.
They're looking for you all over the place.
The police?
Alright. They'll cop the pair of us.
Mr Crawshay.
Nothing would please me more than having you take the necklace from these rooms.
Unfortunately though, I've just promised to return it to the Melrose family.
Yes?
Well.
You don't do me in again.
Either I get them sparklers.
Or I get you.
I see.
Mr Crawshay, may I ask you a question?
Have you ever heard a man condemned to death?
I have.
It is quite an interesting procedure.
The judge puts a black cap on his head.
It isn't really a cap you know.
It's a piece of ..
Square cloth.
I'm telling you this so that you will know what to expect.
The judge then tells you that you'll be taken back to the place whence you came.
And thence to the place of execution.
There to be hanged by the neck.
Until you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy ..
On your soul.
A pity you haven't more pluck, Crawshay.
You see what comes of listening to you?
There is his rope, sir.
It leads to Raffles' window.
So it is.
Cheer up. This time I will get you away.
Have you got a rope?
Yes.
- Come on, quick.
If the police return.
Use all your charm.
Have you got any money?
Not a bean.
Here is ten pounds.
Look. They've got me.
Alright. Pull it up.
Pull it up.
Pull yourself together, man.
They haven't got either of us yet.
Here.
Now wait.
Give us that chloroform of yours.
God love you, Guvnor.
What a crew you'd make.
Crawshay is inside.
In the name of the law, open this door.
[ Door knocks ]
Where is he?
- Who, Mr Raffles?
In his room I think.
- Have you heard anything?
Heard anything?
Why no.
Then Crawshay has got him.
In there.
Good heavens.
Is he dead?
No. Chloroform.
Get Crawshay!
Hey!
He's coming to now.
He got away in the fog, sir.
Raffles, old boy. What happened?
- It's alright, old man. It's alright.
Alright, but tell me what's happened.
Crawshay.
Crawshay came alright.
- Yes.
He came.
And went.
Wait here.
Where is Mr Raffles?
Why Gwen. What are you doing here?
The same as you're doing, Lord Melrose.
Trying to protect Mr Raffles.
Well, you're too late. Both of you.
Confound it, sir.
Well, Inspector.
Have you found your man?
Yes, Mr Raffles.
We got him.
Good.
You can always count on dear old Scotland Yard.
Yes, Mr Raffles.
Here is a warrant for your arrest.
What?
You see, you will have to explain what your business is.
In Amsterdam.
My business in Amsterdam?
Nothing much.
Amsterdam is the diamond market of Europe, sir.
Well?
Aren't you the "Amateur
Cracksman", Mr Raffles?
Yes.
Raffles.
Now there you are.
I'm sorry Bunny, but there you are.
But you haven't got the necklace yet, Inspector.
No.
Does Lord Melrose remember the reward he offered for it?
A thousand pounds to anyone who returned it.
There is no need to remind me of it.
Good. Bunny.
You could use a thousand pounds, couldn't you?
I'm sure you could. Well, if you'll be good enough to get the necklace ..
And return it to Lord Melrose you will find it there.
In the tobacco jar.
Good heavens.
In the tobacco?
Well, I'll be.
Yes, I thought you would be.
See here, Inspector.
We've got this back.
You can't go any further.
I won't have a scandal.
Don't be alarmed, Lord Melrose.
This warrant makes no mention of you.
It charges him.
With the robbery of a Bond
Street jeweller last Friday night.
And the theft of a diamond bracelet.
I'm sorry. I'm not in a position to restore that.
I am.
Here you are, Inspector.
Well.
And there goes my reputation, Lord Melrose.
I'm sorry things had to end this way.
So am I.
But perhaps someone will be good enough to tell me ..
What the blazes this world is coming to.
Well, McKenzie.
You've got your necklace.
- Aye.
You've even got your bracelet.
But you haven't got me.
Here, after him!
Raffles!
Pull it! Get through there!
Get something to pry that door open with.
[ Gunshot! ]
Good heavens! He's shot himself.
Good.
Bunny! Barraclough!
Close the door. Quick!
Gwen.
Where are you going?
- Wherever you'll join me.
A new life?
- Yes, a new life.
I'll meet you in Paris.
- I'll be there.
Ha.
They'll nab him downstairs.
I wonder.
Here.
- Yes, sir.
Watch by that wall.
- Yes, sir.
You guard the entrance.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Rush around Sackville Street.
- Yes, sir.
You go with him.
- Very good, sir.
You take Piccadilly to the left.
- Right, sir.
We've got the entire square surrounded, sir.
Good.
Where is he? Where did he go?
Blimey, sir. You just went that way and now here you are again, sir.
You idîot! You've let him get away.
Which way did he go?
- Down there, sir.
Come on men. This way.
Good heavens.
"You were right."
"It is a useful cloak in a fog."
Scoundrel.
Well.
One can't help liking him.
# s d # oö
Heave the starboard line!
Heave a port line!
Make fast the starboard line!
- Hello, amigo!
- Hiya, Moreno.
Looks like more passengers this trip.
Keep your fingers crossed.
We may have some luck.
- What did you say?
- The boat sails at four.
Hi, Rafel.
- Here you are. Two sacks this time.
- How is the talent this trip?
- Oh, very bad, señor.
- Not much to choose from?
Have my share. Is this all you've got?
There is not one you would give that for.
Wait a minute. Les, look at that.
- Pretty mouse.
- Who hung that one on you?
No, señor. We have had some very bad weather.
I fall against a doorknob.
You ought to cut its fingernails.
- The boat leaves at 4 a.m., miss.
- I'll be here.
Boo!
- I thought you said...
- You chump, that's the doorknob.
- Come on, we got some work to do.
- So long, Rafel.
Be careful, boys, be careful.
Wait a minute.
- Now there's a strong character.
- Probably the wrong approach.
- We'll try again.
- Easy does it.
- Lady, we want to appeal to your...
- What?
It wasn't me. He thought it up.
We were just gonna buy you a drink.
Are you Americans?
I thought you were a couple of...
Gee, why didn't you say so?
Buy me a drink? I'm gonna buy you one.
- Then you won't need this.
- Well, come on.
Sounds good to hear something other than pig Latin. Where are you from?
He's Les Peters and I'm Joe Souther,
New York and Kansas.
- What's your name?
- Lee.
- Lee what?
- Bonnie Lee, from Brooklyn.
Oh, look out.
- What was that?
- Fifth Avenue bus line.
Too bad you didn't break your neck.
Who saw her first?
Here you are, Dutchy.
Dutchy, meet Miss Lee.
This imposing gentleman is the postmaster and banker of Barranca.
- I've always wanted to know...
- Also the owner of this general store, proprietor of the bar on your left and chief cook and bottle-washer of this luxurious hotel and restaurant you see before you.
- That hardly seems enough, Mr ..
- John Van Ruyter is the name.
- Don't pay any attention...
- How about a drink?
Sure. Sit down, make yourself at home.
What are you having?
- How's the local Scotch?
- I carry only the best.
- Make mine bourbon, Dutchy.
- Me, too.
- Well, me too.
- My Scotch is good. I drink it myself.
- Why don't you have one with us?
- I will.
Does it seem good to be off that boat.
What are you looking at?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Boy, you're sure easy on the eyes.
You heard me use that two weeks ago.
It still sounds good anyway.
What are you fellas doing here?
Same as everybody else, working for the Dutchman.
- What's that?
- We fly mail and things.
Flyers? I was wondering why you're carrying those guns around.
Did you think we're a couple of banana cowboys?
Who'd think there's a flying field.
Where is it?
- Right outside the door.
- Well, skol!
- To us.
- Down the hatch.
Happy landings.
What are you doing here?
On your way back to the States?
- If I don't get a job in Panama.
- Professional?
- I quit a show in Valparaiso. On me.
- Oh, don't do that.
I wanted to buy you a drink.
- No, I'm paying for these.
- But I...
- Let him pay. It's much better.
- Wait a minute, Dutchy.
If you take his money,
I'll never come here again.
- Joe, where are you going to eat?
- I'll starve, but I won't come in again.
- I better take his money.
- If you do, I'll never come here again.
- No, I'm gonna pay for this.
- He wants to...
- I meant what I said.
- So did I, Dutchy. Come on.
The drink's on the house. Satisfied?
- Very well satisfied.
- That's a shame. He's cute.
Dutchy, come back.
No more monkey business.
- Bring a bottle.
- You better take it easy.
- One of you has to fly the mail.
- I thought Tony was first out.
Tony has a touch of fever.
It's either you or Joe.
- Can you beat that?
- Fine thing.
- Dutchy, pick a number.
- A number? What for?
- Anything up to ten.
- One to ten, number...
Oh, no. No, not me. If you want to gamble on who flies in that weather, pick someone else for a number.
- Bonnie.
- Anything up to ten.
- Not me. I feel the same way he does.
- Nobody's worrying about who's flying.
We're worried about who's going to take you to dinner.
- Who said anything about dinner?
- We'll send you a formal invitation.
- All right, Les, odd or even?
- Odd.
Oh, that's too bad. Well, Bonnie, how do you like your steak?
Well, I don't know if I...
Do you mean real American steak?
I don't want to brag, but how do you think I keep those boys here?
- I guess I'm staying for dinner.
- That's the girl!
Why do I always say ''odd'' and it always comes out...
Oh, I hate that noise.
Joe Souther, Joe Souther, you're up next.
- That's you, Les.
- Joe Souther.
Sorry, kid.
Joe, stand by.
Tex says it's clearing.
Oh, no, not me, Poppa. Les lost.
I'm having dinner with Miss Lee.
- Miss Lee, Mr Carter.
- How do you do?
Hello, Miss Lee. Sorry, Joe, the mail goes out on schedule. So do the pilots.
Since when, Geoff?
I want Les to go down and check over what came today.
That's an all-night job.
- When'd you think that up?
- Just now.
Look here, Geoff, the boys gambled and he lost. Let him go.
- Is that an order?
- Yeah. No. I...
Who runs things here, anyway?
- That's what I mean. Joe...
- Miss Lee and I are having dinner.
Don't worry about Miss Lee.
I'll be glad to take over.
Now, look here,
I've got something to say about this.
- Chorus girl?
- No, I do a specialty.
Pick up that stuff on your way back from
Las Cruces. See you later, Miss Lee.
Oh, you will, will you?
Well, I might have...
Say, who does that guy think he is, anyway?
- The boss.
- As you may have gathered.
- He's not my boss. I'm not gonna let...
- I hope you win. I'll be seeing you.
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Now, Joe, be careful.
Dutchy, you ought to find something to worry about.
That's what you should be doing.
- Joe.
- Hi, Lily.
- No, no, Joe.
- I've got to go. I'll be back soon.
Bye, darling.
Well, how can he fly in this fog?
It's just on the ground. He'll pull through it. It's only 200 feet thick.
He's waiting for the heavy stuff piled up in the pass.
- Sounds like doubletalk.
- I guess it does.
The only way inland is through a deep pass. It's right up... You can't see it.
It's 14,000 feet at the low spot.
Wind and clouds make it a bad place.
We keep a lookout to tell us when it clears.
Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
- Here it comes in now.
- Go ahead, Tex.
She's moving fast.
How does it look down there?
- OK, if the wind doesn't shift.
- I'll take a look outside.
Big breaks now.
This looks like the last of it.
OK, she's open.
- Let 'em fly.
- OK, Tex.
Joe!
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever seen.
Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it?
It didn't at all.
That's why it's so wonderful.
It's really a flying human being.
Yes, a bird would have too much sense to fly in that kind of muck.
Joe Souther, calling Joe Souther.
Go ahead, Geoff, go ahead.
- Radio check. One, two, three...
- Four, five, six...
...seven, eight.
Clear as a bell, Poppa.
On top at 400 between layers.
Say, Geoff, there's a heavy fog bank laying off the coast. Anything else?
No, that's all. All right, Joe.
- Hiya, Les.
- Hiya.
- Hey, Geoff.
- Hello, Kid.
The wind's swung round.
It's bringing that fog bank in.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Calling Lookout. How much time?
- Move fast.
- Go ahead.
- How does it look up there?
- Better hold Joe for a while.
- He's gone. You should see him by now.
I can't see the tip of my nose. You can't tell what this stuff is gonna do.
- Stand by to put out a flare.
- Never mind the flare, Pop.
Little Jody heard every word.
What'll I do, come back?
Yeah. It's pretty thick down here.
When you get over the fog
I'll talk you in.
Say, Geoff, you tell that beautiful blonde I'm still in the running.
- Stick to business, Joe.
- I just wanna order two steaks.
- How about it, Dutchy?
- I heard you. Tell him it's all right.
- It's all right with me, too.
- All right, Joe, you're all set.
OK, here I come.
- Shorty, plug in that field set. Come on.
- Yes.
Shorty, get the big light ready.
Turn it straight up.
- Kind of cold out here.
- Pancho, light those tubs.
Joe Souther, Joe Souther.
OK, Geoff, coming down.
On top of the fog at 1500.
- Higher than I thought.
- We're turning on the lights.
- Turn them on.
- Here they go!
- There you are, Joe. See them?
- No, not a thing.
I can't even see the glow, Poppa.
- Must be thicker than it looks.
- Won't hurt to try.
- Hey, Baldy, shut off that piano.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep it quiet back there.
- Yes, sir.
Now look, Joe, pay attention.
It's all closed in down here.
You are west of the field, west of the field.
Fly due east. Fly due east.
Flying at 1500 due east.
Due east at 1500.
Hey, Joe, blip your motor.
Joe, you're passing over the field.
Go one mile.
Turn 180 degrees and start letting down.
Watch out for the lights.
Sounds a little that way.
Yeah. Joe, you're a little south, a little south.
OK, Poppa, turning north.
Hey, Kid, turn out that light, will you?
Keep it quiet back there!
Here I come.
Joe, you're coming in too high, you'll overshoot the field.
Make a turn, Joe.
Go further back and try it again.
OK, Geoff, I'm turning.
Can't you see the lights?
Nothing that even looks lik e a dim candle.
His line was OK.
Yeah. Joe, the direction was perfect.
Be sure to keep the same line.
All right, Geoff. I'm turning.
Here I come.
- Cut it up in hundreds, Joe.
- Take it easy, sonny.
- Geoff.
Gun her, Joe.
- I'm down to 100 now.
- That doesn't sound like...
Joe, pull up! You're heading for...
- Say, that wasn't right, was it?
- No, lady, not quite.
Look, Joe. You had the wrong line.
You're way off...
OK, Geoff. I saw the lights.
I'll get it next time.
Nothing doing.
Don't take any more chances.
- You've got three hours...
- Three hours?
She'll almost be on the boat by then.
I told you to stick to business.
Get up on top and cruise around until it opens up.
- Right, don't let him do it.
- Give me one more chance.
I think I see a hole.
Yeah, I do see one.
- I'm coming down.
- No, Joe, please don't!
You've got your orders. Do as I tell you.
Quit worrying about that blonde.
It's all right, Geoff. I see the lights.
I'll mak e it easy. I'll...
- There he is!
- Joe, pull her up!
Mike, get the wagon.
Take a pair of shears in case you have to cut him out. Les, get the mail.
Baldy, have the police clear the field.
- Hurry up.
- Yes.
Well, you did all you could.
Yeah.
Mr Wiseguy.
He may be alive, don't just stand there!
Haven't you caused enough trouble?
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
Geoff, did you get Joe down all right?
All except for one tree that stuck up too high.
Oh. Sorry.
Joe, you crazy fool.
Nobody could tell you anything.
You knew it all, huh? It serves you right.
I don't feel sorry for you, not a bit.
No skin off my nose.
If you can take it, I can.
- I'll take a look over there.
- OK, Kid.
Sparks, I forgot to tell Les, have the mail put in number seven.
Get it out and warm it up.
- Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Go ahead, Geoff.
- Any change, Tex?
- No, just about the same.
We're all set to go down here.
OK, I'll let you know.
Now, wait a minute, Geoff.
- What?
- You are not going to...
Go ahead and say it.
When you got me into this flying business,
I was doing pretty good.
I made good money, I ate good,
I slept good nights.
In a week, you'll collect or lose your shirt.
Oh, I'm not thinking about that.
I can't go on killing nice kids like that.
Not if I lose a dozen shirts.
Think you're the only one feeling that way?
Then why do you send them up in that weather?
I'm running an airline. I'm not running it any different to anybody I ever flew for.
- Oh, Geoff...
- Now look, Dutchy...
...Joe died flying, didn't he?
And that was his job.
He just wasn't good enough.
That's why he got it.
I ain't built like you are, Geoff.
I shouldn't be in such a business.
We can't go on like that.
You got another pilot coming in on the next boat.
Oh, Geoff.
- You are a hard man, much too hard.
- Cut it out.
- I can't...
- Cut it out!
What's the use of feeling bad about something that couldn't be helped?
Give me a match, will you?
Joe just wasn't good enough.
He was bound to get it sooner or later.
Then you had no business to let him fly!
What, ground that kid?
I'd say he'd sooner be where he is than quit.
Here.
Dutch, Joe had a sister somewhere up in the States, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Well, I owed him 100 bucks.
- Here, send it to her.
- You don't owe him no money, Geoff.
- How do you know?
- Well, I...
He's got two months' pay coming.
Why should he loan from you?
If you've got so much dough to throw around, why not get that plane out of hock?
Take it easy, fella. We'll get along.
- Sam, how about that food?
- Coming right up.
- Make it snappy, we're hungry.
- Coming out.
- Kid, how is it out there?
- Everything's all right.
Yeah? Come on, let's get a drink.
Baldy, I'll take those.
- Hello, Pancho.
- Hello, Geoff.
Just a minute, Kid, I can use that.
- Gangway, Charlie.
- Hello, Geoff.
Mr Carter, Mr Carter.
Do you really think... I mean...
Do you really think it was my fault what happened?
Sure it was.
You were gonna have dinner with him.
The Dutchman hired him, I sent him up, the fog came in, a tree got in the way.
All your fault.
Forget it, unless you want the honour.
Hello, Lily.
- Mr Geoff!
- Throw this down, you'll feel better.
- Bottoms up. Salud.
- Salud.
It's pretty good. The best I've ever seen.
- Bonnie, look at this.
- Hi, Gent.
Oh, all right, Gent.
Meet Miss Lee, Gent Shelton.
- How do you do?
- Fine. How are you?
- Where you been?
- Checking those spare parts.
- Oh, I get it.
- Did I send you down there?
- Don't think up some other job for me.
- I hear I missed all the excitement.
- You won't see a better one.
- She's a good one.
- What'll you have to drink?
- You name it.
- Miss Lee?
- What did you say?
- Do you want a drink?
- No.
- You better have one.
- Make mine bourbon.
- Baldy, send over some drinks.
- Right.
Gangway, please, gangway.
Here's your steak.
Here's the other one. Who wants it?
- I'll take it over here.
- Yes, sir.
- Get me some coffee.
- You want coffee, miss?
- That looks all right.
- You got here for the fireworks.
How can you do that?
- What?
- Eat that steak.
- Well, what's the matter with it?
- It was his.
- You want me to have it stuffed?
- Don't you realise he's dead?
- Who's dead?
- Yeah, who's dead?
- Joe.
- Joe?
- Who's Joe?
- Anybody know a Joe?
What's wrong with you?
He was sitting here and now...
Let's break the news to Mother
And tell her there's no other...
- You...
- Well, how do you like that?
Wait, you little fool.
Why don't you use your...
- Stop it.
- How can you act like this when...
- I know, he's dead.
- Yes, he's dead.
He's been dead 20 minutes, and weeping and wailing won't make him any deader
20 years from now.
- How do you think we feel?
- I'm sorry.
Come on. Go outside and walk around.
Stay there until you put all that together.
Was that you they were razzing in there?
Well, don't feel too bad about it.
I did the same thing when I first come out here.
- Say, Mister, can you kick real hard?
- Maybe you won't need it.
I think I'd feel better.
All my life I've hated funerals.
The fuss never brings anybody back.
Just spoils remembering them as they really are.
When I see people actually facing it that way, I have to act like a sap.
You know, this flying business is new to me.
They need some crazy way of looking at it to go on.
- Does this sort of thing happen often?
- That depends on weather and luck.
We've drawn spades twice in three months, not counting this one.
- I guess they'll be at it again tomorrow.
- Tonight, if it clears.
They must love it. Flying, I mean.
- Why do you think they come here?
- It's like being in love with a buzz saw.
- Not much future in it.
- What is it that gets them?
I'm not a flyer myself.
You'd better ask the Kid.
- Miss Lee, Mr Dabb.
- How do you do?
- She wants to know why you like flying.
- I've been in it 22 years, Miss Lee.
I couldn't give you an answer that'd make sense.
- What's so funny?
- That's what my Dad used to say.
- Flyer?
- No, trapeze. He wouldn't use a net.
- Not much future in that, either.
- Yes.
We found that out.
Tell me about this head man Geoff.
Does he go up, too?
When he thinks it's too tough for anyone else.
Just shows you how wrong he can be.
The Kid could tell you.
He's Geoff's best friend.
The only thing I can tell you is he's a good guy for gals to stay away from.
Thank you, I'll remember that.
- What's it gonna be?
- How about Some Of These Days?
How does it go?
There's no B flat in there.
It goes...like that.
- What do you want?
- I came back for that drink.
- Grown up yet?
- Hope so.
- Good girl. Hey, Charlie!
- Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
That's awful! Look, can't you hear that?
I know. Will you go away, please?
We'll get it.
- You wanna hear how it really goes?
- Sure.
- Move over.
- You better be good.
Won't be as corny as you.
Take the pick-up with the horn.
Make it nice and slow.
The rest, watch for the breaks.
Ready now? Here we go.
I dig it!
- Hello, professional.
- That's part of my specialty.
- Yeah?
- Here's to you.
- You got a match?
- Yes, Geoff.
Thanks.
- Who's Joe?
- Never heard of him.
- Anyone know The Peanut Vendor?
- Yes, sir.
Give me those things, honey.
So long, Dutch.
- I'll take care of it.
- All right, Mike. Goodnight.
Here's all the stuff that was turned in.
I gave his clothes to the men on the field.
Yeah.
Well, he didn't have much to show for all...
- Take your pick, Sparks.
- I got a drawer full of that junk already.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
The Kid's sitting in for me.
Goodnight, Sparks.
See anything you'd like to have, Dutch?
I don't need anything to remember him by.
If you want a drink or so, help yourself.
- Goodbye, Miss Lee.
- Goodbye, Dutchy.
- Drop in again sometime.
- Thank you, I will.
Goodbye. It's too bad
Barranca is so far from Brooklyn.
It's only a few minutes past 12.
Your boat doesn't leave until 4 o'clock.
- Say when.
- When are you gonna get some sleep?
After your boat sails.
- Aren't you just wasting your time?
- That's a point that's open to argument.
That's what I'm afraid of, those arguments.
- What's the matter with them?
- They're too one-sided.
No hard feelings.
Your apology is accepted.
How about taking along a little souvenir?
Why not?
Help yourself.
You've got a good eye, lady.
Say, somebody must've given you an awful beating once.
Come on now, you better go home.
Goodnight.
- Hey, you're a queer duck.
- So are you.
I can't make you out.
Same here.
What was she like, anyway?
- Who?
- The girl that made you act like this.
A whole lot like you.
Just as nice, almost as smart.
- Chorus girl?
- Only by temperament.
- At least you're true to the type.
- Sit down, make yourself comfortable.
Still carrying a torch for her, aren't you?
- Got a match?
- Don't you ever have any?
Don't believe in laying in a supply of anything.
- Matches, money or women?
- That's right.
- No tomorrows, just today.
- That's right.
Is that why she gave you the air?
- Who?
- That girl.
Listen, I wouldn't ask any woman to...
Say, you can think up more questions. Here.
- What wouldn't you...
- What?
...ask anybody to do?
Did you ever know a woman that didn't wanna make plans?
Map out everything, get it all set?
Well, I don't blame them, I guess.
It's the only way they can run a home and have kids.
I suppose you think that's easier than flying.
- I don't know, I never tried it.
- Didn't you ask her to?
- Who?
- That girl.
I told you, I wouldn't ask any woman.
What if she were willing?
Yeah, that's what they all say.
Women think they can take it, but they can't.
The minute you're in the air they call the airport.
When you get down, you find them waiting, so scared they hate you.
What if she were the type that didn't scare easily?
- There's no such animal.
- Now, how do you know?
The girl I was telling you about came as close to it as anybody I ever met.
But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed.
- What?
- She couldn't stand the gaff.
Said she'd rather see me dead, have it over with.
Told me if I didn't quit flying, it was all off.
- You wouldn't, would you?
- I'm still flying.
- Wonder what happened to her.
- Who?
I don't know for sure.
I heard she married another flyer.
Is there anything else you'd like to know about me?
Would you like to go over to my room?
Got some letters from home.
Pictures of my parents and of me my first time up in the air.
- Pictures of my first crash.
- Any of you as a baby?
I don't remember. Wanna go and look?
Sure.
Bonnie, keep on the way we're going.
It'll take you to the boat.
- Well...
- I've got to stick around here.
- So that's where we were going.
- Take care of yourself.
- Geoff.
- What?
Tex just called. He says the pass is clearing.
- Did you wake Les up?
- No.
Because...Tex says it's nobody's picnic.
- All right, wind up number seven.
- I already did.
So long, Bonnie. Have a nice trip.
- Wait. Are you going up yourself?
- Sure.
- When will you be back?
- Takes three hours each way.
Won't be back until after your boat sails.
I'll look you up in New York.
- What?
- What?
- You'll look me up in New York? When...
- Sure, I'll see you there.
- What did you say?
- When are you coming?
Next week, two o'clock.
I liked saying goodbye.
Let's try it again.
So long, Bonnie.
Say, things happen awful fast around here.
Is this going to be dangerous?
What do you wanna do?
Put a net under him?
Well, lady, you're really better off this way.
Sure, I guess...
Now, look, I hardly know the man.
Sure, but you'll get over it.
Bye, Miss Lee.
I gotta keep tabs on him.
Bye.
Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Hello, Kid. Did Geoff get down all right?
- Sure, he's all right.
That's good. I couldn't see him when he passed here. Signing off.
That was a pretty quick trip you made.
I still say it was pretty quick.
- Shut up.
- Well, it wasn't slow.
Morning, Charlie.
How about a hot cup of...
Hello.
- What are you doing?
- Having breakfast.
- Is your boat still here?
- No.
Has it sailed?
How did you get left behind?
Oh, I just...
- Go on.
- Well, I just told the man.
- Told him what?
- '' Put my trunk on the dock.''
- Yeah, why?
- Well...
I couldn't stay over without having anything to wear.
What's so strange about that?
- Doesn't it seem strange to you?
- What?
Getting off that boat.
Well, doesn't it?
Well, I don't know.
The girl that got off that boat is a perfect stranger to me.
I don't know. I don't know whether this is me or another fellow.
Bonnie Lee ought to be sound asleep on that boat, far out to sea.
She's not so far out to sea as you think.
- Who?
- The boat.
Kid, put more gas in number seven, call
Santa Maria. Have them hold the boat.
- Where's your luggage?
- Over there.
Good. Charlie...
What are you waiting for?
Boat doesn't stop there this trip.
They have no bananas.
- They have no bananas?
- Yes, they have no bananas.
Shut up.
Don't worry. You don't have to bother about me, I'm cured.
- There's a first time for everything.
- What do you mean?
I've never made such a chump out of myself. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I...
No, I'm not either. I'm glad.
- You're not making sense.
- You're telling me.
If I'd taken that boat I'd have gone remembering a swell guy.
Someone who lived up to a screwy ideal that I... I don't know.
- I didn't ask you to stay. I wouldn't...
- ...ask any woman to do anything.
There's something else I wouldn't do.
- What?
- Get burned twice in the same place.
- Another boat leaves next week.
- I'll be on it.
Good. I'm gonna get some sleep, Kid.
If you're gonna be here a week, we better find some place for you to park.
Yeah, I guess so.
Can I have a nice room with a bath?
I'll see what I can do.
You know,
I always did like a bath better than a shower.
Good morning, Doc.
What are you doing here?
What are you d...
Yeah, thanks, Doc, thanks.
What's he saying?
He's waiting for a call from the San Felipe mine.
Hartwood's son has had an accident.
- How bad?
- That's what we're waiting to find out.
You can't put a plane down there.
It's worse than getting a piano over a transom.
Come on in.
Who's gonna meet the southbound boat?
- You could send Les.
- You go. That new flyer's coming in.
- What's his name?
- Mac something.
MacPherson, ain't it?
- What is it?
- What's the difference, if he can fly?
Can't afford to be fussy down here.
- Now go on. Go and meet the boat.
- All right.
- Tell Charlie to get me some breakfast.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sparks, try Hartwood again, will you?
Well, here's the mail.
And his name is MacPherson.
- How did you find that out?
- He told me.
- Where is he?
- Putting his things in his room.
- I'll be out in a minute.
- All right.
- Don't strain yourself.
- Yes, sir.
Your room all right, Mr MacPherson?
- It'll do.
- Let's get you acquainted around here.
Boys, this is Mr MacPherson, our new flyer.
- Welcome to our fair city.
- Les Peters. This is Gent Shelton.
Mike, this is Mr MacPherson.
Our head mechanic.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Too early to buy a drink?
- No. Where are you from?
- Mexico City.
- What stuff are they using?
The same old Fokkers and Fords.
- Well, look who...
- Felisa, Elena, how are you?
I didn't know you'd come.
Mac, you'll have to buy more drinks.
- This is Elena Silva and Felisa...
- Torres.
...Torres. Mr MacPherson, this is Michael.
- Get a good sleep?
- No!
Mr MacPherson is here.
- Mr MacPherson.
- Geoff!
Excuse me. Hello!
- Well, how are you, Lola?
- Not Lola, Felisa.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Well, Felisa, how's Panama?
Oh, Geoff. It was Puerto Rico.
- Is that where it was?
- Yeah.
I can't remember names.
I'm better at faces. I...
Your name's not MacPherson, it's Kilgallon.
- You're not so bad on names after all.
- Kilgallon.
- You heard him.
- Bat Kilgallon.
- That's right.
- Well, what about it?
He's not the first to come here under a different name.
No, but he's the first pilot who ever bailed out and let his mechanic crash.
Habit of yours, being right, isn't it?
- Look, you don't want...
- Cut it out, Les. Hey...
Did you know the Kid was working down here?
- What?
- He is.
I don't think there's anything funny about that.
You're right, there isn't. But I had to come a long way to find it out.
- Of all the cast-iron crust...
- Don't flatter me.
What's the Kid got to do with it?
Nothing, except it was his brother that was killed when this guy took to his parachute.
I've had enough of this.
Do you mind, Elena? We're...
Come on, baby.
Coming, Geoff?
- No, this is good enough for me.
- Not so particular, huh?
Even you couldn't spoil good liquor.
Thanks, I'm not used to these small favours.
I'm sorry I said it. I'm not used to being around people like you.
- That's the Kid coming in.
- Geoff, what are we...
Quiet, Dutch.
Better make yourself scarce.
- The Kid carries a gun.
- Aren't you getting careful of me?
It's gonna be inconvenient for me if they slap the Kid in the hoosegow.
- I have to meet him sooner or later.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
Well, it's your funeral.
All passengers aboard the boat.
All passengers aboard the boat.
I remember, it was Puerto Rico.
So long.
It's hot on the ground.
Give me some cold water, Baldy.
Who's got a match?
What's the matter?
It's like walking on a graveyard.
Oh, hello.
You the new guy?
Welcome to our city. My name...
Hello, Kilgallon.
Long time no see.
That's right.
I thought there was something.
Look...
I'm all right.
Two years ago I'd have broke your...
Keep out of my sight.
I might still do it.
It's none of my business, but why did you stop him?
- It's none of your business.
- Bat.
Judy, I want you to meet these people.
Gentlemen, this is Mrs MacPherson.
Mr...
- My name is Shelton.
- Mr Shelton.
- This is Les Peters.
- Mr Peters.
- Mr Van Ruyter, our boss.
- He met us at the boat.
And...Geoff Carter.
- Mrs MacPherson.
- Mr Carter.
- I forgot to ask you for the trunk keys.
- Oh, yes, you did.
- I interrupted something.
- Not at all.
There. I'll see you in a few minutes.
I'm glad to have met everyone.
No, she doesn't know about me.
- Come on.
- You're not putting him to work?
Also none of your business.
Who's running this airline?
You are. But you don't seem to remember that.
- Did you get old man Hartwood yet?
- No, the line's still busy.
- You do some queer things, Kilgallon.
- MacPherson's the name.
That's what I mean.
Why didn't you tell her?
When does the next boat leave?
Have you got enough dough for your passages?
No.
That's fine.
- I wonder if I could...
- What?
- Cram you down their throats.
- That bunch in there?
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't mind choking a few of them.
Hello? Mr Hartwood,
I've been trying to get you.
I've got to get my boy out or bring a doctor in.
I'd like to help, but I can't lose a plane.
I know the Dutchman's hard up. Get a doctor, you can write your own ticket.
- I'll take responsibility for the plane.
- Yeah? Wait a minute.
- Hey, you want a chance?
- What do you think?
- You'll make your passage home.
- That's all right with me.
Mr Hartwood, you've got a deal.
Put up some smoke so we can tell about the wind. Sure, goodbye.
Sparks, get the doctor.
You're taking him to a boy who's hurt.
- It's a bad place to get into.
- Got a map?
I'll get you one.
- Here he is, Geoff.
- Hello, Doc.
Tell him it's no cinch. He doesn't have to go unless he wants to.
Here we are, and here's the mine.
It's situated on a small plain...
Sure, Doc.
- That's right, Doc.
- I go!
I go!
- He's going.
- You hurt his feelings.
- Why?
- He was quoting Shakespeare.
Henry IV, I think.
He said, ''A man can die but once.
We owe God a death.''
If we pay it today, we don't owe it tomorrow.
He's no fool.
They'll be waiting for you on the field.
How do you get over this stuff?
There's a pass, 14,000 feet. See it?
- Right.
- OK.
When you land, come in short or you'll run out of ground. There's a big drop.
- Thanks.
- OK. For what?
I'll get things ready for him.
Listen, tell the Kid I want to see him, will you?
Hello, Kid. Put down those shades.
Hey...what about this guy
Kilgallon or MacPherson?
- Come over here.
- You're not putting him to work?
We'll talk about that later.
Here, sit down.
- Giving me an eye test?
- Read that fourth line.
- You're not worried about my eyes?
- I have been for some time.
- Because I didn't know him right off?
- Quit stalling.
- I, P, E, D.
- That's very good.
- I could've told you.
- Stay there.
I got a new one for you.
Fourth line on this.
P, T, E, O.
Try the fifth.
F, Z, B, D, E.
Now read it backwards.
- E, D, B, Z, F.
- That's better than I can do.
- What about this guy?
- You're not through yet.
- Take a shot at this.
- Where did you get that?
Mike made it.
Here you are.
Go ahead, line them up.
- They're together now.
- Yeah.
- How did I do?
- Not bad.
Well, what about Kilgallon?
- He's not staying here, is he?
- Why not?
I thought you'd be the last guy to ask that.
- He's no good and you know it.
- Now, take it easy.
Is he worse than the guy who'd double-cross his friend?
Kid, anything you do is all right with me.
But if Dutch loses another plane, he's cooked.
I thought he was rolling in dough.
Why do you think that new motor is still at the dock?
Yeah, I did wonder about that.
Look, Kid, here it is.
Dutchy made an agreement.
If he gets the mail out on schedule for six months, he'll get a contract and a subsidy.
You know what that would mean?
Plenty of money, no more second-hand junk to fly.
These new jobs can get over those peaks in any weather.
That would be nice.
When did this schedule start?
Six months ago.
Only one more week, or at least until the northbound boat arrives.
That's why you've been forcing things?
Why didn't you tell a fella?
- Dutchy.
- Dutchy, how?
He was afraid if you guys knew the spot he was in, you'd take chances.
What a guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you were right about my eyes.
I couldn't read those cards.
I learned them by heart.
What about the new one?
Dutchy told me where you hid it.
- The old fool, double-crossing himself.
- He wasn't thinking about that.
He was thinking how you'd feel, grounding me.
You're through flying, Kid.
After 22 years.
I guess that's long enough for anybody.
You're gonna need that...
Kilgallon, aren't you?
I might.
Well, if you do...you can forget how I feel about him.
Thanks.
Kid. There's a lot you can do round here to help me.
Oh, sure, I know.
I can help Mike. I can...
Sure.
Calling MacPherson, calling MacPherson.
- Go ahead.
- Radio check.
One, two, three, four, five.
OK, report when you get there.
Fasten your belt.
Your belt.
- Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.
MacPherson speaking.
We got down all right.
We've got to get him to the hospital.
They're loading him in now.
His father is coming, too.
Can you get out with that extra weight?
Well, I got a little help from the wind.
I'll go off the ledge, use the canyon to pick up speed.
- Let me know if you make it.
- OK.
Brace yourselves.
This is gonna be quite a drop.
- Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.
MacPherson speaking. We got out all right. All in one piece.
What do you want me to do?
Pat you on the back?
Signing off.
Come in.
Busy?
- It all seems very natural.
- Yes, it does, doesn't it?
- Like my hair this way?
- I thought it was different.
- I couldn't believe it. I had no idea...
- It's a pretty small world.
- Hello, Geoff.
- Hello, Judy.
I'm not sure we should've done that.
Same old goo.
You haven't changed a bit.
No.
- Were you surprised to find me married?
- No.
No, somebody wrote me something about it.
I thought you'd had enough of flyers.
So did I.
- Are you getting along all right?
- I'm very happy.
Did...
- Did you tell him about us?
- He never asked me.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
Anything I can do...
Would you do something about our room?
- What's the matter with it?
- Remember the one I had at Catalina?
It's even smaller. And no bath.
I'll do what I can, Judy.
This is Miss Lee. Miss Lee has to know about everything.
- She'd like to ask you some questions.
- I would not!
Never mind.
- Still at it, aren't you, Geoff?
- What? Oh, you mean...
No, no, she's stopping over between boats.
- At your invitation?
- My invitation? I wouldn't ask...
...any woman to do anything.
I've heard that before.
No, you can't keep that up forever.
- You'll meet someone you'll have to ask.
- I haven't so far.
Cut it out. Cut it out!
- Come on, come on. You all right?
- Yeah, sure.
- Take him in there.
- Come on, Kid.
Take it easy.
You'll do. Why don't you two pick on somebody you can handle?
- I think it's busted.
- Yeah?
Try and move your fingers.
- Not a wiggle.
- Oh, that's fine. What started this?
The Kid came in, had a couple of drinks.
Gent and I squawked about working with Bat.
- One thing led to another.
- Gonna quit?
- That was the idea.
- I wound up on the floor.
- He acted like he was crazy.
- You'd be crazy, too.
- Yeah, why?
- I had to ground him.
He's through flying.
- No.
- His eyes?
- That's tough.
- No wonder he went nuts.
- You'd better take that to the hospital.
- I wanna talk to the Kid first.
Me, too.
Mr Peters, what did you say about working with my husband?
- I didn't say anything.
- Why should you?
I guess you misunderstood, lady.
Look, Kid...
We didn't know anything about...
Geoff just told us the bad news.
Yeah? Still figure on quitting?
If you can stand that guy we've got no right to kick.
OK, forget it.
- Hey.
- I didn't pick out a good place to land.
I'm sorry about that other thing.
I didn't get this by walking into a door.
Come on, kiss it and make it well.
It's better already.
Les, get that arm down to the hospital right away.
Well, now you're another guy short.
Well, that's how it goes.
I certainly am a great help to you, Geoff.
We'll get along all right.
Maybe I could teach Dutchy to fly.
Who, me? No, I don't want to.
- Now, who's running this airline?
- Oh, Geoff, please include me out.
That's not a bad idea.
No, Geoff, I don't want to fly.
No, no, no. Cheer up.
Hartwood said to give you this.
- If it isn't satisfactory, let him know.
- Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
What about my passage money?
You don't need it. You got the job.
Maybe I ought to pat you on the back.
You don't have to.
Just do what I tell you.
You mean anything that's too tough for somebody else?
Yeah. Yeah, that's about it.
I'm knee-deep in friends around here, but I can send you out in any weather, on any job,
- and only worry about the ship.
- I see.
On those terms, you still want the job?
- I don't know any other way I'd want it.
- Good.
Look around the field, get acquainted.
Anything you wanna know, ask Mike.
If he won't talk to you... tell him it's orders.
Yes, sir.
Dutch. Come and get it, boy.
Now you can get that ship out of hock.
I'm afraid we need more than...
Isn't that too much?
- Not for that kind of flying.
- Oh, Geoff, I don't know.
If you wanna thank somebody, thank him. You could get him a decent room.
- I haven't got a thing.
- The one up on the balcony?
Miss Lee's in that.
- Right next to me?
- Yes, I thought...
- Get her out of there.
- All right, if you want.
- I do. But get the ship first.
- Yes.
- Get it up here as fast as you can.
- Sure.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello, Bonnie. How are you doing?
Not bad. After spending a night in that mouse auditorium I'm sleeping in.
Just room enough for me and a Flit-gun.
- I thought we'd fixed you up pretty good.
- You did.
Mr Carter had other ideas.
You warned me.
Isn't that girl the one he used to be in love with?
Bonnie, when it rains, every third drop falls on one of them.
I can believe that all right.
They come right out of the woodwork.
- More power to him.
- Sure.
You don't think I care about that, do you?
I don't. See?
Just like to tell him what I think of him.
All you have to do is raise your voice a little.
- Is that him?
- The old master himself.
What's he doing?
Testing a smashed-up plane
Mike stuck together with a little glue.
Or did you use baling wire this time, Mike?
- Don't worry, those wings'll stay on.
- We'll soon find out.
- Hey. Hey!
- He's not trying to do that.
- I can't see.
- She's out of control.
- Now he's out of it.
- Geoff, get out.
- Jump. What's he doing?
- He's gonna try to land.
- He can't make it.
- Get set for a crash, Mike!
- Why doesn't he jump?
- Why should he? He's made of rubber.
- He wants to see how high he bounces.
- Shut up!
I'm getting too old for...
What's the matter?
I don't know. I...I...
- Can I come in?
- Sure.
Here.
This is good for the stomach.
- It won't help much for what ails you.
- You didn't tell him what a baby I was?
- No, I skipped that one.
- You won't tell him, will you?
After that, have you still got your chin stuck out for more?
I know I'm a fool, but I can't do anything about it.
- He won't quit flying, Bonnie.
- I wouldn't ask him to.
You don't believe that, do you?
You'll have a hard time making him believe it.
Think you can take that sort of thing day after day?
You love him, don't you, Kid?
- Yes, I guess I do.
- Why can't I love him the way you do?
Why couldn't I sneer when he tries to kill himself, feel proud when he doesn't?
Why couldn't I meet him when he gets back? Why couldn't I...
What do you do when he doesn't come back when you expect him to?
I go nuts.
Gee whizz, you're a great help.
- That's fine.
- What's up?
A new low has formed on the ocean.
It's gonna bring that storm here.
- When do they expect it?
- Maybe tonight.
- How big?
- I don't know yet.
Fine time for dirty weather. Poor Dutchy.
There's no use moaning.
Go and help with that new ship.
- What good'll that do?
- Tell them to stay with it.
Someday I'll get a straight answer.
Geoff. Wait a minute. They're loading number eight with nitroglycerine.
Right, to take into the oil fields.
Baldy, anything you've got.
We aren't meant to fly that with the mail.
- I know.
- Nothing in my contract says I'll fly that.
- You're getting a buck and a half a mile.
- Not me.
- What?
- I saw a guy blow a tyre once.
From the other end of the field it broke a bottle in my pocket.
- Where's your map?
- I don't like that stuff.
- Who does?
- I'll do anything else.
I know.
Here you are, MacPherson.
Once you're through the pass the oil fields are 200 miles north.
Give me a match, Dutch.
You weren't kidding me the other day, were you?
- Dutch, figure out Gent's time.
- What?
- What did you say?
- You're through.
- What's the matter with you?
- You can't blame that boy.
I'm not. He's fired, that's all. Sorry.
Geoff, I don't like that. The way you...
How about clearing the field before MacPherson takes off?
- Nitro.
- Oh, my goodness, you said it!
I didn't think of that at all.
- How's this stuff packed?
- All in rubber.
Here's a trapdoor if you wanna get rid of it.
Thanks.
OK.
None of that stuff for me.
- Watch it for a minute, will you?
- Sure.
- Hello, Judy.
- I...I'd like to talk to you.
- What's on your mind?
- Bat. He's carrying nitroglycerine.
Don't worry, he's pretty good.
- But it's very dangerous.
- Not while he's in the air.
- Run along, let Bat do the worrying.
- Don't be like that with me.
Why does he always get things like this to do? Please.
I told you I was happy, but I lied to you.
Why don't people wanna work with him?
What's he done that makes people act that way?
- Why ask me?
- You're the only one I can ask. Please!
- Can't you see...
- Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
- Wind's coming up.
It's closing in fast.
- Have you seen MacPherson yet?
- Went by a couple of minutes ago.
All right. Calling MacPherson.
You'd better run along, Judy.
- No, Geoff, I'm staying.
- Calling MacPherson.
- Is your weather good or bad?
- There's a chance to get through.
Is it good or bad?
- Bad.
- All right, come back.
- When you can, dump that nitro.
- I can get this stuff down.
I said dump it! And watch yourself.
There's a flock of big birds in the pass.
He could drop that soup on them.
- D'you hear, MacPherson?
- Yeah.
Tex will line you up on 'em.
- Feeling better, Judy?
- Thanks, Geoff.
Now, will you tell me what he's done?
No. No, you'll have to ask him.
You...you think that'll be easy to do?
Start dropping them after you've passed that second peak.
That oughta move 'em!
Drop the rest before you get back.
Too bad I couldn't get through.
I left the mail on the ship.
You're taking it up again as soon as Tex clears you.
Calling Look out, calling Look out.
- Go ahead.
- MacPherson speaking.
An hour out of Las Cruces. Clear ahead.
- Clear here.
- Signing off.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
- MacPherson coming back.
- An hour out of Las Cruces.
- OK, Tex.
Only one more trip, you got your contract.
Only one more. If this rain keeps up, we'll need pontoons.
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Get those motors ready.
I wanna run a test on them.
Hello.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a corkscrew.
- You should get some sleep.
- Seems like an excellent suggestion.
Look what I won. We'll make a nightcap out of it as soon as I find a corkscrew.
Lock the doors.
Judy's lost her equilibrium.
You'll lose something else if you put that stuff on top of it.
I'm getting used to losing things.
Did you ask him?
Is that why you're celebrating?
He wouldn't tell me.
Said it had nothing to do with us.
So, it seems that that's that. It's all over.
You're gonna let him go it all by himself?
Did you ever hear the word ''trust''?
I did once, but I forgot it.
I don't blame him for not telling you.
Maybe he wanted to find out what he'd got.
You're no good and you never were.
Give me that before you cut your hand.
I used to wonder if I was right when we broke up.
- I don't have to worry any more.
- What did I do?
You don't know what I'm talking about.
You've got some listening to do and you're gonna hear every word.
It'll do you good.
What do you care what he did? Why do you have to know? Wipe your eyes.
If it was so bad he can't tell you, how d'you think he feels?
You're like all the rest, you don't know what it means to stick. Blow your nose.
Now go to bed.
Hey, you! Don't come in, don't come in!
- What are you doing here?
- I've been taking a bath.
I know that. You've got a nerve.
You can't take a bath in a washbasin.
- Why pick on my room?
- It's the only clean one I could find.
- Hurry it up, will you?
- I'm hurrying.
- What's all this?
- What?
All this cooking.
That's coffee. Don't touch it, it's hot!
- I told you...
- Go away, go away.
- I'll put butter on it.
- I don't want any butter on it.
- My grandmother always used butter.
- I don't care.
It's still boiling. What's all this about?
I thought I'd like a nice cup of coffee.
It's so cold outside and so cosy in here.
- Would you like one?
- No. Get out and take this...
- I thought you never did that.
- Did what?
Got burned twice in the same place.
Geoff? Geoff?
Geoff, I'm... Oh.
- I'm sorry, I'll go.
- No, it's all right.
- Maybe I'd better go.
- No, please don't.
- I really didn't intend to.
- I wanted to thank Geoff for something.
There's no reason for you not to know.
You were right, I'm no good.
I was only thinking of myself, not how to help him.
I'm glad you didn't tell me what he's done. I just want another chance.
- Why not tell him that?
- When will he be back?
- Two or three hours.
- That's a long time.
Tell Sparks I said you could talk to him on the radio.
Thanks.
I didn't know you had a matrimonial agency on the side.
Just goes to show you how wrong you can be.
- Where do you keep those pictures?
- What pictures?
Those pictures of you as a baby.
- We're right back where we started.
- That was a million years ago.
- What's the matter with your foot?
- I slipped on the porch.
- Don't walk around on it.
- There's nothing the matter with it.
- Let me put you down and look at it.
- I just lost the heel off my slipper.
- Why didn't you say so?
- I have the darndest luck.
Losing one heel right after another.
- You're a queer duck, Bonnie.
- So are you.
Geoff, you don't have to be afraid of me any more.
I'm not trying to tie you down.
I don't wanna plan,
I don't wanna look ahead.
I don't want you to change anything.
I love you, Geoff. There's nothing
I can do about it, I just love you.
I feel the same way that Kid does.
- Anything you do is all right with me.
- The Kid?
Yes, he doesn't ask you for anything or get in your way or bother you, does he?
He drives me nuts.
Hey, Geoff.
Hey, Geoff, I... Oh.
- Oh, sure, come in.
- Sorry.
We might just as well be in Grand Central Station.
I could make a fortune with a hot-dog stand.
I'm sorry. Boys are ready to test those motors.
Oh, all right.
Do you have yours with mustard or without?
- This has gotta be done, Bonnie.
- See if you can find it. It's in there.
- What?
- That picture we were talking about.
And keep the coffee warm, will you?
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- Boat's in, Geoff.
- Thanks, I heard it.
Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Go ahead.
- The boat's in.
Number four will be taking off.
- You can't get through this stuff.
- Gonna try to go over the top.
That don't sound so good. I almost forgot, I need another generator belt.
- What happened?
- Napoleon ate the spare.
- What's he doing in there?
- It's to keep him from blowing away.
- Rig up something.
- With what?
Don't ask me.
A piece of Napoleon's hide.
I'll find something.
- All set out there?
- All ready, Geoff.
Took out all the seats, stripped her clean.
- Fine.
- Yeah, I got 400 pounds.
You know, that's more than twice what I weigh.
I don't suppose there's anything else you can do.
- Look here, Geoff...
- I heard you the first time.
- You're not going.
- Why not?
I'll toss you a coin for it. Heads, I go.
Wait. Go away, go away.
Why are you so anxious about this?
I'm not anxious.
- Heads on both sides.
- Really? No kidding?
- That's right, it is.
- ''That's right, it is.''
No wonder I've been buying you drinks all year.
I wanna go with you, Pop. Please.
- OK, if you feel that way about it.
- Gimme, gimme.
- Put another bottle of oxygen in.
- I already did.
- I'll take a cup of that, Charlie.
- Yes, Mr Geoff.
Dutchy, who went to meet the boat?
Why ask me? You are running this airline, aren't you?
- MacPherson's picking up the mail.
- I want to ask you a question.
Don't you think you are crazy to fly in that weather?
- Get the lights ready.
- I've told you...
Whatever you do, don't think you have to do it for me.
I'd rather be broke. I don't care whether we get that contract or not.
- Don't strain yourself, Dutch.
- What's the use?
- Hello, Bonnie.
- Hello.
- What's this?
- I started that lunch wagon.
The coffee was awfully hot when
I put it in, so don't burn yourself again.
- Thanks, Bonnie.
- Have a nice trip, Geoff.
- See you next week, two o'clock.
- Yes.
- Where are you going?
- Over the room.
- What for?
- My boat's in. I'd better finish packing.
Oh, yeah.
- That's the outfit you came ashore in.
- How did you remember that?
Got a match?
Don't you think it's time you started carrying some?
I'm sorry, Geoff. I'm sorry to be so silly.
I wanted to do this just the way you do.
I was all right until you asked for that match, wasn't I?
- You sure were.
- Just remember it up till then.
Look, Bonnie, are you sorry about...anything?
- Are you?
- No.
I'm not.
So long, Bonnie.
Oh, Geoff! Geoff, I can't let you go.
- This has got to stop.
- No. No, I can't!
- Come on now.
- I won't...I won't let you go.
You're not going to go.
I won't let you kill yourself.
You're gonna do it to keep me from doing it.
- You're just like all the rest.
- No, I'm not!
- Geoff! What have I done?
- Go away, Bonnie.
- Darling, I didn't mean to!
- I know. It's my own fault.
He's shot!
- Shot? Get that coat off.
- Where's the first-aid kit?
In the corner. Does this hurt?
- Get the doctor right away. Who did it?
- I did.
- You? How'd it happen?
- I didn't want him to go.
- He's not likely to now.
- That sure looks bad.
What is this, a sideshow?
Clear out of here.
Don't get excited.
Baldy, get me a drink, will you?
Bonnie, put some water on the stove.
Hold that, Sparks.
It didn't come through, it's still in there.
- Here you are, Geoff.
- Thanks.
- What do you say, Kid?
- It's all right.
- But you're not gonna do much flying.
- You're crazy.
Try to move it. You've joined the rest of us cripples.
- Soon there'll be none of us left.
- Perfect.
- You don't think I can fly her alone?
- You're not good enough alone.
I'm a lot better than anyone you got left around here.
How were you gonna get through?
- Over the top in the new tri-motor.
- Will she go that high?
- I don't know.
- I'll see that you find out.
Kid was going with me.
- You think I might get lost.
- I'll see that you don't.
You don't have to go.
It's not that kind of job.
That's fair enough. There's the mail.
- I'll see you on the field.
- I'll be waiting.
There's a parachute, if you want it.
It's OK.
All clear.
- He'd rather take it out at the hospital.
- Tell him to do it here.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.
Still on instruments, still on instruments.
Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
On top, first layer. On top, first layer.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
Picking up a little ice.
Rate of climb 320. Rate of climb 320.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
Near ceiling, near ceiling.
I never saw one of these things yet could go through the side of a mountain.
Here she goes!
- What have we got under us?
- You're safe till 6,000.
I'll wait till the air is heavier.
- D'you want me to try it again?
- No use.
She's not good enough by more than 1,000 feet.
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Geoff.
- Quiet, Doc.
- We couldn't mak e it.
- Almost 16,000, the bottom fell out.
- Tell him to come back.
Heard you, Geoff. Not coming back.
Don't be a fool, Kid.
I've been flying blind for two months.
Won't do any harm to do it once more.
Come back.
Those are orders, d'you hear?
No dice, Geoff. Signing off.
- Tell Tex to watch for him.
- Calling Lookout.
- Number four is gonna try the pass.
- It's closed in thick er than glue.
All clear below.
Get in one of those chutes and jump.
Is there any reason I can't go, too?
You don't have to.
Which way is the pass from here?
10 degrees north. 3,000 up.
I can hear 'em.
They're starting through.
They're in the pass now.
Kid. Kid, answer.
Kid, answer.
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
They just went by. I tried to talk to them but they wouldn't answer.
- Keep trying.
- OK.
Kid! Kid!
Hey, Kid!
- Kid!
- Yeah?
Get out quick and jump!
There's something broken. I can't move.
- Jump yourself.
- Not this time.
Oh, you fool!
Number four's on fire! They're heading back. I don't think they can make it.
Plug in that outside set.
Get me a coat, somebody.
Turn on the lights in the field.
Kid. Calling number four.
- Calling number four.
- There!
- They'll never get her down.
- Kid, number four, jump! Bail out!
Get them out!
- Get the mail!
- All right!
- We got you.
- He's hurt pretty bad!
Stand back.
All right?
Come on, get out.
Come on!
OK, Doc, that's fine, that's fine.
Cut it out, come on.
Geoff, tell this guy to quit fussing with me.
Let him alone, Doc.
Cigarette, Poppa?
Sure. Here you are.
How's the other guy?
Hands burned and one side of his face.
He's all right, Geoff.
Could have jumped but he didn't.
He sat right there, took it like it was an ice-cream soda.
- Buy him a drink for me.
- Sure I will.
If it hadn't been for those birds, we'd have made it.
Sure you would.
I'd make a windshield at an angle.
Then they'd bounce off.
- Not a bad idea.
- Make you a present of it.
When I get on my feet, we'll work it out.
Or will we?
Your neck's broken, Kid.
Funny.
I wondered why I... couldn't feel anything.
Well...I guess this is it, huh?
Bad sport.
- What is it?
- Get that bunch out of here.
Get out of here. Hurry up.
You too, Doc. Use both feet.
What is it, fella? You can tell me.
- I didn't want them to see me.
- Sure.
- I'm not scared.
- Course you're not.
It's just that...
It's like doing something new.
Like...when I made my first solo.
I didn't want anybody watching then, either.
Yes.
I don't know how good
I'm gonna be at this.
D'you want me to go, too?
I'd hate to pull a boner in front of you, Geoff.
Sure. Sure, I know.
Here you are.
- So long, Kid.
- So long, Geoff.
Hello, Dutch.
Got a match?
Here, the final pay cheques.
The field is closed down.
We are licked.
OK, Dutchy.
- Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Go ahead, Geoff.
Let me know when it clears.
We're all set down here.
What about the Kid, Geoff?
Broke his neck.
Took off a few minutes ago.
- Deal me in.
- Get a seat.
- Hello, Les.
- I took care of everything on the field.
Thanks. Get me a drink, Baldy.
- You send for me, Carter?
- Yes.
The...the Kid asked me to buy you a drink.
Thanks.
Baldy, put it on the table, will you?
- Why not have it with us?
- Sure. Why not? How about you, Judy?
- Thanks.
- Baldy, set 'em up.
- Have that.
- How are the hands coming?
Not bad.
- Here you are, fella.
- He'll spill it.
- Got it?
- OK now?
- Can you make it?
- I'll be all right.
- Here you are, Judy.
- Thanks.
- Come on, drink hearty.
- Here's how.
Here's everything I could find.
- Help yourself.
- No, I don't want any.
Not much to show for 22 years of...
- So long, Sparks.
- Going, Bonnie?
Nobody asked me to stay.
All the things that have been happening to me and I haven't got a picture to show for it.
Aren't you gonna say goodbye to him?
I think you ought to.
You do?
I think he'd want you to.
Are you sure?
He might not act like it, but I think he would.
Well, if you think I ought to.
I think you should.
I don't mind doing it if you say so.
- I do say so.
- You do?
Well, I guess I better go in and do it, then.
- Hello, Geoff.
- Hello, Bonnie.
I...just thought I wanted to...
Well... Sparks said I ought to...
He thought that before I go I'd better...
I don't know why I just...
That's all I wanted to say, was just...
He said you'd like it, but I don't know, you never...
Geoff.
Geoff. Oh, Geoff, you're crying.
Oh, please don't. I...
I'll never be able to...
Never be able to what, Bonnie?
- I'll never be able to say it if you...
- Say what?
I was going to say goodbye.
Geoff...do you want me to stay or don't you?
- Well, Bonnie...
- Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
What's the matter down there?
- Go ahead, Tex.
- Storm's breaking up.
- Wind's down to a whisper.
- Wait a minute.
Sparks! Get him, will you, Bonnie?
- How's the pass?
- Clearing up fast.
- What do you want?
- Wind up number seven.
- Start number seven.
- How about it, Tex?
Stand by. It won't be long now.
Moon's breaking through.
Here she comes.
She's shining harder than $700.
- Let 'em come!
- We're coming. How about it?
- You and me? Let's get going!
- What d'you think of that, Dutchy?
- What is...?
- The pass is clearing.
- Just got time.
- How are you going to fly?
- I've got one good arm.
- I don't know if that's...
Your contract's as good as in the bag.
- Come on, chaps.
- So long, Bonnie.
- Keep that coffee warm.
- I'm going on the boat.
- Yeah?
- Nobody asked me to stay.
- They haven't?
- You won't ask anybody to do anything.
That's right. We'll flip a coin.
Tails you go, heads you stay.
- Heads. What about it?
- I won't stay that way.
- You won't?
- I'm hard to get, Geoff.
All you have to do is ask me.
Here's a souvenir for you.
I like saying goodbye.
So long, Bonnie.
Son of a gun.
Hey!
Hey, Geoff! Ge...
Open the door.
Mrs. David Copperfield, I think.
- Yes.
- Miss Trotwood.
You've heard of her, I dare say?
I... I've had that pleasure.
Now you see her.
Pray, come in.
Oh, tut, tut, tut. Don't do that.
Come, come.
Why, bless my soul, you're a very baby.
I'm old enough to be a widow.
And a mother, if I live.
I'm all in a tremble.
I shall die, I am sure.
Nonsense. Have some tea.
Oh, dear me.
David Copperfield was my favorite nephew.
I'm afraid to admit
I was mortally offended...
...when he married without consulting me. To a wax doll, I heard.
Of course, I'd never seen you.
Now that there's a child coming, what will you call your girl?
Perhaps it will be a boy.
Don't contradict.
I have a presentiment it will be a girl.
And I shall be her godmother.
She shall be christened
Betsey Trotwood Copperfield.
She must be well brought-up.
I shall see to that.
Far better than my impractical nephew would have done.
Mr. Copperfield has been dead only six months.
It is cruel of you to speak unkindly of him to me.
Peggotty...
- Peg...
- My lamb. My lamb. My precious.
- I'll fetch the doctor.
- Come, come, come. Don't dawdle.
- Fetch the doctor.
- My lamb. My baby.
- Peggotty's here, my sweet.
- Come, come.
I beg your pardon, ma'am.
I say, I beg your pa...
I beg your pardon, ma'am.
This is Dr. Chillip.
Dr. Chillip. I am happy to congratulate you. All is now over, and well over.
Mercy on the man.
What's he doing? Can't he speak?
- Some local irritation, ma'am.
- Fiddlesticks.
How is she?
Well, as comfortable as one can expect a young mother to be.
But the baby, how is she?
She, ma'am?
I apprehended you had known.
- It's a boy.
- A boy?
David.
David.
Poor Father.
How lonely and dark it must be for him at night.
While we're at home by the fire.
Davy.
I would have you, if you will...
...pursue with me...
...into the gracious and eternally lovely...
...qualities of charity.
I hope, and indeed I know...
...having lived among you all for so many years...
...that it is not an unknown thing...
...a quality foreign to many of you.
And yet, how well also I know...
...that you may, in the difficulties of your daily life...
...find that the qualities of charity...
...are not always so easy, so ready to observe...
...as one may fancy...
That man. He is like the black panther in my animal book, Mama.
- Hush, dear. He's a friend of Mother's.
- Daily work and toil, in which we...
"When in summer months the streams run dry...
...the crocodile seeks out new waters wherein to live.
But if the stream merely becomes lower...
...it buries itself in the mud and waits for rain. "
Bed, Master Davy?
Mummy promised me I could wait up.
I'm not sleepy.
Were you ever married, Peggotty?
Lord, no.
You're a very handsome woman, aren't you?
Me, handsome, Davy?
Oh, drat them buttons.
Now read me some more about the "crokindills. "
Some sort of a vegetable, ain't it?
Mama!
Mama, I've waited up.
I knew you would, my darling.
This little fellow is highly privileged.
- Why, Davy.
- Dear little boy.
- I cannot wonder at his devotion.
- But, Davy, you shouldn't be rude.
Mr. Murdstone's taken so much trouble to bring me home.
Let us say good night, my fine boy.
Good night.
Come, come.
Let us be the best of friends.
- Why, Davy, that's the wrong hand.
- No, no, no.
A brave little fellow.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Oh, Mother, you do look pretty tonight.
- Do I, darling?
Hope you had a pleasant evening, ma'am.
Much obliged to you, Peggotty.
I had a very pleasant evening.
A stranger or so makes an agreeable change.
No, no, it won't do.
No price would make it do. No, no.
How can you be so aggravating, you cruel thing?
Not such a one as this,
Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked.
- That I say, and that I swear.
- Good heavens, you'll drive me mad.
Was ever any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am?
What have you got against Mr. Murdstone?
Is it to be hinted I'm lacking in affection for my precious treasure?
The dearest little fellow that ever was.
Nobody never went and hinted no such thing.
Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy?
Am I a nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama?
- I don't love you at all, do I?
- Oh, yes, you do.
I never meant to hurt you, ma'am.
I never meant.
- Master David.
- Yes, Peggotty?
How would you like to spend a fortnight with me at my brother's at Yarmouth?
Wouldn't that be a treat?
Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?
Oh, what an agreeable man he is.
- He's a fisherman.
- Oh, I say, Peggotty.
Oh, and there are the boats and the sea.
But, Peggotty, what will Mama do while we're away?
She can't sleep in this big room all by herself.
Oh, bless you. Don't you know?
Why, she's going to stay with friends.
She'll have plenty of company.
If that's it, I'm ready to go.
Splendid. Now, to bed.
- Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye, Mother.
Take precious care of him, Peggotty.
For dear sake, take care of yourself, ma'am.
Drive very safely, won't you, dear Mr. Barkis.
- Come on.
- Goodbye, Mama.
Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye, Mama. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Davy.
Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, my love.
Goodbye.
Oh, there's my Ham.
Growed out of all knowledge.
Ham!
Hi.
- Ham!
- Auntie Clara, how are you?
Who's that one?
That's Ham, her nephew.
- No sweethearts, I believe?
- A what?
- No person courting her.
- Oh, no, no.
Well...
When you is talking to her private...
...perhaps you'd tell her that Barkis is willing.
"That Barkis is willing"?
Is that all the message?
Well, yes.
Barkis is willing.
V ery well, Mr. Barkis. I'll tell her.
Yon's our house, Master Davy.
Put me down, if you please.
Put me down.
- It's a real boat that's been on the water?
- Yes.
But it's upside down.
It's all so delightful.
See the pretty dears.
Well, mates, how are you?
- Lass.
- Daniel.
Well, sir. I'm glad to see you, sir.
Very glad.
You'll find us rough, sir, but you'll find us ready.
How's my little Em'ly?
Blue like your eyes, my pretty.
That come in a big boat all the way from France.
Thank you.
Oh, drat that chimney.
I'm a lone, lorn creature.
And everything goes contrary with me.
It'll soon leave off, old girl.
- It's the same for all of us.
- But I feel it more.
Oh, I have a visitation in the back.
It's the creeps.
Too bad. Too bad.
Oh, I ain't what I could wish myself to be, Daniel.
I better go in the poorhouse and die, and be a riddance.
She be thinking of the old one.
- Mr. Peggotty?
- Yes, sir?
Did you give your son the name Ham because you lived in a sort of ark?
No, sir. 'Twas given by his father, my brother Joe.
Dead, Mr. Peggotty?
Drowndead.
But little Em'ly, Mr. Peggotty...
...she's your daughter, isn't she?
No, sir.
My brother-in-law Tom was her father.
Dead, Mr. Peggotty?
Drowndead.
Haven't you any children then,
Mr. Peggotty?
No, master. I'm a bachelor.
A bachelor?
Why, who's that, Mr. Peggotty?
That's Mrs. Gummidge.
- Gummidge? Why, I thought...
- Come, Davy. Come.
I'll show you to your room.
Now, that Mrs. Gummidge, her husband was Dan's partner.
He was drowned.
- Was he the "old one"?
- Yes, dear.
Em'ly and her cousin Ham are orphans.
My brother adopted them.
And Mrs. Gummidge too.
Oh, he's as good as gold and as true as steel.
But he gets very angry when people talk about his helping people.
I'll be careful.
Oh, Peggotty...
...I just remembered. I have a message for you from Mr. Barkis.
What message?
All he said was, "Barkis is willing. "
I like his impudence.
What is it?
What are you laughing at, Peggotty?
What is it?
Drat the man. He wants to marry me.
But I wouldn't leave you or your mother for a whole basket of buttons.
Especially now.
Why not?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
I would go way over there in a big ship.
That's France, where my blue beads come from. And Spain is there.
We're only poor fisher-folk.
But someday I might be a lady and go everywhere.
And take Mr. Peggotty.
He's a good man.
Good? If I was ever to be a lady,
I'd give him...
...a sky-blue coat with diamond buttons and a cocked hat...
...and a box of money. Look.
I'm going to France.
Em'ly! Come back, quickly!
Em'ly, Em'ly, come here!
That's fun, dancing near the edge.
Mama, Mama, we're here.
Come along.
Mama.
Where's Mama?
Wait a bit, Master Davy, and I'll tell you something.
Where's Mama? What's the matter?
She's not dead, Peggotty.
Bless you, no. No.
Something's wrong, Peggotty.
What do you think, Master Davy?
You've got a pa. A new one.
- A new one?
- Come and see him.
I don't want to see him.
But you want to see your mama.
Come, Davy.
"... preacher of the gospel, with some compliments from the presbytery...
...by whom it was bestowed. Bu... "
- Davy.
- Clara, my dear, recollect.
Control yourself.
Davy boy, how do you do?
Well, I put the storeroom in order.
Goodness knows it needed it.
Tubs, jars, old tea chests...
...pickles, peppers, and no end of rubbish.
Is this your boy, sister-in-law?
Yes. David, this is Miss Murdstone.
Generally speaking, I don't like boys.
How do you do, boy?
I am very well, and I hope you are.
Wants manner.
Clara, I'm here, as you know, to relieve you of all the trouble I can.
You're far too pretty and thoughtless to manage a house properly.
If you'll give me your keys.
Why, I... All of them?
You'll find everything will go on well without disturbing you.
But I should like to be consulted about any changes in my own house.
"My own house"?
- Our own house, I mean.
- Edward, let there be an end to this.
- I go tomorrow.
- Jane Murdstone, will you be silent.
Clara, I wonder at you.
I'm sure I managed very well before we were married.
- Ask Peggotty if I didn't.
- Clara, you astound me.
Even if I don't do everything quite right...
...I thought you were pleased once at my being a little inexperienced.
I'm sure you said so.
I did have a certain satisfaction in the thought of forming your character.
And giving to it the firmness and decision that it lacked.
But when my sister is kind enough to come here...
...and assume a condition something like a housekeeper's...
...and when she meets with a base return...
...my own feeling toward you chills.
Oh, don't, my love. Don't, Edward.
Don't say that. I can't bear it.
Whatever I am, I am affectionate.
- I must have affection.
- No display of emotion...
...can have the least weight with me.
You'll lose breath.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I have a great many defects, I know.
It is very good of you to endeavor to correct them.
- Very well.
- Then it is understood...
...I am to attend to everything in the future?
Yes, Jane. I don't object to anything.
Only, pray, let us be friends.
I couldn't live under coldness and unkindness.
I'm so sorry.
David, go to your room.
Master Davy, you're not to sleep in your dear mama's room anymore.
You're to have a room all to yourself.
Does Mama know?
Peggotty, come here. I want you.
"All crocodiles are flesh-eaters.
But due to forced circumstance...
...live mostly on water. "
Where is the boy?
Late for his lessons, as usual.
My dear Clara...
...all winter long I've observed your attempts to teach David.
He grows ever more sullen and stubborn.
Makes no progress whatever.
Forgive me, dear Edward...
...but Davy has always been considered very bright at his studies.
How are the 40 English counties divided?
There are six in the north,
18 middle counties and... And...
And...
And six in the east and... And...
And... And in the south, there are...
Clara?
And in the south, there are...
In the south...
Oh, Davy, Davy.
Now, clara, don't say "Oh, Davy, Davy. "
That's childish.
He knows his lesson or he does not know it.
He does not know it.
I'm really afraid he does not.
Edward, please.
David, sit down.
Take your slate.
If I go to a cheesemonger shop and buy 100 Double Gloucester cheeses...
...at fourpence-halfpenny each...
And if I sell half of them at sixpence-halfpenny...
...20 at fivepence...
...and use the rest myself...
...do I make a profit or loss?
I can't think! I can't do it!
- Oh, Davy. Davy.
- I can't do it.
- So.
- Edward, please.
- I've been often flogged myself.
- To be sure, of course.
I feel not quite well.
We can hardly expect Clara to bear with perfect firmness...
...the worry and torment
David has occasioned her.
David, you and I will go upstairs, boy.
Don't, Mr. Murdstone, sir, don't.
- Don't...
- Edward!
Clara. You a perfect fool?
In your condition.
I knew my lessons, sir.
David, come here.
If I have an obstinate horse or a dog to deal with, what do you think I do?
I don't know.
I beat him.
I make him wince and smart.
I say to myself,
"I'll conquer that fellow. "
And if it were to cost him all the blood he had, I'd do it.
Mr. Murdstone, sir, don't.
Pray don't beat me, sir.
I tried to learn. I think I could do it with my mother, alone.
But I can't when you and
Miss Murdstone are staring at me.
- Can't you, David? We shall see.
- Indeed, I can't.
Oh, Mr. Murdstone, don't, sir!
So he bites, does he?
Mr. Murdstone!
Mother, Mother!
Be as soft as a mouse, or the cat will hear us.
Is Mama very angry with me, Peggotty?
Not at all.
Mama's not very well.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Don't be frightened, my precious.
Soon you'll be having a little brother or sister.
David, dear, if I don't come to see you often...
...it ain't because I don't love you.
It's because I think it's better for you...
...and for someone else besides.
Oh, thank you, Peggotty.
Hasten, Dr. Chillip, she's in great pain.
Peggotty. Peggotty!
Peggotty, what's happened?
Peggotty! Peggotty! Mother! Mother!
Oh, Mother, Mother!
Peggotty! Peggotty! Peg...!
Peggotty.
Peggotty.
Peggotty! Peggotty!
Peggotty! Peggotty!
Peggotty! Peggotty!
Peggotty! Peggotty!
- Peggotty's here, darling.
- Oh, Peggotty.
- Peggotty's here.
- Peggotty, where were you? Peggotty.
Young as you are, David...
...you've learned to be brave.
Your mama...
...the precious, the darling...
...she's...
She's...
She's dead.
She's gone.
And your little brother, the innocent...
...he's dead too.
- Oh, Peggotty. Oh, Peggotty.
- There, there.
Just before the end, she said to me:
"I shall never see my pretty darling again. "
How did she know that?
Something seemed to tell her, and it was the truth.
But she whispered to me:
"I'm very tired.
God keep my fatherless boy.
Tell him his... His mother blessed him. "
It was near daybreak when she turned to me...
...put her poor head on my arm...
...and died.
Like a child going to sleep.
Oh, Peggotty, we're all alone now.
Davy.
- Goodbye, Peggotty.
- Goodbye, my precious, my love.
Peggotty won't forget you.
I've taken nothing but what belongs to me, ma'am.
- You'd like to see, perhaps.
- Thank you.
I've seen quite enough of you and your things. Good day.
- Goodbye to you, ma'am.
- David, don't dawdle.
Don't be unhappy, David.
I'll be happy, Peggotty.
And I'll see you sometimes.
Oh, but Peggotty, you haven't given
Mr. Barkis his proper answer, you know.
Oh, bless the boy. Answer to what?
Barkis is willing.
What would you say, darling, if I was to marry Mr. Barkis?
I should think it would be a very good thing.
You would always have the horse and cart to bring you to see me in.
Oh, the sense of the boy.
We have come to a decision regarding your future...
Jane Murdstone, leave this to me, if you please.
I'm afraid I've no place for you in my house now.
You have a rebellious disposition.
It must be conformed to the ways of the working world.
It must be bent, even broken, if necessary.
Crushing is what it wants.
Crushed it shall be.
Jane Murdstone, please.
The sooner you begin your fight with the world, the better.
In London, there is a firm of Murdstone & Grinby in the wine trade.
- Yes.
- It gives employment to several boys.
It shall give employment to you.
Yes, sir.
You will earn your own food and pocket money.
Your lodging I've arranged for with Mr. Micawber.
Yes, sir.
Now, remember, you're going to London to work.
To work. To work.
Stop hiding, Micawber.
We know you're in there.
We're not gonna wait forever for you to pay your debts.
Don't pay, we'll take the rest of your goods.
Yes, and precious little there.
Micawber, either you pay or you go to the debtors' prison.
Nobody home. No collectors encouraged.
Master Wilkins. Master Wilkins, stop it.
Get up.
Oh, to see Mama's beautiful bed so desecrated by those low creatures.
Please, ma'am, I'm David copperfield.
I was told I was to lodge here.
Oh, welcome, Master Copperfield.
I am Mrs. Micawber. This is my family.
I'm clickett, the orfling from Saint Luke's Orphanage.
Mind your manners, Clickett.
I never thought before I was married...
...when I lived with Papa and Mama...
...that I should ever find it necessary to take a lodger.
Stop it, dear. Stop it.
I was forgetting.
You must be impatient to see your room.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come, dear.
Be careful.
Baked potato, baked potato here.
Baked potato, sir?
- No, thanks.
- They're all hot, sir.
Even so.
We're not gonna wait forever.
Pay us your debts.
If you don't pay, we take all there is...
No luxury, but simple comfort.
Pay up, Micawber! Pay up, Micawber!
Micawber!
Come out and pay your bills!
Mr. Micawber. Children, it is your papa.
So relentlessly pursued o'er aerial housetop...
...and vice versa...
...I have thwarted the malevolent machinations of our scurrilous enemies.
In short...
...I have arrived.
My bun. My little cutie.
My children, my own.
This is Master David Copperfield, who has come to lodge with us.
Oh, just so. Pardon me, children.
All that we have is yours,
Master Copperfield.
Our domestic comfort, the quiet, the privacy...
...call them your own.
- Thank you, sir.
Count on us, now and forever.
I will, Mr. Micawber.
Now, as you're about to share with us the privileges of our domain...
...I will make no stranger of you.
As man to man, I will confide in you...
...that for years I have been hounded, most unjustly, by my creditors.
Shortsighted fools, they are.
I'm sorry, sir.
I grant you that I have already tried the coal trade...
...the haberdashery trade...
...and Her Majesty's marines...
...and found none of these entirely suited to my somewhat special talents.
- But now...
- Yes, Mr. Micawber?
I am confidently expecting something to turn up.
Hey, my covey, you've been here three weeks, ain't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Then why ain't you learned nothing?
- Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
- Put your back into it.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
In the aggregate, I judge you to be a highly distasteful collection.
And in detail: Cowardly, uncouth, and deserving of merciless chastisement.
You will oblige me by removing your unsavory persons...
...from my immediate vicinity.
In short, get out!
Oh, thank you, Mr. Micawber, you're so kind to me.
Not at all.
And now, since this is a red-letter day...
...in that I am hourly expecting something extraordinary to turn up...
...let us return...
...and discover what culinary triumphs
Mrs. Micawber has prepared for us.
Oh, how wonderful.
Imperative, my dear Copperfield.
Imperative.
For, as I have frequently had occasion to observe...
...when the stomach is empty, the spirits are low.
I predict, my dear Copperfield...
...that we can confidently depend upon Mrs. Micawber...
...assembling a tureen of cock-a-leekie soup.
Veal cutlet, breaded...
...and a jug of egg, hot.
- And a pudding?
- A pudding.
A suet pudding, the very thing.
Wilkins Micawber?
You are under a misapprehension, my good fellow.
- Walk.
- No, you don't. You're Micawber.
You owe me 2 pounds 10 for the last year. Officer, do your duty.
Wilkins Micawber, you're under arrest.
Upon what authority do you take this unwarrantable procedure?
Court order for debt.
I'm the assistant officer to the sheriff of Middlesex.
Now, are you coming quietly?
Copperfield, you perceive before you...
...the shattered fragment of a temple once called man.
The blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered.
The god of day goes down upon the dreary scene.
In short, I am forever flawed.
Oh, you're always ringing that bell...
...but today's the last time.
Your friend Micawber is being released and is leaving town.
- He's leaving town?
- Come along, come along.
What is it?
Come, little friend, open your heart.
It's only...
...that I shall miss you so very much.
At Murdstone & Grinby
I feel so alone and desperate.
I do, indeed.
You've been so good to me, you and Mrs. Micawber.
And as long as I had such friends,
I couldn't despair.
My little friend, you're like one of our own.
But now that you are going and there'll be nobody...
...well, I don't know what I shall do.
Indeed, I do not.
My motto has always been,
"Nil desperandum. "
In short, "Never despair. "
I have an aunt in Dover.
- I thought perhaps I...
- The very thing, my dear Copperfield.
Your aunt will welcome you with open arms.
She may not want to see me.
Is not blood thicker than water?
But Peggotty told me she's very cantankerous...
...and perhaps she'd shut me out.
And Dover's a long way.
True, too true.
Nevertheless, as the Bard says:
"Nothing attempted, nothing gained. "
And should this formidable aunt repulse you...
...write me a letter.
We are friends for life, young Copperfield.
We two have run around the braes
- And pulled the gowans fine
- And pulled the gowans fine, and...
Although what gowans are,
I'm not exactly aware.
However, we'll take a pull at them just the same.
- Bring that bag there.
- Wilkins! Wilkins!
- Put that box on the coach.
- Children, be careful.
Well, push it up, that one.
Shades of Nicodemus.
- Sorry, sir.
- You clumsy lout.
Master Copperfield, your conduct's always been...
...of the most delicate and obliging description.
You have never been a lodger.
You have been a friend.
Copperfield, at present,
I have nothing to bestow but advice.
Still, that advice is so far worth taking...
...I have never taken it myself...
...and am the miserable creature you behold.
Young friend, I counsel you.
Annual income, 20 pounds...
...annual expenditure, 19 pounds.
Result: Happiness.
Annual income, 20 pounds...
...annual expenditure, 21 pounds.
Result: Misery.
Farewell, Copperfield.
I shall be happy to approve your prospects...
...in case anything turns up.
Which I may say,
I am hourly expecting.
Thank you, my love.
Thank you, my darling.
Master Copperfield.
Farewell, Copperfield.
Farewell, my lad.
Goodbye, my boy.
Bye, my friend, goodbye.
I say, sixpence worth of bad halfpence...
...I hope you know me again when you see me.
I wasn't staring at you to be rude.
I was wondering if you could take my box to the Dover coach office.
I can pay you sixpence.
Are you sure you've got the money to pay me?
Oh, yes.
Let me see it.
I have it here.
- Stop. Give me back my money!
- Ask the marines for it, stupid.
He's taken all my money!
Give me back my box!
Out of the way, you blighter!
Watch where you're going!
Janet! Donkeys!
I won't be trespassed upon.
Get off the green!
I've told you young rascals not to ride across this green.
- Don't you dare. Don't you dare.
- We're going to go right through, we are.
- You can't stop it.
- Hey, I'll be your witness.
Stop hitting.
Don't you dare to cross this green.
If you please, ma'am.
Go away. Go along. No boys here.
If you please, Aunt.
I'm your nephew.
Bless my soul alive!
I'm David copperfield of Blunderstone...
...where you came on the night
I was born and saw my dear mama.
I've been very unhappy since she died.
I've been slighted and taught nothing and put to work not fit for me.
It made me run away to you.
I was robbed before setting out, and have walked all the way...
...and have never slept in a bed since I first began the journey.
- My dear.
- Look at me now.
My dear. Oh, bless my soul.
My soul alive.
Mercy, oh, mercy. Oh, mercy on this...
Bless my soul.
Come, swallow this.
Swallow this.
Mercy on you. Come, swallow this.
Swallow this.
Come, come.
Bless my soul. Lie down. Lie down.
- Ma'am, what's happened?
- Mercy, on this.
Bless my soul. Bless my soul.
Bless my soul.
Mr. Dick, don't be a fool, whatever you are.
Because nobody can be more discreet than you can, when you choose.
You've heard me mention
David Copperfield.
David Copperfield? David?
Oh, to be sure. Certainly.
He's done a pretty piece of business.
He's run away.
Now, the question I put to you is:
What shall I do with him?
- "Do with him"?
- Come, come, come.
I want some sound advice.
Don't pretend to be woolgathering when you're as sharp as a surgeon's lancet.
Why, if I was you, I should...
I should wash him.
Janet, Mr. Dick sets us all right.
- Heat the bath.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mercy on us, what a dirty child.
- David, David.
Look, bubbles as big as my head.
Watch out.
Oh, mercy on us.
- Bless my soul.
- There's a clean boy, yes.
Mercy save the man.
Hurry, child. Tut. Tut.
Let me dry you, or you'll catch your death.
Is he...?
Is Mr. Dick at all out of his mind?
He's been called mad...
...or I shouldn't have the benefit of his society.
As for advice, nobody knows what that man's mind is but myself.
He's a distant relative of mine.
If it hadn't been for me...
...his own brother would have had him shut up for life.
He's writing a petition to the Lord Chancellor now...
...to get his rights back.
He's the most friendly creature in existence.
May I...? May I stay here with you, Aunt?
I don't know until I've had a talk with your stepfather.
- To bed with you, now. To bed with you.
- Oh, but I'Il... Please.
Bless my soul.
Bless my soul. Bless my soul.
Bless my soul. Mercy on us.
Our Father, who art in heaven...
...hallowed be thy name for bringing me here.
And please,
I don't want anyone to take me away.
Please, God, please may I have a home now...
...like Mama and I had once.
And let no boys be homeless.
I'm sorry, God, I'm very sleepy...
...because I walked such a long, long way.
And I...
Cherub.
How does the world go?
I'll tell you what,
I shouldn't wish it to be mentioned.
It's a mad world. Mad as bedlam, boy.
Aunt Betsey sends her compliments...
...and asks how you are getting on with your petition.
I believe I'm doing very well.
Do you remember the date...
...that King Charles I had his head cut off?
I believe it was in the year 1649.
Well, so the books say, but I don't see how that can be.
Because if it was so long ago...
...how could the trouble have got out of his head when it was cut off...
...and into mine?
- I'm sure I don't know.
It's very strange.
King charles' head is always popping into whatever I write.
But no matter. No matter.
- What do you think of that for a kite?
- It's a beautiful one.
I made it. We'll go and fly it, you and I.
David. Come, come.
Just coming, Aunt. Coming.
David, your stepfather's coming today.
Must I go away with him, Aunt?
I don't know anything about it.
I can't say I'm sure. We shall see.
Janet, donkeys.
Go on with you! Get off the green!
You have no business here!
But, Aunt, that's Mr. Murdstone and his sister.
I don't care who it is,
I won't be trespassed upon.
Janet, donkeys.
Oh, Janet.
- How dare you? How dare you?
- They're the same rascals as before.
- Clear off. Clear off now.
- How dare you?
Be off with you! Be off with you!
You bold-faced thing.
This is most outrageous.
Go away.
Scat!
- Mr. Murdstone and his sister, ma'am.
- Show them in.
- Shall I go away, Aunt?
- No, sir. Certainly not.
I don't allow anybody to ride over that turf. I make no exceptions.
- Your rule is awkward to strangers.
- Is it?
Miss Trotwood.
You are Mr. Murdstone.
Mr. Dick, an old and intimate friend...
...on whose judgment I rely.
Be seated.
- Well, sir.
- Miss Trotwood, I...
Of all the boys in the world,
I believe this one is the worst.
Jane Murdstone, will you have the goodness not to interrupt me.
Miss Trotwood, I am here to take David back.
I shall deal with him as I think best.
But I warn you that if you step in between him and me now...
...you step in forever.
I'm not to be trifled with.
For the first and last time, is he ready to go?
And you, ma'am.
Have you anything to say?
I have nothing to add, except to thank you for your politeness.
Your very great politeness, I'm sure.
And what does the boy say?
Are you ready to go, David?
Please, don't let me go.
They made my poor mama very unhappy.
They've never liked me or been kind to me.
Please let me stay with you, Aunt.
And you, Mr. Dick. What do you think
I should do with this child?
"Do"? Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly.
Mr. Dick, give me your hand.
Your common sense is invaluable.
I'll take my chance with the boy.
If he's all you say he is...
...at least I can do as much for him as you have done.
But I don't believe a word of it.
Miss Trotwood, if you were a gentleman, I'd...
- Stuff and nonsense. Don't talk to me.
- How exquisitely polite.
You think I don't know what kind of a life you led this boy's mother...
...that poor, unhappy child you married?
A woeful day it was for that soft little creature...
...when you first came her way, smirking and making great eyes at her.
I'll be bound. As if you couldn't say... to a goose.
I never heard anything so elegant.
Smooth and silky you were.
The poor little innocent had never seen such a man.
He was made of sweetness.
He worshiped her, doted on her dear little boy.
He was to be another father to him.
And they were all to live together in a garden of roses.
And when you had made sure of her, you began to break her...
...to train her like a poor caged bird, wearing her life away...
...teaching her to sing your notes.
- This is either insanity or intoxication.
- You're a tyrant.
You tormented that simple child through her boy here.
That is why the sight of him is odious to you.
You broke her heart and gave her wounds that she died of.
- And there's the truth for you.
- The woman is mad.
Good day to you, sir. And goodbye.
Good day to you, ma'am.
Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again.
As sure as there's a head on your shoulders...
...I'll knock your bonnet off and tread on it!
Now, clear out. Go along with you.
Go along with you, go along.
Thank you. Oh, thank you, Aunt.
King Charles is king of the castle.
King Charles is king of the castle.
- King Charles is king of the castle.
- King Charles is king of the castle.
But why must I go away, Aunt Betsey?
I want to stay with you and Mr. Dick.
You have to be educated, David, and take your place in the world.
There isn't a finer school in canterbury than Dr. Strong's.
You must make us proud, David.
Never be mean in anything.
Never be false. Never be cruel.
Avoid these three vices, and I can always be hopeful of you.
V ery well, Aunt. I'll try.
There's a good boy. Isn't he, Mr. Dick?
The finest boy in England.
But I love you and Mr. Dick so much.
- I don't want to go away.
- Now, now.
What a kind man you're going to live with, Mr. Wickfield...
...my business advisor and good friend.
He has such a pleasant old house.
And canterbury isn't far away.
- How was school today, David?
- Great fun.
And what do you think happened, Agnes?
Steerforth, the head boy, you know, and everyone's hero...
...let me bowl to him at cricket.
And he walked back to the school with me.
How fine.
Papa, you're tired.
Yes. Yes, Agnes. Perhaps I am.
Shall I take those papers downstairs,
Father dear?
My little guardian...
...ever since her mother died.
- May I take them, Mr. Wickfield?
Thank you, David.
Thank you.
You're working late tonight, Mr. Heep.
Master Copperfield.
Pray, Master Copperfield, do call me Uriah, if you please.
- Certainly.
- Yes.
I'm improving my legal knowledge.
I suppose you are quite a great lawyer.
Me? Oh, no, Master Copperfield.
I'm a very humble person,
I'm well aware.
My mother is likewise humble.
We live in an humble abode.
We've many things to be thankful for.
My father's former calling was humble.
He was a sexton.
What is he now?
He's a partaker of glory at present,
Master Copperfield.
I'm thankful for my place here with Mr. Wickfield.
Oh, what a worthy gentleman he is.
Perhaps you'll be a partner in his business one of these days.
Me? Oh, no, Master Copperfield.
I'm far too humble for that.
I should think you would come into the business at last.
- Why, I have no views of that sort.
- Oh, yes, I think you will.
Certainly. Oh, I know.
And won't Miss Agnes be glad, eh?
Mother will be expecting me.
Will it suit your convenience if I snuff the candle?
Yes, Uriah.
- Good night, Master Copperfield.
- Good night, Uriah.
Latin verses.
If it weren't for you, Agnes,
I should never have learned them.
Steerforth, how handsome.
How astonishingly clever he was.
Always so generous.
Agnes, do you remember this?
Oh, what fun we used to have on those Sunday walks.
Remember?
I carved a little wooden heart for you with my first penknife.
Oh, but you'll have lost that years ago.
We really must finish your packing, David...
...or we'll be late for the party at school. Here.
Oh, you can't imagine how excited I am.
A few days' holiday...
...and a short visit with my beloved Peggottys at Yarmouth.
And then London, to start serious work on my book.
Agnes?
Those are tears in your eyes.
Father and I, in this quiet old place, will be sorry when you're gone.
Oh, but I shan't be at the other end of the world.
I'll write to you and see you often.
I shall always want to confide in you, Agnes.
Whatever happens, whenever I fall in trouble or...
Even when you fall in love?
Even then.
You know, my only wonder is...
...you've not been in love yourself by this time.
But I know of no one who deserves to love you.
Someone better than anyone
I've ever seen here...
...must rise up before I'd give my consent.
- Oh, David.
- Even then, I should hesitate.
How proud we shall be when your first book is completed.
How much I shall owe to you, if it ever is completed.
What faith I ever had in my writing was given me by you.
I shall miss you like my right hand.
Although that doesn't say much.
For there's no head in my right hand, and no heart.
And they both will miss you terribly.
Oh, Master Copperfield.
Mr. Copperfield, I should say.
I'm so busy, I didn't see you.
You seem very busy indeed these days, Uriah.
Yes, I'm so glad to be of use to Mr. Wickfield.
What an excellent man he is. But...
...how imprudent he has become.
If anyone else had been in my place during the last few years...
...he'd have had Mr. Wickfield under his thumb.
Under his thumb.
But I'm the humble instrument that's humbly serving him.
Pardon me.
I assume that this imposing edifice houses the brightest star...
...in my firmament of earthly companions.
I allude to Master David Copperfield.
- Micawber!
- Copperfield.
Mr. Micawber, how wonderful to see you in Canterbury.
Thank you.
This successful conclusion of my peregrinations...
...through highways and byways is a happy augury...
...that something extraordinary is bound to turn up.
Will you excuse me, please?
Mr. Micawber, this is Uriah Heep...
...who works for my good friend,
Mr. Wickfield.
How do you do.
Any friend of my friend Copperfield has a personal claim upon me.
Oh, thank you, thank you, sir.
But I am too humble to be called a friend, Mr. Micawber.
I'm grateful to Mr. Copperfield for his kindness.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
A man, I perceive, of remarkable shrewdness.
- Ah, fruit.
- Now, tell me, how is Mrs. Micawber?
Mrs. M. Is, I am pleased to state, in status quo.
In short, were it not for unfortunate circumstances...
...not unconnected with finance...
- Tell me.
- No, no.
I should never be able to hold my head erect before my fellow man.
Still, I confide in you that we are being held...
...virtually as prisoners at the Sun Inn.
- The sum involved is admittedly trifling.
- Oh, you must allow me.
- Never. Never.
- Oh, please. I insist.
You overwhelm me.
Your generosity floors me.
- Goodbye, Mr. Micawber.
- Goodbye.
I am impressed with your friend Heep.
He has been good enough to offer me employment...
...in a confidential capacity.
- Then something did turn up.
Perhaps the foundation of a new career.
I have acquaintance with the law, only as a defendant, of course.
Would it be too much to hope that Mr. Micawber...
...would eventually be eligible for a judge or a chancellor?
Yes, he'd be eligible.
- I wish you all success.
- Thank you.
Have a good holiday.
Enjoy London, and have a good time with all your old friends at Yarmouth.
Why they should have such an unchristian name as Peggotty, I don't know.
Oh, thank you, Aunt.
Thank you for everything.
Oh, fiddlesticks.
Save your sentiment for Agnes.
David will have no time for sentiment in London...
...seeing his friend Steerforth.
Oh, there's no one like Steerforth.
He belongs to the grand world...
...yet he's as kind and simple as if he were a country cousin like myself.
You're a good friend, David.
I hope he's worthy of you.
Remember, Agnes, I promised.
You'll see how I work at my writing.
- Goodbye, Uriah. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Why, Copperfield, old boy.
Steerforth, I never was so glad.
But, David. David.
Where's the little nipper
I used to order about at school?
"Order about. " It was an honor.
The great Steerforth, head boy.
So kind and protective to a small nobody.
I shall never forget what a hero you were to me.
My dear David, I was never anybody's hero...
...not even my own. Come on.
Some fine, high-stepping girls dancing tonight, David.
It's a gala evening, Steerforth.
I've always wanted to see
The Enchanted Bird.
Yes, but I can scarcely be excited over an old bird of 40...
...being shot by a bow and arrow.
David, that's the stage.
Oh, Auntie, isn't it lovely?
I say, don't let her notice.
In the next box, the most beautiful girl.
Oh, Steerforth, what heavenly curls.
By Jove, she is pretty.
But those two old dragons with her...
Oh, how wonderful if I could only speak to her.
Oh, but I never shall...
...unless something happens like the theater catching fire.
There's a much easier way than that.
Trust an old hand.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. My glasses.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'll find them in the interval.
In the meanwhile, allow me.
I have an excellent pair.
Oh, thank you, sir. You're most obliging.
- Is not the ballet charming?
- Yes. Yes, indeed.
I'm afraid you can see but half the stage.
I wonder... I dare hardly suggest it, but our box has a better view.
I wonder whether I may not tempt you and the other ladies to share.
Clarissa, do you think...?
Oh, is this not most irregular?
I'm afraid Dora cannot see the ballet too well.
I think we might venture, Lavinia.
A gentleman, I'm sure.
It's too kind. Too much.
Dora, come along.
Now, I trust, you have an adequate view.
- Quite perfect, thank you.
- Too kind of you.
Permit me.
Thank you.
Yes. Yes, I've always considered botany a fascinating subject.
- One learns so much from nature.
- Oh, indeed.
In the quiet of the country at Norwood, we're able to devote our lives to Dora.
I shall be riding often in the direction of Norwood, Miss Spenlow.
Oh, yes, indeed. How agreeable.
Oh, she's like a dove.
We have the most beautiful dovecote at home.
Oh, Miss Spenlow, I'd love to see the dovecote. May I call?
May I call? Would your aunts have any objection?
Can he be so cruel as to shoot her?
- Sometimes love is cruel, Miss Spenlow.
- Do you think so?
Oh, now he's drawn his bow.
- Oh, dear.
- Miss Spenlow.
Be careful. Be careful.
She's escaped.
- She's escaped.
- Please, Miss Spenlow, may I call?
Perhaps, if my aunts permit.
The old sun must be amused...
...by the constant spectacle of romantic lovers.
Come along, Davy.
Let's take them by surprise.
Oh, Steerforth. They're...
They're very simple people.
Why, of course.
And I'll be anything you please.
Comic or sentimental or whatever the scene suggests.
- They're the best people in the world.
- Why, of course they are, David.
Of course they are.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Look who's here.
- Master David.
Em'ly. Ham, how are you?
Mr. Steerforth, this is little Em'ly, sir.
And this is my nephew, Ham, sir.
Mr. Steerforth.
Well, to think of you two gentlemen...
...coming here tonight under this roof.
Come here, my little pet.
Come here, my little Em'ly.
If this ain't the brightest night in your uncle's life...
...as ever was or ever will be,
I'm a shellfish.
Gorm and horroar for it.
Now, listen, mates, there's something I got to tell you.
She knows I was going to tell.
And what does this here blessed tarpaulin do...
...but lose that there heart of his to our little Em'ly.
Tonight he makes so bold as to ask her hand, and she agrees.
I know that if I capsized...
...and was to see the town light shining for the last time...
...I'd go down quiet a-thinking there was a man ashore there...
...iron-true to my little Em'ly as long as that man lived.
I'll lay down my life for her,
Master Davy.
Why, gentlemen, she's more to me than...
She's all to me that I can ever want and more than I can ever say.
There's many a man can say it better.
No man could say it better or deserve happiness more than you, Ham.
- Ham, I give you joy.
- Thank you, sir.
And unless you can induce your niece to return, I shall go.
For such a gap at your fireside tonight...
...I wouldn't make for the wealth of the Indies.
I'll go and fetch the bright-eyed little thing.
It can't be. Davy.
Oh, my darling boy.
It is, Peggotty, it is.
What a fine young figure you are.
- I can't see you for my feelings.
- Dear Peggotty.
I'm so sorry to hear about poor Mr. Barkis.
He went out with the tide, as you may say, Davy.
Oh, he was a good and faithful man.
If your sweet mother could see you now, Davy.
Yes, Peggotty.
Do you remember when she and I danced together in the winter twilight...
...to the old music box?
And the sweet William under the wall.
Oh, but wait. Steerforth, this is my beloved Peggotty.
Why, Peggotty, I've known you so long.
I've known the crocodile book...
...and the work box with St. Paul's cathedral on the lid.
And because of what you've been to Davy, I love you as he does.
I'm proud to know you, sir.
And you're so good to Davy at school.
Here's the little bride.
That's a good thought, mom.
Gather round, young gentlemen.
I'm rough as a sea porcupine, but I makes you welcome.
Thank you, Mr. Peggotty.
And now I have a toast to propose.
A toast to little Em'ly, the flower of Yarmouth.
Here's to her beauty, her happiness and her marriage.
And here's to the one who is to marry her, the luckiest man in all England.
- Em'ly and Ham.
- Ham and Em'ly.
Ham and Em'ly.
Why, David...
...you come upon me like a reproachful ghost.
Not reproachful, Steerforth.
I've been looking at the pictures in the fire.
How I detest this mongrel hour.
Neither day nor night.
What have you been doing?
I've been taking some letters to be posted.
What, Dora again?
Is it twice or three times a day that you write to your divinity?
I envy you.
- What is it, Littimer?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
I've arranged for the boat for the summer.
I think you will find the terms satisfactory, sir.
Exceedingly satisfactory.
Isn't Littimer the perfect servant, David?
Respectable, discreet and a skinflint.
Thank you very much, sir.
You see,
I'm gonna take my yachting seriously.
Oh, we'll have a glorious summer sailing, David.
Two idle apprentices, sailing and daydreaming.
You of your Dora, and I...
Hang it, Littimer, when's the boat to be ready?
It's being freshly rigged, sir, and renamed.
What are you going to call her?
- The Little Em 'ly.
- Oh, won't that make Em'ly proud.
She's an engaging little beauty, that girl.
Isn't that rather a chuckleheaded fellow she's going to marry?
Steerforth. Don't.
Don't pretend to be cynical.
I see how well you understand these simple people...
...and how perfectly you enter into their happiness.
And I admire you for it.
I believe you're in earnest.
I believe you're good, David.
Oh, I wish we all were.
Davy, if anything should ever separate us...
...promise me you'll always think of me at my best.
You have no best for me, Steerforth, and no worst.
Oh, dear, 'tis early come.
A chill autumn creeping up my back.
I'm a lone, lorn creature.
Everything goes contrary with me.
Oh, cheer up, my pretty mother.
No, Daniel, nothing's natural to me but to be lone and lorn.
Oh, come along, old girl.
It hasn't been so bad the past weeks...
...with Master Davy here and Mr. Steerforth to keep us merry.
I know, but I'm lone and lorn.
A real sailorman he's become this summer, Mr. Steerforth.
Always happy sailing along with Ham and Em'ly.
There. That's for little Em'ly.
The path ain't over-bright or cheerful at night...
...so when I'm here and Em'ly's coming home...
...I put the light in the window for her.
Here she is.
Where's Em'ly?
Master Davy, will you come outside a minute...
...and see what Em'ly and me has got to show you?
- Ham, what's the matter?
- Master Davy...
For heaven's sake, tell me.
Her, that I'd have died for...
Would die for now.
Is gone.
- Gone?
- Em'ly's run away.
And I pray God kill her sooner than let her come to disgrace.
You're a scholar, sir.
You know what's right and best.
What am I to say to them indoors?
How am I gonna break it to him,
Master Davy?
What's amiss?
It's Em'ly.
It's a letter, sir, from Em'ly.
You read it, sir. Read it slow.
I don't know as I can understand.
"When you, who loved me so much better...
...than I ever have deserved, see this...
...I shall be far away. "
Far away. Em'ly, far away.
"Never to come back, unless he brings me back a lady.
You that I have wronged, love someone that will be true to you...
...and worthy of you.
Tell Uncle that I never have loved him half so much as now. "
Who's the man?
Master Davy, leave us a bit.
I want to know his name.
A servant came with a strange chaise and horses outside the town.
Almost before day broke.
A man was inside.
A man you know, Master Davy.
Em'ly went to him.
Steerforth.
It ain't no fault of yourn, Master Davy.
I'm far from a laying of it to you.
The man is Steerforth.
As I'm a living soul...
...if I'd one thought of what was in his mind...
...strike me down dead, I'd have drowned him and thought it right.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find my Em'ly.
- Where, Dan?
- Anywhere. No one's stopping me.
No, no, no, Daniel.
Seek her in a little while and that'll be but right.
But not as you are now.
Sit you down.
Give me your forgiveness, Daniel, for ever having been a worry to you.
Oh, what have my contraries ever been to this.
Dan...
...remember her as the little orphan what you took in.
That'll soften your poor heart.
I forgive her. I do forgive her.
But I must find her if it takes to the end of my days.
My dear boy.
His first work, between covers at last.
And how good it is.
I knew one day the promise of his short stories would be fulfilled.
Have you happened to glance at the dedication?
"To the dear one who has given me courage...
...inspiration and love. "
Look for yourself, child.
You know who that means, I suppose.
Oh, no, Aunt Betsey, it couldn't.
David's always thought of me only as a sister.
Tut, tut. Then why should he say in his letter...
...that he has a secret to confide in me?
"The most important decision of my life.
I know that it will make you happy. "
Bless my soul, what's keeping him?
Is the London coach late?
No, my dear, it's as plain as a pikestaff.
He realizes where his happiness lies.
- How I've dreamed that you and he...
- Oh, Aunt Betsey.
I've tried not to show it.
Aunt Betsey.
- Agnes.
- Come, come. Come.
And what is the important news?
I'm in love. Completely, utterly.
With someone... The loveliest, most beautiful...
Her name is Dora Spenlow.
Dora Spenlow?
I hope you've acted wisely, David.
Wisely? Oh, she's more loving, more adorable...
...than I ever dreamed anybody could be.
I'm so glad, David.
So very glad.
Micawber. My good friend, Micawber.
I am too humble to be called a friend.
I... I must stop that.
What does this mean?
- It can't be.
- It is.
My friend Heep has advanced his personal situation.
In short, he is a partner.
- Micawber.
- Your servant.
Don't you think that Heep is rather a peculiar partner for Mr. Wickfield?
My dear Copperfield, all I can say about my friend Heep...
...is that he has responded to my financial appeals with generosity.
In exchange, of course, for my IOUs.
IOUs.
In exchange for them. IOUs.
He has some strange power over Mr. Wickfield, hasn't he?
I should imagine he's made good use of his opportunities here.
Isn't that so?
I am here in a capacity of confidence and trust.
Therefore, allow me to suggest...
...that we do not discuss the affairs of Messrs. Wickfield and Heep.
I offer no offense, I hope.
- As you wish.
- Four o'clock.
May I pour you a dish of tea?
- Coming, coming, Mr. Heep.
- Micawber, Micawber, I want you.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Dear me, what a prophet you turned out to be, Mr. Copperfield, eh?
Remember?
You said I might be a partner of Mr. Wickfield some day.
Yes, Uriah, you've been a great help to me.
My father always used to say to me:
"Be humble, Uriah, and you'll get on.
It's what goes down best. "
"Be humble, Uriah," says Father,
"and you'll do. "
I must say, it ain't done bad.
Here.
Shall we go to the drawing room, Father?
Perhaps a little music?
Have another cordial with Mr. Copperfield and me before you go, sir.
Stay a bit.
- Yes. Yes, I'll stay a bit.
- Yes.
Very well, Father.
Come, fellow partner. If I may take the liberty, I'll give you another toast.
To the divinest of her sex, Agnes.
Agnes Wickfield.
Oh, I know I'm a humble individual to give you her health...
...but I admire, adore her.
May I speak out among friends?
To be her father is a proud distinction.
But to be her husband...
- You...
- What's the matter with you?
- You gone mad?
- My child is all I have.
- Look at him, he dares...
- Please, sir.
Step by step, I've abandoned to him my money, reputation...
...peace and quiet, house and home...
Oh, I kept them for you.
But now I finally see you for what you really are. You...
Stop his mouth, Copperfield.
He might say something he'll be sorry for, and you'll be sorry to have heard.
Eh, fellow partner?
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Father.
Come.
Before we close the subject, you ought to understand...
...that Agnes Wickfield is as far above you and your aspirations...
...as the moon itself.
You've always hated me,
Master Copperfield.
I am well aware.
Thought me too humble.
But now I'm not gonna be pushed to the wall...
...by someone who isn't humble.
All's fair in love.
There.
It takes two to make a quarrel,
Master Copperfield.
I won't be one, and now you know what to expect.
I expect only this from you:
Deceit and treachery.
Oh, dear.
Oh, Doady.
Mind Jip.
That's to punish you for your bad behavior.
Jip. Oh, did he think I could be cross with him?
Jippy, Jippy, I'm not cross anymore.
- Oh, Doady.
- Darling.
Doady. Oh, Doady,
I've been so impatient.
Doady, you've forgotten something.
Doady, you brought me a present.
What is it?
Now, now. I do hope the evening's going to go well...
...and you've a good dinner for Aunt Betsey and Mr. Dick.
Oh, isn't he a tiresome Doady.
Dinner's going to be beautiful.
- Oh, Doady, what's in the parcel?
- Come and get it.
Jippy wants to know.
My dearest little wife.
Doady, what is it?
It's the latest cookery book.
Isn't it a clever Doady.
Oh, but now we can have the most wonderful dinners.
My dear love,
I was shocked at the butcher's bill.
- Where is the account book?
- Oh, it's about. Somewhere.
Here's a recipe for turtle soup.
"Hang the turtle up by its hind legs...
...and before it can draw in its neck, cut off its head. "
Oh, Doady, I could... I couldn't do that.
Sweetmeats.
That sounds nicer, doesn't it, Jippy?
What a mess.
Dora, my life, this is not the place for the easel.
I can't find the account book.
Try the guitar case, or...
Oh, Doady, it's in Jip's pagoda.
Why, Jip, you naughty little thing.
Were you keeping the accounts?
Were you?
Oh, my pet.
All these drawings of flowers and ships.
This seems to be my own likeness.
Jip, apparently, has walked over it.
And as for the accounts, well, they seem very peculiar.
I'm sure I'm very affectionate.
But those figures are so obstinate.
They will not add up.
Oh, Doady. Doady, don't be cross.
Don't be a naughty old bluebeard.
Oh, Doady, look at those wrinkles.
There.
- Oh, my darling.
- Oh, my Doady.
Now, Jip, you mustn't be tiresome.
Jip, tiresome? Dear me, no.
Of course not.
Oh, Doady...
...I bought the most beautiful little barrel of oysters...
...and the man said they were delicious.
Well, here they come.
They seem rather obstinate oysters.
I don't think they've been opened.
We did have the most beautiful oyster knife. But it's lost.
Well, that finishes the oysters.
Of course, writing a story in monthly parts isn't easy.
Mutton.
That's always sure to be good.
Splendid, splendid.
I've seen some of the illustrations.
I hope...
It seems to be all burned.
But the butcher said it was the very best mutton.
Well, it may be the very best, dear, but unfortunately...
...it's burnt on one side and raw on the other.
Now, now, then, Jip.
Now, now. Now, now.
Well, Dora, this is a fine dinner you've given us.
Oh, don't!
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, I wish I was dead.
I wish I was dead in the ground...
- Doady. Doady.
- My darling.
You were hardhearted, I was naughty...
...but it was all my fault.
- No.
- Yes, Doady.
- No, my darling.
No, it was all my fault.
I... I've been trying to change you...
...when I should have been trying to relieve you of all your cares.
Why didn't I think of it before?
Think of what, Doady?
Well, we'll send for my Peggotty...
...and she shall come and look after us both.
Now, my precious, you must be weary.
No, Doady, don't send me to bed. Don't.
Doady, may I ask you something very, very silly?
What wonderful thing is that?
I want to help when you're so industrious.
May I...? May I hold the pens?
Yes, dear.
That's a talking pen.
It will disturb my Doady.
- Doady.
- My darling.
What is it? What's wrong?
Master Davy.
- Master Davy.
- What's the matter?
- Dora's not worse, is she?
- No, Master Davy.
She's resting comfortably.
But my brother Dan's here.
He has news of Em'ly.
Master Davy.
It was in Naples, by the sea.
There he wearied of her, left her.
When she knowed she was abandoned...
...her heart died in her.
That snake, his servant, insulted her.
Told her he'd been left there by his master to marry her.
Something cast off for a servant's use.
She tried to die by her own hand.
So he locked her up, imprisoned her.
And she, my poor lass...
When night come...
...she forced a window and escaped to the shore.
She thought herself home...
...wandering on the Yarmouth beach.
She stumbled on, calling out for us who loved her...
...thinking that here was the old boat...
...there was her dear friends.
When morning broke, they found her.
By God's mercy, they took her in and cared for her.
All night long, we've been together...
...her arms around my neck and her head laying here.
We knows full well we can put our trust in one another...
...forevermore.
One thing, Master Davy, is heavy on my mind.
It is Ham, sir.
He was cut deep...
...and lost his care for life.
I've heared, now, in rough weather and in danger...
...he's first afore his mates as though he hopes the sea would take him.
Sir, would you go to Yarmouth, as soon as may be...
...and get word to Ham?
Tell him as how Em'ly remembers all his kindness...
...and how she begs his forgiveness...
...and says goodbye.
I'll go by the first coach.
What boat is that?
It looks like a schooner from Spain or Portugal.
Hack it!
Hello, Mrs. Gummidge. Where's Ham?
He's gone down there to help with the rescue.
I must see him. I have an important message from Dan Peggotty.
Oh, Master Davy, don't let him do anything dangerous.
Get me a line, and I'll swim out to her.
Ham.
Ham! Ham!
Careful with the little precious,
Master David, careful.
- Careful.
- Isn't that wonderful?
Everything's all ready for her.
The bed's all made and comfortable.
There you are.
You can go to your mistress.
There you are, my darling.
Oh, Doady, look at the garden.
The blossoms are out.
Now I know
I shall be well and strong again.
When you can run about as you used to, we shall make Jip race.
Doady, you must take me to London to see The Enchanted Bird again.
- Promise?
- Of course, my dear.
Our patient seems to have borne the journey downstairs remarkably well...
...so I shall be on my way.
Until tomorrow, my dear.
Oh, you must allow me to see you to the door, doctor.
Thank you.
How can we ever thank you enough?
My boy, there's something you must know.
She is better, isn't she?
But she's in so much brighter spirits.
- Doctor, she's... She's not going to...?
- No, David, no.
Her life's in no immediate danger.
But I cannot give you hope for any real recovery.
I'm sorry, David.
Doady, come and look at our garden.
We'll be walking there soon.
I'm coming, my love.
Yes, doctor?
Her strength is done.
Poor Dora.
- Doady?
- Yes, darling.
Is it...? Is it lonely downstairs, Doady?
Very. Very.
Oh, you'll soon be well and strong again, my Dora.
Oh, Doady, sometimes I think...
You know what a silly little thing
I always was.
That that will never be.
No, no, my darling.
I'm with you.
I won't allow anything to happen to you.
Doady, I'm afraid I was too young.
I wasn't fit to be a wife.
We've always been very happy, my sweet Dora.
I was very happy. Very.
But as the years went on...
...my dear boy would have wearied of his child-wife.
He would have realized more and more what was wanting in his home.
She wouldn't have improved.
No, Doady, it's better as it is.
- Doady?
- Yes, my dear.
I... I want to speak to Agnes.
Let no one else come.
I want to speak to Agnes quite alone.
Oh, Doady, you could never love your child-wife more than you do now.
And in more years, she would have so tried and disappointed you...
...that you might not have been able to love her half as well.
Oh, Jip, it may never be again.
I'm sure I never signed that paper.
Oh, yes, Mr. Wickfield,
I can assure you that you did.
But I... I must have been out of my mind to think I had the power.
Take it more quietly, Father.
Then you'll remember.
I'm afraid Mr. Wickfield is a little careless.
- I warned him, but he wouldn't listen.
- I did listen.
- I listened far too often...
- Don't let him upset you.
That's right, Miss Agnes.
I fancy, all the same, you'll need some help from me before you're done.
If you were to suggest to Miss Agnes that she be a little kind to me...
...we should manage the business very well.
I'm sure it would be good for all parties.
He'll be sorry for this.
Don't despair, sir.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Micawber's the key. He knows better than anyone what Uriah's been up to.
Micawber, he sold his soul to Uriah, the same as I have.
Oh, it's true. Micawber's been strange lately. I myself have been worried.
But he's always been so honest, so true.
I can't believe he's false until I've seen him.
Miss Trotwood, Mr. Copperfield and Mr. Dick.
Well, this is an unexpected pleasure,
Miss Trotwood.
There have been some changes in the office since I was an humble clerk.
But I'm not changed, Miss Trotwood.
I think you're pretty constant to the premise of your youth...
...if that's any satisfaction to you.
Thank you for your good opinion.
No good opinion's wasted on you,
Uriah Heep.
Still seeking a quarrel,
Master Copperfield?
I'm seeking more than that.
Don't wait, Micawber.
What are you waiting for?
Because... Because...
In short, I choose.
You were always a worthless fellow, as the world knows.
You'll oblige me to get rid of you.
Now, you go along.
I'll talk to you presently.
If there's a scoundrel in all this world with whom I've talked too much...
...that scoundrel's name is Heep.
I see. A conspiracy, eh?
Well, we understand each other, you and me.
There's no love between us.
You was always a puppy with a proud stomach from your first coming here.
You envy me, me rise.
You'll make nothing of this.
I'll match you.
Mr. Micawber, the change in this fellow assures me we're right.
Deal with him as he deserves.
Precious set of people, ain't you, trying to buy me clerk over.
The very scum as you yourself was,
Copperfield...
...before anyone had charity on you.
Miss Wickfield, if you really love your father, don't you join them.
- Because if you do, I'll ruin him.
- Scoundrel.
"Miss Wickfield, Mr. Wickfield...
...and others whom it may concern.
In denouncing the most consummate villain that ever existed...
...I ask no consideration for myself.
But I declare that Heep, and Heep only, of the firm of Wickfield & Heep...
- ... is the forger and cheat. "
- Liar!
I'll get even with you for this.
You carried out my orders.
You're in it as much as I.
Approach me, approach me, you Heep of infamy.
And if your head is human, I'll break it.
I cast off your yoke. I defy you.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
"My charges against Heep are as it follows:
First, he has caused Mr. Wickfield to sign documents of importance...
...representing them as if no importance...
...thereby empowering Heep to draw out trust moneys. "
Prove this, you Copperfield, all in good time...
"Second, Heep has systematically forged to various books and documents...
...the signature of Mr. Wickfield.
I have in my possession several imitations of Mr. Wickfield's signature...
...the work of this monster, Heep.
I have now concluded.
And although poverty and imprisonment may follow...
...I trust the labor of these investigations...
...may be as a sprinkling of sweet water on my funeral pyre.
I ask no more.
In mere justice, let it be said of me, as of a gallant naval hero...
...that what I have done,
I did for England, home and beauty. "
Yours, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
Wilkins Micawber.
The books. The books are gone!
Who stole the books?
I did, when you gave me the keys this morning, as usual.
They're in my possession.
I'll take care of them.
Oh, so you receive stolen goods, do you?
In these circumstances, yes.
- What do you want done?
- I'll tell you what must be done.
Mr. Wickfield, please.
First, the deed of partnership must be given over to me now, here.
- Supposing I haven't got it.
- But you have.
Therefore, we won't suppose that.
You must return the bonds you've taken...
...and the money you've appropriated, to the last penny.
All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession.
Must they? I don't know about that.
I must have time to think about it.
Certainly. In the meantime, you may wish to repose in Maidstone Jail.
Mr. Dick, will you go and get a couple of officers?
With the greatest pleasure.
No, no, no. Don't let's be hasty.
Don't let's be hasty.
Master Copperfield.
We've lost our tempers, perhaps, and no need of that.
I'm a very humble person,
Master Copperfield.
I've no wish to rise above my place.
The keys.
- Is that all, Master Copperfield?
- Yes.
Then I humbly beg to wish you all a very good day.
Goodness me. Who is that
David's bringing home?
I must speak plainly, Agnes.
After Dora died,
I went away, lonely and miserable.
I stayed away, realizing my need of you.
I returned loving you.
David, the night that Dora died,
I was alone with her, you remember.
The last thing that she asked me was that I should take her place.
I've loved you all my life.
High time too, eh, Mr. Dick?

News has come from Vienna!
"Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard on his return from the Crusades.
Our king is being held prisoner.
Nothing further is known.
His Highness Prince John will make further public pronouncement tomorrow."
And how are the dear Saxons taking the news, Sir Guy?
They're even more worried than Longchamps,
Your Highness.
They'll be more than worried when I squeeze the fat out of their pampered hides.
- You intend to act on your plans?
- What better moment than this, Sir Guy?
Whoever would have thought my dear brother would be so considerate as to get captured...
...and leave all of England to my tender care?
He may disapprove when he returns,
Your Highness.
If he returns.
And I'll see to it that he doesn't.
We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy.
Golden days are ahead.
I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.
Tomorrow, Your Highness.
- But who's gonna pay me?
- Pay! Pay!
That's all you Saxons think about.
Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John, who's just come up from London?
Stop! Stop!
This man is freeborn!
He's a landowner.
You can't make a slave of him!
Didn't he refuse to send his men to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?
But I protest...!
Dickon, follow me!
The rest remain here.
- What's your name, you Saxon dog?
- A better one than yours.
Look to your manners!
This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.
Sir Guy or the devil!
There's little to choose between them.
- What's your name?
- Much, the miller's son.
- You know it's death to kill the king's deer?
- And death from hunger if I don't.
Thanks to you and the rest of you
Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.
- Be quiet, you.
- I won't be quiet!
You can kill me if you like, but not until I've had my say.
You can beat and starve us Saxons now...
...but when King Richard escapes, he'll take you by the scruff of the neck...
...and fling you into the sea!
- What the devil?
- Come now, Sir Guy.
- You'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
- lf it amused me, yes.
Be thankful my humor's of a different sort.
- By what right do you interfere with justice?
- By a better right than you have to misuse it.
That goes for your master, Prince John.
I'll give him that message at the baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.
Thank you.
He does need a bit of a talking to.
- Eh, Will?
- Yes, he has been getting rather out of hand.
- Fetch him along.
- Hold there. What's his fault?
- He's killed a royal deer.
- You're wrong. I killed that deer.
This man's my servant.
I suppose you realize the penalty for killing the king's deer is death.
- Whether for serf or noble.
- Really?
Are there no exceptions?
- Thanks, good master.
- Better look before you shoot next time.
From this day, I follow only you. There isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire...
...that doesn't know and bless
Sir Robin of Locksley.
Take me as your servant.
Why, in all the forest, there isn't a hunter as good as me.
I ask no pay.
Just to follow you.
Fetch the deer, then.
While Richard is bent on adventure in foreign lands...
...it is our duty as Normans to preserve the realm...
...by giving loyal support to Prince John, the only true defender of the Norman spirit.
Hail to Prince John.
My lords, I thank you.
Well, this is what we Normans like:
Good food, good company, and a beautiful woman to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?
Was it worthwhile coming with me from London...
...to see what stout fellows our Nottingham friends are?
Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne, now. One of our most renowned defenders of the realm.
- Must I take him, Your Highness?
- Why, you like him, don't you?
- Well, he's a Norman, of course.
- Is that the only reason for liking him?
Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian?
Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady.
But he's our most powerful friend in these shires and he's already in love with you.
If I could promise him marriage to a royal ward, it might help my plans.
- Perhaps when I know him better.
- Of course.
You're a very wise young woman.
Any more objections to the new tax from our Saxon friends?
Objections, Your Highness?
With a Saxon dangling from every gallows tree between here and Charnwood?
Well said, sir knight.
But not too many, mind.
Else we'll have nobody left to till our land or pay the tax.
There's one exception I'd make,
Your Highness.
- A certain Saxon noble.
- Who is that?
- Sir Robin of Locksley.
- Sir Rob... Sir Robin of Locksley?
Why, I've heard precious little else since
I've been here. What's his latest outrage?
Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer in Sherwood Forest today.
And you didn't take him?
That would have been a problem,
Your Highness.
- A Saxon a problem?
- He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.
Aye.
An impudent, reckless rogue...
...who goes around the shire stirring up the Saxons against authority.
And he has the insolence to set himself up as a protector of the people.
- I could have captured him long ago, but...
- But what?
Well, he's the deadliest archer in England, and...
And my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham is afraid of him.
I want him taken and hanged. At once, do you hear? I'll not tolerate...
Open the door!
Who is this, this...?
Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.
Let him approach.
Greetings, Your Highness.
You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.
I no sooner enter his castle doors with a piece of meat...
...than his starving servants try to snatch it from me.
You should feed them, Gisbourne.
They'll work better.
With the compliments of your royal brother,
King Richard, God bless him!
By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.
Robin, I like you.
I'm gratified, Your Highness.
I don't think Gisbourne shares that sentiment, however.
He does look sour.
What's the matter, Gisbourne?
Run out of hangings?
- I know a ripe subject for one.
- lf you'll excuse me...
Sit down! Sit down, my dear.
He'll not harm you.
Sir Robin, this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.
I hope my lady had a pleasant journey from London?
What you hope can hardly be important.
What a pity her manners don't match her looks, Your Highness.
You hear that, gentlemen?
Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian he daren't say "boo" to her...
...and this saucy fellow gives her better than she sends.
My lords and ladies, I would like to present to you Sir Robin of Locksley.
Sir Robin, permit me to present to you your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...
...and our noble guests.
- I'm deeply honored, Your Highness.
- Have you had meat?
- None but what I brought.
Well, sit down.
Sit down there opposite me.
- Get up, Sir lvor, and give him your place.
- Your Highness!
Get up!
Get up, sir knight!
Come, Sir lvor.
Out with you.
Bring Sir Robin food at once, do you hear?
Such impudence must support a mighty appetite.
True enough, Your Highness.
We Saxons have little to fatten on by the time your tax gatherers are through.
Be seated, gentlemen. No need to stand on ceremony on my account.
So you think you're overtaxed, eh?
Overtaxed, overworked and paid off with a knife, a club or a rope.
- Why, you speak treason.
- Fluently.
I advise you to curb that wagging tongue of yours!
It's a habit I've never formed.
You know, we Saxons aren't going to put up with these oppressions much longer.
Oh, you're not?
Then listen to this:
As you may know, my brother is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.
And from Leopold, I have received a ransom demand of 150,000 gold marks.
That means that you, my friends...
...must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks in the pound, but 3!
- And the money's to be turned over to me.
- Why to you, Your Highness?
- King Richard appointed Longchamps regent.
- I've kicked Longchamps out.
From now on, I am regent of England.
Well, confound it, what are you goggling at?
Is it so strange that I decide to rule when my brother's a prisoner?
Who's to say I shouldn't?
- You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?
- Not I, Your Highness.
- You, Sir Boron?
- Nor I, Your Highness.
- You, Sir Ralf of Durham?
- My sword is yours, Your Highness.
And what about our young
Saxon cockerel here?
What's the matter?
Have you no stomach for honest meat?
For honest meat, yes.
But I've no stomach for traitors.
- You call me traitor?
- You? Yes.
And every man here who offers you allegiance.
Your Highness.
What do you call a man who takes advantage of a king's misfortune...
...to seize his power?
And now, with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats...
...you'll try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless Saxon.
A ransom that'll be used not to release
Richard, but to buy your way to the throne.
Let me ram those words down his throat,
Your Highness!
Oh, no. Later.
Let him spout for the moment.
And what do you propose to do?
I'll organize revolt.
Exact a death for a death.
And I'll never rest until every Saxon in this shire can stand up, free men...
...and strike a blow for Richard and England.
- Have you finished?
- I'm only just beginning.
From this night on, I use every means in my power to fight you.
Dickon!
Such impudence, Your Highness.
If I could only reach him.
Stand back!
Stand back!
Open the door!
Quick, guards, quick!
There's a traitor inside trying to escape!
- Shut the door, quick!
- Traitor, sir?
You infernal idiot!
Which way did he go?
There, through the gate.
- After him!
- Guards! Horses!
Dickon, follow Mansfield!
To your troop!
Up you go, quick.
Find Crippen the arrow-maker and his friends...
...to pass the word to every man who's been beaten or tortured:
- The Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow.
- Yes, master.
Off you go, and good luck.
Have it proclaimed in every village that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.
- Hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid.
- Yes, Your Highness.
His possessions are forfeit to the crown.
Seize his castle and his lands.
Everything he owns.
And just to let the people know how the wind has changed...
...the sooner you begin collecting the...
- The ransom, Your Highness?
Yes, yes, of course.
The ransom.
There's a death sentence for your Robin of Locksley!
I'll have him dangling in a week.
- I'm tired.
- What?
- After a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
- I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.
- Lovely fresh air.
- My teeth ache with chattering.
- Nightingales singing.
- An owl hooting in my ear all night.
Hooting?
He was singing you to sleep.
There's a lusty infant.
He'd be a good one to reason into joining us.
By the look of him, his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.
- Let's see what he's made of.
- It's your skull, not mine.
- Give way, little man.
- Only to a better man than myself.
He stands before you.
Let him pass, Robin. It's much too warm to brawl with such a windbag.
When I've brushed this fly off,
I'll give you a dusting for good measure.
This fly has a mighty sting, friend.
I've only a staff and you threaten me with a longbow and a goose shaft.
- Aren't you man enough...?
- Wait! I'll get myself a staff.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Hey, pretty fellow, play a livelier tune that I can make this puny rascal dance to.
You need a merrier tune?
Well, how's this?
If you want a lesson, you came to the right man!
- Where is he?
- Who?
- This quarterstaff master.
- Here.
Give my compliments to him.
My friend, I should ask payment for what I'm teaching you here today.
There's something on account.
There's your change.
My head hums like a swarm of bees.
What's your name, friend?
- John Little. What's yours?
- Robin.
- Not Robin of Locksley?
- Aye.
- Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.
- 'Twas he who did the falling in.
I wanted to see what you were made of.
And I did.
- I hope you'll not hold it against me.
- On the contrary.
- I love a man that can best me.
- I'd like to join your company.
You shall. If you can hold a breach like you held that bridge, you're one of us. Welcome.
- This is Will of Gamwell.
- Yeah.
- He took good care not to wet his feathers.
- Just brain over brawn, friend.
You heard Robin's orders.
Look nippy now and spread the word.
"By royal decree, Robin of Locksley is declared an outlaw, condemned to death."
- Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
- "Any person aiding him will be hanged."
Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
Robin in Sherwood.
At the Gallows Oak.
Robin in Sherwood.
Robin. Gallows Oak.
Gallows Oak.
I've called you here as freeborn Englishmen, loyal to our king.
While he reigned over us we lived in peace.
But since Prince John has seized the regency...
...Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors have murdered and pillaged.
You've all suffered from their cruelty.
The ear loppings, the beatings...
...the blindings with hot irons, the burning of our homes...
...the mistreatment of our women.
It's time we put an end to this!
- Robin's right.
- Aye!
Now, this forest is wide.
It can shelter, clothe and feed a band of good, determined men...
...good swordsmen, good archers, good fighters!
Men, if you're willing to fight for our people,
I want you. Are you with me?
Aye! Aye!
Then kneel and swear this oath.
That you, the freemen of this forest, swear to despoil the rich only to give to the poor.
To shelter the old and helpless, to protect all women, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.
Swear to fight for a free England.
To protect her loyally until the return of our king and sovereign, Richard the Lion-Heart.
And swear to fight to the death against our oppressors!
We do!
We do solemnly swear!
String him up again!
- He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.
- Oh, he'll die, will he?
Another one of their Saxon impudences.
They'll do anything to trick us.
Continue!
- Mercy, good master! Have mercy!
- Start him dancing!
This will teach you to defy Prince John!
Father! Father!
Stop!
Five men dead. Murdered.
Sir lvor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.
- You don't have to name them.
- Our men can't lay a hot iron...
...in the eyes of a tax dodger without getting an arrow in the throat. It's an outrage!
- He's got to be stopped!
- Have you tried to stop him?
Yes, but I couldn't find him.
What chance has anyone of finding him?
Every villager and woodcutter's his friend.
Every runaway serf and Saxon thief in the shire is joining him.
I've sent spies in the forest to find out his hiding place...
...but he strikes, and gone like a flash.
- While you stay safely at home.
Do you question my valor?
Am I not personally commanding the force...
...that goes with Sir Guy and Lady Marian to Kenworth Castle...
...to guard the tax money he is bringing back, with my sword and my life?
I only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place.
You hope!
Enough of this wrangling! I'll lay this outlaw by the heels when I get back.
Well, well.
A curtal friar, and a mighty fat one at that.
- He's the man we need. I'll enlist him.
- Be careful, Robin.
That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey.
He's noted...
Yeah, that's right.
Noted for his piety.
A humble soul, he is, with a heart as gentle as a lamb.
- Be easy with him, master.
- Oh, I won't harm him.
You stay here lest you frighten him.
Don't interfere.
But that friar's one of the most dangerous swordsmen...
Bless my soul, a miracle!
Robber! Thief!
Give me back my mutton joint!
If you're a robber you'll get nothing from me.
I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.
If this is poverty,
I'll gladly share it with you.
That's what you are doing.
Give me back my mutton joint!
Not so close, my ponderous one.
- I'd have a word with you.
- Well?
I live in the forest with good fellows who've everything in life save spiritual guidance.
And no merit but one.
- And what's that?
- We're outlaws.
Since we're newborn to the greenwood, we need someone to do our christenings.
- So we've chosen you.
- Not I.
- They've probably all got your taking ways.
- Of course. But you'll love them, one and all.
Now, friar, let's waste no more time.
We'll take the shortcut across the stream.
- Come.
- I'll not. I'm happy here.
You will come.
Now then, since I don't care to get my feet wet, you'll carry me across on your back.
- On my back?
- Bend! You must learn obedience.
Come on, bend.
On, now!
Come on! On! On! Faster!
I'll have a gallop from you yet.
Come now, fat one. Why don't you give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman.
After I let a little air into your bellows you'll whistle a different tune.
By Our Lady, you're the fairest swordsman I ever met.
Must we go on, then?
I think we're even now, friar.
Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me by half a leg of mutton.
- So...
- No. Hold there, friar. Enough.
Come with me and I'll promise you the finest venison pasty, and the biggest you ever ate.
Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.
If you'd said that before, you'd have saved us both a wetting. Come along.
- You'll join us?
- Aye.
If only to convert you from your thieving ways.
You're Robin Hood, aren't you?
The holy henchman!
Hail, doubting friar!
- Robin.
- Aye?
He's well named Friar Tuck.
It would take half the deer in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.
And twice that to fill your empty head.
- Whoa, Will!
- What news, Will?
- I've got word...
- It's all right. He's one of us.
One of us?
He looks like three of us.
Aye.
And equal to a full dozen.
Now, now, now, now.
Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?
Sir Guy of Gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight.
- Has he got the tax money?
- A fortune!
- When does he enter Sherwood?
- Tomorrow.
We'll have to postpone that stuffing match
I promised, but it'll be double tomorrow!
Come! Back to camp, men!
Here, curb your appetite with that.
- Are you ready, men?
- Aye.
- See anything of them?
- Not yet.
Is everything ready?
They'll think they've got into a blooming hornet's nest.
There they come.
- Hadn't we better send out flanking guards?
- What for?
Well, this is Sherwood, you know, and Robin Hood...
- Afraid of that gallows-face?
- Afraid? Certainly not, sir.
But it's here that he's boldest.
Don't worry.
We're more than enough to take care of him.
Outlaws have no face to show themselves against armed troops.
Are you sure?
I seem to remember...
Oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.
- Well, you old rooster, what do you see?
- Make ready. They're in two sections.
- Do you see Sir Guy?
- He's leading the second.
The treasure wagon is with him.
Sir Guy and the sheriff are watering their horses.
- The advance guard's far ahead.
- Good. Little John!
Take your men and cut off the first section.
You surround the advance guard.
Personally!
- Ready, men?
- Aye, Robin!
Then stand ready for the signal.
Come, Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.
- Look!
- The guard! Quick!
Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.
What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you?
Why, that's curious.
I've often heard that you'd give me a warm welcome if ever we met again.
- You're permitting this insolence without...?
- Fighting?
- I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.
- Well, I have, you impudent rascal!
You're not going to harm my lamb, my honeysuckle.
Be still, Bess.
We've nothing but peaceful intentions.
Have we, men?
We only want to stroke his pretty neck.
- We won't harm him much.
- You see?
Well, let's away.
Don't bother to mark the way.
It'll take keener men than you've got...
...to find our camp again.
- You'll hang for this, all of you.
A small price to pay for the company of such a charming lady.
What can a Saxon hedge-robber know of charm? Or ladies?
- She means you.
- Me? A hedge-robber?
You must tell me more about myself.
You may have been misinformed.
Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting enough to bother about.
You just harm one hair of my lady's head...
...and that ugly face of yours will walk about with no neck under it. Now, mind!
- What are you staring at?
- I ain't never been out walking...
...with a female before.
- What female?
- You.
- Well, of all the impudence!
I suppose you say that to all women that tickle your fancy.
I've never tickled a woman's fancy before.
No, I've never had a sweetheart.
Do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life?
You don't know what you missed, my lad.
I've had the bands on five times.
My lord! Your robes for the feast.
Hurry up, put them on.
- I won't!
- You will!
I will! I will!
To them, this is heaven.
Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches, limitless food instead of hunger.
- Why, they're actually happy.
- Are they?
Aren't you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves?
I think it's revolting.
Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it, my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps.
But if you could know these people as I know them. Their patience, loyalty, goodness.
Friar Tuck!
These should fit Sir Guy.
Me lord. Here is your raiment for the banquet.
When you've done with them, give them to Prince John.
To the tables, everybody, and stuff yourselves!
May I serve you, my lady?
I'm afraid the company has spoiled my appetite.
Misfortune.
Now, mine is excellent.
- A little mutton, my lady?
- I said I'm not hungry.
Why, so you did. I'd forgotten.
Well, you will let me know if you regain your appetite, won't you?
Friends! Friends!
I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...
...and a bitter enemy of ours.
And yet, look!
He provides us with this tasty supper.
And is this the end of his beneficence?
Why, no!
For in his train today he's brought us half a score of boxes full of jewels and silks...
...and more, about 30,000 golden marks wrested from the northern shires.
- You wouldn't dare.
- Sit down!
Some of you might think our host intended this treasure for the coffers of Prince John...
...instead of to ransom the king.
And you would be right.
But a strange thing happened.
A change of heart overtook him in the forest, and there it is, safe and sound!
- You speak of loyalty.
- Yes. Why not?
I suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to Richard?
You wouldn't dream of keeping it yourselves.
Friends! What shall we do with this treasure?
Divide it amongst ourselves?
- Hold it for Richard!
- It belongs to the king!
- Convinced?
- I may have been hasty...
But why you, a knight, should live here like an animal, robbing, killing, outlawed...?
Are you really interested in learning why I turned outlaw?
Or are you afraid of the truth?
Or of me, perhaps?
- I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.
- Good. Then come with me.
Oh, so you are afraid.
- Well, men.
- Hi!
Hardly an inspiring sight for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure.
But these poor devils have all had their homes burned.
Their families beaten and starved to death by your tax gatherers.
- Bless you, Robin. We'll never forget you.
- Our humble thanks, master.
- May we be worthy, Robin.
- You are, mother, you are.
- Have you eaten well, friend?
- Yes, thank you, Robin Hood.
We humbly thank you, master.
I'm sorry to have to show you that. But once these poor people were happy and contented.
Just simple villagers who never harmed a soul.
And now... Tortured, eyes put out, tongues slit, ears hacked off.
They come to me for protection against your Norman friends.
But you've taken Norman lives.
Yes, those that deserved it.
The cruel and unjust.
You're a strange man.
Strange? Because I can feel for beaten, helpless people?
No, you're strange because you want to do something about it.
You're willing to defy Sir Guy, even Prince
John himself. To risk your own life.
- And one of those men was a Norman.
- Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?
- It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.
- But it's lost you your rank, your lands.
It's made you a hunted outlaw, when you might have lived in comfort and security.
What's your reward for all this?
Reward?
You just don't understand, do you?
I'm sorry.
I do begin to see a little now.
If you do, then that's reward enough.
Now that you've robbed us and had your fill of insulting us, we wish to leave.
- Come, Lady Marian.
- My men will escort my lady.
But before you take leave, it might be well if you thanked her for saving your life.
My life?
Do you think you would have left this forest alive if it hadn't been for her presence here?
- Peter! Harold!
- Yes, master?
Take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend to the Nottingham Road.
But our horses, our clothes.
You'll return to Nottingham as you are, on foot.
This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson to you in humility, if not in mercy.
- Your people will be returned tomorrow.
- But the lady Marian.
You'd best be started before I have a change of mind.
I think we'd better go.
Now, my lady.
Friar Tuck! Little John!
Take the lady to the Abbey of the Black Canons...
...so tomorrow the bishop can give her escort the rest of the way.
- May I go too?
- With your permission, my lady?
Goodbye, my lady.
Goodbye.
- He took everything you had collected?
- Every silver penny.
And you two nincompoops sat there and let him do it.
- Oh, we resisted as well as we could.
- Where are your wounds? Your bruises?
- And where are your men?
- What did Your Highness expect?
With the Lady Marian in our company and Locksley's men outnumbering us.
And not an arrow wound to divide among them, I suppose.
And more than 30,000 marks in the hands of that wolf's head.
That fellow's got to be taken.
Understand?
And how does Your Highness suggest that he be taken?
- lf I may be so bold as to inquire?
- Mind your words, Gisbourne.
You're fortunate not to be paying for this with your head.
Your Highness, sir, I could muster an army and surround Sherwood.
- You couldn't capture him...
- You mind your words.
...if he sat in your lap shooting arrows at a crow.
Arrows!
- He said shooting arrows at a crow.
- Take that silly looking bonnet off.
That stirs something in my mind.
Perhaps we can't take him by force.
He's too well protected.
Knows Sherwood's hidden paths well. But...
- But what?
- We'll outwit him.
We'll hold an archery tournament!
Archery tour...
And have him fly in on the end of one of his own arrows? That's marvelous.
He's the finest archer in the North.
Think he'd forgo shooting...
...against the archers of all England?
We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.
And ask him to risk his neck for that?
That won't be the only bait, with the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself.
What do you mean?
When they came out of the forest, she seemed very friendly.
And didn't you notice how his eyes never left her?
- Yes, yes, I noticed.
- Well, then!
- Well, then, how do we get word to him?
- Get word to Robin...
...who has an eye in every bush and ears in every wall?
But even if he comes, won't he be disguised?
Whether he be dressed as priest, beggar, knight, palmer, what disguise can conceal...
...the finest archer in England?
The man who wins the golden arrow will be Robin Hood.
Will you take that bonnet off?
I hope our little golden hook will catch the fish.
- You hope?
- Oh, it will if he's here.
If he's not, we'll stick your head upon the target and shoot at that.
- Are your men sure of their orders?
- Yes.
They're stationed all around the field.
Even a worm couldn't get through.
You talk as if this were a trap.
Oh, no, my dear. Just a precaution in case the Saxons create a disturbance.
By orders of His Highness Prince John, the champions of Sir Guy and the knights...
...will be limited to three flights of arrows for the eliminations.
The winning team will meet all comers.
- You know it's a trap.
- A golden arrow, from the lady herself.
- They've cooked up this thing to take you.
- Well, what of it?
- You know what'll happen if they do.
- Where's your sporting blood?
Sir Guy accepted our invitation.
We'd be rude not to accept his.
- It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.
- There, my band getting fat and overfed.
Where's your love of fights, risk, adventure?
Well, since our friend seems to have gone a little mad, I'll have to see him through.
We'll have to see him through.
Prepare final flight.
Does my lady find it interesting?
Lady Marian?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I asked if you found it interesting.
Yes, very.
They're splendid archers.
You'll find it much more interesting later on.
The winning team will compete as individuals.
Captain Phillip of Arras.
Elwyn the Welshman.
Matt of Sleaford.
They now challenge all comers.
The men who'd shoot against that lot have to have the eyes of a falcon.
They're far too good for me.
I'm not shooting today.
Remaining archers will use center target.
Matt of Sleaford, out!
Elwyn the Welshman, out!
- The tall tinker.
- Now is the time.
Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying myself.
Let them finish the match.
- But he could...
- Have your men close in if you wish.
Look.
Yeah, they're closing in.
I hope Robin sees them.
I must commend Your Highness for the subtlety of your scheme.
Very good. Would you say you'd seen that tall fellow before?
And if I had, what interest could a tinker have for me?
Phillip of Arras shoots next.
Tie!
You will be allowed another flight.
Target's a deal too close. Can we have it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?
Another 20 paces!
If your archer captain wins at that distance,
I'll give you 1000 gold marks for him.
Win or lose, I'll give him to Your Highness for a favor.
Provided you let me deal with this wolf's head in my own way.
Done. I'm leaving for Norwich immediately after the tournament anyway...
...so you may do what you please with him.
Why, he can't win now.
No living man could beat that shot.
I'll wager 100 marks on Phillip of Arras!
He split Phillip's arrow.
The tinker wins! He wins!
- What is your name, archer?
- Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.
How is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms?
Even a peaceful tinker must protect himself these days from treachery and other things.
It's earned you more than you bargained for today.
I pronounce you champion archer of England.
And from the gracious hand of Lady Marian
Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.
Advance.
I... Here is your prize, sir archer.
It's indeed an honor to receive it from the hands of so beautiful a lady.
- How is it that you didn't use a black arrow?
- That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.
- Its verdict is always final.
- Arrest this man!
That's a good idea.
You're a very rash young man.
And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham to see what Gisbourne has in store for you.
- It'll be something special, I'm sure.
- I'm sure.
Sorry I underestimated you.
Next time perhaps...
There'll be no next time.
Take him away!
"Robin of Locksley.
Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood.
After trial, in which you did not produce one witness in your behalf...
...you've been found guilty of outlawry, theft, murder, abduction...
...false pretenses, contempt of the Crown, poaching in royal forests and high treason."
Haven't you forgotten a count or two?
Surely it's a crime under the noble
Prince John to love one's country.
To protect serfs from injustice and be loyal to one's king.
If I could add anything to the charges against you, I would most gladly do so.
"It is the sentence of this tribunal, on the morrow at high noon you be taken...
...to the square in Nottingham and there hanged by the neck until you are dead."
There may be some who will regret that a man of your peculiar talents...
...should be cut off so early in life.
But personally...
You think the sentence extremely lenient.
Thank you.
What's troubling you, my lady?
Is it the outlaw?
Yes. I hate to see a human being trapped...
Bess, you know where his men may be found, don't you?
- Why, my lady, how should I know?
- Don't put me off.
That little man who liked you.
You've been seeing him?
- Yes, my lady.
- Tell me where.
- Do you want to send a message?
- To his men, yes.
Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale of a night, just now and again...
...at a place in the town and I won't deny as some of the others were there.
Where was it?
Oh, Bess, please tell me!
It was a tavern, my lady.
The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court.
- The landlord's name is Humility Prin.
- Humility Prin.
- Knock at the door and say, "A Locksley."
- "A Locksley."
- Yes, but...
- Get me a cloak, quickly!
Yes, madame.
Oh, dear...
- But there must be some way...
- lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place?
Why, you'd need an army with a battering ram to even dent it.
Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.
Maybe Little John's right.
Perhaps we should...
A Locksley.
- What is it, Prin?
- A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.
- What?
- It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.
She has the password, all right.
- Is she alone?
- Yes, sir.
Fetch her in.
- What do you want, my lady?
- I want to help him.
- How did you find us here?
- Never mind that now.
Please don't stand there staring.
Tell me what I can do.
- Don't trust her. It's a Norman trick.
- Would I come here alone if it were a trap?
What's to prevent your killing me if...? Is there no one here with sense enough to see?
One moment.
We have to make sure, my child.
You're a good daughter of the church?
You swear by Our Lady that you want to help Robin?
I swear, good Father.
- Have you thought of a way?
- Yes.
- Can you get us in the castle?
- That's no good. He's heavily guarded.
But I thought of another way.
Listen.
- This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?
- Yes, isn't it?
With Locksley out of the way, we'll stamp out the rest.
Won't it be a pleasant surprise for Prince John when he returns?
And to think that I was once foolish enough to believe that you rather liked him.
Why, your hand is trembling.
Take him to the gallows.
Take him up there.
He'll not be so insolent when they've stretched his neck.
Get ready.
Stop him!
Stop! Guards!
Friar Tuck! Much!
- Here we are, sir!
- Here we are, safe and sound!
Back to camp!
Robin! Where are you?
Here I am. Stand by!
He is different from anyone I've ever known.
He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless, and yet he's gentle and kind.
He's not brutal like...
Tell me, when you are in love, is it...
...well, is it hard to think of anybody but one person?
Yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping.
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.
Yes, and it affects your appetite too.
Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged.
Does it make you want to be with him all the time?
Yes. And when he's with you, your legs are weak as water.
Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you, do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...
...like goosy pimples running all up and down your spine?
- Then there's not a doubt of it.
- Doubt of what?
That you're in love!
What do you want?
Robin!
- I must say. I must say!
- Keep quiet, Bess.
Are you completely mad?
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.
But don't you realize that...?
My men told me what you did for me, so I've come to thank you.
And after what I couldn't help overhearing about that prickly feeling...
...I'm very glad I did come.
That was a game.
Now, you've got to go at once!
A game?
Well, couldn't I join in?
Of course, I probably wouldn't be as good at it as this pretty young girl.
But I could do my best.
Bess, will you leave us?
Please!
Now, let's see, where does this game begin?
Oh, I know. It's simple.
We'll start where you're in love with me.
You are, aren't you?
Because I am with you, terribly.
That's why I came.
I had to see you again.
You must go at once.
And I don't love you.
- Oh! Are you sure?
- Yes.
Very well then, I'll go.
You know, this is rather unfriendly of you, exposing me to my enemies like this.
Now, let me see. There's a fat old captain of the guard down there with bow legs.
If I drop on him that'll bend them out worse.
An archer! He's too thin.
I might miss him altogether.
- Robin!
- The very thing.
Five men-at-arms in a group.
They'll break the fall beautifully.
- Goodbye, my lady!
- Robin!
- Yes?
- Please.
Then you do love me? Don't you?
- Don't you?
- You know I do.
Well, that's different.
- Do you know you're very impudent?
- Me?
You are!
When my guardian, King Richard, finds out about your being in love with me...
- I know, he'll make me court jester.
- He won't!
He'll stick your funny head on London Gate.
And a fine decoration it will be, my bold Norman beauty.
- I'm not bold.
- Well, you're Norman.
Well, I don't hold that against you.
And you are a beauty.
- You're the most beautiful...
- You're leaving at once.
Please, darling, every minute you're here you're in danger.
I'll go.
- Marian, will you come with me?
- To Sherwood?
I've nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger, but we'd be together.
- But, Robin, dear...
- I know. It's asking a lot, but who knows...
...how long it'll be before Richard returns.
Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?
Because I love you, Robin, I'd come.
Even the danger would mean nothing if you were with me.
Then you will?
No. Listen to me, darling.
You remember that day in Sherwood Forest?
I realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right...
...and that we were wrong.
No, let me finish.
You taught me England is bigger than Normans and Saxons...
...fighting and hating each other.
That it belongs to all of us, to live peacefully together...
...loyal only to Richard and to England.
But, darling, you could help.
I could help much more by watching for treachery here...
...and leaving you free to protect
Richard's people until he returns.
Now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone?
Go now, quickly, dearest.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye.
- You gentlemen have traveled far?
- Yes, quite a distance.
I'm sorry I can't give you better food.
- There is little left to us these days.
- This will be enough.
The inn at Luton was well supplied.
How is that?
That's a Norman inn.
But it's an outrage!
I'll complain to Prince John.
I'll have this rascal's ears, no matter how.
Dares to rob me!
Strip my person of jewels!
What's this country coming to when a high churchman can't travel the forest in safety?
- Who's he?
- The Bishop of the Black Canons.
- Do you wish to go on after dinner?
- No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.
- I'll stay. Tend to the horses.
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Bring food to us!
- Yes, Your Grace, at once!
It's no longer safe to journey anywhere.
Robbers at every turn of the road.
- What happened, Your Grace?
- I told you! We've been robbed.
Not a chance to defend ourselves.
They burst on us from ambush.
- Who did?
- Why, Robin Hood, of course.
There's no other with impudence enough.
Robin Hood again, sire.
- You've heard of him, then?
- Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.
- Oh, then you're strange to this shire?
- More or less.
What might be your names, gentlemen?
They're hardly important enough to deserve your interest.
- Landlord, where's our ale?
- Coming, sirs.
Will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight?
We hadn't decided, Your Grace.
What would you advise?
Well, there's so much danger on the road, you'd be far safer here.
We will then, since we'll have the added pleasure of your company.
Well, I should really like to stay, but I recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey.
Some other time, or perhaps you would break your journey and sup with me tomorrow.
Your Grace is too kind.
Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen, and God speed you in the morning.
Thank you. Good night.
The window!
Are there beds prepared, landlord?
Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired.
- I'm afraid he suspects, sire.
- I fear so.
His Grace is a Norman. Did you see the fear on the landlord's face when he came in?
I've seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned.
I ought never to have left England.
I noticed when Robin Hood's name is mentioned...
The mysterious outlaw whom we have sought.
In vain. However, the bishop didn't have any difficulty meeting him.
Which gives me an idea.
- And you're sure it was Richard?
- No doubt of it.
How like my dear brother this is!
He couldn't rot in Durnstein like any decent man.
- But Richard has no army.
- No, Your Highness.
- lf he had, we should have heard of it.
- lf my brother happened to be killed...
- England would have a new king.
- That would be murder! I'll have no part...
You'll do as you're told!
That's very simple. Keep your mouth closed.
Your Highness, I beg of you!
How long will you retain your abbey if Richard survives to find out...
...what you've been up to these years he's been away?
Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to...?
Dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs...
...over some little mischance.
There's nothing he wouldn't do for a king who'd restore him to rank.
- You don't love my brother, I hear.
- I have little reason to, Your Highness.
- You know this tavern?
- Yes.
- lf Richard dies...
- Dickon returns to the roll of English knights.
Am I not right?
With the manor and estate of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.
- When shall I start?
- Immediately. How many men will you need?
I shall do it better alone, Your Highness.
The sooner you're crowned king...
The better for my friends?
You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Return to your abbey and make preparations to proclaim me king...
...here in Nottingham, the day after tomorrow.
Do you suppose she heard?
I don't know.
And now you know why Robin's got to find
King Richard at once and warn him.
Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head.
My lady's hearing is a little defective tonight.
When you knock at a lady's door as if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.
You seem upset.
Upset? Why should I be?
Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.
You've played the innocent long enough.
- Let's be frank with one another.
- I don't see the need.
You're charming, Lady Marian, but not exactly clever. You couldn't have failed...
...to overhear what Prince John and I were talking about.
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't trouble to deny it.
And your first thought, as Richard's loyal ward, was to warn him.
- Am I not right?
- Why, how could I warn Richard?
How did Locksley and his men arrange his escape...
...from hanging after the archery match?
Someone here in the castle must have got word to him.
That's ridiculous!
When Richard's in danger, what more natural...
...than that you should try to warn him through Locksley?
And you do intend to warn him, don't you?
- Don't you?
- No!
If that's true, perhaps you'd explain before Prince John...
...and the Court of Execution the meaning of this.
Guard!
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.
Not only has she consorted with this Saxon rebel...
...found guilty of outlawry, theft, murder, abduction and high treason...
...but she has betrayed her own Norman people.
Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?
Yes, I am. Bitterly. But it's a shame that I'm a Norman...
...after seeing the things my fellow countrymen have done to England.
At first I wouldn't believe. Because I was a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe...
...that the horrors you inflicted on the Saxons weren't just.
I know now why you tried so hard to kill this outlaw whom you despised.
It's because he was the one man in England who protected the helpless...
...against beasts who were drunk on human blood!
And now you intend to murder your own brother!
You'll be sorry you interfered.
Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it.
A prophetic speech, my lady, for that is exactly what is going to happen to you.
You wouldn't dare.
I'm the royal ward of King Richard and no one but the king himself...
...has the right to condemn me to death.
You are quite right, my dear.
And it shall be a king who will order your execution for high treason...
...exactly 48 hours from now.
Take her away.
- Have you got it all in your stupid head now?
- Of course I have.
Well, give Robin the whole message exactly like I told it to you.
Bess, where was Dickon supposed to find King Richard?
Oh, never mind him!
What do I care about your kings and thrones and such?
Robin has gotta do something to save my baby!
Come on, old girl.
Robin will look after her, all right.
- Where's Dickon heading for?
- Kent Road Tavern.
Kent Road Tavern? You can save three miles and cut him off through Low Wood.
Come on, lass, give us a kiss and wish me luck.
Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here.
Oh, Much.
Oh, you will be careful, won't you?
Of course I will.
Greetings, sir abbot!
- You've traveled far this morning?
- Too far to be patient with delay now.
Perhaps it's the weight of your purse that wearies you. Now, I can remedy that.
If it weighs more than a just amount
I'll share it with those who have less. Come.
You think I hand my purse to every rough lout who asks for it?
You see, sir abbot?
We're poor outlaws, with nothing to eat but the king's deer...
...while you have property, rents, and silver. So your purse!
I've traveled far on the king's business and the silver I have left...
...equals no more than 60 marks.
What?
Are you friendly to our good King Richard?
I love no man better.
By that speech you save half your money.
Give me 30 marks for the poor and the rest you may keep.
Then I can go free?
Any friend of Richard's is free of this forest.
Would you honor us by sharing meat with us?
- Gladly.
- Then come.
- Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
- I'm called Robin Hood.
It seems I've heard of you.
- Nothing good, I hope.
- Oh, now I remember!
How does your loyalty to Richard set on a killer of knights...
...a poacher of the king's deer and an outlaw?
Those I kill died from misusing the trust that Richard left them.
And the worst rogue of these is the king's own brother.
- Oh, then you blame Prince John.
- No, I blame Richard.
His task was defending his people instead of deserting them to fight in foreign lands.
What?
You'd condemn Holy Crusades?
I'll condemn anything that leaves the task of holding England to outlaws like me.
Much!
- Much, what's happened to you?
- Take me to Robin, quick!
- Much, what's happened?
- King Richard's in England. In Sherwood!
What?
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern last night to kill the king.
- Will, take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern...
- No need, master, no need.
I headed Dickon off.
He ain't gonna murder no one no more.
- But the king? Where is he?
- I don't know, master.
Men, Richard must be found.
He must be brought here for safety.
Little John, take a party and scour the country.
Friar Tuck, into the town.
Will, search every inn and cottage.
Don't rest, day or night, until he's found. Understand?
You don't need to search for Richard, Robin.
- He's in good hands. The best in England.
- What do you mean? Where is he?
Here!
Sire.
All these have remained loyal.
Rise, Sir Robin.
Rise, men of Sherwood.
Sire, Prince John's calling
Bishop of the Black Canons...
...to proclaim him king in Nottingham tomorrow.
- How'd you learn this?
- Lady Marian. She overheard.
They've taken her for treason.
She's been condemned to the block for warning us.
He wouldn't dare execute the king's ward.
You underestimate him. If we're to save her and your throne, we've got to act now!
By attacking Nottingham castle?
Without an army it'll be much too strong.
Your men will be killed.
If the Bishop of the Black Canons is performing the ceremony tomorrow...
...suppose we visit him at his abbey tonight and persuade him to suggest a way.
Brace up. Smile!
Wider!
Still sure it wasn't you who warned my brother I was in England?
Why, sire, believe me, I...
Your Grace, smile!
You'll sweat the lard off that fat carcass of yours...
...before this day's over, my pudgy friend.
And I hope some Norman sword whittles you down to size!
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.
Sanctify this thy servant, our royal Prince John.
Enrich his noble heart and bestow upon him all princely virtues.
Amen.
No news of Richard.
No. None, Your Highness.
Then Dickon must have...
Sir Dickon, Your Highness.
Of course. Of course.
We are ready for the ceremony,
Your Majesty.
Remember.
By what authority do you,
John Lackland, Prince of England...
...claim to be crowned this day, sovereign of the realm...
...and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher, to receive the blessing of the church?
By right of blood succession.
According to the law of the realm.
Is it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother...
...Richard the Lion-Heart of England?
Richard no longer exists!
From this moment forward,
I, John, am king of England!
Aren't you a little premature, brother?
Richard! The Lion-Heart!
He's lying! He's an imposter!
- The king lives!
- Men of Sherwood!
Robin Hood!
It's a trick of the outlaws!
Kill him! Seize him!
- Did I upset your plans?
- You've come to Nottingham once too often!
When this is over, there'll be no need for me to come again.
Your sword, Gisbourne.
- Know any prayers, my friend?
- I'll say one for you!
Save yourself, Robin!
The door, quick!
Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you!
But, Richard, Richard! I thought...
- You thought I was murdered!
- Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean to...
After all, Richard, I am your brother.
Yes, sire, he is your brother.
Yes, my brother.
I could forgive you if your treachery were against me and not my subjects.
I banish you and your followers from England for the remainder of my lifetime.
Take them away.
See that they leave England.
I further banish from my realm all injustices and oppressions...
...which have burdened my people.
And I pray that under my rule...
...Normans and Saxons alike will share the rights of Englishmen.
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!
What about you, Robin?
My sword is yours, sire, now and always.
Is there nothing the king can grant the outlaw...
...who showed him his duty to his country?
Yes, Your Majesty, a pardon for the men of Sherwood.
Granted with all my heart.
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!
But is there nothing for yourself?
There's but one thing else, sire.
And do you too wish...?
More than anything in the world, sire.
Kneel, Robin Hood.
Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley,
Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...
...and lord of all the lands and manors appertaining thereto.
My first command to you, my lord earl...
...is to take in marriage the hand of the Lady Marian.
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Lady Marian!
And what say you to that,
Baron of Locksley?
May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire!
#[Bugle]
[Man] The munitions used by the rebels
came up from Nammu to Dowgli Pass.
The revolt was quelled, but at the cost of 90 lives-
60 natives and 30 of our own lancers.
Ninety dead men.
And why are they dead?
They are dead because the lancers
guarding Dowgli Pass- the sole gate to an attack on Jerishtawbi- were ordered elsewhere by Colonel Loring Leigh.
I will call Captain Loveland.
Raise your right hand.
Repeat the oath.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence which I shall give before this court...
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.
Captain Loveland, will you tell the court about any orders... received by you from Colonel Leigh on the night of the 18th.
I received written orders, delivered to me shortly after 9:00... to proceed immediately with my detachment to Tablis.
Orders in Colonel Leigh's writing.
Can you identify the writing?
Yes, it was his writing, but perhaps-
Perhaps what?
I was about to say the order may not have been as neatly written as usual.
Of course, this might have been due to haste.
- Could it have been due to intoxication?
- I cannot judge as to that.
That is all.
I believe you have known Colonel Leigh for several years.
Have you ever seen him intoxicated?
Not intoxicated.
Have you ever known him to issue a careless order?
I have not.
Captain Loveland... in view of all the very strange things which happened that night... has it ever occurred to you... that the order in question might have been forged?
The question is disallowed.
Unless you intend to offer proof.
That will be all.
I call Colonel Loring Leigh to the stand.
- [Man] Leigh!
- Yes?
This came to your digs.
Thought it might be important.
Thanks.
- Well rowed, Leigh.
- Thank you, sir.
[Man]... something more fundamental than
that referred to by the opposing counsel.
As he has so aptly stated,
under ordinary circumstances...
there might be doubt as to the validity
of a claim against the defendant company.
However, in this instance...
my clients have suffered
a loss which can be laid...
directly at the door
of the defendants.
- I have no doubt...
- Anything wrong, Leigh?
The learned counsel's opinions have been honestly expressed, but l-
May it please Your Lordship, I am called from the court on urgent private affairs.
By Your Lordship's permission?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
Message for Flying Officer Leigh.
That's his ship coming in now.
Joan!
- Joan.
- You are late.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling, but it's such a lovely ship,
I hated to come down at all.
- How very flattering.
- But now I'm here, I'm awfully glad to see you...
- and did I ever tell you your eyes are mysterious-
- Pools of limpid twilight?
Heavens, is it Wednesday today?
Oh, did you know each-
Miss, uh- Miss-
- Cable for you, sir.
- Oh, thank you. Most timely.
[Clears Throat]
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll take you both out to tea and I'll tell you all sorts of classic things... that I thought up in the air, all right?
Yes. Excuse me, darling- darlings.
Christopher, what is it?
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.
Hello.
- You again, Lynn.
- [Chuckles]
Look here, you dumbbell,
I might have shot you.
Oh, how divine to be killed at such loved hands.
The faithful attaché decoding messages of an empire on which the sun never sets.
- What does that say?
- Sorry.
Why, you know, those messages might shake the world.
Oh, it's so romantic.
It's about as romantic as reading the last census reports.
My, how you shatter my illusions.
And one illusion was that... you might have thought enough of me to come down to that tea fight.
- Good heavens, is it as late as that?
- Mm-hmm.
- I am sorry, Lynn.
- Well, you ought to be.
- We'd better go down now.
- No, you don't. I'm taking you out tonight.
- Those are orders from your boss.
- I'm sorry, Lynn. More work tonight.
Oh, no. You're not gonna work any more tonight. We're going out.
We're going slumming, dancing. We're gonna drink champagne and listen to Negro orchestras.
Ah, that's good medicine for your correct English soul, my son.
Woman's oldest instinct, eh?
Want to make me over?
Ah, and how you need it.
Come on. Let's go.
Look, I'll join you in the hall in, uh, two minutes. I must finish this work.
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll stay and help you... and then you can finish it that much quicker, huh?
- Come on.
- Help me? No, this is one thing, Lynn...
- that you cannot interfere in.
- Oh, I see.
- Secrets of the empire, huh?
- Yes.
All right, but don't you keep me waiting.
- I won't. Two minutes.
- Two minutes.
- Oh, what's that?
- A cablegram for you, sir. Personal.
Thank you.
- That'll be all, Benson.
- Yes, sir.
[Birds Chirping]
- ## [Piano]
- Gad, what a homecoming.
A lifetime of distinguished service, and chucked out like this.
Never did a dishonorable thing in his life.
Must you do that?
- I've gotta do something.
- ## [Continues]
The trouble is, I've read the proceedings of the trial... and I don't see how they could have reached any other verdict.
What's that? Do you mean to say you actually believe the governor guilty?
- Don't be an ass.
- Now look here, Nosey, l-
Rod. I've known Dad a good many
more years than you have.
What do you think I believe?
Well, what are you all being so solemn about? It's like a funeral.
What I'd like to do is find out who's behind all this and wring his blasted neck.
Oh, chuck the heroics, kid. We all know there's something funny about this.
Quite. That's why the old man asked us to meet him here.
Now look here. We've all got to appear as though nothing had happened... as though this is a perfectly natural homecoming.
Do you remember how he used to come home on leave?
Full of beans, all sorts of plans?
- Mmm.
- Yes. You know how he'll take this, don't you?
You bet.
Head up and smiling.
- [Car Horn Honking]
- Here he comes.
Yes, that sounds like the governor.
Manders! Manders, the colonel's here.
The colonel? Oh!
Hello, Manders.
Back again, huh?
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.
- Your case, sir?
- No, I'll keep that myself.
A bit of weather, sir.
A trifle cold perhaps.
- A trifle damp too, Manders, huh?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Mr. Wyatt and the others are in the library, sir.
- Right.
Hello, boys.
Good of you to come.
- How are you, governor?
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, lads.
- Welcome home, Dad.
[Chuckles]
Let's have a look at you.
Squad! 'Shun!
Number!
- Beano, sir.
- Boson, sir.
- Nosey, sir.
- Rodney, sir.
Huh? I didn't quite get that last one.
Oh, all right then.
Snicklefritz.
- But I think it's a rotten name, sir.
- Well, you chose it yourself.
Remember? You were going to be a magician.
- Snicklefritz the Great.
- [All Chuckling]
Unlucky day for me, sir.
Dismissed!
Beano, what happened to the big oak by the gate?
Why, I had to have it cut down, sir.
It died.
Pity.
One hates to see staunch old friends go down.
Glad to see you're looking so fit, governor.
Hmm. You're taking it well, boys.
- I knew you would.
- There's nothing to take, sir.
- We knew there was something sticky about it.
- There was.
We all read the evidence.
What about that batman of yours- Mulcahay?
I'd as soon distrust one of you.
And Captain Loveland?
- So far as I know, an officer doing his duty.
- Drake, sir?
One of the best. He got special leave
to come home and help me.
- You're going to fight, of course.
- Naturally.
- Good.
- We knew you wouldn't take this lying down, sir.
And neither will we.
We're in this with you, if we can help.
You bet we are. We've always stuck together- all of us- through fire, flood and famine.
Famine, Snicklefritz?
When was that?
Well, the time that Nosey and I got lost in the woods and missed supper.
[All Laugh]
Sit down, sir.
You must be feeling tired.
I am a bit tired.
The nights on the boat were the worst... when I knew how all you fellows must be feeling.
Well, l- I think we'll all have a spot.
That's a sound idea.
Now, have you any idea-
Oh. Uh, have you any idea, sir, of the motive behind all this?
I have.
A very definite idea.
It was the work of a munitions syndicate.
- [Whistles]
- The tribe that revolted had
the very latest in modern guns.
Do you mean to say, sir, that someone sold guns to the natives... and then created an opportunity for the guns to be used?
I do. It all fits in.
Oh, that's- that's absolutely fictional.
Have you any proof?
I have.
It wasn't easy to collect.
After the court-martial, everybody seemed to disappear.
- Disappear?
- Well, scatter.
General Bryce was transferred to Egypt.
Captain Loveland inherited a fortune and retired to Buenos Aires.
- And the barman had already done a bunk.
- Yes.
- Why, that's extraordinary.
- Ah.
Just to see whether you really can take it, sir.
I can... if it isn't drugged.
[Chuckles]
Well, sir, here's confusion to your enemies and to ours.
And to your mother, boys.
I'm glad she's not here today.
Well, I've got an hour's work to do... so clear out for a bit, will you?
- See you at dinner, sir.
- At dinner, Father.
- See you at dinner, governor.
- See you at dinner, Dad.
After dinner I'll lay the case before you
and ask your advice.
Four brains are better than one.
- Yes, sir.
- Four brains? What about me?
Oh, have you found one?
Good. I hadn't heard.
[All Laugh]
Nosey, I'll have you for that!
Oh, Manders, will you see if the colonel is ready for us?
- Very good, sir.
- It's good port, this.
- I don't imagine you get very good port in America.
- Oh, yes, you do.
- How do you get it?
- Well, they send it over in boats.
- Oh.
- Oh, boats.
Nosey, are you growing a mustache?
I beg your pardon.
It's grown.
It jolly well isn't.
Geoff, do you realize that while you've been away... you've picked up the most appalling American accent?
Have I? Do you know, in the States nearly everybody takes me for a Yankee.
Yes, I can well understand that.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Let me hear you say "Okay, toots."
- Tell my sons I'm ready for them, Manders.
- Very good, sir.
[Rattling]
Who's that?
Your father is ready, Mr. Wyatt.
Oh, thanks.
Now for the story.
Come on, you chaps.
- [Gunshot]
- What was that?
It sounded like a gun.
- It's locked.
- Father!
- Father!
- Father!
Try this again.
Oh, Dad! Dad!
Oh, governor.
He's killed himself.
The disgrace.
- Manders.
- That isn't true. L- I won't believe it.
Beano, look.
The dispatch case!
- It's empty.
- [Wyatt] His papers are gone.
- Dad's evidence.
- Look, the window!
Somebody came through this way, all right.
This is murder.
What's the plan, Beano?
You're head of the family now.
Well, we've got four names to work on.
There's Drake, Mulcahay, that barman and Loveland.
These men must be found and talked to.
- Right.
- I shall go to India and start with Mulcahay.
- Drake's coming here.
Boson, you'd better wait for him.
- Right.
Loveland's in Buenos Aires.
- Nosey, that's your job.
- Good.
- Well, what about me? I'm in on this.
- You're going back to Oxford.
- Oh, no.
- You'll do as you're told.
But that isn't fair. This-This is a family cause.
It- It's Dad's and ours.
Well, Boson, you understand.
This is my cause too.
- He's right, Beano.
- Yeah, let him go.
- All right, Rodney goes with me.
- Thanks, Beano.
But this isn't going to be any tea party.
If Dad's evidence was so important that they had to murder him... we'll be running the same risk.
- Let it come.
- And the sooner the better.
Here's to you, Mother.
And to you, Dad.
[Together]
Mother, Dad.
Hello.
[Sighs]
Doesn't the diplomatic corps even allow you to look surprised?
- I'm not.
- You're not?
You're the world's champion popper-upper.
It amounts to genius.
Your butler thought I was working my way through college and wouldn't let me in.
- Sensible fellow.
- [Laughs]
What's the matter with your feet?
You're not starting a nudist pose?
No. Feet hurt and there wasn't a taxi... and I had to walk all the way from that adorable little place called SaintJohn-Cum-Leigh.
- [With Correct Pronunciation]
SaintJohn-Cum-Leigh.
- Yeah, and the man said that-
- Why?
- Hmm?
- "Sinjin Comely"?
- Well, that's the way it always has been.
Oh. [Chuckles] Well, however, the man said it would only be just a step.
I suppose that's the well-known
English sense of humor, huh?
- The village has never seen a taxi.
- Oh, really?
Well, now that you're here, shall I carry you across the threshold like a bride?
Oh, Geoff, I'd love it.
Oh, Lynn, l- I think you-
I think you'd better walk.
[Chuckles]
Scaredy-cat.
You're never going to get anyplace if you're always going to be a-
- You see, I got in, Meadows.
- Manders.
- I beg your pardon.
- I say, that's pretty close. How did you know?
- Oh, Meadows, Manders.
- That's all right. American, you know.
- Oh, yes.
- Tea in the library.
- Very good, sir. Madam, may I have your wrap?
- It's a dress.
- Oh, yes.
- Ah, Geoff, it's lovely.
Oh, it looks just like the tap room...
- at the Statler Hotel in Buffalo.
- Thanks.
Well, you needn't be so snooty about it.
It's a very nice tap room.
Oh, and so is this.
Ah, fire. It's cozy.
I love fires.
Well, it's nice to see you, Lynn, but what are you doing here?
I came to find out why you stood me up that night in Washington and then disappeared.
No, thank you.
The embassy wouldn't tell me a thing... and so I started on a world tour looking for you.
I happened to land in England first and heard you were here, so I came.
Do I hear an apology for that stand-up?
Geoff, what is it?
It's in all the papers, Lynn.
Two seconds after you left me that night...
I had a cablegram saying that my father had been court-martialed and broken in India.
He asked me to meet him here.
Oh. Was that- that
English colonel your father?
Yes.
Oh.
And I came barging in here like a-
Oh, Geoff, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
Oh, it's all right, Lynn.
L- I realized you didn't know.
Of course, l- I read all about it in the paper, but I never dreamed-
London is calling, sir.
Captain Drake.
Oh, thanks.
Excuse me, Lynn.
Good afternoon, Captain Drake.
This is Geoffrey Leigh.
We've been waiting to hear from you, sir.
I'm so glad you got here.
I've seen the papers about your father's death, Leigh. Do you think it was suicide?
No, we don't.
We think it was murder.
So do I. I'm coming out to see you immediately.
No, don't send a car to the station for me. I'll manage.
We must be very careful.
I've been followed ever since I landed.
Good-bye.
[Train Whistle Blows]
That was a friend of the governor's.
He's just come to help him clear himself.
- But your father was killed. Why?
- I know.
That's what we've got to find out, if it takes the rest of our lives.
We've got four names to work on.
There's Trooper Mulcahay and a barman in India.
- Mm-hmm.
- There's Douglas Loveland-
- Douglas Loveland?
- A retired army officer now living in Buenos Aires.
- And Captain Drake.
- Geoffrey, I, uh-
Now be a good kid, will you? I've got loads of work to do before Captain Drake arrives.
There's a train leaving
SaintJohn-Cum-Leigh at 3:18.
I'll have them take you down there in the car.
Must I go now? I could be a lot of help to you.
It'll be sweet of you and you're a charming girl and I'm delighted to see you... but I don't need any help and I really am busy.
I have something to tell you that's very important-
Tea- I haven't had mine yet.
Manders, will you have Dover take this young lady down to the station in my car?
- Very good, sir.
- Okay. Take these things.
- Sorry, miss, but we haven't any chewing gum.
- That's quite all right. L-
- Hurry up. We're late.
- Geoffrey, what I had to tell you was really very important.
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll be in town tomorrow. Tell me at lunch.
- At lunch tomorrow?
- Uh-huh.
- All right. I'm staying at the Savoy.
- Savoy, grill room, 1:00.
- All right. And, Geoffrey-
- Mm-hmm?
Don't disappoint me.
I won't.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Where can I find a taxi?
Well, that's where you have me, sir.
- [Train Whistle Blows]
- Taxicab, sir?
Why, there's one now.
- Here. Leigh Hall, please.
- Yes, sir.
[Car Door Closes]
- Well, where'd that come from?
- [Engine Starts]
A taxi here?
- Manders.
- [Manders] Yes, sir.
Have dinner served as soon as Captain Drake turns up, will you?
Very good, sir.
- [Car Approaching]
- A car is coming now, sir.
Oh, good.
The car is there, sir, but, uh, there's something strange.
- No driver.
- No.
"Captain Drake."
Well! You're looking very well this morning, my friend.
Do you suppose he'll notice?
No, I guess you're right.
He probably won't.
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying anyway, can you?
It's just come.
Probably bad news.
Something wrong?
Decidedly wrong.
I'm stood up again.
You know, Piper, people are gonna decide one of three things about me.
Hello. Give me the travel desk, please.
Either that I'm a brazen hussy,
or I'm just a plain squaw... who has to tag along after her man no matter where he goes.
Even if he isn't her man yet.
Or that I'm unselfish enough to want to help a friend who's in a lot of trouble.
Perhaps the correct answer is I'm all three of those things, huh?
Say, Piper, what are you doing?
Packing for Buenos Aires.
- Buenos Aires?
- Isn't that our next stop?
- Yes. Yeah, but how did you know?
- I'm psychic.
Hello. Is this the travel desk?
Can you tell me please... what boat left for Buenos Aires this morning and when will it arrive there?
And can I beat that boat by sailing for New York immediately and then flying south?
And if so, by how many days can I beat it?
No, no, no. Call me back, will you please?
Yeah, thanks.
[Speaking Arabic]
Now look here, Mulcahay, there's something I want to ask you.
Did you know the barman that mixed that drink for my father at the club?
I did.
But there's a brown colleen here by the name of Ah-Ah-Nee.
Ah-Nee?
They say she knows him better.
The barman? Does this girl
Ah-Nee know where he went?
She did spit it out once in the state of her wrath.
'Twas in, uh, America.
- South America, I think.
- South America? Did she say what part of South America?
Now, she did so.
I'm just remembering.
Let's see now.
I have a- I have a sister... in, uh- in Cincinnati, in Ohio, married to a plumber.
Yes, a nice girl. No, it wasn't there.
It was an island, I think.
Get away!
English dog! You pushed me!
[Spits]
English dog?
English, to me! Eng-
- Oh, Barney!
- Yo!
- Feeney!
- Yo!
- [Shouts, Indistinct]
- [Man] Yo!
## [Piano]
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
#[Continues]
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
[All Shouting]
#[Continues]
Be with you in a minute, boys.
Gentlemen, I give you-
- Mulcahay, you're hurt!
- Ah, 'tis nothing. Nothing.
- Look, it's the police!
- Upstairs. Upstairs.
Come on.
- Boson!
- [Geoffrey] Nosey!
Oh, I am glad to see you.
Any news of Beano and Rodney?
Yes, a wire. They've struck the scene and the kid's been in a fight.
- Oh, trust Snicklefritz for that.
- What about you?
I'm with Loveland. And this calls for a drink.
Two B and B's, please.
I have met the most attractive-
The most beautiful, the most wonderful girl.
No, seriously, this time I've struck 10.
I think I'll marry her.
- [Chuckling]
- How do you do?
- What about the others?
- Well, it is hard on Joan... and I did have a kind of understanding with Betty, but...
- I think I'll keep this one.
- [Chuckling]
Now, Chris, we're out here on serious business.
We've got to clear our father's name.
Hold your hat on, Boson.
Everything's under control.
This girl introduced me to the whole bunch... and you're going to meet them all in a minute.
- And there's something going on, my boy.
- What?
Excuse us, please.
- Well, what's going on?
- Well, I don't know yet, but here's the picture.
Furnoy-American, rich, with a yacht, but not cruising about just for pleasure.
I'll stake my life on that. Then there's a General Torres who simply reeks of conspiracy.
And Loveland-very thick with them all and suddenly rolling in money.
- Looks like something pretty hot to me.
- Well, let's get on with it.
Wait a minute. Your name's Gordon.
Uh, Herkimer Gordon.
Her- Herkimer?
Why not Hezekiah?
Well, I'm sorry if you prefer it like that, but you're already heavily billed as Herkimer.
Captain Loveland, may I introduce my brother,
Herkimer? He's just landed from England.
- How do you do?
- It's a pleasure, Mr. Gordon. Won't you join us?
- Delighted.
- Thank you very much.
- General Torres.
- [Geoffrey] How do you do?
- Senora Aguilard.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Furnoy.
- How do you do, Mr. Gordon?
And Miss Cherrington.
How do you do, Mr. Gordon?
Uh, won't you sit down?
How do you do, Miss Cherrington?
- What is your politics?
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- What?
- Hmm?
- [Laughing]
- #[Orchestra Begins]
I, uh- I'd like to dance.
You understand, don't you?
[Chuckles]
[Laughing]
Geoffrey!
Well, then score one for me.
For once you did look surprised.
How in the world did you get here?
- By plane from New York.
- Why?
Why not? After all, I'm the traveling kid.
Remember me?
And besides, I adore intrigue.
Give me a couple of aliases and a plate of fudge, and I'm happy.
Well, I might have known you'd be here.
Well, you'll change your tune when you find out how much help I can be.
You see, I know Douglas Loveland.
That's what I was trying to tell you that day at..."Sinjin Comely."
Now, Lynn, I'm delighted to see you, and I know your intentions are excellent...
- but please keep out of this.
- Why-
Why, you ungrateful pup.
- I know, little Miss Fix-it.
- Mm-hmm.
You were going to fix a speeding ticket for me in Washington.
- It took the whole embassy to get me out of the, uh-
- Jug.
Well, in that case, I don't suppose you'd care to go up the river... on a little yachting trip tomorrow with Furnoy,
General Torres and Loveland.
- But I would.
- Well, of course, I could fix it for you, Geoffrey... but if you think
I'm such a nuisance-
Look here, Lynn, we must go with them.
- Well, are you grateful?
- Rather.
Say it properly then.
Geoffrey, Boson, Herkimer,
Herky, listen.
Loveland's going up the river on a yacht and-
- Were you two kissing then?
- No.
[Man Chanting In Arabic]
Here we have the village belles.
[Chanting Continues]
I don't like to have Rodney running about alone in the native quarter.
I wouldn't trouble about him.
- I'm sure he can box better than I can myself.
- [Gunshot]
- [Rodney] Stop that, you fool!
- Rodney!
Rodney, what's up?
This is the barman's girl- the barman at the club, you know.
She was just showing me how she'd like to welcome home her erring knight...
when the popgun went off.
- Give me a look at the cannon.
- I wish you wouldn't go barging off all alone like this.
We've got serious work to do.
Good afternoon.
I know that as well as you do.
Oh, don't flutter like an old hen, Beano.
- I can dig my own worms.
And make a note of that too.
- Look here, sir.
'Tis the same lethal weapon was in the hands of the natives that revolted against us. Look, sir.
The maker's name chiseled off and all.
That's splendid.
Now, can you tell me where you got that?
One day I steal from him.
He drunk.
Bad to Ah-Nee when he drunk.
[Wyatt] Where did your friend live
before he came here?
I do not understand.
'Tis strange, sir, how a little silver increases the understanding.
Oh, yes, of course. Here.
Perhaps this'll help clear the old bean.
He say Murros Island.
- Murros Island?
- In South America.
- We've got it, Beano.
- We'd better keep the gun for evidence.
Yes. Here, Ah-Nee.
Take this, but don't spend it all in one place.
Calcutta?
- Calcutta? I have ticket.
- Ready.
Mr. Wyatt Leigh calling Mr. Herkimer Gordon,
Hotel Royal, Buenos Aires.
This is Calcutta Central 0021.
Buenos Aires?
I have a ticket.
[Speaking Spanish]
Murros Island?
Where's that?
That's right. That's right.
Murros Island.
- M-U-R-R-
- Oh, shut up.
No, no, no. Young Rod.
Somewhere off the coast of South America.
Yes. South America.
Right. Are you sure about the gun? The gun.
Certain.
Mulcahay says it's identical with those used in the revolt.
Revolt.
Even to the maker's name being chiseled off.
Good.
Then we're getting warm.
We're getting warm.
We think we're on a trail here too.
A trail here too.
Keep up the good work, Beano, and take care of the kid.
Hello, Geoff.
Did you hear about the cricket final?
Thirty-eight pounds 10.
[Ship Horn Blowing]
Oh, look, Douglas, we're slowing down.
- Are we stopping?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.
- Squalid little place, but quite important for military reasons.
Controls the up-country.
Oh. Are we on a military expedition?
I didn't mean to suggest that.
Oh, Douglas, you don't have to be cautious with me.
You know that.
And after all, we, uh- we are on a military expedition, aren't we?
- Nice little hand.
- [Chuckles]
Nosey, we're slowing down.
I think we must be coming to-
Lynn is getting altogether too thick with that fellow Loveland.
- Oh, is she? L- I hadn't noticed.
- Take a good look.
You know, Douglas, you're such a natural as a soldier.
You must have had awfully good reasons for giving up the service.
- I did.
- Oh.
[With Squeaky Voice]
Hello.
- [Squeaky Voice] Hello.
- Hello.
Hello. Did you gentlemen order a bottle of scotch?
Aye. Aye.
Aye, that we did.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye.
- [Squeaking]
[Normal Voice]
My good friend, Donald Mouse.
Fine type.
- You know, you are a good sort.
- [Chuckles]
- Mr. Furnoy is asking for you, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, Douglas, you're coming right back to me now, aren't you?
- Yes, of course I will.
- Oh, hurry now.
- Well, Lynn, I must say, you're marvelous.
- Really? Why?
Got Loveland all in a lather, haven't you?
- Well, that was the idea.
- Well, I don't like it.
- Oh, really? Why, Geoff?
- Because I asked you to keep out of this.
This is a serious mission.
Oh, I appreciate your interest and all that.
It was very kind of you.
You got us invited on this trip.
But for the rest, I wish
you'd let us go it alone.
Oh. So that's how it is with us, huh?
Yes, that's the way it is with us.
And besides, Loveland's no friend of ours.
He's in the enemy camp.
Now, just a moment.
- Am I, by any chance, being called a traitor?
- Oh, I didn't say that.
Well, you implied it. And you might just as well have said it as to imply it.
- You know, really, Geoffrey, you're awfully stupid.
- Oh, so I'm stupid, am I?
- Yes, you certainly are.
- Well, how do you explain your snuggling up to him?
- Was that part of your act too?
- Explain to you? I'd rather eat ground glass first.
I have my own reasons
for what I do and-
[Both Arguing, Indistinct]
I don't stand and deliver to anybody! Do you understand?
All the same, you did everything but kiss him.
I don't see why you stopped at that.
Well, supposing I did?
Now listen to me, young man.
Nobody tells me what I can't do or where I can't go.
And as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Geoffrey Leigh, you can go jump in the lake- river!
Oh, I'll admit that wasn't very good... but the next time I see you, and I hope I never do...
I'll have thought up something better!
[Sobbing]
[Bell Ringing]
- [Chime Ringing]
- If they have discovered the guns, I am ruined.
- Oh? What's up?
- Well, he has a message that suggests a leak.
I paid you dearly for those guns, senores.
One million gold pesos, the gift of poor people, the word-
You'll find them all there.
The last stuff was delivered yesterday.
If there should be treachery-
It will be from your men.
I can trust mine.
So General Torres has an interest in this little place, huh?
Well, why is Mr. Furnoy going with him?
Oh, take a look at the town, I expect.
Oh, really?
Oh, I think I'd like to do that, Douglas.
- Let's go.
- No, no, really.
- Furnoy doesn't want anyone else to go ashore.
- Well, why?
- Well, these little places can be dangerous.
- Oh.
- Bandits, you know.
- Bandits! Oh, how exciting!
- Now I know I want to go. Come on, Douglas.
- No, really. L-
- You know, I've got to obey.
- Obey?
- Yeah.
- Well, whom?
Well, I mean- I mean, you can't.
No, I must forbid it.
Forbid? Oh, Douglas, that was your biggest mistake.
Stand aside.
I'm on my way.
- Torres.
- Hmm?
I don't like the feel of this place.
It's- It's suspiciously quiet.
- Senor, it is I who give the command here.
- [Chuckles]
All right. Go ahead and give the command.
I'm going back to the yacht.
- You're afraid to go to the warehouse?
- Oh, no. Let fools be heroes.
It's their business.
Mine is selling arms.
You go to the warehouse.
Take a good look around.
You'll find everything in order.
[Scoffs]
Oh, that's lovely.
Oh, I like that.
Douglas, buy me that, huh?
There's General Torres.
Oh, I'll bet where the general is, there's excitement.
Come on, Douglas.
Let's go.
- Willful little thing, aren't you?
- [Chuckles]
Furnoy will give us beans for this, but I can't let you go alone.
No, no. I'll say you couldn't.
Come on.
- Atenciön!

- Senor, you have no right-
- It's quite all right, General.
Miss Cherrington is a friend.
Oh.
Forgive me, senorita.
I did not know you were a friend.
Behold my so beautiful stores.
With these, I shall liberate
my unfortunate people.
They shall be happy
once more in liberty.
Please come.
Please, senorita, let me give you a little of this old, old-
Do I see you again, amigo?
A charming moment, my friend.
Oh, delightful, mi general.
It is a pleasure to introduce my friends.
Senorita Cherrington of New York...
Capitán Loveland of London... my distinguished compatriot...
General Adolfo Arturios
Gregario Sebastian.
Ah, senorita.
- What a moment I have.
- Thank you.
Capitán.
- I extend my most gracious welcome to our small city.
- [Lynn Chuckles]
There will be a little celebration tonight... in honor of our dear friend,
General Torres.
If the so beautiful senorita and capitán
will honor us.
Oh, I'd love to.
Do you think we can, Douglas?
- Well, I'm not quite sure, Lynn.
- I shall hope.
And now, with your pardon, I have important business with our friend, General Torres.
If you will be so good, my friend.
Oh, with pleasure, amigo.
- Forgive me for a moment.
- Of course.
Good-bye.
General.
- [Engines Rewing]
- Oh, I think he's charming.
- We'd better get out of here.
- Why?
- I don't like it.
- Oh, Douglas, don't be silly. It may be interesting.
- Besides, I want to stay and see the fun.
- Fun?
Uh-huh.
Well, you would come ashore.
[Rewing Continues]
- Gracias.
- [Engines Stop]
Shall we drink, my friend, to liberty?
With all my heart.
To liberty.
Forgive me, my friend, but you know I do not smoke.
- But, my friend, people are watching.
- Oh.
You are very thoughtful.
Gracias.
[Coughs]
No.
- Magnificent, my friend.
- Gracias.
Douglas, they're not going to-

Oh, Douglas, poor Torres.
And those half-starved little people, mowed down like that without a chance.
- And women and kids too, Douglas!
- That's war, you know.
- It isn't war. It's a massacre.
- [Gunfire]
- It's all a surprise to me.
- [Woman Screams]
It's the men who sell them ammunition and encourage such things who ought to be shot...
- not those poor little devils!
- Lynn!
- Lynn!
- Geoffrey! Oh, Geoffrey!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Say, help me out of this, will you, mister?
- [Speaking Spanish]
Come along, Lynn.
We'd better get back to the boat.
Say, guvnor, you remember me...
- from Murros Island?
- I never saw you before in my life.
Why, I been looking at your blinking face every day for a week.
They're going to shoot me, guvnor.
Help me, lady, will you?
Help me.
They're gonna shoot me.
- Douglas, you can't let them do that.
- It isn't wise to interfere.
[Shouting In Spanish]
Say, look here!
[Spanish]
[Spanish]
Geoffrey! Geoffrey!
Oh, of all the stupid, asinine things to do!
Don't worry, Lynn. He's got a plan.
He's getting information.
Information? Why, they'll stand him up against a wall and shoot him. Geoffrey!
They won't do that to him.
He's a British subject. He's been to Washington.
Now you listen to me, Chris.
You haven't seen what I have tonight.
They'll kill anybody in this town- anybody!
[Speaking Spanish]
[Gunfire In Distance]
[Speaking Spanish]
[Spanish]
You were employed by these munitions people. Is that right?
That's right. Say, mister, the firing squad'll be here any minute... and they don't bother about court-martials in this town.
My friends are at work.
They'll get us out.
Well, I hopes they look lively.
They'd as soon shoot you as look at you. Uh, sooner.
- What about Murros Island?
- That's where they keep the stuff, guvnor.
And they've got enough stuff there to blow up the whole world if you ask me.
- And you delivered the guns here to Torres and his rebels?
- [Gunfire In Distance]
Yes, sir.
And to the government too.
Atlas Arms was shooting on both sides in this little dust-up.
- Atlas Arms?
- [Gunfire]
What was that?
[Speaking Spanish]
[Gunfire]
- We'll be next, guvnor.
- Don't get a wind up, old chap.
My friends will manage somehow.
Well, they'd better shake a leg if they want to meet us this side of heaven.
I'm afraid you're right.
- [Gunfire]
- Look.
- [Spanish]
- They're coming for us now!
- Geoff!
- Lynn!
- Oh, Geoff, I was so worried.
- Oh, Lynn.
L- I've got a release order for you.
Douglas Loveland got it.
Let's get out of here.
[Speaking Spanish]
[Spanish]
- [Gunshots]
- [Man Screams]
[Spanish]
- Thank you, lady.
- Yeah.
Oh, Geoffrey, I'm so glad you're all right.
Lynn, darling, I'm sorry about those suspicions.
They were just plain jealousy.
- Geoff!
- And, darling, apart from the fact... that I'd like to box your ears...
- I'm afraid I'm hopelessly in love with you.
- Oh, Geoff, Geoff.
[Vehicles Approaching]
Darling!
[Backfires]
[Gunfire In Distance]
Look, I'm not a fussy man, but I thought you didn't like him.
Well, l-
I'm not quite sure that I do.
You see, Nosey... uh, Lynn and l-
Well, l- Look here.
It's an old story.
I mean, l- Well-
You mean you and Lynn are-
Uh, yes.
[Laughs]
- Then you don't love me?
- Oh, yes, Chris. I do love you.
Only Geoff saw me first.
It took a firing squad to make me realize it.
Oh, you'll be all right, Chris.
Remember, there's Joan and Elizabeth... and that little telephone operator in the Buenos Aires hotel.
Bernice and Penelope. There are thousands of beautiful creatures all panting for me...
- but I don't think I'll find one quite like you, Lynn.
- Thanks.
[Sighs]
Good luck, old man.
Oh, what about that cockney?
Listen. Marvelous, Nosey. It's a concern called Atlas Arms behind the whole thing...
- and their distributing point is Murros Island.
- Murros Island?
Hey! Don't mind me!
Murros Island!
Then the whole thing links up.
I think I've got the evidence to prove it.
Do you remember Beano said...
- the maker's name was chiseled off that gun?
- Yes.
This one I got off a dead soldier and the name's gone off that too.
- Oh! Even I get that.
That means Atlas Arms in both places.
- And Loveland in both places.
I think we've got the last nail in that chap's coffin.
Where is he?
He's in the street. He's getting rather nervous.
Let's go and get him.
[Gasps]
We'd better get aboard. Furnoy is extremely annoyed over the disturbance you've made.
Listen, Loveland, I don't usually go about hitting people on the chin... but this time I have a reason that might interest you.
Let's go inside and have a beer and talk it over.
No, we can't keep Furnoy waiting.
Oh, please, Douglas.
L-I'm thirsty.
Well, if it ain't my old pal from Murros Island!
- Get away, blast you!
- Oh, now how can I be in your way... when I'm invisible?
- What you can't see can't hinder.
- You come with me.
- You'd better come.
- Entertain the lady, will ya, mate?
Sit down.
[Sighs]
This is all very mock heroic, gentlemen.
May I ask the point?
Well, the first point is this-
Our name's not Gordon. It's Leigh.
Interesting as fact, but hardly significant.
You'll find it significant.
Our father's name was Colonel Loring Leigh.
You knew him, I believe.
Very well.
He was my commanding officer in India.
Quite, and you were a witness at his trial.
Reluctantly, I admit.
All the same, he was convicted on your perjured evidence.
- I'm not gonna stay here and be insulted.
- Speaking of mock heroics.
Sit down.
Is there anything familiar about that gun?
- No.
- Well, the barman in India left one behind... exactly like it when he skipped.
It wasn't clever of you, Loveland, to let that cockney down.
He told me the whole story in jail while you, no doubt, were hoping we'd both be shot.
I confess it would've saved me this rather boring interview.
Don't smile like that.
It annoys me.
You're gonna tell us now exactly what happened in India.
- And if I don't?
- Why, then, Loveland...
I promise you, on my word of honor, that I'll shoot you right now.
Just a stray bullet from the revolution.
I forged the order.
That's all.
- Go on.
- There isn't any more.
- I didn't kill you father.
- Then you do know that he was killed!
Well, we want the name of the man who killed him.
I'm probably signing my own death warrant.
[Chuckles]
- But since you insist, it was-
- [Gunshots]
Geoffrey! Geoffrey, what happened?
- A shot came from that window.
- But why?
The thing to do now is get out of here immediately.
[All Shouting]
[Horn Blowing]
[Furnoy]
Yes, poor fellow.
Very evidently a stray bullet from the revolution
finished him off. Come in.
Yes. Oh, you'll make
all the arrangements, eh?
Good. Well, I'm pulling out of here at once.
L- I don't want to risk my other guests.
I've just been talking over the wireless telephone to the British consul.
He's making all the arrangements about poor Loveland.
Peculiar chap, in some ways, Loveland... but always a delightful guest.
- Won't you sit down and have a drink?
- No, thanks.
We want to talk to you, Furnoy.
- First of all, you ought to know who we are.
- Oh, that's not necessary.
I do a lot of business through the British embassy in Washington.
In that case, you must've heard of our father, Colonel Loring Leigh.
Yes, I think I have.
Read something of him recently.
We came here to have a showdown with Loveland.
He was the chief witness against our father in India.
And tonight we got the evidence we wanted.
He confessed that he had been bribed to forge the order... on which our father was court-martialed and convicted.
Bribed? Who bribed him?
A munitions concern called Atlas Arms.
Atlas Arms?
Never heard of them.
Won't you boys sit down and have-
And Loveland wasn't killed by a stray bullet.
He was murdered.
Well, great scott, this all seems very mysterious.
It is. Loveland was just about to disclose the name of the official of Atlas Arms... who killed our father, when the shot was fired.
- Obviously, someone did not want us to hear that name.
- Certainly looks that way.
Furnoy, we were wondering if it could be anybody on this boat.
It seems to us that Loveland constantly took orders from you.
By the Lord Harry,
I believe you chaps think I'm in this.
[Laughs]
Why don't you take that gun out of your pocket?
You know, I've been accused of a lot of things in my time, but never murder.
You chaps are so serious.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can look me up in Bradstreet's.
[Chuckles]
Well, wait.
You've been in America.
- Have you never heard of Standard Rubber?
- I'm afraid not.
Oh! Well, that's me.
[Laughs] Of course, I don't pay much attention to it nowadays.
But while I was developing it, I was forced to travel a great deal, looking for rubber.
It gave me a sort of a passion for knocking about the world with adventure and excitement.
You know, knocking about the world in odd places and collecting curious people.
I knew a chap called
Traud Shaw once-
Now take, for instance, Loveland and Torres.
I looked them up too.
Loveland, I found, was an army officer who'd retired with a bit of money.
And Torres-
Well, Torres was obviously an old bandit.
Turned revolutionary and all that sort of thing.
[Laughs]
As a matter of fact,
Torres suggested this cruise.
And I thought it would be fun.
Now with Loveland gone-
[Sighs]
What I'm really interested in- uh, pardon me- is this.
- Ooh.
- Softer hands...
- for housewives.
- That's good.
As well as bigger and better teeth for dogs... and babies.
So you see, if you're trying to tie me up with your late friend...
- well, you're barking up the wrong tree.
- [Squeaking]
[Laughs]
Now if you boys will pardon me...
I think I'll turn in, and I think you should too.
- Uh, may I keep this one?
- Yes, if you like.
- And that too.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, look-
- Good night.
We didn't do that very well, did we?
You blasted idiot!
[Squeaks]
Which one of those mugs is in love with Lynn Cherrington?
Both, I should say.
Oh, good.
Ask Miss Cherrington to step in, will you?
[Horn Blowing]
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Miss Cherrington.
I hope you're feeling better.
- Thank you. I am.
- Sorry you got in all this mess.
- Well-
- Won't you sit down?
Thank you. After all, it was my first revolution, and I don't care to see another, thanks.
Well, you know, men will fight.
- Yeah.
- War is a pretty old institution.
Pretty horrible one too, isn't it?
Yes, it's terrible about Loveland.
Oh, I managed to get your father on the wireless telephone.
Finally located him in Alexandria, in Egypt.
Really? I thought he was in- in London.
No. I felt that he'd, naturally, want to know what was going on here.
Particularly about Loveland.
My father? But why?
Well, as president of the Atlas Arms, he'd naturally feel concerned.
President of Atlas Arms?
Yeah. Oh.
L- I thought you knew.
Why, uh-Why, no.
I didn't know. L-
Uh, I wonder if I may have a cigarette.
Yes. Surely.
Thank you.
As a matter of fact, that's how I first met Loveland.
He'd a letter of introduction from your father... whom he'd worked for sometime before in India.
Oh, and by the by, I didn't make any mention at all of your being aboard ship.
I was afraid it might worry your father.
Yes. Oh, yes, it might.
- Good night and thank you.
- Good night, my dear.
[Ship Horn Blowing]
You'll probably find
Miss Cherrington at the hotel.
I think she went ashore early to get a good night's rest.
Well, good-bye, Mr. Furnoy.
Very happy to have been aboard.
- Well, happy to have had you.
- And I'm- I'm terribly sorry about last night.
- Oh, forget it.
- Good-bye, sir. Happy to have been aboard.
- Thank you very much.
- Well, I enjoyed having you too.
And by the way, here's one of my latest little gadgets, all for you.
- Oh, thank you so much.
- [Laughs]
- Thank you.
- Good-bye, boys.
[Geoffrey]
Good-bye.
[Squeaks]
[Loud Squeaking]
[Laughs]
Beg your pardon, sir. Operator says please stand by for a call from India.
- India?
- Yes, sir.
- Right!
- Gracias, senor.
Nosey! Ready, Nosey.
India's calling!
Really, I wish you'd knock before you do this type of thing.
How did you know who was- Oh. India?
Hello? Ready here for the call.
India again?
You know, I can't understand why Lynn didn't wait for us this morning.
Typical of the breed.
Women don't give it a thought.
I suppose she was feeling pretty ill.
- No wonder after last night, poor kid.
- Yes.
- Should we phone her?
- Let's. I know the minute she hears my voice... her rooms will be bathed in brilliant sunlight... and birds will probably twitter from her ceiling.
Get her on the phone for me, will you?
Hello? Hello. Operator?
Put me through to
Miss Cherrington, will you?
She's gone?
She's gone!
- Hello, this is Gordon Herk-
- Herkimer Gordon!
Calling. Didn't she leave a message for me?
But she must've left a forwarding address.
- Thanks.
- Gone?
Bag and baggage, without a word.
But no note on the dressing table?
- I can't understand it.
- [Ringing]
Hello? It's Wyatt!
We've got on to something, Boson!
That barman's gun was manufactured by a company called Atlas Arms.
Atlas Arms!
We located the president of Atlas Arms in Alexandria, Egypt.
All the number-one boys of the munitions racket are there.
Now look here.
Take the first boat and meet us there.
What?
Oh, yes, yes!
What was that name again? Quick.
His name is Martin Cherrington.
That's right.
"Cherring-ton."
Now what's the matter?
Lynn's father's president of Atlas Arms.
What?
- I certainly don't like the look of this.
- What do you mean?
Lynn arrived at Leigh Hall the day that Drake was shot, right?
Then she arrived out here before you did, and I met her with Loveland.
It all looks most peculiar to me.
Don't be an ass.
Lynn's just an impulsive girl who reads too many detective stories.
- I hope you're right.
- I am! Lynn tried to help us, didn't she?
She arranged for us to go on this trip with Loveland.
Don't you realize that might all have been a very neat trick?
I wonder.
- It's utterly impossible, but-
- What do we do now?
- We pack for Alexandria at once.
- Oh.
[Prayer Horn Sounds]
[Speaking Arabic]
[Arabic]
His Highness agrees to the terms... and would pay partly in gold and partly in silver.
Okay. Now you tell your friend the shipment can be made secretly.
Mr. Furnoy, who's in charge of all operations... will be here in a couple of days and settle the details.
- [Speaking Arabic]
- The kid's here.
Landed at Imperial Airways a few minutes ago.
What? Here in Alexandria?
How the dickens did she track me?
- Well, tell her I'm busy!
- [Chuckles]
- You tell her.
- Hmm?
Well, all right.
Shoot her in.
If you gentlemen will wait in this room, please,
I won't be a minute.
- As-salaam alaikum.
- As-salaam alaikum.
Okay.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Lynn. What are you doing in Egypt?
- I came to have a little talk with you.
- Well, well. What's up?
Engaged, married or broke?
How's about a daughterly peck?
No, thanks. I'm not very fond of you at the moment.
Well, well.
What have I done now?
Dad, is it true that you're president of Atlas Arms?
Where did you get track of that?
Now don't go answering a question with a question! Are you president of Atlas Arms?
As a matter of fact, I am, though it's not generally known.
But then I'm mixed up in a dozen companies.
Why pick on Atlas?
Oh, nothing.
That just makes you a murderer, that's all.
Here, here, here, here.
What's this?
I've just come back from South America where I've seen men, women and kids... killed with guns that you made and sold.
It was terrible. People were shot down on the street without a chance.
[Scoffs] What do you think war is like?
A marshmallow roast?
Don't be flippant.
It was horrible.
You came halfway around the world to tell me that?
Listen, Lynn. I know that war is agony, filth and horror.
It's mass stupidity and collective insanity.
You know all that and still you go on selling arms?
Well, if I don't do it, somebody else will.
Besides, you know, you're pretty expensive with your globe-trotting ideas.
- Right now, I hate every penny you ever spent on me.
- Oh, you do, eh?
Okay. I'm making a note to have your allowance stopped.
Can't you be serious for two seconds?
I'm more in earnest than I've ever been in my whole life... and you treat me as though
I were still in rompers.
- Are you really serious?
- Yes, of course I am.
All right.
War is all you say it is and more.
But I'm not responsible if fools want to cut each other's throats.
My factories turn out guns, among other things.
Now if men want to buy them and make hell on earth... they might just as well buy 'em from me.
But if they ever see reason...
I'd be delighted to shut down my plants.
Now you know where I stand.
Dad, you're talking about men as if they weren't even people.
I've seen them die, slaughtered like animals.
That's your fault for messing around such places.
I don't suppose it makes any difference to you either, the fact that you've cost me... the love and respect of the one man in the world I cared anything about.
I never heard of him either, so I can't be responsible.
All right, but get this clear.
From now on, I'm on the other side.
I'm fighting you.
Great! I love a good, stiff fight.
- You'll get it.
- In that case, I'll increase your allowance.
- You'll need a war chest.
- You can take your war chest and go to the devil!
[Clicks Tongue]
- [Laughs]
- Spunky kid, eh?
That's the way I like 'em.
Send in those snake charmers again.
[Chattering]
I say! There they are!
- Nosey, Boson!
- By George, it's good to see them!
[Laughs]
What have you got on your head?
[Laughs]
Come on!
[Laughs]
Oh!
[Laughing]
Rodney, wha-Whiskers?
- [Wyatt] A mustache!
- A beard!
- It comes off.
- But you have one, and Boson said-
It comes off!
- Up.
- [Laughing]
- [Laughing]
- I say.
Nosey! Come on.
Get out of here. Nosey!
- Come on.
- [Laughs] Oh!
[Lynn Laughs]
Geoffrey!
Chris! Chris, hello. Remember me?
The old popper-upper?
Um, Geoff, darling!
Darling, I'm so glad to see you.
I didn't know where we'd ever find each other again.
I wasn't even sure that you'd come, but I watched every steamer.
And, Geoff, remember there was something I had to explain to you?
Well, I wasn't clear about it until I got here, but now I am.
- You see-
- I think we're both quite clear.
Why, Geoffrey, what's the matter?
That sounds like a queer kind of question.
Queer question?
But why? What have I done?
When your father's president of Atlas Arms-
Oh, well, I wanted to be the first to tell you that and explain, Geoffrey-
- I don't think explanations are possible.
- Oh, but, Geoffrey...
- surely you can't just-
- Please, Lynn, my brothers are waiting for me.
Uh, Geoffrey-
The guns are identical. The maker's name
has been chiseled off on both in the same way.
We had an acid test made of ours, and the name Atlas Arms came out plain as day.
- So, at last, we're getting somewhere.
- I'm afraid we're not.
- What do you mean, Beano?
- Well, you see, Loveland is dead.
We have his confession, but that's only hearsay evidence.
And the rest is purely circumstantial.
No court would accept it for a moment.
[Geoffrey] Do you mean we haven't
accomplished anything?
[Christopher] What about Cherrington?
He's the man we've got to see.
- [Rodney]Just try.
- Dear fellow, it's easier to get an interview with the king.
Cherrington's guarded on all sides.
We couldn't even get past his third secretary.
If ever I wanted to poke anyone in the nose, it was that snooty secretary.
No, I'm afraid as far as seeing Cherrington is concerned, that's a very difficult assignment.
Well, in that case, you'll need me.
- [Geoffrey] Lynn!
- [Chris] Lynn!
- Oh, Lynn, we werejust talking about you-
- That's hardly necessary.
- I'm Lynn Cherrington.
- How do you do?
- How do you do? And how do you do?
- How do you do?
And believe it or not, you do need me.
- Uh, Lynn, we're very busy.
- Very busy indeed.
Yes. Yes, I know. I'm still messing in your affairs, and you don't like it.
Well, all the fun's gone out of it for me too... but I'm gonna stay and finish what I started.
We'd be grateful for any help,
Miss Cherrington.
- May I take your wrap?
- Thank you. Don't tell me I've met one member of this family...
- who really has brains.
- Oh, well.
- Or, perhaps, two members, huh?
- Oh, thank you.
Of course, those idiots over there think I can't be trusted.
- [Wyatt] No.
- But I do hope you'll believe me.
[Both Laugh]
- Please, Lynn-
- Look, Lynn, if you could-
And besides, I've had about enough of this
"Please, Lynn" stuff.
Do you think I've met every steamer just to flatter your vanity?
I was afraid my father'd get away before you arrived, if you ever did.
And when you did arrive, you wouldn't even listen to me!
Now, would you like to see my father?
Oh, would we?
I say, you are a trump.
- Thank you.
- We'd be very grateful, Miss Cherrington.
Oh, I knew I should've waited till I met the rest of the family... before I made my choice.
- You know, it's a very good thing that you came, uh, Beano.
- Yes?
- Because those two mutts would never have gotten anyplace.
- [Wyatt] No, no.
And it's a very good thing that you came too...
- uh, Snozzle.
- Uh, Snicklefritz.
[Laughs]
Well, shall we go?
Thank you.
[Laughs]
Uh, you two can tag along if you like, uh, Nosey and, uh, Stinky.
[Laughter]
Come, Stinky.
[Lynn]
Thank you.
[Knocking]
Oh, sorry, Lady Cherrington.
[Speaks French]
- Hi, Mike.
- Hello, Lynn.
No!
No!
Uh-huh. Nope.
- Oh.
- Well, Dad, I want you to meet some friends of mine.
Mr. Wyatt, Rodney,
Christopher and Geoffrey Leigh.
Oh, yes. Always glad to meet friends of Lynn's.
How do you do?
- Uh, now, Dad, I want you to listen to me-
- I'm sorry, Lynn.
I've got to attend a meeting.
Some other time, honey.
[Lock Rattles]
Hello. What's this?
Am I being kidnapped?
I'm sorry, sir, but this is a matter of life and death to us.
We've been trying to see you for days.
And I'm afraid you must listen.
[Clicks Tongue]
Well, well.
Serious as all that,
I suppose I can spare you five minutes.
Well, go ahead, Lynn.
You've evidently got a speech on your chest.
[Sighs]
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.
Do you remember a couple of weeks ago when we were in England?
I went to a certain house where a British officer and his sons... had led happy and honorable lives.
I went out there happily too, but...
I found a tragic thing had happened.
A little while before, that officer had been disgraced and broken in India.
He'd come back home to prove to his sons that he wasn't guilty.
But before he could show them his evidence... he was murdered and all of his papers were stolen.
That officer was Colonel Loring Leigh and these are his four sons.
Are you sure he was murdered?
- Definitely.
- A few days later... another officer who had come from India... to help Colonel Leigh clear his name was also murdered.
- Now, someone was afraid, Dad, of what they knew.
- That's true, sir.
I see.
But what on earth makes you think that I was in on this?
Well, because Atlas Arms is responsible for everything that's occurred... and you are Atlas Arms.
So you think I'm the man, and you're ready to throw me to the wolves, eh?
Lynn, you must have a pretty big stake in this.
I have Dad. I'm in love with Geoffrey Leigh.
But he's not in love with me now, though he was for a little while.
Mr. Furnoy spoiled all that. You see, he told me you were president of Atlas Arms and-
Uh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Lynn, did Furnoy know that these boys were Colonel Leigh's sons?
- Yes, he did.
- Well.
I'm beginning to see daylight.
Gentlemen, I hold the controlling shares of many companies, including Atlas... but I don't control its policy.
I want you to believe I didn't know that that policy included murder.
- Oh, Dad, can you prove that?
- Why, yes, if necessary.
I make plowshares, locomotives and tractors and even safety razors.
My stock in Atlas will be sold at once,
I promise you.
But you must know who does control the policy of Atlas Arms.
- And you've got to tell us, sir.
- Oh, no, sonny, I haven't.
- Oh, Dad, you do.
- May I suggest, sir, that if you protect him... you make yourself an accessory to those murders.
Well, I guess a man in my position could legally wriggle out of that.
But I don't hold with murder, and the man who's responsible knows that I don't.
That's why he's kept me in the dark.
- Guess you boys want him pretty badly, don't you?
- Naturally, sir.
Then you'll have to hustle.
He's sailing on his yacht tonight for Singapore.
His name is Furnoy.
- Furnoy?
- But I thought he made-
- Well, what are we waiting for? Come on!
- Thanks, Dad.
Geoffrey! Geoffrey!
Geoffrey, wait a minute!
- I'm going with you!
- Darling, you can't come too.
This is a job for men and guns and-
[Screams]
[Sighs]
Don't forget to touch second.
- Lynn, can you ever forgive me?
- Of course, Geoffrey.
Only not in a rush like this. Not until there's time for a thorough reconciliation.
And, darling, be careful!
There she is out there, the big white one.
- There's no dinghy. We'll have to swim for it.
- Yes, but quietly!
- No flat dives.
- No nonsense.
Captain, get up a head of steam.
We're gonna sneak outta here tonight.
No, sneak out.
Not Singapore.
Murros Island.
[Indistinct]
[Ship Bells Ringing]
[Whispers]
All right. Come ahead.
Hey! What are you people doing here?
Come on, Boson.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
All clear.
- Now which way?
- Follow it forward. Go to his cabin.
- Are you comfortable, Captain?
- Come on.
- What's this?
- Guest cabins here.
Come on now.
Take it easy.
That's Furnoy's cabin and the secretary.
[Rattling]
That door's locked.
That's Furnoy's cabin there.
- [Typing]
- There's someone in there.
- It's the secretary's room.
- It's locked.
- Let's crash it.
- Don't be silly.
[Squeaky Voice] Hello!
Did you want some more scotch and soda?
Snow White! Shh! Shh!
Donald Moose- Goose. Wait a minute.
Shh.
[With Squeaky Voice] Hello.
- [Squeaking]
- Oh. Yes, sir.
Good heavens.
Thank you. Thank you.
[Squeaking]
[Squeaking]
Oh. Right away.
[Men Grunting]
Captain. Captain!
Good evening, Mr. Furnoy.
This is my brother Wyatt Leigh.
He's head of our family now since you murdered our father.
This is my brother Rodney Leigh.
We've come to clear our father's name.
We want a full confession from you.
Confession?
Wh- Stay where you are.
I've got a bullet here for each of you!
- [Gunshot]
- [Groans]
And as for Loveland, well... he was done away with by friends of mine in the government.
And that's all.
That's a true confession.
[Chime Ringing]
And now all that's required is your signature, Mr. Furnoy.
- Sign it?
- Furnoy!
You murdered my father! Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to blow your-
Rod!
- Oh. Your father's?
- Yes.
His Majesty said he was proud and happy... that an honorable name had been restored.
I'm proud too.
Afternoon, Parker.
Good afternoon, sir.
General Faversham is waiting for you on the terrace.
Aye.
Dr. Sutton, sir.
You've had a long journey, Doctor.
Oh, it's worth a journey to join old comrades.
- Are they all coming?
- Same crowd.
- A year older.
- Ah.
- Sit down. Help yourself.
- Thank you.
Well, what's the news from London?
Well, haven't you heard?
Gordon's dead.
Murdered in Khartoum.
That's no news to me.
I said that was going to happen years ago when they first sent Gordon to Egypt.
He wasn't hard enough.
They wanted someone like you out there.
Just what I was going to say myself.
First time for a hundred years there hasn't been a Faversham in the army... and look at the mess they make.
I'm too old, the boy's too young.
Me own fault for not marrying sooner.
You remember the boy.
He's 15 years old today.
I'm going to let him dine with us tonight.
- Oh, good.
- I don't mind telling you, I'm worried about him.
- Oh?
- I can't understand the boy.
I send him to the best army school in England... spend half me time telling him about his famous ancestors... and what do you think?
I found him this morning reading a poetry book!
Shelley, of all people!
So I want you to help me lick this boy into shape and make him hard.
Gentlemen, to Crimea!
- Ah.
- Old comrades.
Old comrades!
- Arnold!
- Raglan!
Yes.
Crimea, by Jove.
Ah, war was war in those days and men were men.
No room for weaklings.
Balaclava, for instance.
Here. You fellows remember the positions.
Now here, these nuts... were the Russians.
Guns, guns, guns.
On the right, the British infantry.
The thin red line.
There was the commander in chief.
And here was I... at the head of the old 68th.
The right was impossible.
The left was blocked.
Behind us was the commander in chief.
I realized the position in a flash.
I said, "The 68th will move forward. "
Immediately one of my subalterns came to me shaking.
Absolutely shaking!
I said, "What's wrong, Travers?"
Said, "I'm afraid to face those guns, sir. "
I said, "Would you rather face me?"
Hmph! He took one look at my face and off he went.
Ten minutes later he was shot to pieces at the head of his men.
As a soldier should be, eh?
I quite agree with you, General.
I can tolerate nerves before a battle, but I can't stand cowardice.
I remember a soldier at Inkerman when a Cossack charged down on him.
I saw a man raise his musket, fumble with his trigger, then turn and run.
The Cossack's lance went in at the back of his neck... and came out in his throat.
Best thing that could have happened to him.
Do you remember Wilmington?
- Wilmington?
- Fine old service family.
Father killed at Inkerman... grandfather blown up under Nelson and an uncle scalped by Indians.
Oh, splendid record. Splendid.
What happened?
Well, the general ordered him to gallop through the lines with a message.
Paralyzed with funk.
Couldn't move.
General sent his adjutant.
Killed before he'd gone 50 yards.
Sent his A.D.C.- head blown off.
Then he went through with the message himself- lost his arm.
- Ruined his cricket.
- Oh, yes, I remember now.
He disgraced his family.
His father disowned him.
Hung about for a year or two, then blew his brains out.
Ah, he had the courage to blow his brains out.
Courage?
Last spark of decency, that's all.
There's no place in England for a coward.
Harry.
Past 11:00.
Time you were in your bed.
No, no, no.
Sit you down, my boy. Sit you down.
It's the boy's birthday, and we've not drunk his health!
- Go ahead, General.
- A toast to Harry!
And may he prove the bravest of the Favershams.
- To Harry!
- Harry!
- Thank you.
- That's our boy.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Harry.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Fine boy.
- Yes.
Harry.
You don't remember me.
I remember you though, when you were about so long.
I was a doctor in your father's regiment in the Crimea.
I knew your mother too, Harry.
She was my friend.
I'd like you to think of me as your friend too.
If ever you should need me, here's my card.
I'm not much use to anybody nowadays, but if ever you feel the need, write to me.
Come and see me.
That's very kind of you, sir.
Thank you.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Harry.
Sections... left!
Wheel!
Stand at ease!
Ten years ago...
General Gordon was murdered in Khartoum... and the British army was withdrawn into Egypt... without punishing the crime.
Today the Royal North Surrey Regiment... is under orders to join
Sir Herbert Kitchener's Anglo-Egyptian army... for the reconquest of the Sudan!
Hip-hip-hooray!
- Ooh, hello.
- Well, what's Egypt like, John?
Principally, sand, sweat and sunstroke.
- Ooh, lovely! When do we start?
- Can't say.
- Not before next Thursday.
- Heavens no.
Took them 10 years to make up their minds.
- We'll be lucky if we start in a month.
- Splendid. Then I can give you these.
Mr. Harry Faversham,
Captain John Durrance... and one for Fat Face Willoughby.
- Ooh, what's all this?
- An invitation to the Burroughs family bean feast.
Complete with regimental string band, strawberry ices... and a performing troupe of hired waiters.
Yes, my sister's coming of age.
Ethne is 21 next Thursday, so Father is letting himself go.
- Champagne?
- Gallons!
- Oysters?
- Oysters in June? Don't be a fool.
I had 'em at my coming out.
I had the sense to be born in March.
Father's going to be terrific.
He's given four speeches already, and he's been rehearsing them in the bathroom.
"My lords, ladies and gentlemen and officers of my old regiment... this is an occasion for double rejoicing.
I am proud to announce not only my daughter's coming of age... but also her engagement to the son of my old comrade in arms...
Mr. Harry Faversham of the Royal North Surrey Regiment. "
What, him?
- Our own Harry Faversham.
- Oh, I say, this is very sudden.
They've been signaling for it for months.
- Good luck, Harry.
- Thanks.
Good luck, Harry.
Thanks, John.
What about this Egypt business?
You can't take her with you, you know.
When the Dervishes catch a white man, they cut his nose off... and hang him up by the toes.
Ooh, disgusting business.
All the money falling out of your pockets.
I'll see you at dinner.
Ooh.
Did I frighten the poor lad?
Shouldn't be surprised.
I don't know what's come over the lad.
Can't take a joke.
Never takes a drink.
Moons about all day.
Reads poetry all night.
If that's love, give me indigestion.
Oh. Uh, time to get changed.
- So long.
- So long.
I'm sorry, John. I was a fool to make a joke of it like that.
- I know how you feel about her.
- That's all right, Peter.
It was for her to decide.
I wish it had been you, all the same.
See you at mess.
After all, there are plenty of other girls.
Plenty?
For other men.
Um, uh, many years ago...
I fought in the Crimea... beside that very gallant soldier
General Faversham... whose death last year was, uh, such a loss to us.
Hear! Hear!
Tonight I am proud to announce the engagement of my daughter... to Harry Faversham... my dear old friend's only son.
Bravo!
- Good old Harry!
- Good luck, Harry!
Ten years ago, when Harry was a boy...
I raised my glass in his honor... with the toast, "May he prove the bravest of all the Favershams. "
Harry Faversham... coupled with the name of my daughter Ethne.
Harry!
- Good luck!
- Good luck, Harry.
The company is now dismissed.
The business of dancing will now commence.
Well, Colonel, you're off on this Egyptian affair, eh?
Of course it's only a minor campaign.
It'll do you a world of good.
The army's too soft nowadays.
- You mean not hard enough?
- Of course!
Now, the Crimea - Ah!
War was war in those days... and men were men.
Let me tell you what happened at Balaclava.
Uh, you remember the positions,
Doctor, don't you?
Only too well.
I was over there, on the extreme left.
Here were the Russian batteries, behind the nuts.
Guns, guns, guns, guns.
On the right, the British infantry.
The thin red line.
I suppose they didn't get much to eat.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, sir, you said they were so - so thin.
Bah! The line, I meant!
- Not the men.
- Oh.
Right here was the commander in chief.
And here was I... at the head of the old 68th.
- Sorry Father had to drag Egypt into it.
- Tired of Egypt already?
We have it for breakfast and lunch... and the honor of the regiment for supper.
I suppose he quite understands you're marrying me and not the regiment.
He's not quite sure about that.
Are you... quite sure?
When we are old and creaky with rheumatism... we shall look back and think of this night.
Ethne, you'll never creak.
Never in your life.
We shall creak with the best of them.
And through the creaks will come the sound of this dance music... and the light of the moon and the scent of the flowers.
This is a solemn occasion, Harry.
A memory is being born tonight... a memory that shall stand the test of all the years.
Moments like this are better than all the memories in the world.
The memories will be the best... because they'll be right out of reach of uncertainty and care.
Memories just float about on their own with no shadows upon them.
The dance music, the moon and evening primroses. That's all.
You're not going to rob me of my solitary dance, Ethne.
John, I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
Is this your dance going on?
- It's just started.
- Oh, dear. There's a partner waiting for me.
Excuse me.
It wasn't his fault, John.
It was mine. I talk too much.
- Shall we dance?
- It's a polka.
- Don't you like a polka?
- A bit jerky, isn't it?
Rather like saying "good-bye" in Morse code.
- I'm sorry, John.
- There's no need to be sorry.
- It's terribly hard to explain.
- There's nothing to explain.
You don't expect a girl to sit down and write out a catalog - points why I love Mr. "A," points why I don't love Mr. "B."
It's only Mr. "B" who sits down and puzzles out the points against him.
I never saw such an impressive list.
Reasons why Ethne Burroughs doesn't love John Durrance.
- Reason one -
- Don't, John.
Oh, I put down about 40 reasons altogether.
Reason 41 was, she loves the other man.
So I crossed the rest out.
- Thank you.
- Harry's a fine fellow.
Were you to help him, he shall have a splendid career.
- You'll enjoy helping him, won't you?
- I hope I shall be able to.
You will.
I think you'll be very happy.
And I think I shall always love you.
Oh, John, dear.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, rubbish.
I shall be all right.
You're not going to be sorry for anything tonight.
Come and dance that polka. I've just learnt it.
- Faversham.
- See what he wants, Lubbock.
He wants to see you privately, sir.
Oh, very well.
Well, Faversham?
I want you to accept this, sir.
- What is it?
- I am resigning my commission.
Resigning your commission?
- What do you mean?
- I mean just that, sir.
I don't understand you, Faversham.
I should have taken this action months ago.
I only accepted a commission for my father's sake... because all his family have been soldiers.
But when he died, my duty towards him was done.
Your duty towards him?
Have you no duty towards your country?
Oh, go lie down in a dark room, my boy.
You'll be all right in the morning.
I've made up my mind, sir.
Faversham, if you do this... you will regret it for the rest of your life.
I'm sorry, sir.
I've made up my mind.
You're deliberately shirking your duty, sir!
I refuse to accept your resignation!
I am within my rights to resign, sir.
You cannot refuse.
I never thought I should live to see a Faversham play the coward.
- May I go, sir?
- Yes.
Go.
- The officers -
- Well?
Are waiting, sir.
Whew!
Gentlemen, final orders have just arrived.
The regiment leaves on Thursday.
We march to Portsmouth and embark at midday.
I, uh - I've just received this telegram from General Kitchener.
"Glad to welcome your regiment to my command. "
- Well, that's very nice of him, isn't it?
- Gentlemen.
There will be one change in regimental orders for the 15th.
Mr. Faversham has seen fit to send in his papers... on the eve of his regiment sailing for active service.
His place will be taken by Mr. Parker, who was to have remained at the depot.
- Well done, Parker!
- Glad you're coming with us!
- Ohh!
- Look out, sir!
- Well, I must be off.
- Good-bye, John.
- Good-bye.
- Good luck to you.
- And keep an eye on young Peter for me.
- I will, sir. Both eyes.
There's a lovey dove!
What's she crying for?
There.
Well, good-bye, Aggie.
Take care of your ma.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, lovey.
Don't take on now.
I'm all right.
The kids are going to miss you.
- Good-bye, my boy.
- Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye.
- The dogs are going to miss you.
- Yes, sir!
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot #
# In the days of auld lang syne #
# For auld lang syne, my dear #
# For auld lang syne #
# We'll take a cup of kindness yet #
# For the days of auld lang syne ##
Harry!
What's happened? Peter left last night.
Father went with him to see you all off.
They've canceled it.
You're not going after all?
They've gone.
The regiment sailed this morning.
- But I haven't gone with them.
- I don't understand.
We've discussed it so often - the futility of this idiotic
Egyptian adventure... the madness of it all... the ghastly waste of time that we can never have again.
- What have you done, Harry?
- I've resigned my commission.
I should have done it sooner.
Long ago.
It's released me from the life of an impostor.
That's all a man is when he fails to be true to the things he believes in.
I believe in our happiness.
I believe in the work to be done here to save an estate that's near to ruin... to save all those people who've been neglected by my family... because they preferred glory in India, glory in China, glory in Africa.
Oh, excuse me, miss.
This package has just arrived for Mr. Faversham addressed in your care... and marked urgent, miss.
Thank you.
"Mr. Thomas Willoughby. "
"Mr. Peter Burroughs. "
"Captain John Durrance. "
Well, they had a fine send-off, Ethne.
I went aboard and had lunch with them before they sailed.
Peter has a cabin with John Durrance and Willoughby.
I'm glad the three boys are going to be together.
- Father, I -
- Yes.
It was a wonderful sight, the vessel steaming out into the channel... and all those men cheering and -
May I speak to you a moment, sir?
It was cruel to send these.
Cruel, but just.
That's what you think, isn't it?
You needn't tell me, Ethne.
I can see it quite clearly in your eyes.
We agreed always to be honest with each other, Harry... to keep no secret from each other.
When you did this... did you believe that I should be proud of you?
I thought you'd understand.
We've so often talked of these things and we've always understood each other.
I know, Harry. We've talked and we've dreamed of things we'd do if we were free.
Some people are born free. They can do what they like without concern for consequences.
But you were not born free, Harry, and nor was I.
We were born into a tradition... a code which we must obey even if we do not believe.
And we must obey it, Harry... because the pride and happiness of everyone surrounding us depends upon our obedience.
I quite understand.
There should be four feathers here.
We agreed always to be honest with each other.
Give it to me.
Come on!
Brigade!
Attention!
Shoulder arms!
Present arms!
Shoulder arms!
- You've served here before.
- Abu Klea, sir.
Then you know what to expect.
- You too?
- I've been out here ever since, sir.
- You married?
- Yes, sir.
- Children?
- Four, sir.
When I left home.
- Harry Faversham.
- Hello, Doctor.
Why, what's happened?
I thought your regiment had gone.
Oh, yes, they've gone, like the guards have gone tonight.
Years ago, Harry, I gave you my card.
Do you remember?
Yes, Doctor, I remember.
In case you ever needed any help.
Come along. We'll have a quiet supper at my club.
It's just across the park.
The Naval and Military.
No, not there, if you don't mind, Doctor.
- Let's go to my rooms.
- Very well.
You tell me you left the army... because your duty to your home... was greater than your duty towards a crowd of African peasants?
Well, there's nothing dishonorable in that, Harry.
If that's all, if that's the whole truth... then these feathers are an insult to be treated with the contempt they deserve.
If that were all, I should have put them on the fire and you would have never seen them.
But you know that it's not all.
Just as Ethne knew.
I was told a ghastly story when I was a boy, and you were there when it was told.
An officer who failed to carry a message because he was paralyzed with fear.
An officer disgraced and hounded out of society... who shot himself in a back room off the Haymarket because his life was ruined.
That story haunted me.
Many a man is haunted by some fear.
With me it was more than fear.
My father despised me.
He believed me to be a coward.
His belief turned fear into reality.
I knew that if ever fate put me in the same position,
I should behave like that man... and meet the same end.
I am a coward, Doctor.
If I'd been anything but a soldier, I might have lived my whole life and concealed it.
But to be a soldier and a coward is to be an impostor... a menace to the men whose lives are in your hands.
When orders came for Egypt...
I knew that fate was closing in round me... just as it closed round that other man.
I fought against it.
I believed in all the reasons I gave for shirking my job.
I deceived myself.
But I didn't deceive my friends.
The men who sent me these feathers knew me better than I knew myself.
The man who tries to cheat his fate is more than a coward. He's a fool as well.
You're wrong there, Harry.
I never met a fool who had the imagination to be a coward.
If I thought you were a coward, Harry...
I should take this with me... fight you for it if necessary.
It's because I know you've no intention of using it on yourself... that I leave it here.
Harry, is there anything I can do?
Yes, Doctor, there is something you can do.
Yes?
I shall be leaving England tomorrow.
I shall write to you from time to time... just to tell you that I'm alive.
If you don't hear from me for a year... you'll know that I'm dead.
If that happens,
I should like you to go to Ethne... and tell her that at least I tried to put right... the shame and humiliation that I caused her.
Can you tell me where you're going?
Egypt.
- Dr. Harraz?
- Yes?
I've come from England, from an old friend of yours - Dr. Sutton.
Dr. Sutton! I remember him.
I served with him in a hospital in India.
- How is he?
- He's well. He sends you his greeting.
What may I do for you?
I have a mission to reach the army of General Kitchener.
I want your help to disguise me as a native.
- You speak Arabic?
- No.
- You have some native tongue?
- No.
But the army of General Kitchener is 400 miles away... across country in the hands of the enemies.
How then can a doctor help you, except to certify you as mad?
I'm told there is a native tribe called the Sangali... that once revolted against the Khalifa.
And in revenge the Khalifa branded them, cut out their tongues from their heads... and made them outcasts.
- You know the brand?
- All men know the brand of the Sangali.
Then you understand the reason of my visit, Doctor.
But, my dear young man, you will miss your tongue in many ways.
I will keep my tongue.
No one will look for it if I'm branded.
I can stain your skin... but I cannot imitate a scar that would escape detection.
That I understand.
Is your mission then of such importance?
May I stay in your house until the wound is healed?
You are a brave man.
Ah, Durrance.
- Told to report, sir.
- Kitchener's been talking to me.
You know what the situation is.
The main army and provision ships must get up the Nile.
It's the only feasible route up country towards Omdurman.
But the river's blocked by the Khalifa's army... and our ships can't get through the gorge.
Now, the Khalifa must be drawn away, by some sort of bluff, into the desert.
Yes, sir.
Now, if one of our brigades appeared on his flank... he'd have to turn away and face it.
- That would leave the river unguarded.
- Yes, sir.
Now, General Kitchener can't spare a regiment, much less a brigade... but he can spare a company.
Number Five Company of the Royal North Surreys.
Thank you, sir.
Number one section, by the left!
Quick march!
Number two section, by the left!
Quick march!
Number three section, by the left!
Quick march!
Number four section, by the left!
Quick march!
Left, right, left.
Who is this man?
How much did he overhear?
Sangali.
That was a very bad performance,
Mr. Faversham.
No true Sangali would enter a room with the self-assurance of an Englishman.
- Why was that fellow in such a funk?
- He was terrified you might betray him.
- Oh, I see.
- But for myself I have no such fears.
But I must admit I should feel a little more comfortable... if you would tell me frankly why all this - the wandering, the disguise.
In England four people gave me a white feather apiece.
- They've got to take them back.
- Oh, a mad race, the English.
No, not so mad.
In England, the white feather is the mark of a coward.
Ah, I see. Then why worry?
Be a coward and be happy.
No, Doctor.
I have been a coward, and I wasn't happy.
Tell me, did he bring any news?
Yes. He says a North Surrey regiment has left Abu Hamid.
By crossing the desert you could pick them up at the Nile... perhaps near the 5th Cataract.
Part of Kitchener's army is going up the river in boats.
They will be hauled up the cataract by native labor.
There is your chance.
- All right, Sergeant?
- All correct, sir.
We've rigged up enough scarecrows to look like the entire blooming army!
That ought to draw them, all right.
The men can rest, but be ready to move without delay.
The moment we're spotted we won't have time to sit about and admire the view.
- No, sir.
- Take the men back to the camp.
- You watch from that jebel over there.
- Very good, sir.
Your watch.
No Fuzzies round here.
- I'm gonna have a word with the captain.
- Right, Sarge.
Blimey!
- Two men!
- Clark! On the double!
You get the rifles.
Come on. Give me a hand.
Didn't we ought to start him back to camp at once?
His orders were to stay here till we seen Dervishes, and we ain't seen none.
It's ice we want to clap on the back of his neck.
Yes, and a couple of saucy nurses to clap it on for him.
- Can you see anything?
- No.
I can't make it out.
He said he'd be back by dawn at the latest.
Well, perhaps he's spotted a covey of Dervishes and wants to keep an eye on them.
No. If he'd spotted any Dervishes, he'd be back in no time.
Kitchener?
Who's there?
Corporal Evans, sir.
How long have I been lying here?
Since this time yesterday, sir.
- What's the time now?
- About 3:00, sir.
Call Sergeant Brown the moment it's daylight.
But - But it's light now, sir.
- It's afternoon.
- Huh?
What?
- Call Sergeant Brown.
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant Brown!
- What is it?
- Captain wants you.
- All right.
- Sergeant Brown here, sir.
- Come in, come in.
Glad to see you're better, sir.
No sign of Dervishes yet.
Yes. Now strike the camp immediately.
I spotted Dervish yesterday.
- There's not one moment to lose.
- Very good, sir.
Corporal Clark, call in your men!
Hughes, fetch the captain's horse!
Come on! On the double then!
All right, fall in! Fall in!
Come on, men! Fall in! Come along.
Come on then.
Ready to march off, sir!
Sergeant, come here.
Don't - Don't go away. I -
I want you to - to help me to my horse.
Oh, very good, sir.
Attention!
Flower and Bardell, strike the tent.
Put it on the mule and follow us behind.
Section at ease! Quick march!
- Take me right up to my tent.
- Very good, sir.
Glad to see you back, sir.
We were getting a little worried.
Ah, need to worry.
I spotted some Dervish yesterday.
That's why I stayed up there - to keep watch.
They saw us, all right, so that's half our work done.
Sergeant, give the men some food and see they get to sleep immediately.
Very good, sir.
- Willoughby?
- Yes, sir?
- Parker?
- Yes, sir?
Put those fires out, will you.
Double the sentries round here.
There's no immediate danger, but we've got to keep on the alert from now on.
- Yes, sir.
- Right. Put your fire out.
Oi, Bill, give us a hand with this fire?
Simper, Curtis, Gamble, bring your equipment round.
Good night, boys.
- Peter?
- Yes, John?
I got a touch of the sun out there yesterday.
Hard luck, old boy.
I know what it is.
- I had sunstroke when I was a kid at school.
- Oh? H-How did it affect you?
- Well, it gave me a devil of a headache.
- Oh.
You look a bit done-in, John.
You ought to take a good rest.
Yes. Now listen, Peter.
We're not in a healthy spot here.
Things may be a good deal worse before we're through.
I'm feeling a bit groggy.
I'm going in to rest now.
- Will you look after things for me here tonight?
- Yes, of course.
- Shall I help you in?
- No, no, no. I'll be all right in the morning.
- Seen anything?
- No, sir.
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- Very good, sir.
The mules are restless, sir.
Bad sign.
Yes, I know.
I shall be glad when the sun rises.
Yes, sir.
Alarm!
Alarm!
Bugler, alarm!
Alarm! Alarm!
Alarm!
Load! Present! Fire!
Fire!
Load. Present. Fire!
Present. Fire!
Load. Fire!
- Peter, where are you?
- Here, John.
Are they all around us?
I can't see in this smoke.
Load. Present. Fire!
Present! Fire!
Load. Present. Fire!
Load.
Fire!
- Sir.
- Yes?
- Ali has news, sir.
- Good. What does he know?
What?
Well, the Khalifa's left the Nile with his whole army.
Fine. That's the news we're waiting for.
Madsen, give orders to sail at once.
Now, this is grand.
We'll soon be up to Omdurman... and Kitchener can have his battle where he wants it.
Ah, thanks to Durrance.
He's done a magnificent job.
Peter?
Is that you, Peter?
Peter.
Peter?
Peter!
Peter!
Willoughby?
Burroughs!
Peter!
For God's sake, answer me!
Oh, is that you, Peter?
I'm blasted near mad.
I - I can't see, Peter.
It's no good pretending anymore.
I can't see. I - I'm blind.
The sun got me out there in the mountains.
Why don't you speak?
What's the matter?
Who are you?
What, are you all dumb?
Have you never seen a blind man before?
Who the devil are you? Speak!
If you can't speak English, speak Arabic, but speak! Speak!
Or it's true then.
They're all dead.
All my company wiped out.
Nothing but a blind man and a dumb lunatic.
There's nothing left but death from thirst.
Come here.
Come here.
Lean your head against the one cool thing... left in this blasted furnace.
You won't? All right.
Well, go to the devil alone.
Give it! Give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'll kill you! Let go.
Alarm! Alarm!
Company, stand to!
Company, fall in!
Load! Present! Fire!
Fire! Load! Present!
Fire! Fire!
Load! Present!
Give me my helmet, Sergeant, will you?
Ethne.
Don't you like the polka?
A bit jerky, isn't it?
Ethne, I shall love you always.
Hello, Doctor.
I'm glad to find you alone, Ethne.
- I really came here to talk to you.
- Well, Doctor?
I want to know if you've heard from Harry Faversham.
I've heard nothing.
It was his own wish and my wish that the break should be complete.
I've no idea where he is or what he's doing.
I promised to give you a message when I saw him on the night before he left England... a year ago.
A year ago?
Then -
I don't understand, Doctor.
He left England for one purpose only.
If he succeeded, he said that you would learn by means... that would need no explanation.
If he failed, then he asked me to let you know... that at least he'd done his best.
I see.
He promised to write to me now and then just to show that he was still alive.
If I heard nothing for a year... then his silence would show that he was dead.
My dear.
So that's the end.
You think I behaved brutally to him,
Doctor.
No.
I did behave brutally.
I behaved like the worst kind of coward.
I failed to help him when he was so terribly in need of help.
Nothing that you could have done would have made him alter his decision.
I could have helped him.
If you'd gone on your knees, you could have done nothing.
His mind was made up.
You must always remember that, Ethne... for the sake of his memory and for your own happiness.
Oh. Ethne!
What are you two mooching about outside for?
Just having a dose of your country air, General.
It'll be a dose of bronchitis if you don't take care.
Come on in, Ethne.
Give us some sherry.
Look, there's an Arab!
He's got an officer.
- Blimey! He's trying to rob him.
- Come on. Let's get him.
Abdul, ask him what he has to say.
It is useless, Your Excellency.
He's one of the Sangali tribe.
He cannot speak.
Put him with those two horse thieves we got yesterday... and send him to Abu Hamid to mend the roads.
- March him out, Sergeant.
- Sir.
The doctor, sir.
- Well, Doctor, how's Durrance?
- He'll pull through.
Splendid. He's a fine officer.
The regiment can't spare a man like that.
He's blind.
Blind?
Sunstroke- exposure of the eyes to the sun.
I've seen it before, Colonel.
A man alone bowled over suddenly lies there exposed.
But with rest and care, he'll get better?
With immediate attention, there might have been a chance in a hundred.
Now there's none.
The nerves are completely destroyed.
Up!
- Good work, boy. Good work. Good work.
- Bravo!
Ha-ha! You'll have me riding to hounds in a couple of weeks.
- Up another six inches, Joe.
- No more today.
Just one more.
Just a tiny little bit more.
Tomorrow, John.
It's time to dress for dinner.
Dress? I can dress in 10 minutes now.
Knocked two minutes off my record this morning.
There's your shaving lesson before dinner too, sir.
Aha! Yes, my shaving lesson.
Also my lesson in making bow ties.
Lots of fun in going back to school again, Ethne.
Joe's a great teacher.
Ought to be a professor.
Easy with a good pupil, sir.
And no more of those infernal chopped-up meals.
I'm feeling like a lesson in carving roast chicken tonight.
I'll see you at dinner.
Come on, Joe.
Thank you.
Brave man.
I hope I can make him very happy.
All right, Joe.
You do it for me, will you?
Look here, Ethne. I -
I've been wanting to say something to you for a long time.
Beastly difficult to know how to put it.
Of course, it's no business of mine... but are you sure you're right in what you're doing?
Quite sure.
You know, a man becomes a soldier with all the knowledge of the risks ahead of him.
If misfortune comes, it's all part of the game.
He doesn't ask for any pity or sympathy.
But you've got your whole life before you.
I know it's a noble, unselfish impulse... but for 30 or 40 years - maybe 50 years -
Father, please don't talk about being noble.
There's nothing like that about it.
It's just -
Well, it's just that
I've made up my mind.
Yes. The Arab is a strange, unexpected creature.
Yes, yes. Wait a minute.
You haven't heard the end yet.
Here's a solitary Arab. Heaven knows where he comes from or how he's alive.
He packs my map, slings my water bottle round my neck... and never says a word from beginning to end.
- That must have been uncanny.
- Uncanny?
It nearly drove me mad.
Yet I knew all the time he was trying to save me.
How many days we traveled
I shall never know.
I was crazy with fever.
Must have been the best part of a week.
He gets me in a boat, floats me down the Nile... till he comes within sight of the camp, and then -
Now, here's the extraordinary part.
Having done enough to win the Victoria Cross... he lays me down outside the camp and calmly begins to rob me.
Nothing strange in that.
Just Eastern business mentality.
He'd done a job of work and was taking payment.
Poor devil got less than he bargained for.
I carried no papers on active service and no money.
Huh. He got nothing then.
He nearly got one thing - the only thing I was carrying.
- Remember this?
- It's my letter.
Your letter.
There's a funny thing in this letter.
Ethne, read - read the postscript you wrote.
It's still got some sand in it.
- You can keep the sand as a souvenir.
- Thank you -
- Go on. Read the postscript.
- Let me read it.
"PS: Take care not to get sunstroke. "
You always said I knew too much to take advice.
Ethne, darling, I'm sorry.
You're trembling.
You mustn't take it like that.
It's all over now.
It might have been a lot worse.
I'd have been dead six months ago if it hadn't been for my little Arab friend.
And what happened to your little Arab friend?
I wish I knew.
They sent the poor devil to a convict gang.
When I came to my senses, it was too late to find him.
He'd escaped.
I was never able to trace him.
Now for a turn in the garden.
Stay here.
I'll get my coat and fetch yours, Ethne.
Oh. My letter.
Thank you.
So Harry's alive... or was when he paid that debt.
Oi, Peter.
Good of them to entertain us for nothing.
If I had my hands free, I'd applaud.
If I had my hands free for 10 seconds...
I'd strangle that filthy little blighter with the monkey.
Get out, you -
Willoughby. Do I still look sane?
No. Do I?
"Don't despair. "
Peter.
Perhaps our message got through.
Perhaps Durrance did get away and sent this fellow... to give us some hope of escape from this hell.
Escape? I wonder.
I wonder what his plan is.
Karaga.
Karaga Pasha.
Tell me, which do you think would give the better chance of escape - the desert or the river?
How should I know?
Nobody has ever escaped from here.
But surely some attempts must have been made to free you.
Yes, years and years ago... but they all failed.
How long have you been here?
- Since Gordon was killed.
- Thirteen years.
Swim.
- Swim?
- Yes?
See island.
Tomorrow. Boat waiting.
So, the mad musician of Omdurman was a British spy.
What message did you give to your British friends?
The Khalifa will reward and spare you if you will do his bidding.
What do you know of Kitchener's army?
If you won't answer, we'll flog you until you do.
Answer!
- There you are.
- Thank heavens for that.
Well, that's the end of that.
No pork for dinner.
Poor devil. They've flogged him.
I wonder who he is.
Looks like an Arab.
Probably paid by our people to help us.
I wonder if he's got any papers on him.
Spies don't usually carry papers about.
Well, I made a nice mess of that, didn't I?
- Faversham!
- Harry, how the devil did you get here?
- Who sent you?
- Nobody.
Then what you - what you doing here?
- For heaven's sake, explain, Harry.
- There's no time to explain now.
We're in an infernal mess, but there's still a chance. Now listen to me.
The Khalifa has gone out to meet Kitchener.
If he gets beaten, he'll slit our throats in revenge.
If he wins, he'll slit 'em out of pure joy.
Right opposite the prison gates is the arsenal of the Khalifa.
That's our one chance. Just a couple of guards and a few storekeepers, and that's about all.
- Have you got that file?
- Yes. That file was an absolute brain wave.
We must work like blazes.
Now, is there anybody here who understands the language of these poor devils?
Yes. That old fellow over there.
I'll go and fetch him.
Are you all right, Harry?
I'm all right, Fat Face.
Harry. This is Karaga Pasha... once governor of the province of Kordofan.
You speak English and the language of these people?
I speak Arabic and Greek.
They all understand one or the other.
Then you can do a great service to yourself and to all these people.
Will you tell them that I have brought the means of setting them free?
Tell them that once they are freed, on no account... must they make a sign or a movement until they get the word from me.
We must work very fast.
Tom, break that file in two.
Bring me the strongest man first.
Fix!
Fix!
- Bayonets!
- Bayonets.
They're deploying to attack, sir.
It's their whole army.
Perkins, go to the right.
Cramley, go to the left.
Tell the brigade to take up their position.
Tell them to withhold their fire until the last possible moment.
Front wing! Kneel!
Hold!
Grand sight, ain't it?
- Getting 'orrible close. When do we fire?
- When we're told.
Stick it, lad.
If you can't look at 'em coming on, shut your eyes.
I'll nudge ya when to open 'em.
Present!
Fire!
Get your chains on.
Karaga, tell them it's now or never.
Tell them they mustn't move an inch until the guards reach us.
They're rallying again, sir.
- There aren't so many of them now.
- Nor of us, sir.
Lengthen range 350. We'll have that tower down with the black flag on it.
- That's the arsenal, sir.
- Good! Then we'll blow it up.
Lengthen range 350!
- That's not a Dervish gun. That's our gun.
- They'll blow us to pieces!
Wait here.
They're firing at the black flag.
We must get it down, put something else up instead.
Anything! This'll do.
Harry. Look here!
It's the one they took from us.
- All right. I'll take it.
- All right.
They're lowering the flag, surrendering.
Hauling up a white one.
- It isn't white, sir. It's ours.
- What?
Paper! Paper!
Khartoum recaptured by Kitchener!
Paper! Paper!
Khartoum recaptured! Paper!
Paper! Paper! Paper!
Come in.
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Doctor.
How are you?
Have a drink.
On the table there.
- Do you mind if I light the gas?
- Sorry, old man.
Meant to have done it before you came.
No, no. Give me the matches. I'll light it.
- Have you heard the news?
- I've been listening.
Is it true? We've got Khartoum?
It's just come through. Kitchener broke the Dervishes's army at Omdurman.
Good. Good. Splendid.
Well, that's that.
Sit down, Doctor.
- Whiskey?
- Not just now, John.
You've seen Dr. Wesley?
I've just left him.
Heine, the German specialist, was there too.
Nice fellow, that German.
Took a lot of trouble.
You needn't tell me the verdict, Doctor.
I quite understand.
I think it's what you expected, John.
He doesn't feel that an operation -
Neither did I.
A man gets to understand these things.
If there had been any sort of spark left inside that could be fanned up again...
I'm certain
I should have felt it there.
I've known for some time that they were... stone dead.
Heine explained that the trouble sometimes comes... from a lesion that can be repaired by operation.
- In your case -
- In my case, it's a complete blackout.
No harm in getting the best man anyway.
- You earned your whiskey now, Doctor.
- Thanks.
Might have been a lot worse.
If I had known from the start it was hopeless...
I'd probably have blown my brains out.
Today it isn't half so bad.
I've been learning to read this Braille stuff.
- Yeah?
- Funny how quickly the fingers get sensitive.
Listen.
"Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs... that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears... and sometimes voices... but if I then had waked after a long sleep... will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming... the clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me... that, when I waked...
I cried to sleep again. "
- Splendid.
- Marvelous, isn't it?
I knew that bit by heart anyway.
- Here - Here's to your health, Doctor.
- Well, here's to you, John.
To Kitchener and his bright lads in Khartoum.
Now, stretch out your legs and read the news.
There's a report by Mallinson, the war correspondent.
- "Khartoum, second September. "
- Good. Good. Now, do read it.
"From the shadow of Gordon's palace,
I am proud to send news... of a glorious victory.
At dawn this morning, after a wild night of storm and rain... scouts reported that the Dervish army was massing to give battle... upon the hills above Kerreri. "
That's where the legend said the British would be destroyed.
Now, if the Dervish had ignored that silly rot and fought -
- Oh, shut up and listen.
- Sorry.
"At 6:00 the Dervish army advanced en masse... and flung themselves with fanatical bravery upon the British square.
Within two hours the Dervish forces were broken and in flight.
A full report upon the fighting at Kerreri will be sent... when details are available... but your correspondent, who accompanied the Royal North Surrey Regiment" -
Good old Surreys.
"... was privileged to witness the most dramatic and astonishing scene in this inspiring day. "
Hmm.
"During the battle, the prisoners in the Omdurman dungeons... overwhelmed their guards, captured the arsenal and held it...
- until relieved by Anglo-Egyptian troops. "
- Bravo!
"The achievement was led and inspired... by two British officers of the Royal North Surrey Regiment... captured in the fight at Gakdul Wells,
Lieutenants Burroughs and Willoughby. "
Peter! Alive!
And good old Willoughby!
Isn't that splendid!
- What's the time?
- The time? It's just on 7:00.
- We'll go tonight.
- What?
We'll be the first to tell Ethne and the old man.
Ha! He'll be crazy with excitement about this!
- Joe! Joe!
- Yes, sir?
Pack my bag. Send a message round to
Dr. Sutton's house to send his bag round here.
We're going to General Burroughs's.
The 8:15 from Paddington.
Oh, but I've got an important appointment in the morning, John.
- And, Joe!
- Yes, sir?
Tell Dr. Sutton's man to cancel all his appointments for tomorrow.
Oh, but Ethne and the general will know before we get there.
They won't. They never get the evening papers in that place until the morning.
We'll just walk in and break the news.
And the War Office is certain to send a telegram.
You've always got some confoundedly cold-blooded reason for doing nothing.
Anyway, we'll be the first to congratulate them.
Don't you realize what this means?
Peter alive, and done a grand job of work into the bargain.
- Is there any more? Read that last bit again.
- Huh?
- "Lieutenants Burroughs and Willoughby'-
- Hmm.
"... whose release from prison was due to an act of heroism... described to me personally by Lieutenant Burroughs.
A man posing as a dumb Sangali native gained entrance to the prison... with means of cutting the chains of the captives.
He suffered torture and faced death to do so... because in reality, he was until recently... an officer of their own regiment. "
Lieutenant Faversham.
But why should he try to rob me?
- Doctor.
- Yes, John?
There's some notepaper on my desk there.
I want you to write a letter for me.
I'm ready, John.
To Ethne Burroughs.
Dear Ethne...
I've just had some splendid news.
I've been to a famous German eye doctor... and my sight can be restored.
Got that?
I've got that, John.
It means a long course of treatment in Germany... and I leave tomorrow.
When I can see again,
I shall return to the army... with the happy memory... of all you have done... to help me through.
I'll sign it myself.
And add a postscript.
PS:
Just heard the splendid news of Peter and Willoughby... and Harry Faversham.
I enclose a little souvenir of a journey through the desert... with a dumb Sangali native.
If you'll give him the chance that he deserves... you'll find he's not... as mute... as I thought he was.
That's all.
Your bags are packed, sir.
There's just time for a bite of dinner if you hurry.
All right, Joe.
We're not going after all.
I -
I still say the army of today is soft compared with our day.
Soft! That's your trouble.
Still, you did your best... and as Harry has made you two young rascals take your feathers back... well, he'd better marry the girl and have done with it, eh, Doc, hmm?
It's not as easy as all that.
There's my feather too.
What deed of reckless daring are you going to do... to make me take back my feather?
Must I?
Deeds of reckless twaddle.
Stuff and nonsense.
No such thing nowadays.
All you boys had to do was deal with Fuzzy-Wuzzy.
But the Crimea was different.
War was war in those days.
No room for weaklings.
- Take Balaclava, for instance.
- Ah.
Of course, you fellows wouldn't remember the position, but it was this -
Ah, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Here were the Russians.
Guns. Guns. Guns.
On the right, the British infantry.
One moment, sir.
Your famous account of Balaclava's not accurate, you know.
- Not -
- Not accurate, sir.
Not accurate?
No, sir.
Let me recall the position.
Out of the way, Peter.
Here are the Russians, behind the walnuts.
Guns. Guns. Guns.
Here's the British Infantry.
The thin red line.
Here's the commander in chief.
And here are you... at the head of the old 68th, correct?
Absolutely.
You were riding a horse called Caesar, which my father sold you... because, fine horseman though he was, he could never hold him himself.
Quite right. Quite right.
Then, according to your story, you said...
"The 68th will move forward. "
Quite right. Quite right.
Yes, sir.
The trouble is, you never said it.
- Ne -
- You never said it, sir.
- Never said it?
- No, sir. You never had time.
At that moment, my father told me, Caesar - uh, Caesar - Caesar... startled by a stray bullet, took the bit between his teeth... and dashed straight at the Russian lines.
Away went Caesar, away went you, away went the 68th... away went the commander in chief, away went everybody... and another magnificent mistake was added to an already magnificent record.
But nobody ever said,
"The 68th will move forward. "
Unless it was the horse.
Come on, sir. Own up.
Well, well, well, well, after all these years, it's rather difficult to remember all the details... but... confound the boy!
I shall never be able to tell that story again!
Ethne, your feather.

It looked swell, Sheila.
Thanks. It was a perfect day for it.
Yeah, but holy smokes, what a way to dot an "I."
Well, it got dotted, didn't it?
I'll say it did.
Take Bonzo in and give her a drink.
I'll be using her tomorrow.
All right.
Hi, boys.
Hi.
Hi, Sheila.
Did you make it?
And how.
Hello, Top.
Hello, Sheila.
Cup of coffee and chocolate parfait.
What was it this time, Sheila, a parachute jump into
Sheepshead Bay for dear old
Dooley's Little Liver Pills?
Nope, just a simple little spelling lesson for the morons.
Not skywriting?
Miraculous.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, I'd love to be a flyer, wouldn't you?
Way up there in the air.
It must give one a sense of freedom, like, like...
Like a bird?
Yeah, a bird.
That's it. Just like a bird.
All right, you monkeys, kid if you like, but $50 is $50.
Did they pay you $50 for doing that?
Sure. Me they did.
Go out and get yourself a reputation.
What do you mean, reputation?
I only got 7,000 hours in the air.
And 10,000 hours in the seat of your pants on that chair.
I guess that grounds you, my friend.
What'd you use, Sheila, that crate of yours?
Sure, why not?
Better watch it.
I'll have to ground you.
What do you mean, Top?
Bonzo's still good for 200 hours.
It's not me, it's the government.
I only work for them.
Quit worrying, Top.
The kid's got luck.
Sure, just like me.
I remember one time I was flying an old girl who had a son in Omaha with a toothache.
Hi, boys. Hi, Sheila. Hi, Top.
How'd you make out?
Well, I'm here.
Good. Here's your money, minus my fin.
Now about tomorrow,
I got something swell.
How swell?
Well, 25 bucks.
But you don't have to do practically nothing.
And just what is nothing?
You don't think I'd ask you to do anything dangerous, do you? I'm your manager.
I got everything to lose.
Go on.
Now, look, there's a little joint out in New Jersey, see?
And they got a bridge.
And they want somebody to fly under it?
Yes.
What'd they build a bridge for, anyway?
Civic pride.
Now look, you can do it with your eyes closed.
It's about 20 feet high and 40 feet wide and a nice little river underneath.
That's in case
I miss.
You can't miss.
After that, all you gotta do is a parachute jump.
Oh, that's all?
Sure.
Is that before the bridge or after the bridge or under the bridge?
Now, Sheila, it's a cinch.
Okay. What time does this cinch take place?
4:00. The sun's right at your back.
You think of everything, don't you?
Why don't you hire this guy to shoot you, Sheila?
Save a lot of trouble.
Now quiet, Top, quiet!
Hey, Top, ain't that
Ken Gordon coming in?
Ken Gordon?
Where?
Over the south runway.
Don't you see him?
That's Ken, all right, flying that blind goose of his.
We've just passed over the field.
Right.
I'm going to turn and go down.
Now, take it easy, Chief!
What's he doing here?
Flying blind in a hop from his own field.
Flying blind, now?
Yes, I've been expecting him.
I think I'll take a peek at that jalopy.
Me, too.
Here we go.
I'm leveling off.
Well, I hope Top saw that landing. It'll save an awful lot of conversation.
Right.
What a flyer.
Did you ever meet him, Sheila?
Once, but he wouldn't remember me.
Hey, what's he got that we haven't?
He's a flyer, son.
Well, we fly, too, you know.
I know, but when you go out and pick a couple of people off ice floes and fly serum through a blizzard to a lot of sick Eskimos, then I'll buy your violets.
See that landing?
Anything wrong with it?
Nope.
Was it blind?
Yes, and the take-off, too.
Take a look.
I'd like to.
Some board you've got up here.
Certainly is blind, all right.
We gave her the works didn't we, Mac?
I'll say. And we brought her down in our own field last week with the fog zero-zero.
Even the birds were walking.
Looks like you're in.
I am in. When do I go?
Paris is a long way off,
Ken, blind.
It's a long way off any way you take it, but I'm going.
It's your funeral, not mine.
Come on, Top.
Get on the phone to Washington and tell those red-tape artists what you saw today.
I can't miss, I'm telling you.
When do you want to take off?
Why, right away.
Tomorrow, if the weather's right.
I'll see what I can do.
All right, but keep it under your hat.
I don't want any ballyhoo until after it's through.
Okay.
Like to take a ride?
Me? In that? I'm working for the government, not dying for it.
Hi, Ken.
Hi, Nick.
Nice little plane you got here.
Like it?
They tell me you fly her blind.
That's how I landed.
What are you going to do with her?
Just kick it around.
Get you lots of publicity with this.
You know, those ballyhoo flyers you work for are getting you down.
You got the wrong slant.
Now, let me handle you and I'll put you on every front page in the country and boy, how that front page pays off.
Yeah. Some day a front page is going to walk right up and bite you, and you'll be sorry.
All right, all right, just talking for your own good. You'll learn.
Well, I got to be going.
Be seeing you.
Keep after that, Top.
Right.
All clear?
Clear.
Contact.
How'd you like to fly to Paris with that guy?
How'd I like to what?
If you're a good girl,
I might be able to fix it.
Hold it.
How's it coming?
Eighty-five here, Chief.
How many all around?
Six hundred gallons.
How much oil?
Full up.
You'd better be right.
Right.
Need any help there?
No. A new bolt and she'll be singing.
How's your weather report?
Made to order, Mac.
All we're waiting for now is the permit.
Sure you're ready?
You can leave in two minutes.
Radio checked?
Right.
Instruments?
Right.
Plenty of coffee?
Right.
Eight hours two points off East.
Mac, if that tail wind holds off the banks, I'll make Paris under 20 hours.
Right.
Where the devil's that permit?
Give me a dime, Mac.
Give me a dime!
Right.
You Scotchman.
Operator, get me Top Harmon at Roosevelt Field
Government Office.
Boy, when I burn up half that load of gas, she'll cruise over 200.
She's a bonnie ship, my lad.
You should have seen my first one.
Four cigar boxes and a quart of glue.
Did she fly?
From the top of the shed to the ground in one straight hop.
Hello, Top?
Oh. Well, where is he?
Yes. Well, have him call
Ken Gordon the moment he comes in, will you? Yes.
Never mind, he's here.
Yes. Yes, thanks.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you!
I've never waited for anything so long in my whole life.
What's the matter?
You're not going, Ken.
What?
I didn't get the permit.
They wouldn't send it.
They wouldn't send it?
Why not? I'm ready to go now.
I told them that,
Ken, but then...
But what?
What's wrong?
I'm afraid they're not going to send it.
You mean not at all?
They sounded like they meant it.
Look,
I don't mean to appear to be stupid, but I just don't follow you.
You seen this?
The department figured that we couldn't publicly sanction a man going out to commit suicide.
I see.
Sorry, Ken.
I don't have to ask you if you did this?
What do you think?
Well, there goes the bubble, Mac.
Four years we've been working, isn't it?
And a few months.
Sort of hits you financially, too, doesn't it?
It's all rotten.
Just because somebody wants to spill a lot of type,
I'm grounded by an eight-column banner.
Hey, Mr. Gordon, carload of guys with a dame moved in on us outside.
Who are they?
I don't know.
Some of them's got cameras.
Oh, they have?
We tried to keep them out but they piled in anyway.
Fix that tie, babe. Here.
There we are. Now, keep that nose up. Sheila, keep that nose up.
That's it, that's it.
Tilt your hat a little bit.
That's the idea.
Show them you can look as well as fly.
All right, boys.
Smile,
Miss Mason.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look at the plane, honey, like you loved it.
Like you belong to it.
Fine. Great. That's the girl.
Just a minute.
What's the idea?
Get those things out of here.
What's the matter?
You heard me. Get out.
Ken, you're kicking everything in the pants after I had it all fixed up.
You've caused enough harm for one day.
Now, take your little whatever-she-is and get out.
Ken, don't act that way.
Just a minute, Mr. Gordon!
We may have done something wrong, I don't know.
Maybe Nick can explain.
But whatever it is...
I don't think I know you.
It's Sheila Mason, Ken.
Sure you know her.
Oh, yes, I believe I do now, by reputation. Where do you fit into this?
You mean you didn't expect me?
Nick.
Now, wait a minute, Sheila.
Give me a chance.
You see, Ken, it's this way.
I heard you were making this flight to Paris blind, and thought it was a great chance to cash in.
Sheila's good copy, and a swell flyer, and doing it together would make it the biggest stunt since Lindbergh.
There's a million in it.
I see.
I thought Nick had already arranged it.
Sure, Ken. It'd be terrific.
So you thought I'd take something like this and turn it into one of your cheap ballyhoo stunts?
Take her along, huh?
When I can't even take a man like Mac, who's worked every step of the way with me.
Well, it might interest you both to know that
I've been refused permission.
Oh, no.
What do you mean?
The government happens to have the same dislike for cheapness that I have.
You mean to say you're not going?
You heard me.
Well, what are we doing around here?
Come on, let's go.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah, me, too, Ken, but how was I to know?
You've said quite enough.
Now please get out of here.
Nice tie you got there, Chief.
Might as well cover her up, Mac.
Right.
Like a cup of coffee?
No. Cover her up and go home.
They've got a new shooting gallery down at Coney Island.
Good night, Mac.
What is it, Mac? What is it?
I thought you left with the others.
What do you want?
I stayed behind to tell you again how sorry I am.
Rather late for that, isn't it?
I know explanations don't mean very much, but I do hope you can forgive me.
It's all right.
Forget it.
Thanks.
Hadn't you better run along now? Your friends might leave you here.
They've gone already, but I can take a streetcar.
Well?
Ken Gordon, you weren't after publicity on this trip, were you?
I think you know that by this time.
Nor glory, particularly.
No.
All you wanted to do was to prove that it could be made safe to fly an airship anywhere regardless of fog or weather.
That's about it.
Then why don't you?
Why don't I? Perhaps you haven't heard,
I was denied permission.
A piece of paper, wasn't it?
A pretty important piece of paper.
Of course. Only it occurred to me that the man who laid the air track to Rio when the whole world said it couldn't be done, and did a lot of other things that nobody else would tackle, well, that man would hardly be the one to wait for a piece of paper in order to do something a great deal more important.
Mac, Mac, Mac, are you still here?
Coming, boss.
How soon can I take off?
You're going anyway?
Right away. Don't want to lose this weather.
Get your maps, man.
You're on your way.
What are you going to wear?
Heavy flying suit, moccasins, gloves.
Where are they?
In that locker.
I'll get those.
You get your maps.
Say, you're a pretty good sport to do this after the way
I treated you today.
Forget it. If I can't go with you, at least I can see you off.
These moccasins are torn.
That doesn't matter.
You know, you're nothing like what I thought you were.
What did you think I was?
Well, I've always heard of you barnstorming, flying under bridges, doing stunts for the movies.
In other words, working the aviation racket for all it's worth.
Well, yes.
Where do you keep your coffee?
Mac has it ready on the stove.
I didn't mean to be as rotten to you as I was today.
This coffee's cold.
I'm not often as wrong about people as I was about you.
You just didn't understand, that's all.
You see, I want to fly, but I haven't the money.
Do you realize how little women can do in the air?
We can't fly for the Army, we can't fly the mails.
Even the good transport jobs are closed to us.
How do you light this thing?
I'll show you.
I wasn't fair. I hope you'll let me see you when I get back to sort of make up for it.
Watch that match.
You'll burn your fingers.
Isn't it always the way when you're in a hurry?
Mac! Mac!
Oh, my dear!
What's happened?
Get some olive oil, butter, any kind of grease!
Hurry!
Let me see. Let me see.
Let me see.
I can't see. I can't see.
Mac, hurry! Hurry!
Just as we thought after the first examination.
There are no surface burns.
The explosion did its damage within the eye.
Then I'm blind.
The chief injury's due to a major disturbance of the eye fluid, Mr. Gordon.
Tell me the truth.
Will I ever see again?
That's hard to say.
But as long as the optic nerve is uninjured, there's always hope, but we can tell nothing yet.
How long before you can tell?
A long time, I'm afraid.
You mean weeks? Months? Years?
Months, at least.
Now, let me get this straight.
I'm blind now and it'll be months before you can tell me if I'll ever see again, is that it?
Sorry, but I'm afraid that's about it.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Gordon.
Goodbye and thanks.
You've been very kind.
Here, Ken.
Thanks, Mac.
All right, Mr. Kelter.
Thanks for not trying to tell me that everything will work out swell.
Right.
I'm going away, Mac.
Away?
Yes, I have to.
I don't want charity and I won't stand being pitied.
I'm not down yet.
Of course you're not.
You'll have to get another job, Mac.
But I wish you'd keep an eye on the ship.
Right.
I don't want you to tell anybody where I am, nobody.
I've got to have time to think this thing out alone.
Right.
No, Mac. He'd rather do it himself.
You all right, Mr. Gordon?
Certainly I'm all right.
What are you doing out here?
I told you I didn't want you following me around, Waring.
I only came out to get some wood, Mr. Gordon.
All right, get the wood.
Yes, sir, Mr. Gordon.
Here, Mac, you take him in.
I'll wait out here.
Right.
What is it, Waring?
Well, what do you want?
It's me, Chief.
Mac?
Yes, Ken.
What are you doing here?
The ship's all right, isn't it?
Sure, the ship's fine.
Well, then?
I knew you wanted to be alone but, well,
I brought you something.
Thanks, Mac,
I don't need a thing.
I'm getting along fine.
Of course you are, Ken, but this is a dog.
That's very thoughtful of you,
Mac, but don't need a dog.
But this is not an ordinary dog, Ken. He'll help.
He's a German shepherd.
He'll lead you around.
He's from the
Seeing Eye school.
I see.
A dog to lead the blind.
Just the thing, isn't it?
Now, Ken.
All I need is a tin cup and some pencils.
Congratulations, Mac, that's a swell idea.
Ken, it's nothing like that.
You don't understand. Here.
Meet him, get to know him like I did.
Here, this is his harness.
All you have to do is to snap it on him.
Get him out of here.
Now, Ken.
Get him out!
Come on, Lightning.
Come on.
What's the idea?
Let Lightning try.
Waring!
Waring!
No. Don't go.
Waring!
So he left you here anyway.
Keep quiet.
Go away.
Get away!
Waring! Waring!
Come and take this dog out of here!
Waring!
Get away!
You're a determined cuss, aren't you?
Now what are you trying to do, talk to me?
Well, you're an awful lot of dog, big fellow.
I'll bet you could put up a whale of a fight.
What do you want to do, go for a walk?
What's this?
Oh, your harness.
All right, how does it work?
Keep your fingers crossed,
Sheila. I believe he's going to do it.
So that's it.
Come on, boy.
Well, how about that walk, boy?
You still feel like it?
Okay. Contact.
Easy, fellow.
This is a new kind of take-off for me.
Now, we're ready.
Give it the gun.
Hey, let me learn to fly this ship, will you?
What's the matter, fellow?
What is it?
Who is it?
Who is it? Who's there?
Who is it? Who's there?
It's Sheila Mason, Ken.
Sheila Mason.
What's she doing here?
Well, right now she's trying to shake the straw out of her hair.
What's the matter?
Forced landing.
If somebody will give me a hand,
I'll try and get this crate of mine in the air again.
Here.
Thanks.
Hope you weren't hurt.
No. Just dusted off the wings.
Sheila bought the dog, Ken.
Oh, thanks.
Come on, Lightning, let's all go outside.
That his name, Lightning?
Yes.
I hope you don't mind my being here.
I made Mac bring me.
She made the dog make me bring her.
Well, whatever it was,
I'm terribly grateful to you both. I hope you'll stay and have dinner with me.
You're sure you want us?
I have to have some lessons on these controls, don't I?
I'll have you doing your solo in an hour.
There's some rhododendron partway up that hill.
Can you see them?
Only on top where the moonlight strikes them.
Yes.
Are we near the lake?
It's right in front of us.
Is there a moon?
A great big one.
Tell me about everything around us. I want to see it with your lips.
The lake's silver, Ken, pale silver, and divinely quiet.
Like above the clouds at night in a ship?
Yes.
The hills are dark, almost purple.
Listen.
Wasn't that a fish jumping?
Yes.
The ripples are spreading clear across the water.
What are you thinking about?
I was just thinking how crazy I was not to take a good look at you when I had the chance.
Don't you remember at all?
Pretty well, but I'm not sure.
Tell me.
I'm a sort of low wing, single-motored monoplane type.
You've seen hundreds of them.
I don't believe it.
Tell me more.
Let's see. I have reddish hair, snub nose, freckles, plenty of freckles.
What else?
Well, a little under medium length, fair wing spread, stream-lined, so they tell me.
Sounds fascinating.
Watch out for this log.
Thanks, I've got it.
Sheila, come here.
I can't tell the color of your hair, but it's soft and fragrant.
I just had it shampooed.
They put the silliest things on it.
You lied about your nose.
I have not.
Now, don't argue with me.
What color are your eyes?
Sort of gray.
I knew they would be.
You're so lovely.
Ken, why don't you come back?
Back?
You can't stay buried up here.
It isn't fair to yourself.
Up here at least the money
I have left keeps me going,
I can't be a burden to my friends.
You wouldn't have to be.
There are things you can do.
There must be.
I'd hate to wind up in a tailspin.
Good flyers pull themselves out of tailspins.
Right.
On the panel board of a modern plane, there are six important instruments by means of which the pilot may determine the movement and position of his ship.
You know, Mac, writing these articles has given me an idea.
I've got a hunch that if I took the glass off my board
I could read most of those instruments by touch.
There might be something in that, Ken.
Mac, a blind man flying a plane.
Boy, oh, boy.
Would that really prove blind flying.
Look, first thing in the morning go down to the Rockwell people.
I don't want to have them take my ship away from me now.
All right, Ken.
Wouldn't it make Sheila happy if I could work this thing out?
She'd like it, Ken.
If I could really prove blind flying.
It would sort of justify her faith in bringing me back again.
And if I succeed, she wouldn't have to go stunting around county fairs any more.
Keep that crowd back. Go on, keep them all back, will you?
Keep them all back.
Nice going, Sheila.
Thanks, Nick.
Go on, kid.
Get away from that plane.
Here you are.
Two hundred for the week.
That right?
Right.
You kind of kick that ship of yours around up there, don't you, Miss Mason?
Oh, I give it a little exercise now and then.
Like to have you back with us next year if you live that long.
Thanks.
Well, good luck.
Good luck to you.
Cheerful little fellow.
Isn't he?
The most interesting thing on the instrument board is the artificial horizon.
Sheila, boy? Let her in, Mac.
Hello, boy, hello.
Hello, Mac.
Hello, Sheila.
Hello, Ken.
Hello, Sheila.
I brought a visitor.
Come in, Nick.
How are you, boys?
How's tricks? Good to see you,
Ken, you're looking great.
You haven't any shame at all, have you, Nick?
You mean about that Paris trip?
Water under the bridge, water under the bridge.
Water, huh?
Well, all right, perhaps you're not so bad when you're not trying to help somebody.
That's the stuff, Ken, Sheila said you wouldn't be sore.
How're you doing?
Fine, thanks, Nick, fine.
You should read some of the things he's written, Nick.
I'd like to.
And you'd better let me sell it for you, too. I got a pal who's editor of...
No, you don't, not this.
Okay, only if you'd let me...
Excuse me. This just came for Mr. Gordon and I thought
I'd bring it up.
For me, Mrs. Clark?
What is it?
Well, it's a letter from the Hallwell
Publishing Company.
Great.
Here, give it to me.
Wait, Ken, let me open it.
Thank you.
All right, Sheila, you break the news.
Well, what do they say?
Well, wait till I see.
Well, what is it, good news or bad?
A check!
Yes, a check.
Congratulations, Ken.
You're a full-fledged author now.
Now I can really go to work.
Sheila, I've got an idea that'll knock the world for a loop.
What is it, Ken?
Never mind about that now,
I'll tell you later.
How much is the check for?
$200! Mac, did you hear that?
This cinches it.
Now we go places.
What was your idea?
I'll have to work like mad, Sheila, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not tell you now in case I miss.
It'll take a lot of money, of course, but I can grind out enough stories to cover that.
Of course you can.
I know you can.
Oh, Mac.
Yes, Ken?
Take good care of that.
Right.
You know, writing is a great profession.
Right!
What are you trying to do, kill yourself, or just seeing how much that crate'll stand?
They're paying extra for those stunts, aren't they?
Yes, I know, but you don't have to chase yourself all over the sky.
Your job is to get more of them, that's all.
And for what, that's what I want to know, for what?
A blind man's pipe dream.
Nick, you know what's going to happen?
A lot of little children are going to grow up to hate you.
Hello, Mac.
Hello, Sheila.
Getting any place?
Well, to tell you the truth,
Sheila, I believe we are.
Really?
You mean to say that business about the radio beams and the automatic pilot really works?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that, but I will say it's got a chance.
Honest, Mac?
Yes.
Ken's working it out on the model at home, and I'm following instructions here on the ship.
Say, I can make something out of this.
You just try.
All right.
Here, Mac, here's a check.
This is from some other magazine.
Sure, I know.
Well, what you don't know is how she's been trying to break her neck to get those checks!
Don't listen to him, Mac, he's getting soft.
Well, tell Ken I'll be up to see him later.
Just a minute, Sheila.
I've got something here that I think you ought to know about.
Listen to this.
It's from the Rockwell
Aviation Company.
They own Ken's plane.
"My dear Mr. Gordon.
"In view of the fact that your unfortunate accident
"has incapacitated you from completing the work on the plane
"we have placed at your disposal,
"and since we have received no payment from you for the last two months,
"we feel forced to reclaim the ship
"unless a substantial payment is made within the next 10 days.
"Yours truly, George Rockwell,
President, Rockwell
Aviation Company."
That's something else again, isn't it?
It's a lot of money.
Yes.
What are you going to do now?
I'm going to borrow your car!
But I tell you, Mr. Rockwell, he has a chance.
His mechanic is a Scotchman and even he's beginning to believe in it.
Miss Mason, I know Ken knows his business or we wouldn't have let him have the ship in the first place.
But a blind man, putting it in operation so he can fly, let's not fool ourselves.
He's not trying to build instruments so that blind men can fly.
He's simply trying to perfect something that even a blind man can fly.
You're pretty persuasive.
I'll tell you what I'll do, not that I believe in it, but for you.
Yes?
I'll give Ken another three weeks and that's final.
Oh, thank you.
If there's anything to it, he should know it by that time.
Goodbye.
Good luck.
Thank you.
See him?
No. Do you?
They're certainly giving it a test.
Hello, Sheila.
Hello, Nick.
Kind of dirty outside, isn't it?
Just coffee.
What's this I hear about Ken taking a run-out powder?
Let's forget that, huh?
All right.
So, Nick, has anybody been set for that Moscow flight yet?
What?
You heard me.
So you want to make it after all?
Well, I have been giving it some thought.
I see.
Guess you know they moved
Ken's plane over here to Roosevelt, don't you?
Now, what's that got to do with me flying from Moscow?
I was just wondering. $25,000 would come in pretty handy right now, wouldn't it?
Do I get the job or don't I?
You know, I sort of like you.
Tell you what we'll do, Sheila.
I'm sorry, Ken, there's nothing I can do.
Miss Mason was here several times before, and for her sake we let you have the plane weeks and weeks after we should have foreclosed.
I'd like to help you, but my hands are tied, too.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gordon,
Mr. Crawford can't see you today.
That's what you've been telling me for the past two weeks.
I've got to see him.
Why don't you come again next week?
Thanks.
Can't you understand, Jack?
You have hundreds of pilots and thousands of passengers riding in those planes of yours out there,
I can make them as safe as rocking chairs.
But this is a business proposition.
You must realize I couldn't put the company's money into experiments that you can't even see to make.
Thank you.
How do you
do, ladies and gentlemen
of the radio audience?
This is Graham McNamee
speaking.
America's daring
and darling Sheila Mason,
left the Moscow airport
bound for the USA,
at 6:20 a.m. Greenwich time.
The whole world is waiting
for news of her nonstop flight
which is being
brought to you
over the facilities
of the ABC
International Hookup.
Miss Mason is flying
the great circle,
which will carry her over
Ireland and Newfoundland
and north of the regular
lane of ship travel.
Her ship is equipped
with radiotelephone
but she may be out of touch
with the world for hours,
and her life depends
on her skill and her ship.
She is flying a powerful,
single-motored monoplane
with a cruising range
of over 6,000 miles.
Unless she runs
into bad weather,
she should put her plane down
at Roosevelt Field
under 40 hours.
A record.
Hello, Halifax.
Hello, Halifax.
Mason calling Halifax.
Mason calling Halifax,
Sheila Mason calling Halifax.
Here's the
bulletin you've been waiting
for, ladies and gentlemen.
Halifax has gotten
in touch with Sheila Mason.
She reports by radio
that she's 100 miles
off the banks.
She says that she has been
held up by headwinds,
but her plane is working well.
It begins to look
as if she'll succeed
in her great flight
from Moscow to New York.
It's safe to say that every
man, woman and child
in the world hopes so.
Hello, Portland.
Mason calling Portland.
Mason calling Portland.
Sheila Mason calling Portland.
If you can hear me, come back, please.
If you can hear me, come back, please.
Here's the
latest flash on Sheila Mason,
and ladies and gentlemen,
it's not so good.
She is over the Atlantic
somewhere north of Boston,
but she has been out of touch
with every radio station
for more than an hour.
A heavy fog bank
covers the entire seaboard
and in order to get
to New York,
she will have to fly
without any visibility at all,
on account of those
head winds,
her gasoline supply
must be running mighty low.
We will now continue
our regular program,
but we will give you
the latest bulletins
as they come in.
Ken, where have you been?
Down the street, listening to the radio.
You heard about Sheila?
Oh, it's terrible.
Why, the fog is so low out on that field a snake couldn't crawl under it.
Why did she make this flight?
Too late to talk about that now, Mac.
I've got to get out to the field.
What?
I'm going up in my ship to bring her down.
You're crazy, man!
All right, then watch a crazy man do it.
They won't let you have the ship.
They've got to!
You've got to take me, Mac.
I can't, Ken.
You're in no shape to fly.
They may have ruined the instruments, anything.
You might get killed.
That isn't important anymore.
It's Sheila's only chance.
You got to help me.
Right?
Right.
Come on.
Hello, Boston.
Hello, Boston,
Sheila Mason calling Boston.
If you can hear me, come back, please.
Mason standing by.
Hello, Mason.
Hello, Mason. Boston calling.
What is your position?
What is your position?
Boston standing by.
Go ahead, Mason.
Hello, Boston. Mason calling
Boston. Am uncertain of my position.
Haven't seen the ground for the past two hours.
Am flying in and above a heavy fog bank.
How is my signal strength?
Come back, please.
Come back, please.
Hello, Mason. Hello, Mason.
You're coming in very strong.
You must be
within 100 miles.
Here are
the weather reports...
Hello, Boston. Hello, Boston.
Come back, please.
Mason calling Boston.
Come back, please.
This is Graham McNamee again.
Here you are, ladies
and gentlemen. Another
bulletin on Sheila Mason.
Boston reports,
they've just got in touch
with her.
She said she was keeping
on toward New York,
but the fog is so thick
her situation
is almost hopeless.
She asked for her bearings,
but before Boston could reply,
they lost touch with her.
Please stand by.
Is this as fast as this thing can go?
I've got her wide open, Ken.
Sheila Mason calling
Roosevelt. Sheila Mason calling Roosevelt.
If you can hear me, come back, please. If you can hear me, come back, please.
After a sensationally successful flight of over
5,000 miles, during which she conquered distance, winds and
North Atlantic storms,
Sheila Mason, girl flyer, was apparently defeated tonight within a few miles of her goal, by the aviator's greatest enemy, fog.
Yeah. Well, even if she could find the field, she won't be able to land.
There's the worst fog in years all up and down the coast.
And, Al, you better send a couple of cars out here in a hurry.
I think I've got her!
I've contacted her.
Give me that.
Hello. Hello, Sheila.
Hello, Sheila. This is Nick.
Hello, Nick. Yes, this is Sheila. I'm all right, but where am I?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear my motor?
No, we can't hear your motor.
Have you any idea where you are?
No. I've lost my bearings, and I've got gas for another 20 minutes.
How's the weather at the field?
It's zero-zero here.
The fog's right down the ground.
Listen, kid, forget the flight and bail out.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me have that.
What good will it do her to jump?
It's a hundred to one she'll fall in the Atlantic Ocean.
How does she feel?
How would you feel?
Hello, Sheila.
Sheila Mason.
Calling Sheila Mason.
Hello, Sheila.
Sheila, hello, Sheila!
I've lost her.
Here's where they keep it.
Here you are, Ken.
It's shortly after midnight, the fog shows no sign of lifting.
Sheila Mason's situation is becoming more hopeless.
Where's Top Harmon?
Right here.
Ken Gordon broke into the hangar to get his plane out.
What?
He says he's going up to find Sheila Mason.
Well, why didn't you stop him?
Well, tried to tell you first.
Hold everything. Ken Gordon, blind flyer, broke into the hangar, stole his plane and is going up after Sheila Mason.
Keep this wire open.
He mustn't do it!
He's crazy!
All set, Ken. You're headed straight down the runway into the wind.
Get on that transmitter and don't stop talking.
Right.
Sorry, Top, but after all,
I got Sheila into this.
Sheila, Sheila, Ken speaking.
Can you hear me?
Ken.
Ken!
Yes, I can hear you.
Where are you?
In my plane 1,000 feet over Roosevelt Field.
In your plane? Are you alone?
Yes, but everything is working fine.
How much gas have you got?
Maybe 15 minutes.
Are you above the fog?
No, I'm trying to get down under it.
All right.
Head due south, climb above the fog and look for me on top.
Right.
I can see you now, Ken.
Good, sit tight.
We're only about 20 miles away from the field.
Pull up alongside.
Right.
I'm alongside now, Ken.
How close are you?
Just above you on your right.
Fine. Follow me.
I'm following you, Ken.
Keep as
close as you can
so you don't lose me.
I will.
How do you feel?
A little tired.
We'll be over the field in a few minutes. I'll have to shut off my transmitter.
There isn't much time.
I've got to tell you something.
What is it, Ken?
I love you, Sheila.
It's the first time you ever told me that.
I couldn't before.
I love you, Ken.
I loved you even before
I met you.
I want you to be happy, dear.
I'm so happy right now
I could cry.
I'm not even tired anymore.
Ken, if we get through, you'll have proved your ship and then maybe you and I...
No.
No, we can't plan beyond, this.
Ken, what are you saying?
Listen, dear, there isn't much time to talk.
I've lost my courage.
I can't go on. I can't.
Even if I get my ship back,
what's the use if I can't
see the clouds and the moon
and the stars?
I won't be able to see you.
But we'll make up for all that.
No, Sheila.
I'm going to take you down and then, I'm going on until it's too late to turn back,
I'm taking my ship with me.
Ken!
Ken!
Steady, Sheila.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two...
We're over the field now.
One, two, three...
We're gonna take a dive into this now.
One, two, three...
Keep close to me but be careful that we don't tangle in this soup.
I can't talk anymore now.
Ken! Ken!
You can't do it.
You can't do it!
Cut your motor.
Ken!
Ken, don't!
I won't let you do it!
I'm going to stop you!
Ken.
Sheila!
Miss Mason, Miss Mason, will you say a few words to the radio audience, please?
She'll tell you all about it later.
Watch out!
Sheila, dear, you're sure you're not hurt?
Of course I'm not hurt, dear.
Sheila, I can see flashes of light.
That's what they are, dear, flashlights.
You mean you can see them?
Yes, dear, I can see them.
Keep that nose up, Sheila, keep that nose up.
Right.
My darling.
- Do I have to eat any more of this?
- DefiniteIy.
Spinach is very rich in vitamins.
I might say disgustingIy rich.
And very good for you, Miss Barbara.
Why is it so many things you don't Iike are good for you?
I couIdn't say offhand, Miss Barbara, but you must eat some more of your spinach.
Why do I have to?
Your Iunch caIIs for so many vitamins, and you must have them.
AII right.
My goodness, that was an awfuI big vitamin.
- Have you finished, Miss Barbara?
- But definiteIy.
The third sneeze.
Let me see your tongue.
I'm afraid you'II have to go to bed.
I'm not sick. I feeI fine.
CoIIins, she's perfectIy weII.
A sneeze is nothing to be aIarmed at.
Perhaps not, but I'm responsibIe for the chiId.
Come, my dear.
Phone for Dr PaImer.
The chiId sneezes and you'd think the worId was coming to an end.
Can't they Ieave her aIone?
She's a perfectIy normaI, heaIthy chiId.
The way they carry on, you'd think she was made of gIass.
Something ought to be done with CoIIins.
- How Mr Barry can...
- Sshh!
..stand that femaIe is beyond me.
WeII, you can't expect a widower and a man as busy as Mr Barry is to notice everything that's going on in the house.
Better do your teIephoning.
No, itjust seems to be a sIight coId, but Mr Barry aIways wants us to notify him.
Just got a message from Barry's home.
His chiId is iII.
Just got a message from Barry's home. His chiId is iII.
OK, I'II see that he gets the message.
Mr Barry is wanted at home at once.
His child is quite ill.
ReaIIy?
- Where's Mr Barry?
- At the househoId exhibit.
- His daughter's seriousIy iII.
- I'II go over to the show and pick him up.
If he phones, teII him I'm on my way over.
Thank you. Be ready for the opening of the exhibit at 2.15.
(women) Yes, Mr Barry.
- May I heIp?
- Thank you.
Seems I can't do anything without Barry making troubIe for me.
I hate that man.
He causes me more sIeepIess nights...
SIeepIess nights? What does he do, pIay a sIide trombone under your window?
Everything but that. I Iay awake haIf the night thinking up new ideas.
Then I find Barry's not onIy beaten me to them, he's topped me in a thousand ways.
I wish he'd drown in his own soap suds.
- I shouIdn't be boring you with my troubIes.
- That's aII right.
- Are you in this business?
- Yes.
I'm with the Peck Company. Advertising.
I see. I'm sorry you disIike this feIIow Barry, though. He's reaIIy not a bad sort.
- Do you know him?
- SIightIy. My barber cuts his hair.
- Maybe I couId bribe him to cut his throat.
- Mr Barry, do you think she'II be aII right?
I don't know. Let me see.
- Yes, she'II do very niceIy.
- Thank you, Mr Barry. Just what I thought.
Of aII the rotten tricks! Letting me taIk my head off without teIIing me.
Just another exampIe of Barry cIeverness, I suppose.
What was she burning about?
I keep her awake nights.
Mr Barry, you're wanted at home right away.
Barbara's very iII.

Ah.
- WiII you read to me from this?
- AII right. Which one is it to be?
It's the one where Betsy runs away from the orphan asyIum and meets Tony, the organ grinder, and his monkey.
''Betsy Ware was two years oId when her mother died.''
''Because the famiIy was poor,
Betsy couIdn't stay at home.''
''So she was sent to an orphan asyIum.''
Which was an ugIy red-brick buiIding far, far away from where Betsy used to Iive.
Yes. ''From where Betsy used to Iive.''
''A young man came dancing round the corner in a green coat and bumped right into her.''
'''Excuse me,' said the young man.
'I'm aIways bumping into peopIe.'''
''That's why they caII me Puddin' Head...''
''So Mary couIdn't pIay that afternoon.
She had Iessons to do...''
No, no. Read what happened after Betsy met Puddin' Head.
Oh, excuse me.
Why, I must have skipped a page.
- How is she?
- She's fine.
The doctor was here and he said there isn't the sIightest thing the matter with her.
Now, you see, Mr Barry?
She's perfectIy aII right.
CoIIins gets panicky every time the chiId sneezes.
CoIIins is right. I want every precaution taken.
Of course, I know it's none of my business, Mr Barry, but did you ever stop to consider that the constant piIIing up of precautions and attentions was bad for the chiId?
Why, she's pampered and watched over and babied to death.
- WouId you mind if I'd offer a suggestion?
- No, go ahead.
If I were you, I'd send Barbara to schooI where she'II be with other chiIdren.
There may be something in that.
Perhaps schooI's the thing.
TeII CoIIins I wish to speak to her about it.
I know what CoIIins wiII say.
CoIIins aIways says no.
- HeIIo, Daddy.
- HeIIo, sweet.
Daddy, why do I aIways have to pIay aIone?
Why can't I pIay with other chiIdren?
- Honey, how wouId you Iike to go to schooI?
- Goody-goody!
- WeII, I guess that's settIed, then.
- Yes, Mr Barry?
I'm sending Barbara to schooI in the
Adirondacks, where her mother used to go.
But the chiId's much too young for a summer camp.
Didn't I teII you CoIIins aIways said no?
I've onIy been foIIowing your instructions.
I'm sorry if...
She needs to be with other chiIdren.
Get in touch with the Forest Grove SchooI right away.
Take care of aII the detaiIs.
- Yes, sir.
- (man) Mr Barry.
You wanted to Iisten to the changes on your radio hour.
- The programme's on now.
- Oh, yes.
? B-a-r-r-y
? Why don't you buy a bar of Barry's?
? Every grocer carries Barry's
? You will find that Barry's little bubbles
? Make you kinda laugh at your washing troubles
? Buy a bar of Barry's
? It's the berries, that's Barry's
? So run, don't waIk
? To the nearest exit and find a bar of Barry's
And now the Barry baritone will sing that new hit tune, ''When l'm With You''.
? Every street I waIk on becomes a Iovers Iane
? When I'm with you
? I can see the sun though we're out in the rain
? When I'm with you
? To lose you would be tragic
? Here is my heart unfurled
? You have that certain magic
? You're the Seven Wonders of the World
? Snow is on the ground but the Ieaves are on the trees
? When I'm with you
? Flowers sing a love song, there's music in the breeze
? When l'm with you
? Ooh
? Please let me make this confession
? You are my magnifiicent obsession
? The world is all in rhyme, lovely one
? When l'm with you
You know, Daddy, this house wouIdn't be so
Ionesome if you'd stay home once in a whiIe.
If I stayed home aII the time, there wouIdn't be any house.
Do you know, Daddy, I can sing that song, and I've got my own words.
- Wanna hear them?
- Mm-hm.
? An ordinary day becomes a hoIiday
? When I'm with you
? I have Iots of toys but I don't wanna pIay
? When I'm with you
? Oh, Daddy, how I miss you
? You're busy aII your Iife
? I Iove to hug and kiss you
? Marry me and Iet me be your wife
? Every word I hear sounds Iike a IuIIaby
? When I'm with you
? Even funny spinach tastes Iike pumpkin pie
? When I'm with you
? Ooh
? In every dream I caress you
? And every night
I pray the Lord wiII bIess you
? The worId's a nursery rhyme, Daddy dear
? When I'm with you
Are you going to stay in schooI with me?
No, my dear.
I'm going to take a IittIe vacation.
- What's a vacation?
- It's a rest, dear.
Getting away from peopIe you've been with and seeing new faces.
You reaIIy become another person on a vacation.
- What person are you gonna be?
- Just another person.
- Is going to schooI a vacation?
- HardIy. Just the opposite.
You think CoIIins is strict, but wait tiII you get to schooI.
There'II be no running to Woodward or to your daddy.
You'II do just what you're toId.
I don't think I'm gonna Iike schooI.
- May I take Snoopy with me?
- No, my dear.
- You're not aIIowed to have dogs in schooI.
- No?
- No, indeed.
- That settIes it.
- AII right, darIing. We'd better get started.
- Come, my dear.
Goodbye, Snoopy.
Are they expecting you this evening?
I toId them we'd be out sometime this week.
You'd better wire them and have a car meet you.
- I'II do it from the station.
- You're going to be very happy at schooI.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
Sure you're going to be happy.
I'II be up and spend every weekend with you.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Aren't you coming into the station with us?
I'm sorry. I can't. I'm Iate for a business appointment aIready.
I'm aIways running away from you.
I'II make up for it Saturday and Sunday.
I'II spend every minute with you.
We'II have Iots of fun. Goodbye.
- Take good care of her, CoIIins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's this for?
- It weighs you for a penny.
- I wanna be weighed.
- WeII, I haven't a penny.
- I have a penny.
- AII right.
No, here.
On this side is your weight. 58 pounds.
And on this side is your fortune.
What does it say? What does it say?
It says you're going away on a Iong trip.
You're going to meet a Iot of strange peopIe.
What a smart machine.
Come, my dear.
Porter, I have to send a teIegram.
My purse. It's gone.
I must have dropped it.
Keep an eye on her. I'II be back in a minute.
Yes, ma'am.
- (screeching tyres)
- Look out, Iady!
Come on! Give her air!
- What's your name?
- Rufus Washington Jackson Lee.
- AII by yourseIf?
- (chuckles)
- My name is Betsy Ware.
- That's a mighty pretty name.
- Did you ever have a vacation?
- Oh, yes, missy. Lots and Iots of 'em.
- Are they fun?
- They are if you don't have too many.
I'II bet they're more fun than going to schooI.
I never had a vacation, but I'm thinking about having one.
Look.
- Why don't you heIp your brother?
- Brother?
AII right, IittIe missy.
You just wait right here tiII I come back.
There was a Iady and IittIe girI with these.
They went away and didn't come back.
AII right.
- Has the woman been identified?
- No. No pocketbook, no Iaundry marks.
You'd better caII up the bureau of missing persons and have a description sent out.
It's Tony!
And his monkey!
Gee, that's a sweII hat.
I wish I couId have one Iike it.
- Here, take it.
- Oh, thanks.
- And you may have these, too.
- Thanks a Iot.
I know who you are. You're Tony.
That's right. Antonio is my middIe name.
I'm on my vacation.
Do you wanna come aIong?
You're very nice, IittIe bambina.
You go home to your mama.
- I have no mama.
- That's too bad.
Then go home to your papa.
- Say, what's your name?
- Betsy Ware.
I used to Iive in an orphanage, but they were mean to me, awfuIIy mean.
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- Huh?
I'm on a vacation. To see new faces.
Your face doesn't Iook very new.
WeII, it's good enough for me. Goodbye.
Here comes Papa! Here comes Papa!
- Why you chase me for?
- I'm Betsy Ware.
I used to Iive in an orphanage, but they were awfuI mean to me.
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- I know. You toId me that.
- And you no Iike my face.
- Yes, I do.
(Tony) Ma! Ma!
Who is she?
Mama, maybe she's hungry.
I go get her?
Come, you stay in my house tonight.
Eat the spaghetti. They're good.
Look, Iook. Like this. Look.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- I sneezed.
- Salute.
Salute.
- Don't I have to go to bed?
- What's the matter?
- You're sIeepy?
- You eat first.
I Iike it here.
So IittIe, and so sweet.
Maybe we keep her. Yes?
Are you crazy? What you want to do?
You want to go to jaiI for the kidnap?
Five chiIdren you have aIready.
Six with the monkey.
AII right. Then I take her to the poIiceman in the morning.
Come, bambina.
- So fast she sIeeps.
- Maybe we'II keep her, huh?
Mama, come on! Get up!
This music comes in handy for rehearsing.
- Rehearsing for what?
- Somebody may ask us to pIay a benefit.
Don't forget - we got another radio audition tomorrow.
You know, this radio racket is a Iot tougher than vaudeviIIe used to be.
- Remember when we got married?
- No, and don't remind me.
And, by the way, I'm getting tired of these radio auditions.
If we don't Iand a sponsor soon,
I'm going home to my mother.
WeII, that's better than bringing the oId battIe-axe here. I'm onIy kidding.
Honey, I've been working on a step that's gonna start BiII Robinson taIking to himseIf.
Watch this.
Like to see anybody tie that.
- I'm going to see who that hoofer is!
- WhiIe you're there, take a few Iessons.
(Mama) Bravo, bambina! Bravo!
It's a kid. Jerry, Jerry!
Are you the one who was answering my steps?
- Tony, who is she?
- She's an orphan.
She run away. She foIIow me here.
Jerry, she's a naturaI. Look at her.
Did you ever see a better bet?
- Who is she?
- She's part of our act, kid.
DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
Say, what's your name?
Betsy Ware. Are you Puddin' Head?
I'II say he's Puddin' Head. Come on.
- What's this aII about?
- Don't you see?
That kid's a noveIty.
Just what we need for the act.
You crazy?
What do you know about the chiId?
AII there is to know.
She ran away from an orphan asyIum.
Orphan asyIum! Did you notice her hands?
They don't manicure 'em in orphan asyIums.
WeII, I don't know. Friend of mine got his hair cut in Sing Sing.
You're aIways making mountains out of mothbaIIs.
Supposing the kid's story does turn out to be a phoney? So we beIieved it.
We fed her, took care of her and put her on the air.
- They can't hang you for that, can they?
- They can try.
Wait a minute.
I want the poIice department.
Bureau of missing persons.
Bureau of missing persons?
Is anybody missing?
Oh, thousands of peopIe?
That's very interesting.
Did anybody report a kid missing by the name of Betsy Ware?
But, Jimmy...
No record? Oh.
No, no. I don't wanna make a report.
No, thanks.
But if I shouId ever Iose a kid by that name,
I'II Iet you know.
What? Oh, wise guy, hey?
- You'd better turn her in anyway.
- I teII you, it's OK.
Wait a minute. Listen, sweetheart. Remember, you're Bonnie DoIan, the radio star.
Don't use your reaI name around here.
Just forget that you're Betsy Ware.
- Are we pIaying a game?
- That's it, a game.
- WiII you pIay aIong with it?
- Mm-hm. I Iove games.
- AII right. Now, don't forget, Betsy.
- The name's Bonnie DoIan.
We're DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
We have an appointment with Dan Ward of the Ward and WaIIace advertising agency.
Oh, yes. For an audition.
Room B to your right, pIease.
- HeIIo, Mr Ward. Mr Ward.
- Yes?
This is my wife, Jerry.
And this is our kid, Bonnie DoIan.
Have we got an act!
Have we got an act? I'm asking you.
Don't ask me, show me!

? Let's keep on dreaming
? MiIIions or biIIions can't equaI your worth
? Your Iove is a bIessing to me
? Are you an armfuI of heaven here on earth?
? You are
? But definiteIy
? When you are crooning the bIue of the day
? And whistIing the goId of the dawn
? Bing-bing!
? Are you my favourite?
You know that you are
? But definiteIy
? Bo bo-bo-bo-bo

Not bad. I'II be right out.
I have a cIient who might be interested.
You wait here.
- Didn't he Iike what we did?
- Sure.
I guess he's gone to the next room to appIaud.
Margaret? This is Dan. Listen, I've got the greatest act that's ever been offered to radio.
It's no use, Dan.
Mr Peckjust won't go on the air.
I know he won't go for girIs, and I know he won't go for crooners, but he'II go for this.
But you said we were good.
Never pay any attention to what he says.
Maybe we were too good.
- Oh, uh...
- Yes?
- This cIient of mine...
- Yeah?
- ..that I was teIIing you about...
- Yes?
..wiII see you this afternoon.
- We're good!
- We're good! We're good! We're good!
- Can you be there at three?
- Can we be there at three?
- Can we be there at three?
- We'II be there at five minutes to three.
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.
I don't care how good they are!
I teII you, I don't want a radio show!
But, Mr Peck, if you'd onIy give them an audition...
It's a most unusuaI act, Mr Peck.
They'II be up here in a few moments.
- Shut up!
- (phone rings)
Oh.
Mr Barry of the Barry Soap Company is here.
Says he has an appointment.
Do you know what that young upstart wants?
TeIephoned me, said he wanted to see me.
- I have no idea.
- WeII, I have.
He wants me to buy him out.
Buy him out?
Why, Mr Peck, the Barry saIes are...
I know he's been seIIing soap!
But he's been spending 11 cents on baIIyhoo for every 10-cent cake he's soId.
- But the figures show...
- Figures!
It takes no genius to offer five-doIIar biIIs for four eighty and do a voIume of business.
But the day of reckoning is aIways around the corner, and it's caught up with Barry.
ShaII I show him in?
Yes, show him in.
You stay, Gooch.
- WeII, weII. If it isn't Peck's bad girI.
- HeIIo, Mr Barry.
- Mr Peck wants you to go right in.
- That's mighty white of the oId man.
Listen, how wouId you Iike to have Iunch with your boss?
- With my boss?
- Sure. I'm gonna buy up the whoIe shebang.
It's on its Iast Iegs and Peck'II probabIy be gIad to seII it for a song.
- What's funny about that?
- (telephonist) Yes, sir. I'II teII him.
Mr Peck wants to know what's deIaying you.
The oId boy can't wait. See you Iater.
WeII...
Mr Peck...
Yes, Mr Barry?
Just what can I do for you today?
WeII, Peck, I understand that this pIace is going to... going to pot.
Now, I might consider taking it off your hands.
But... do I understand you to say...?
You understand me to say that I'II buy you out. How much?
Have you the coIossaI insoIence to suggest that I seII my business to you?
Why not? You've been Iosing money for two years. You're practicaIIy broke.
Get out! Get out, before I kick you out!
Now get out.
I gather that he doesn't want to seII.
Is that your impression too?
- DefiniteIy.
- Very weII.
Good day.
HeIIo, boss.
Boss or no boss, how about the date for Iuncheon?
WeII, I couIdn't possibIy.
Come on, be a sport.
You're even with me, aren't you?
I'm ahead of you.
When wiII it be?
- Oh, Friday at one?
- Fine. At the Savoy?
Say, Margaret, isn't he one of our competitors?
As far as I'm concerned, he has no competition.
(man) 16.
Peck's Soap Company.
- We're DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
- The radio stars.
Oh, yes. DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And which one are you?
I'm the one in the middIe.
Miss AIIen's busy at the moment.
WiII you wait in her office?
Thank you.
DarIing, don't do that.
Be a good girI and sit down over there.
- I wanna taIk to Puddin' Head a minute.
- Do me a favour and stop worrying.
- You're beginning to Iook terribIe.
- Why wouIdn't I?
I dozed off this morning at 3.30 and sIept Iike a Iog tiII four.
(Jimmy) The way you're acting, you'd think we were kidnappers.
(Jerry) That's what I'm afraid the judge wiII think. We may get off with Iife.
HeIIo.
- How'd you get in here? Who are you?
- I'm Bonnie DoIan, the big radio star.
You know, DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And are we good!
Ah.
So they sent you in here to soften me up, did they?
Young Iady, you're wasting your time.
Now get outta here.
- Why have you got so many doors?
- To keep out nuisances one door won't stop.
- But they aII open.
- Ah.
- What's this?
- Nothing to do with you.
Now, get aIong with you.
Why do you want me to go? You're aII aIone, and I'm not doing anything, either.
- TeII me a story.
- I don't know any stories.
You know, you remind me of oId Mr SpindIeshanks.
- Who?
- Mr SpindIeshanks.
He's the grouch in the Betsy Ware stories who heIps Betsy when she's hungry...
Hungry? You're not hungry, are you?
No. I just had Iunch, and I did something bad, too.
- What'd you do?
- WeII, we had spinach.
And whiIe Jimmy wasn't Iooking,
I put mine on his pIate.
No, no. That is wrong.
You shouId have eaten your spinach.
It's good for you.
So I've heard.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get aIong.
- Why?
- You said for me to.
I didn't say anything of the kind.
AII I said was that spinach was good for you.
Come back here.
Sit down over there.
Come over here.
You Iike these pictures?
- Do you know something?
- What?
I didn't think I was gonna Iike you at first.
But I Iike you now.
- Do you?
- Yes.
- Your eyebrows are so nice and ragged.
- (stutters)
AII right.
So you're a singer, are you?
Mm-hm.
- Sing a song for me.
- AII right.
? Buy a bar of Barry's
- ? Every grocer carries Barry's...
- Stop it! Stop it, I say!
- What's the matter?
- Where'd you Iearn that trash?
On the radio. I heard it on the radio.
Ah.
Radio. There oughta be a Iaw against it.
Now, come on.
Look at the pictures.
- Do you know how to pIay piggyback?
- (stutters)
- No, I don't think I do.
- Oh, it's easy.
Stand up. Stand up.
Turn round.
Now I put my arms around your neck Iike this.
Now go Iike this.

Where's the chiId?
You haven't forgotten her?

You'd better go right in.
I'II Iook for the chiId. Right in there.
? Rings on her fingers and beIIs on her toes, she shaII have music wherever she goes
Come in.
Ah.
So you thought you'd trick me into going on the air, did you?
Oh, no.
You deIiberateIy sent this chiId to infIuence me.
WeII, I'II Iet you know, it didn't work.
As a matter of fact, I made up my mind a Iong time ago to go on the air.
But she had nothing to do with it, nothing whatever.
She didn't infIuence me the sIightest.
Now, understand that.
- Yes, of course.
- Arrange for time on the air at once.
I want these foIks to start on a series of 15-minute programmes five nights a week, starting tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
But, Mr Peck, I couIdn't possibIy do that...
Then make it possibIe!
Didn't I teII you aII we needed was a break?
- 13 weeks on the dotted Iine.
- It's wonderfuI, Jimmy.
- I hope we cIick.
- Why, we'II knock 'em dead.

- No, we won't kiII them. We'II just sIay them.
Oh.
They'II be on in a few minutes.
And if you wanna see a radio show that'II make yours Iook sick...

That's just the pIace to wear 'em.
Your feet don't sIip so easy.
Oh.

- It's uncanny.
- Isn't she wonderfuI?
I mean her voice, it's... it's just Iike Barbara's.
If I didn't know my chiId was at schooI, I'd swear to it.
AII chiIdren's voices sound about aIike.
It's just that sIight difference that makes Bonnie stand out.
A proud father probabIy wouIdn't even notice that difference.
? Marry me and let me be your wife
- That's Barbara. It is.
- Are you Iosing your mind?
- That's Bonnie DoIan.
- But, I teII you, it's my daughter.

Why do I have to marry a girI Iike this?
Who said you're going to?
I wouIdn't marry you...
You'II marry me if I want you to.

Come on.
And were you good!
We certainIy sIayed them, didn't we?
Come on, darIing.
Great IittIe trooper, that kid.
Just Iike her father. I taught her aII she knows.
When she was six months oId, the name of the act was DoIan and DoIan.
- Then she used to...
- Mr Peck, Mr Barry just phoned.
Said Bonnie is his daughter and wants us to hoId her here.
Barry, huh? Trying to put something over on me again. The nerve!
- What eIse did he say?
- That's aII, except he was on his way over.
Good! I'II teII that cheap upstart just where he gets off.
Trying to steaI my taIent, is he? I'II sue him.
Here, you get your wife and chiId and get them out of here.
I know how to handIe Barry!

Taxi!
Taxi!
Taxi!
Listen, honey, teII us the truth.
Do you know Mr Barry?

- What'II we do now?
- There's onIy one thing.
Take her home, teIephone Barry where she is and then duck. FIag a taxi.
- Taxi!
- I shouId have known better.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
AII we've got to do is...
Oh.
- An awfuIIy nice kid you have there.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Taxi. Taxi!
(Jerry) DarIing, we've got to go. Something has come up and we've got to go right away.
- (Barbara) Can't I go with you?
- (Jimmy) No, you stay here.
But I don't wanna stay here aII aIone.
Honey, do us a big favour. Stay right here.
Listen, sweet, you stay here, we'II caII your daddy and he'II come for you in a few minutes.
Oh.
Here, sweet. PIay with your toys.
Goodbye, darIing.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Puddin' Head.
Come on.
A fine cock-and-buII story. If she's your daughter, what's she doing here?

- She's gone, and don't teII him where she is.
- Can't you see I'm teIIing you the truth?

Yes? Yes.
It's for you, Richard.
Yes?
What's the number of the house?
Yes, what fIoor?
The parIour fIoor, the first door to your Ieft.
I know where she is. She's aII aIone!
Is she reaIIy your daughter?
Isn't that what I've been teIIing you, you crazy oId buzzard?
We're a coupIe of heeIs, running out on the kid.
- I know, but...
- And a coupIe of saps.
- They're bound to get us.
- I guess you're right.
Everybody knows DoIan and DoIan.
They know we had the kid, too.
Of course, and if we run away, it'II Iook worse.
Come on. Let's go back and face it.
Come on, now. Be a nice IittIe girI.
I'II buy you a pretty present if you teII me who your father is.
I won't teII you. I don't Iike you.
- You'd better teII.
- I won't! I won't! You Iet me go!
- No, you don't. You're coming with me.
- I am not! I am not!
I'm waiting! I'm waiting! I promised Jerry!
Hey! Where are you going with that kid?
Jimmy, Iead with your Ieft!
Hit him hard, Puddin' Head!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Daddy!
- (Jerry) Are you aII right, Jimmy?
- Who brought you here?
- They did.
- Where's CoIIins?
- I don't know.
She Iost her purse and went away.
So I thought I'd go on a vacation.
I found Tony, and then
Mr and Mrs Puddin' Head found me.
What are they doing, Daddy?
They're hurting them, and they're my friends.
They're my best friends.
They saved me from that bad man.
She toId us she ran away from an orphan asyIum, and we beIieved her.
- Didn't you teII us that, Bonnie?
- Yes, I did.
But I wasn't teIIing a Iie. I was just pIaying a game, and they pIayed with me.
I see.
I've never had so much fun in my whoIe Iife.
But I'm gIad to be back with you, Daddy.
Barbara. Officers,
I'm afraid I've put you to a Iot of bother.
- You needn't hoId those peopIe any Ionger.
- Wait. I've got a contract.
- You know what that contract's worth?
- You've been trying to buy each other out.
Why don't you merge the two companies?
You can wash the neck of the whoIe nation.
- That's a thought.
- Merge with him? Never!
I don't know what that means, but why don't you do it?

-Happy birthday, Mrs. Hawkins.
-Yes, Mrs. Hawkins.
Younger every year.
None of your frippery, John Harrow.
But music and friends do make you feeI--
-Where's Jim?
-He's in the kitchen, I think.
Just put a head on that one, John.
It's going to thunder and Iightning.
Then you best go
Iock yourseIf up in a cIoset.
You made that cake?
No, I didn't.
And I'II thank you not to say I did.
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
No, I didn't.
OnIy girIs make cakes.
My mother made this cake herseIf.
SureIy she had to have a cake for her birthday.
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Stop foIIowing me around.
Upon my souI!
Why, Jim, you didn't go and bake a--?
Here's the cake you made, Mother.
I trust it's good.
It's the best cake ever.
I raise a mug to Jim Hawkins, proprietor of the AdmiraI Benbow.
-Jim.
-Speech!
-Come on, get up.
-Speech, speech.
WeII, I don't know what to say, but ever since Father died. . .
. . .and with Mother having to do the work, I'm gIad each time she gets oIder.
I mean, then I get oIder too.
And soon I'II be abIe to do aII the work and won't have to make speeches.
Here she comes.
Everybody to the taproom.
We'II cut the cake in there.
Everybody take a seat.
Oh, Jim, there go the shutters.
-Go up and cIose them, wiII you?
-At your service, ma'am.
-Now what?
-I'm scared. Aren't you scared?
No, I'm not.
It's girIs that make me nervous.
Why don't you go downstairs, where there's more room to be scared in.
-I want a bunk with a sea view.
-This way, sir.
Have you seen this man around here before?
He Iooks Iike a seafaring man.
He certainIy doesn't beIong to these parts.
Hey!
I want a noggin of rum.
Yes, sir.
Mind, you cIod.
Have an eye to that chest.
Here. Now, you never made this voyage, you understand?
You never seen me and you don't know nothing.
Get out.
What are you Iooking for?
Strangers, sonny, strangers.
I don't Iike strangers coming aboard me sudden-Iike.
Makes my spine jump
Iike a porpoise, it does.
-What might your name be?
-Jim Hawkins.
Now, Iook here, Jim, you and me's going to be mates.
You'II get a siIver four-penny bit every month. . .
. . .if you watches out for strangers and comes and Iets the oId captain know. . .
. . .when they tops the horizon.
-WeII, what manner of strangers?
-Seafaring men.
WeII, aII seafaring men?
No, no, no, son.
There's a speciaI cut of the jib to these seafaring men.
But most especiaIIy, I want you to keep your eye open. . .
. . .for a seafaring man with one Ieg.
-A seafaring man with one Ieg?
-Aye.
Upon my word, sir, what shaII I teII them? What do they want?
Never you mind what they want.
You go on down beIow and get me a noggin of rum.
A doubIe noggin, Jim, because I'm becaImed.
BecaImed on a sea of troubIes, and I've got to fiII my saiIs again.
Yes, sir.
Who is he, Jim? What did he say?
I don't know. Something about seafaring men with no ears and no Iegs and no--
Hey, drop anchor, matey.
We'II fiII the cask where you Iie.
Rum for aII hands, say I.
Here's a new port aII fuII of pretty wenches. . .
. . .and strong young buckoes.
CIear the decks for pIeasant action.
FiII a pretty beIIy with grog and that's what makes the worId. . .
. . .spin on its poIes, say I.
Hey, beIay there.
-The rum.
-I'm not much on strong Iiquor, sir.
Besides, we have to go now.
It's getting--
''Go,'' say ye?
You'II stay.
You'II aII stay.
Sit yourseIves down on your binnacIes.
Jim, matey, the rum.
I ain't Iike aII seafaring men.
GenteeI, I am, and a dove at heart, mates.
Why, I know some seafaring men, them as boarded a Spanish brig. . .
. . .aII Ioaded down with
CastiIian dons and their beauteous Iadies.
And what did they do?
GenteeI Iike me, ye thinks?
No. They sIices them dons
Iike bread Ioaves. . .
. . .and feeds them to the sharks.
And what did they do to the beauteous Iadies?
Why, after courting their favor, as it were. . .
. . .saving your presence, matey. . .
. . .they sIits the veins of their pearIy white arms. . .
. . .and uses their bIue bIood to warm their rum.
And then what did they do, matey?
BIess my souI, sir, what eIse was Ieft?
There was the song, Jim.
Singing by aII hands.
Now, come on. We'II aII tip the stave.
Come on!
Come on, sing!
BottIe of rum, you oId hag!
-BottIe of rum!
-''BottIe of rum! ''
We'II tip it again now. Come on!
-Dr. Livesey.
-Mrs. Hawkins.
It was Mother's birthday. We were just having a IittIe entertainment, doctor.
WeII, my compIiments, Mrs. Hawkins.
-A IittIe brandy, Jim.
-My pIeasure, sir.
Come on, mates.
Now we'II tip it again.
-Thought sure we were in for a storm--
-Hey! SiIence there between decks.
You addressing me, sir?
Is it bIowing a gaIe of wind you can't hear me? What did I say?
I have onIy this to say:
I don't know you. But by your Iook, if you continue drinking rum. . .
. . .the worId wiII soon be rid of a very dirty scoundreI.
I'II spIit you doubIe, you--
If you do not Iower that cutIass. . .
. . .I promise on my honor that you shaII hang at the next assizes.
And furthermore, sir. . .
. . .I'm not onIy a doctor,
I'm magistrate here.
And if I catch another breath of compIaint against you. . .
. . .if onIy for a piece of inciviIity Iike this,
I'II have you routed out of here.
Let that suffice?
I ask your patience, sir.
Just a squaII from a poor oId saiIor man. . .
. . .who took too much rum over his bowsprit.
I ask your pardon.
It was a nice party.
Don't worry, Mrs. Hawkins.
Don't worry.
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.
Praise be, Jim, the man was onIy fuII of taIk.
But bIess my souI, sir.
He certainIy can sing.
WeII, sonny.
Come here.
Come here, sonny. A IittIe cIoser.
Here.
-Now, is this here tabIe for my mate BiII?
-I don't know your mate BiII.
-But don't BiII Iive here?
-No. Nobody but the captain.
Oh, captain, it is?
TruIy, sir. I can--
Here comes my oId mate BiII now.
BIess his heart, to be sure.
Jim, Iad! The rum.
I'm becaImed again.
Come, BiII. You know me.
You know an oId shipmate, sureIy.
-BIack Dog.
-BIack Dog as ever was.
Come for to see his oId shipmate BiIIy.
-WeII, speak up.
-The porter, sonny. Porter.
WeII?
Now, BiII, I've been after you, now.
No, by the powers, and there's an end to it!
If it comes to swinging, swing one, swing aII.
I'II part your dirty wig!
Out, you bIubberous barnacIe.
Next time I'II sever your guIIet.
-Humor him, Jim. I'II be back.
-Where you going?
To Mr. DooIittIe's.
I'II get him to ride to Livesey's. . .
. . .so he and his constabIes can come and get that man out of here at once.
Rum, Jim. Rum.
Are you hurt?
I gotta get away from here, Jim.
I gotta sIip my hawsers.
Captain, you've been drinking too much.
Remember, the doctor said--
Doctors is aII swabs.
I've Iived on rum, I teII you.
It's been meat and drink to me, man and wife.
And I needs rum now, Jim.
-Mother Iocked up aII the rum. She said--
-I've got to have it, Jim.
I gotta have it.
Look. See how me fingers fidget?
I can't stop it, Jim.
I gotta have a drain of rum.
If I don't, I'II have the horrors.
And then I'II see FIint there behind you in the corner, just as pIain as print.
-WeII, is FIint the one-Iegged man?
-No, no, but he'II be there too.
Both of them wiII be there if you don't get me the rum.
Oh, go on, quick. Before they come in and sIips me the bIack spot.
-WeII, what's the bIack spot?
-It's a summons, Jim. A summons.
-Do they wanna kiII you?
-No, no, it's my sea chest they're after.
-What's in the sea chest?
-Pieces of eight.
PearIs as big as ostrich eggs.
AII the goId your heart can desire.
-And just for a IittIe noggin of rum, Jim.
-WouId a haIf a noggin do?
That's my matey.
-There we go, Iad.
-Wait here. I'II see.
WiII any kind friend inform a poor bIind man. . .
. . .who has Iost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defense. . .
. . .of his native country, EngIand, and God bIess King George. . .
. . .where in whatever part of this country he may now be.
You are at the AdmiraI Benbow,
BIack HiII Cove, sir.
I hear a voice.
A young voice.
WiII ye not take my hand, me kind young friend, and Iead me in?
CertainIy, sir.
I-- I--
Now, boy, take me to the captain.
-WeII, no, sir. Upon my word, I dare not.
-Take me straight or I'II break your arm.
Oh, it isn't for yourseIf, I mean.
-He has his cutIass. Another gentIeman--
-Come, now, march.
Yes, sir.
Hi, BiII. Your oId friend Pew.
Now, sit where you are, BiII.
GentIemanIy-Iike.
I can't see, but I can hear even a finger stirring.
Business is business.
Now, right up to him.
Aye, BiII.
Now, boy, take his hand and bring it cIose to mine.
There. That's done. That's done.
We'II do him yet!
Not a doubIoon.
I fought and bIed for it.
It's mine. Every farthing of it.
Mine!
I'm swing on Execution Dock. . . .
Jim, what's happened?
Why, he's dead.
''You have tiII 1 0 tonight. ''
BIack spot.
And they'II be back again, too.
-Who wiII be?
-The men that wanted to kiII the captain.
They wanna own the treasure in his chest upstairs.
-Let's get out of here.
-No. The captain owes us money.
We'II go get what he owes us.
They can't take that.
Jim, I'm so frightened.
I'II see no harm comes to you,
Mother.
I'm not afraid.
-We shouIdn't, Jim, they'II--
-Come on, Mother.
He says there's goId and siIver and pearIs as big as ostrich eggs.
We'II show them we're honest.
We'II take what is our due and not a farthing over.
Why, there's nothing there at aII.
There's some coins, though.
Open the door!
There's something.
I'II take what I have.
Up. Down with it!
In! In! In!
-BiII's dead.
-WeII, search him. . .
. . .some of you brass-brained Iubbers.
-Get the chest!
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Jim, I'm going to faint.
-No, Mother. Here.
Down with the door!
They've been here before. Someone's turned out the chest aIow and aIoft.
-Is it there?
-There's some money.
Not money, you squid.
FIint's fist. FIint's fist!
You beIow! Is it on BiII?
It's that whining IittIe sneaking brat.
I shouId have torn his arm off.
I shouId have put his eyes out!
Scatter and find him!
-We'II have to budge, mates.
-What?
Give him the whip.
Wait. Johnny. BIack Dog. WaIIace.
You wouIdn't Ieave oId Pew, wouId you, mates?
After them, boys.
Scour the thickets.
Jim!
Jim!
Mrs. Hawkins!
Here we are, Dr. Livesey.
Here we are.
-Oh, dearie me, dearie me.
-Who were they?
They wanted to kiII the captain.
But he dropped dead. . .
-. . .just Iike you said he wouId.
-WeII, what did they say?
WeII, they wanted something up in his chest upstairs.
FIint's fist or something, I don't know.
This is aII I took.
-Do you suppose that couId be anything?
-FIint's fist?
WeII, there's onIy one FIint.
I know that.
Why, it's onIy a map.
What are those funny red crosses there?
''BuIk of treasure. ''
BIess my. . . .
QuickIy. Into the coach, both of you.
-Vance, back here at once.
-WeII, where are we going, doctor?
To Squire TreIawney's.
Jim, my boy, you may have stumbIed. . .
. . .on the secret of the century.
-It's it. It's it, I teII you.
-Squire TreIawney, are you sure?
Sure? The actuaI chart of FIint's treasure.
The very isIand it's buried on.
Latitude. Longitude.
Jim, now, Iook here.
The very bIockhouse and stockade. . .
. . .where the infamous pirate heId off attack.
Squire, you get so confoundedIy overheated.
-What do you propose to do?
-Why, bIess me for a fat moIe, we'II--
We'II dig it up. Won't we, Jim?
Won't we, young Hawkins?
-I have my own shoveI, sir.
-ShoveI? ShoveI?
You'II have more than that.
You'II be the richest Iad in EngIand.
-In the whoIe worId.
-But, squire, a moment, now.
We'II need a ship.
-We'II need a crew.
-Tomorrow I Ieave for BristoI.
In two weeks from today,
I'II have the finest ship. . .
. . .and the choicest crew in EngIand.
Those cutthroats who attacked tonight have shown us they'II stop at nothing.
Others too, perhaps.
-We must proceed with absoIute secrecy.
-ExactIy, sir. ExactIy.
Sphinxes, aII. Do you hear that, Jim?
Sphinxes. Sphinxes, aII.
There's just one man I'm afraid of.
And who's that, sir?
Who's that? Name the dog.
You, sir. For you cannot hoId your tongue.
I? I? Why, doctor, bIast me, I--
Livesey, you're aIways in the right of it.
I'II be as siIent as a grave.
TaIIyho, Jim.
-How are you, my boy?
-It was a wondrous ride, sir.
-Where's our ship? We aII ready to saiI?
-Not for severaI days.
Dr. Livesey won't be here tiII Saturday.
-Hunter.
-Where's our ship, sir?
Ship? Ship?
There she Iies.
The good ship Hispaniola. And a tighter craft never saiIed the seven seas.
BIess my souI, sir.
AII right, now, give them another broadside. AII together.
One, two, th--
WeII, sonny, was you aiming to bIow the other Ieg off?
I don't think it's Ioaded.
WeII, you ought to be certain.
You be the captain of that ship, now, be'n't you?
-WeII, I--
-Come on, Jim, I'II show you to your--
Oh, he wanted to know if I was captain.
My captain is on his way from Dover.
Is there anything I can do?
No, thank ye, sir.
Just an oId saiIor hobbIed down. . .
. . .to get a smeII of the saIt air and cast these eyes on a trim craft. . .
. . .the Iikes of which you sure have got here.
Yes, I think I have a good eye for a ship.
Do you mind if I just come aboard, pIease?
Just for a speII.
Yes, you're--
You're weIcome, my man. Of course.
-Squire, sir.
-This way.
-Squire.
-This way, my friend. Any assistance?
WeII, weII. . . .
SiIver's the name.
Long John SiIver, they caIIs me.
-At your service, sir.
-Mr. SiIver, sir.
TreIawney's my name.
Squire TreIawney.
And this is our cabin boy, Jim.
Jim Hawkins.
Aye, matey. Smart as paint,
I'II warrant, huh?
Smart enough to see you've onIy one Ieg.
-Jim, boy.
-Yes, sir.
You're pretty smart, Jim.
So was that French gunner who touched off the baII. . .
-. . .that bIew that Ieg of mine overboard.
-You served in the navy, my man?
Aye, aye, sir.
Under AdmiraI Hawke, off Biscay.
-Under the immortaI Hawke?
-Aye, aye, sir.
Are there many one-Iegged seafaring men?
Why, the country's fuII of them, matey.
Just Iike storks on a roof.
TruIy, Mr. SiIver,
I'm sorry for my bIuntness.
Here, matey, you try this out.
Of course, you reaIize we can onIy sign on abIe-bodied men.
Oh, bIess me, sir. I didn't think when I came hobbIing down here. . .
. . .that you'd have any use for this timber Ieg and me.
Oh, no, no.
Now, you don't happen to have. . .
-. . .a cook onboard, do you?
-Cook? Why, no, not yet.
WeII, squire, I own a IittIe saiIor's tavern up here, and I can make saIt pork. . .
. . .taste just Iike roast pheasant.
Why, damn me, SiIver, if you want the berth, you're hereby made ship's cook.
SiIver, this port is fuII of the most unreIiabIe men.
Of the dozen or so that I signed on, eight have never come back.
Disappeared entireIy.
Oh, no.
Now, ain't that a shame.
I wonder what couId have happened to them.
ShiftIess idiots.
How many men might you be needing, squire?
I shouId Iike a round score of stout feIIows. . .
. . .in case of savages or buccaneers.
Oh, now, you be scared of pirates, huh?
WeII, SiIver, one never knows.
Not presuming, sir, but I know every abIe-bodied seafaring man. . .
. . .in the town of BristoI.
What say you that I fetch a fIock of them right down here to you?
Fetch them down.
Fetch them down, SiIver.
Why, strike me pink. We may get
SmoIIett's entire crew for him. . .
. . .and be abIe to saiI sooner, eh, Jim?
Aye. Aye, aye, sir.
With your eye for seamen, sir--
Here, matey.
There you are.
Oh, sir, mayn't I go with Mr. SiIver?
-WeII, Jim--
-Oh, no. No, no, no.
-There's a Iot to be done.
-But, sir, I want to go. PIease.
Oh, now, take the boy aIong, SiIver.
Take him aIong.
Show him the port, the ships.
Start his education for him.
-AII right.
Come on, matey. Come on.
That's the way it be, matey.
That's the way it be.
Then you sureIy wouId have been a captain if you hadn't Iost your Ieg.
Come on, Iads, come on.
Overboard with ye.
Oh, yes, I'd be captain.
I'd be captain, matey.
Here. HeIp yourseIf to a boatswain's pipe.
There you are. Here.
-Thank you.
-Let me show you how to bIow it.
-Oh, thank you, Mr. SiIver.
-Now you bIow it.
This is my IittIe inn, Jim, as I keep for saiIors as ain't appreciated.
Mateys, this is Jim Hawkins, ship's boy off the Hispaniola.
-Hi there.
-Aye, Iad.
You might be gIad to know that I've been made ship's cook.
Just friends, Jim. AII happy to know that oId John's gonna get his heaIth back.
They wouIdn't be needing any other hands, wouId they, John?
Them as is worthy, George.
I've just been yarning with the ship's owner.
Maybe I can convince him of your high quaIities, them as has them.
Oh, John.
That's the kind of joke, Long John.
Now, this here is Dandy Dawson.
A gentIeman, is Dandy.
Took to the sea for the Iove of it, he says.
WouIdn't harm a cockroach.
-Your servant, sonny.
-My pIeasure, Mr. Dawson.
And this is WiIIiam O'Brien.
Now, WiIIiam is a Iay reader in the church, is WiIIiam.
Lost his ear defending a woman.
A maid in Santiago that he had taken unto his heart, as it were.
-As it were, sonny.
-BIess my souI.
And, matey, this is IsraeI Hands.
UgIy IsraeI, we caIIs him, but as honest a man as you'II find in the room, Jim.
My pIeasure, Mr. Hands.
You come on a fair breeze,
Master Hawkins.
Where's John?
Stop him! Stop him!
Here, here. Jim, Jim, Jim.
Here, here. Who is he?
-It's BIack Dog, stop him.
-Who? BIack Dog? Who?
-What's he done?
-He was one of the buccaneers--
A buccaneer?
Not one of the pirates that
Squire TreIawney was teIIing us about?
Yes. He ought to be caught.
Now, have any of you ever seen the Iikes of him before?
-No, John.
-Ain't a friend of anybody in here, be he?
-No.
-No, John.
That's good.
That's good for aII of you.
If I ever catch any of you running aIongside the Iikes of that, why, I'II. . . .
A scurvy pirate in my inn.
You wait here, matey.
I'II run and get me sea bag and me bird.
And we'II go right up and teII the squire about this.
BIimey.
Pirates.
Those are pretty boots,
Master Hawkins.
Yes. My mother gave them to me before I Ieft.
And the same size our foot is.
AIike as two sister craft.
-Yes.
-I'm fond of pretty things, I am.
Yes.
-Oh, a parrot.
-Yes, matey.
If any of you wants a voyage, you go right down to the Hispaniola.
She's Iying in WoIf's Wharf.
Is it a boy or a girI parrot?
No, Jim, a girI, and usuaIIy a weII-mannered IittIe wench, too, says I.
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight.
Upon my word, she's a good taIker.
WeII, I wouIdn't say ''good,'' Jim, but powerfuI.
-What's her name?
-Captain FIint, I caIIs her.
Here, matey. You take her for a speII.
She Iikes you, Jim.
-But does she bite?
-No, no. Nary a nibbIe.
-I thought most parrots Iiked to bite.
-Not this one.
She's a Iovebird, matey.
You know, I've been thinking about the squire, matey.
-Yes, Mr. SiIver.
-You just caII me Long John.
-Yes, Long John.
-You know, I don't think. . .
. . .that we ought to teII him about that BIack Dog, now, do you?
-WeII, why not?
-WeII, the squire is very excitabIe.
-He's got a Iot on his mind, ain't he?
-WeII, yes.
WeII, now, we didn't catch BIack Dog, and there's nothing can be done. . .
-. . .about it, is there?
-WeII, I know, but--
WeII, now, there's AdmiraI Hawke.
I remember in a battIe off of Lisbon. . .
. . .why, a young Iieutenant teIIs him something without using his judgment. . .
. . .and do you know what happened?
Why, that admiraI feII in a fit. . .
. . .and pink foam oozed out of his ears for 42 days.
-Out of his--? AII that time?
-Yes, sirree. Just Iike two spigots. . .
. . .out of a barreI of aIe.
So just for the peace of the mind of the squire, why, we won't teII him, huh?
-I beIieve you're right, Long John.
-Matey, you're just smart as paint.
Why, you and me's gonna get aIong just fine in my gaIIey.
She did bite me.
Now, ain't that too bad.
WeII, matey, I guess she ain't used to you. She's a IittIe bit jeaIous, yeah.
I guess you don't want to Ieave oId Long John aIone, do you?
You. . . .
-Just a IittIe kiss, matey.
-Yes.
You cIam brain.
Is a crew aIways happy Iike that when they Ieave a port?
A good crew, Jim.
You know, if this voyage were a rainbow. . .
. . .and there was a pot of goId at the other end. . .
. . .they couIdn't be any happier.
-I'm gIad you Iike Dr. Livesey.
-Now, he's a pretty smart man, Jim.
He's not a saiIor, of course. But he can cut you open and sew you up again.
WeII, that sewing up must be pretty difficuIt.
-So is the cutting-up part.
-Yeah, weII, experience, Jim.
-I couIdn't do it.
-Oh, no. Neither couId I.
I'd swoon Iike a Iady of quaIity,
I wouId.
I guess I'm kind of sensitive-Iike.
To the squire, with my compIiments, Jim.
MuIIed wine, sir, with Long John's compIiments.
And SiIver forgets nothing. AIong with me, he's going to be certain. . .
. . .that this is a voyage that we shaII aII remember.
Long John's a wonderfuI man, sir.
Livesey, I give you--
Yes, yes, yes, yes?
Captain SmoIIett. AII weII, I trust.
Everything shipshape and seaworthy?
I may as weII speak pIain, gentIemen, at the risk of offense.
I don't Iike this voyage.
That's short and sweet.
-Pray expIain yourseIf, sir.
-I was signed on under seaIed orders. . .
. . .to saiI this ship wherever you'd bid me.
But I've arrived at the concIusion that every hand before the mast. . .
. . .knows more about the voyage than I do. I don't caII that fair. Do you?
-CertainIy not. What do the men know?
-That we're going after treasure.
Oh, mind you, I've heard it whispered on aII sides.
So has my officer, Mr. Arrow.
Livesey, I never uttered a word. It must have been either you or the boy here.
Oh, upon my word, sir, I never--
-So treasure it is, I see.
-You mean you don't trust the crew?
-Oh, some of them may be honest.
-British navaI heroes, aII of them.
Yes, when there's treasure in the hoIe, there's fire in the forecastIe.
So I'm taking certain precautions before we saiI.
And by your Ieave,
I'd ask you gentIemen to heIp me.
Lay forward on the quarterdeck.
-Two inches off those points, boatswain.
-Aye, aye, captain.
Captain, sir, what are we to make of this?
Why, me and Dick and AIIan--
I never had me knife broke afore captain.
It's a habit of mine on Iong voyages.
Sometimes hands get restIess.
Captain's right, Jim. Honest hands never object to having their knives tipped.
Boatswain, take the Iarboard watch.
Have the powder moved out of this forehoId back under the aft cabin.
Aye. Larboard watch.
Spring the hatch to the forehoId.
Captain, that means that
I'II have to move aII my provision.
I stored them aft especiaIIy so the vegetabIes wouIdn't get miIdewed.
My orders, man. You get to your gaIIey.
The hands wiII want their dinner.
Aye, aye, captain.
WeII, why do you men stand here?
Do as you're toId.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
-WeII?
-No sign of arms, sir.
You gentIemen are determined to make this cruise?
Like iron, sir.
-Weigh anchor, Mr. Arrow.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Now, here, matey.
What's to do?
The captain ordered us to move our bunks aft.
With the gentIemen, huh?
That's fine, Jim.
Oh, but I'd rather be forward with you.
WeII, how's this:
Supposing I ask the captain to change bunks with me.
That is, after we settIes down to saiI.
Here, you, ship's boy.
Get aIong with that.
I'II have no favorites aboard my ship.
If there's one honest man aboard, it's Captain SmoIIett.
Honest, if you wiII, but an intoIerabIe humbug.
I consider his conduct unmanIy, unsaiIorIy and downright un-EngIish.
BIess my souI. Why does the captain have to beIIow at me?
Captain's ways, Jim. Captain's ways.
Now, I wonder what couId have thrown the captain. . .
. . .into such a sudden squaII, matey.
Oh, weII, he wanted to--
I don't know.
I wish you were the captain of this ship, Long John.
I'II wager you couId handIe this boat better than he couId.
No, matey, the captain's a man of wisdom.
A Iot of brains.
Too bad an uneducated seamen can't open his head and see. . .
. . .just what he's got in it.
We're moving.
-WeII? WeII, Mr. Arrow?
-She's breaking cIear.
HauI the haIyards around. Set the jibs.
AII right. Set the topsaiIs.
Set the guards and royaIs.
BeIay that canary piping and tip us a man's stave.
Long John Iikes it.
And I Iikes rum, I does.
Lord, for a mouthfuI.
Is he serving rum aft?
The squire
Iikes his spirits of an evening.
And he Iikes VaIencian Iace around his throat, he does.
I'm partiaI to VaIencian Iace meseIf.
A tender spot, the throat.
Starboard a bit, matey. She's Iuffing.
She aImost got away from you that time.
I was Iooking at oId Nicodemus.
He foIIows us untiI he gets what he's after.
WeII, we've given him pIenty of potato peeIings.
That won't do for oId Nicodemus.
He's used to foIIowing sIave ships.
BIess me, the ocean's fuII of death.
But it's cured your Iungs. . .
-. . .hasn't it, Long John?
-Lungs, matey?
Yes, you've not coughed in a Iong time.
Yeah.
They're much better, more shipshape now.
What are you gonna do after this voyage?
Oh, I'II go back to that
IittIe oId roof, I reckon.
WeII, wouId you Iike to come and Iive with me?
-With you, matey?
-Yes.
You see, I'II have a Iot more money.
And, weII, I mean. . .
. . .there's onIy Mother and me.
And we've a nice room with a sea view. . .
. . .and sea air coming in from three sides.
And you couId aIways be--
No, no, matey.
I couIdn't.
I just. . . .
WeII, anyhow, you can come and visit us.
-We'II aIways be mates, won't we?
-Certain, we wiII.
-Certain, we wiII.
-No, matey, never spit to windward.
It'II ebb back on you.
AIways spit to the Ieeward.
It saiIs Iike a guII.
That's right, matey.
Look, Mr. Arrow's drunk again.
The captain's got the key to the grog, Jim.
-Where'd you get it?
-Just seasick.
-Sick? You're drunk.
-Why, sir, I haven't had a drink--
You're drunk. If it occurs again, you'II Iie in the brig.
-Where'd you get the rum?
-Why, sir, I haven't had a drink.
You get beIow before I cane you.
Here, you two.
SiIver, what are you doing here in the poop?
-Boatswain, take this wheeI.
-Aye, aye.
Captain, for the Iad's sake,
Mr. Arrow says--
To bIazes with Mr. Arrow.
You get forward, where you beIong.
Aye, aye, sir. Aye, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Arrow, sir.
How's for a cup of tea this morning?
A powerfuI Iover of tea you are, Mr. Arrow.
Yet I hopes I'm the one that serves you your Iast cup, sir.
-WeII?
-He ain't nowhere aft, sir.
He ain't in the forecastIe.
Poor Mr. Arrow.
And he stopped by me gaIIey onIy
Iast night, sir, for a breath of fresh air.
-StiII drunk, you say?
-His weakness was stiII upon him, sir.
OId Nicodemus isn't with us anymore.
Arrow must have Iurched overboard.
-That settIes it.
-I'm sorry, sir.
This wiII Ieave you short-handed, captain.
I'II have it entered in the Iog.
That's aII, men.
So why shouId I join?
Join up with what?
-But, Henry, Iookie--
-Astern of me, you IittIe runt.
I don't Iike you and others of your kind who've come aboard this ship.
WiIIiam. . .
. . .Henry doesn't seem happy aboard this ship.
You won't faII, Henry.
I be right here beIow you.
Oh, Iook. Is that another shark?
Oh, no. That's a porpoise.
That's a seaman's friend.
Look, there's a whoIe schooI of them.
-They wouIdn't eat anybody?
-Oh, no, matey.
Porpoises off the bow is a good sign.
A successfuI voyage, they say.
Why, they comes right out from port and escorts you right in.
I guess nobody knows where we're heading to. . .
. . .but the porpoises and the squire. . .
. . .I'II wager.
O'Brien, you were aIoft with him.
How'd it happen?
I don't know, sir.
A bit choked up I be, sir.
Henry was my friend. He swooned,
Iike, and feII Iike a pIummet.
Poor Henry. Leastwise he'II never know what struck him.
I'm thankfuI for that.
-Boatswain.
-Aye, sir.
-Prepare this body for buriaI.
-Prepare the body for buriaI.
Land ho! Land ho!
Where away?
Off the starboard bow!
Here, here, here.
Livesey, it's irreverent, but, damn me, come, sir.
Gray.
-Where?
-There it be, right under the cIoud bank!
-There she be.
-Where?
Look, right there, underneath that cIoud there.
BIess my souI.
BIess everybody's souI, matey.
It's it! Gadzooks, Livesey, if it isn't it!
The spot seems on the side of a hiII.
Rotten to the core.
Jim, run out to the appIe barreI and fetch us some good ones.
My pIeasure, sir.
Tomorrow, Livesey, tomorrow.
We'II Iand at dawn. . .
. . .and we'II have the doubIoons by sundown.
You're as smart as paint to join up,
Dick.
Aye, Dick Iistened the minute he heard there was treasure.
Don't you know the exact spot it's buried, now you're here?
FIint saw to that.
He Ieft his ship in the same pIace as we're anchored.
He took the treasure and six brave Iads and went ashore.
And when he came back, he came back aIone.
''Dead men don't bite nor teII no taIes,'' says he.
-WeII, I'm with you.
-How about the others?
Oh, you mean Gray and AIIan and--?
Oh, they be stupid souIs.
WeII, we'II taIk to them.
Now, Iookie, John, now we're here. . .
. . .how Iong are we gonna stand off and on Iike a bIessed bumboat?
When do we strike, John?
The Iast minute that I can manage, that's when.
We couId aII steer a course for home, but who's to set one?
Captain SmoIIett's a good navigator, he wiII.
They takes the map, gets the treasure, brings it aboard.
Captain SmoIIett takes us out into the trade winds. . .
. . .and then one day, they aII disappear overboard.
ResuIt of a very heavy storm at sea.
Like FIint ye be, John.
And the fIower of the fIock was FIint.
Hey, Dick, you're a nice Iad.
Get me an appIe out of that barreI to sweeten my pipe with, wiII you?
SiIver. SiIver. SiIver.
George Merry and the others is breaking out arms.
-Now, I toId them you was against it.
-Why, the fooIs.
Aye.
This moIasses is sweeter than SiIver said it'd be.
Ephraim, Iook-see if that box of prunes don't turn into powder and baII.
Who smuggIed these arms aboard this ship?
I did. I'II teII you when to break them out.
And that's the whoIe awfuI story, sir.
I wish I'd onIy dreamt it.
There's your Iighthearted crew for you.
Captain SmoIIett,
I own myseIf an utter ass.
I await your orders.
What beats me is how they've been heId in check so remarkabIy.
With your permission, captain, that's SiIver. A very remarkabIe man.
Yes, he'd Iook remarkabIy weII swinging from a yardarm, sir.
Easy, Jim.
Steady, boy.
You may have been the means of saving the Iot of us.
-Don't fIounder now.
-I'm not afraid.
Let's see, there are seven of us, incIuding young Hawkins here.
We were nine.
What's the first move?
SiIver's anxious to conceaI everything and hoId on.
I'm anxious to give him the chance.
So we'II send the crew ashore aIone.
It's my idea they'II be gIad to go.
Think they'II bark their shins on the treasure.
If they aII go, we up anchor and run with the ship.
If none go, we'II try and hoId this cabin, and God defend the right.
Redruth, you Ioad and distribute those muskets.
If onIy a few go ashore. . .
. . .you mark my word, SiIver wiII bring them back, as miId as Iambs.
-Come get your sidearms, gentIemen.
-Come on, Jim.
-You can spy out a Iot more for us.
-ExactIy, boy. They trust you.
Why, you and SiIver have been great friends.
I know. Why, we were mates, and we were gonna hunt goats together.
I even asked him to Iive with me.
He was the best friend I knew.
He gave me this.
I never knew anybody Iike him before.
But I know him now.
Certain, I do.
Ship's cook means Iuck ashore, mates.
Shove off, Iads.
SiIver has Ieft six men.
One of them might be honest.
Jim!
Who toId you to come aIong?
WeII, nobody. I just--
Hey, what?
Jim! Come here.
Wait for me, matey.
Jim? You hear me?
Jim! You come back here!
-Hunter, did Jim go ashore?
-Why, yes, sir.
-I thought it was part of the pIan, sir.
-GentIemen, this is bad business.
Now, come now, Tom.
You hauI to and think it over.
What are you teIIing me, John SiIver?
I'II not Iisten to the Iikes of that.
Now, be off. I don't want my rigging fouIed with mutiny.
-I'm an honest seaman, you hear?
-Yeah, I'II Iay to that. . .
. . .but, Tom, you're smart as paint.
Why, I knew that the minute
I cIapped eyes on you.
You ain't gonna Iet honesty stand in the way of being smart, are you?
-In heaven's name, what was that?
-That? I reckon that be AIIan.
So you kiIIed AIIan, have you?
WeII, rest his souI for a true seaman.
But kiII me if you can. I defies you.
That's two.
-Not Jim. They wouIdn't do--
-They'II do anything now.
Our onIy chance is to--
Stay beIow there, you men.
Get back in that hoId.
We've got to abandon ship.
Load the joIIyboat with aII the provisions and powder she'II carry.
You men get that boat in the water and get it Ioaded up.
-Why abandon ship?
-They've shown their hand.
When they come back, they'II board it.
They've kiIIed two men aIready.
We're next.
-Can't we hoId them off?
-With these swine at our backs?
If we tried to hoId that aft cabin, they'd burn it.
We've got to get to FIint's bIockhouse.
If that stockade is stiII standing, we can at Ieast make a fight of it.
Gray! Abraham Gray!
We're about to Ieave this ship.
I think you're an honest man.
If you wanna do your duty, come out and foIIow me.
-I'm with you, sir.
-Good man.
-Lay aft and heIp with the boat.
-Aye, sir.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
-Who are you?
-I'm Ben Gunn.
I'm poor oId Ben Gunn.
And I haven't spoken to a Christian these three years.
Three years?
-Were you shipwrecked?
-Nay, mate. Marooned.
Marooned three years agone.
And I Iived on oysters and berries and goats.
My heart's sore for Christian diet.
You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?
-No.
-''No,'' says you?
WeII, says I, many a Iong night
I dreamed of cheese.
It's toasted, mostIy.
Then I wake up again, and here I were.
WeII, if I ever get aboard again, you shaII have some.
WeII, now, what's to hinder you getting aboard now?
-Ain't oId FIint's ship, be it?
-Oh, no. FIint's dead.
But most of his hands are aboard her.
-Worse Iuck for us.
-Not a one-Iegged man?
You mean SiIver?
If you was sent by Long John,
I'm just the same as pork, and I know it.
But who are the rest you spoke about, matey?
WeII, there's Dr. Livesey and Squire TreIawney and the captain.
Squires and doctors, says you?
GentIemen born, says I.
That's different.
-Have they showed themseIves ashore?
-No.
LiveIy, doctor, IiveIy!
This is the Iast trip.
So after I was on FIint's ship,
I was on another ship.
That was three years back, and we spied this isIand.
''Lads,'' says I, ''there's where oId FIint's treasure's buried.
Let's Iand and find it. ''
TweIve days we hunts.
Every day they have worse words for me.
TiII one fine morning, aII hands got aboard.
''As for you, Benjamin Gunn,'' says they. . .
. . . ''you're so sure FIint's treasure's buried here. . .
. . .you can just stay and find it,'' says they.
''Now, was that a gentIemanIy thing to do,'' says you?
WeII, did you find it?
That's what your squires and doctors wouId Iike to know, says I.
''Yes,'' says you?
Snug in behind that rock, Jim, is my IittIe skin boat and paddIe. . .
. . .as I made it with my own hands.
You takes it, paddIes out, finds the squire and teIIs him. . .
. . .that Ben Gunn puts a heap sight more confidence. . .
. . .heap sight, mind you. . .
. . .in gentIemen born than gentIemen of fortune.
And then you nips him on the cheek
Iike I does you.
-Why?
-And then you teIIs him. . .
. . .that Ben Gunn wiII meet him on this hiII.
He's to come aIone with a white thing in his hand.
Upon my word,
I don't know what you're taIking about. . .
. . .but I'II teII the squire and doctor everything that you said.
They've be-- They've begun to fight.
Who's the best shot here?
Mr. TreIawney, out and away.
Pick me off one of those pirates, if you pIease, sir.
Move sharpIy, move sharpIy.
There. Hand me that baII.
That's a score snood!
Come on, my boys.
Stay to your oars. He's gone. We've got to beach this boat or she'II swamp.
Larboard. Larboard a IittIe.
We're swamped here, Iads.
HoId to your muskets.
Jim, thank heaven you're safe.
Up, Iads. Abandon that boat.
Stockade's our onIy chance.
It's them after-cabin bIokes!
They're making for the stockade.
Come on, Iads, head them off.
BeIay that. BeIay that, you swabs!
They'II shoot you down
Iike a Iot of guIIs.
Get to those gigs and get back to that ship.
Come on, Iads.
Shoot away, me Iads.
That's the way to waste powder.
The fIag spots the house for them.
Hadn't we better Iower it?
Lower the fIag?
Strike my coIors? Not I, sir.
We've IittIe provisions, but we've pIenty of powder and baII.
And by heaven, sir, this spot is EngIand.
Stockade, ahoy!
It's SiIver himseIf.
Eyes peeIed, this may be a trick.
Doctor, take charge of your watch.
Gray. Joyce.
What do you want with your fIag of truce?
Captain SiIver, sir, wants to come aboard to make terms.
Captain SiIver?
Who's he? I never heard of him.
Me, sir. Me.
The poor Iads have chosen me their captain since your desertion, sir.
What's your course, SiIver?
One minute's taIk with you.
I've no desire to taIk with you.
If you wanna come over here, come.
But if there's any treachery, it'II be on your side, and Lord heIp you.
That word from you is enough, sir.
I knows a gentIeman when I Iays eyes on him, you can Iay to that.
Joyce, take the doctor's pIace.
WeII, weII, weII.
Here we are aII together again, just Iike one big, happy famiIy.
Top of the morning to you, Jim.
I'd rather you'd sit down, SiIver.
Sit down and toss away that crutch if you're taIking to me.
Come, out with it, man.
What do you want?
We want the treasure.
We're gonna have it.
You want your Iives, that's yours.
WeII, you can have that if you give us FIint's chart.
I'd see you and the whoIe isIand bIown to bIazes first.
WeII, that-- That's an idea.
You give me the chart. . .
. . .and the moment the treasure's onboard, we'II take you with it.
And I'II give you my affidavit, upon my word and honor. . .
. . .that we'II set you down safe and sound at the first point of civiIization.
-That's on your word of honor.
-My affidavit, gentIemen.
And a handsomer one you couIdn't hope to Iook at.
That aII?
Every Iast word, by thunder.
Good. Now you hear me.
You come back here, one by one, unarmed. . .
. . .I'II guarantee to put you in irons, take you to EngIand and get you a fair triaI.
If you refuse, my name is AIexander SmoIIett. . .
. . .I've fIown my sovereign's coIors. . .
. . .and I'II see you aII to Davy Jones.
-That finaI?
-That's the Iast good word. . .
. . .you'II hear out of me, by heaven.
The next time we meet,
I'II put a buIIet in you.
-Do you meet my terms?
-No.
Then tumbIe out of here, me Iad.
Hand over hand, on the doubIe.
-Give me a hand up.
-I'd sooner touch carrion.
Who'II give me a hand up?
Before the hour's up,
I'II crush your bIockhouse. . .
. . .Iike it was a puncheon.
Them of you that dies wiII be Iucky.
Inside. CIear decks for action. Quarters, aII hands. They'II board us in a minute.
Now, get over that waII first, and don't use your muskets onIy as the Iast resort.
Morgan, you and yours to the Iarboard.
Job, you and yours to the starboard.
Now, by the powers, board them.
-Here they come, captain!
-Fire when they top the waII.
Another Ioad, Jim.
More Ioads, Hawkins. Come, boy.
-TreIawney, sir, you're a man.
-And you are a captain, sir.
At them, you dogfish! At them!
Outside, Iads. Outside and fight them in the open. CutIasses.
LiveIy, IiveIy, Iads.
My compIiments, Mr. Gray.
I've been Iooking for this.
Inside the house, Iads.
They've gone.
Fire from cover.
You crawIing squid.
You dogfish.
Don't mind me, sir. Watch them.
They've turned taiI for the moment.
My case, Jim.
Hunter and Joyce are dead, sir.
My case. Captain SmoIIett has a baII in his shouIder.
Oh, yes.
-God rest Hunter and Joyce.
-Amen.
-How many did they Iose?
-Seven.
They've had their rations for today.
WeII, that makes them nine against our five, gentIemen.
-Precious sight more confidence, eh?
-Yes, sir.
Here's Gray.
WeII? WeII, Gray?
They're aII camped down by the swamp.
I heard them.
They're Iike hornets, and SiIver's the maddest.
-It Iooks Iike tomorrow wiII finish us.
-What's in the wind?
They're buiIding rafts and fIoating the cannon in from the ship.
SiIver says he's going to bIow this bIockhouse to Iimbo.
That settIes it.
This Ben Gunn may be our Iast chance.
-You sure he's aII right in the head?
-WeII, he's rather siIIy, sir.
He toId me to nip the squire.
Nip me? How?
Begging your pardon, sir, Iike this.
-A Iunatic.
-No harm in finding out.
I have two hours before dawn.
I'II haunt that cIearing aII day.
It'II take them aII day to get that gun ashore.
If they turn up again,
God be with you, gentIemen.
-Godspeed, doctor.
-Good Iuck, doctor.
What's the doctor up to?
Oh, he thinks this Ben Gunn feIIow can heIp us.
How is beyond me.
Says he, says them, says I, says nothing.
We can't hoId out against cannons,
SmoIIett.
If we couId onIy get out and cut that ship adrift. . .
. . .that'd put an end to the cannon.
Cut off their base of suppIies.
We've no boat.
They're undoubtedIy watching the gigs.
I know, I know.
The doctor's right.
Our onIy chance is this Gunn feIIow.
-Keep near the house, Jim.
-Oh, yes, sir. It's just hot in here, sir.
Go on, make your pIay.
Make your pIay, I says!
Let's taIk.
SiIver's tangIed everything, I teII you.
Stow that drunken guff and make your pIay.
I be'n't drunk, and SiIver's a fooI.
You're the fooI, WiIIiam. And your face fair makes me biIious, it does.
FooI, biIious, eh?
We're adrift!
Adrift we be!
-Why, the anchor's gone!
-The hawser's parted!
Up with the jib, we'II swing into the reef.
Come aboard, Mr. Hands.
Much hurt?
Not the way poor dear WiIIiam be.
He weren't much of a saiIor, was WiIIiam.
Where might you come from?
I've come aboard to take possession of this ship, Mr. Hands. . .
. . .and you can regard me as captain untiI further notice.
WeII, now, Captain Hawkins. . .
. . .and who's to saiI her, without you get the hint from me?
-WeII, I--
-Now, Iook here. . .
. . .you give me me food and me drink. . .
. . .and a bit of a scarf or a handkerchief to bind up me wound with. . .
. . .and I'II show you how to saiI her.
Now, that's square aII round, ain't it?
Done, Mr. Hands.
Now, I can't have these coIors,
Mr. Hands. . .
. . .and by your Ieave, I'II strike them.
God save the king, and there's an end to Captain SiIver.
Now your wound, Mr. Hands.
I won't be forgetting about this,
Captain Hawkins.
And where might we be a-saiIing to?
Not back to the anchorage, you can be sure.
I've seen a map of this isIand.
-Do you know a cove caIIed North InIet?
-That I do.
It's a way north, on the other shore, it be.
WeII, that's where we're saiIing to.
I'm gonna run her high and dry on the beach. . .
. . .where nobody wiII be abIe to find her excepting honest peopIe.
Now, does that suit your curiosity,
Mr. Hands?
Why, Captain Hawkins, under my present unfortunate circumstances. . .
. . .to a pIum.
Aye, she's headed right now.
Right, captain.
Now Iash the wheeI and come forward for a cIose hauI on the jib.
Right.
It's been a tiresome voyage.
Why, you can stand.
And I can waIk too.
Perhaps you'II be needing a IittIe rest,
Captain Hawkins.
Wet powder, Captain Hawkins.
One more step, Mr. Hands, and I'II bIow your brains out.
Dead men don't bite, you know.
I reckon you and me wiII have to sign articIes, Jim.
I'd have had you but for that Iurch there.
I don't have much Iuck, not I.
It Iooks Iike I'II have to--
Dr. Livesey.
Dr. Livesey.
Pieces of eight.
WeII, if it ain't Jim Hawkins.
Dropped in sort of friendIy-Iike, huh?
What have you done with my friends?
Have you kiIIed them?
Oh, no. BIood spiIIing's aII over, Jim.
We signed a treaty, Jim.
Treaty? What kind of a treaty?
We give them their freedom out of here in return for haIf of their provisions.
But where did they go?
Oh, they just wandered away.
But if you're of mind to hunting them up, why, you just save your time, Jim. . .
. . .because they don't want to have nothing to do with you.
-You're Iying.
-No, Jim.
Why, the squire toId me right to my face that you was a deserter. . .
. . .and the doctor--
Oh, the doctor said that you was scared.
But they couIdn't think that.
They wouIdn't, not after--
NaturaIIy, I've aIways wanted you to join up with us and take your share.
-Now it Iooks Iike you'II have to.
-WeII, supposing I said no.
WeII, even if you do get the treasure. . .
. . .your ship's Iost, your men Iost, your whoIe business gone to wreck.
-You want to know who did it? It was I.
-You, Jim?
I was in the appIe barreI that night and heard you.
I cut the ship's hawser and kiIIed those two aboard her. . .
. . .and I took her where you'II never see her again, none of you.
KiII me if you want. The Iaugh's on my side. I'II die Iaughing at the Iot of you.
I beIieve you wouId, matey.
He faked the map from BiIIy Bones.
First and Iast we've been fouIed by him.
Avast there!
Be you captain here, Morgan?
-Tom's right.
-I'm the captain. . .
. . .I say what's right.
-I'II be hanged if I'II be hazed by you--
-You want to have it out with me?
That's better, George Merry.
Why, this boy's got more fight in him than the whoIe of you.
I Iike this boy. . .
. . .and if you understand
King George's EngIish. . .
. . .you better not Iay a hand on him.
WeII, you makes a hash of this cruise.
You're a boId man to say no to that.
And second, there's that boy.
He's earned a proper kiIIing.
In the third pIace, you wouIdn't Iet us attack them, and they on the march.
And fourth, you Iet the enemy out of this trap for nothing.
Oh, we get the stores and the powder. . .
. . .but we didn't get the map, did we?
And what do we want here except for the map, I'd Iike to know.
Quiet, by George!
-By thunder, it's it.
-Look: ''J.F. ''
FIint's initiaIs, with a score beIow and a cIove hitch.
Good oId SiIver!
Long John forever!
-Aye, SiIver!
-Hurrah for SiIver.
-Where'd you get the map?
-From Dr. Livesey, matey.
You couIdn't have gotten it unIess you kiIIed them.
No. That's part of the bargain, matey.
They gets their freedom and we gets the treasure.
WiII you join me in a bit of fresh air, matey?
There's so much stupidity in here that I can't breathe properIy.
Come on.
Guess that ends everything, now that you've got the map.
No, matey, you've stiII got a chance for a share.
No, I thank you. . .
. . .but I want you to know I'm gratefuI for you defending me.
Now I best go and hunt up my friends.
Goodbye.
Here, you better stay here for a speII.
Maybe the squire and the doctor have had a IittIe change of heart about you.
WeII, yes, but--
WeII, I might need you for a hostage.
Come on, sit down.
Hostage?
What do you need a hostage for?
You said you'd made a treaty.
WeII, treaties are onIy good untiI you find a chance to break them, matey.
That isn't very honorabIe.
It's smart, Jim.
You see what being honorabIe done for me?
-I had to show them the map, didn't I?
-Why were you keeping it from them?
There's too many of them to share the treasure with.
I just trying to figure a way to get rid of about haIf of them.
-Oh, I see. More murders.
-Oh, no, not murder.
Tactics.
I recaII taking a prize ship off of Peru once. . .
. . .and there was too many of them to share the treasure with. . .
. . .so FIint and me, we waits tiII aII hands are asIeep--
I don't wish to hear about it.
AII right, Jim.
WeII, what did you do with them?
FIint, he has a IittIe hammer, so we go around to aII the bunks. . .
. . .and we get in back of the men and then we--
Never mind.
I don't wish to hear about it.
Oh, aII right. It ain't important.
We onIy disposed of 1 3 men.
BIockhouse, ahoy.
What about it, SiIver?
Have you seen anything of Jim Hawkins?
-Why--
-Here I am, Dr. Livesey.
Thank heaven you're safe.
Let me taIk with him.
-No, by the powers. They'II puII a trick.
-PIease.
I'II be teIIing you for the Iast time,
George Merry, you drop his arm.
You give me your word of honor that you won't sIip your cabIe, Jim?
-I do.
-WeII, aII right, then.
We'II go down and have a yarn with the good doctor.
Dr. Livesey. Where did you aII go?
Why did you give up to them?
AII I can teII you now is that we're safe and sound.
But where did you go, Iad?
We searched everywhere.
Then you didn't think I deserted you, sir, and that I was scared?
Not a thought of it, Iad.
You said that they said I was scared, that they didn't want me.
WeII, matey, I thought it wouId be easier for you to join up that way.
-Oh, I didn't join, sir. TruIy, I didn't.
-But where did you go, Jim? What--?
I ran away to cut the ship's hawser,
Iike Captain SmoIIett wanted.
-I have her beached at North InIet, sir.
-North InIet, eh?
FIoat her and get her away from here.
Don't mind about me.
One budge of your hand, SiIver, and I fire. Quick, now. Quick, Jim.
Whip over the waII and run for it.
Oh, no, sir, I passed my word--
What's your word to these scoundreIs?
Quick, head for cover.
Sir, it was my word of honor, no matter whom it's to. I can't break it.
A Iad of honor. I counted on that, sir.
Jim, we won't Ieave this isIand without you, my word on that.
-You're going for the treasure now, eh?
-There where we be going.
WeII, mark you, SiIver:
When you find it, prepare for squaIIs.
And if Jim Hawkins here is so much as scratched. . .
. . .there'II be a baII between your eyes that nobody wiII bother to remove.
SquaIIs, eh, matey?
Am I off my course and sitting on a waterspout?
I'd aImost wager.
East-southeast. . .
-. . .two points east.
-I thought so.
Just as the chart says.
Why, that's one of the six brave Iads that FIint kiIIed. . .
. . .and Iaid their bones right in a Iine with the treasure.
There's five more of them ahead between us and the doubIoons.
Forward.
Darby McGraw! Darby McGraw!
Hark, ye.
Darby McGraw!
Darby McGraw!
That's him, I teII you. I've heard FIint caIIing Darby a hundred times.
Fetch aft the rum!
-Them was his Iast words aboveboard.
-That fixes it. I'm done.
Where might I hear that voice afore?
Nobody but us on this isIand knows them words. That's FIint's spirit.
Nothing but fIesh and bIood can taIk.
I was never afeard of FIint aIive, and I ain't scared to face him dead.
Come on, if you're coming.
There it be, mates, right in the cIearing there.
At it, mates. AII together.
-Why, there's nothing there at aII.
-Nothing, Jim.
We've been out-saiIed.
Here, Jim. Take that and stand by for troubIe.
Two guineas.
That's your 700,000 pounds, is it?
Why don't you dig a IittIe deeper, Iads.
Maybe you'II find radishes and turnips.
It's onIy an oId crippIe and a boy.
Let's settIe it.
Let them have it.
That'II hoId them for good and aII,
Gray.
Dr. Livesey, where did you come from?
-How did you happen--?
-We thought we'd be usefuI, Jim.
Look, sir, there's no treasure at aII.
We've come aII this way and everybody's been kiIIed for nothing.
Upon my word, sir,
I don't understand it.
WeII, don't try, Jim.
We'II go up to Ben Gunn's cave.
Maybe oId Ben's got another trick in his beard.
Beard? Cave? Upon my word, sir.
Thank ye kindIy, doctor, and quite a squaII it were.
By the powers. That voice.
-So it be you, Ben Gunn.
-How do you do, Mr. SiIver?
''Pretty weII, I thank you,'' says you.
Ben, Ben. To think as you've done me.
Gray, Iead the way with Jim.
March, SiIver.
You'II find as how you've been done by everybody.
-Have you had enough action, me Iad?
-No, thank you.
Keep going, keep going.
Why, bIess my souI. . . .
But-- What's--?
Upon my souI, how did it aII get here?
AII found and carried up here with my own hands, says I.
''Very thoughtfuI,'' says you?
And you can be fuII of cheese from now on, says I.
''Yes,'' says you?
Yes, says I.
Be it aII here, Ben Gunn?
You don't be hoIding out any on us, now, be you?
Mr. SiIver, says I.
-SiIver.
-Aye, aye, sir.
WeII, captain, I reports back to duty.
Me and Jim pIayed a powerfuI trick on them.
Now that we aII have the treasure, why, we're aII one big, happy famiIy.
We've got the treasure. We.
You're going back to stand triaI in
EngIand for mutiny and murder, my man.
Look, Jim. Rubies with fire in them.
Them's pretty harsh measures.
Pretty strong medicine, captain, for just a IittIe infraction of the ruIes.
Not nearIy so harsh or strong. . .
. . .as the rope I hope to see you hanging from at Execution Dock.
You're under arrest, SiIver.
-Hispaniola ahoy!
-Ahoy! Ahoy!
Don't Ieave me!
Don't Ieave me, I'II stand triaI!
We'II starve. We'II starve!
You had your chance, my friends.
We'II pick up a new crew at Jamaica.
Did the frigate answer our signaI?
She says, ''Come aboard,
Hampton commanding. ''
Good. Ben Gunn, stay aIert, now.
-We want no strange craft aIongside.
-Aye, sir.
A British ship of the Iine.
And tomorrow we may have the pIeasure of seeing SiIver. . .
. . .hanging to a yardarm.
WeII, Jim, do you come to take oId John aIoft for a breather?
No. I fetched you this instead.
Thank ye, matey, but I ain't much for spirits.
WeII, I thought you might Iike to start and drink a Iot of it.
-Why?
-WeII, doesn't everybody?
I mean, before they're hanged?
Hanged, matey?
They went over to a frigate that's Iying here.
They're not gonna wait tiII we get to EngIand.
Captain says we can hoId a navaI triaI tomorrow. . .
. . .and the squire says we can see you swinging from a yardarm.
That ain't just exactIy a breather, be it, Jim?
I'm sorry. TruIy, I am.
You say they aII went over?
No, they Ieft Ben Gunn on watch.
WeII, Jim. . .
. . .I guess you'II have to stand on deck and watch me swing.
I can't bear the thought of it.
Of you, of anybody.
Oh, we won't think about that, Jim.
You just dies, and that's that.
Quite often, though, not as quick as peopIe think, Jim.
-Why not?
-WeII. . .
. . .you take my case, as it were.
Now, there I'II be, way out on that yardarm.
Way out there with a rope around my neck.
And then they gives the orders to jump.
And when the average man jumps and reaches the end of that rope. . .
. . .snaps his head around, way around Iike that.
That's the average man. But of course, with me, it's a IittIe bit different.
With my one Ieg, you see,
I'd be kind of off-baIance.
And if they didn't get that noose just right. . .
. . .right there, why, I'd probabIy just. . .
. . .sIowIy strangIe and choke. . .
. . .just so I didn't swaIIow my tongue.
But that very rareIy happens, Jim, swaIIowing the tongue.
Stop, stop!
There. I don't know how you'II get by Ben Gunn. . .
-. . .but you're free from here, at Ieast.
-Oh, that's my matey.
If ever the day comes that I can heIp you, why, I--
I'm going to. . . .
What's the matter?
I guess you'II have to heIp me up, matey.
It's my rheumatism.
This pIace is damp in here.
No, no, no. I'm tickIish under my arm.
Thank ye, matey, thank ye.
Where's Ben Gunn?
Sitting up by the mizzenmast on guard.
You run aft and get me a pistoI.
-No, there'II be no bIood spiIIed in this.
-Oh, no, not for Ben Gunn.
Why, I can taIk with Ben, he and me are oId shipmates.
Just for protection on shore, you know.
It's a wiId pIace, Jamaica.
AII right.
But I toId you, you mustn't.
Now, ain't that terribIe?
He's Ieft to guard a ship, and there he Iays in a drunken stupor.
But he has a awfuI Iarge bump on his head.
WeII, he must have got that when he feII off of there. . .
. . .and hit the deck with his head.
Ain't that too bad.
WeII, matey. . . .
What oId Long John's got to teII you, he don't know how to say it.
I don't mean that you'II be forgiving me aII the bad things that I've done. . .
. . .but just for the mateys that we might have been.
You won't be a pirate anymore, wiII you?
You won't steaI?
No, sir. From now on. . .
. . .my course is going to be a straight, honest one, so heIp me.
Why, shiver my timbers, I--
WeII, now, I'm gIad that happened, matey.
That's just what I was trying to teII you, and I didn't know how.
I cut through the buIkhead, into where the treasure was. . .
. . .and took off just one sack of goId.
But you promised you wouIdn't.
WeII, I took that before I promised.
But it's off my conscience now. . .
. . .and the Lord knows my conscience won't stand any more, matey.
-WeII, here. You may need it.
-No, no, no, thanks.
But you have to buy food.
No, that's aII right, Jim.
I'II get aIong aII right.
I'II get aIong aII right.
WeII, matey. . . .
Here.
Feed her good.
And put her. . . .
You put her down beIow decks when any women around, huh?
I wiII. I promise I wiII.
Oh, beIay that. Don't do that.
Our courses wiII cross again sometime.
Lookie. Lookie, now.
Now, you didn't get aII of that bar siIver on that isIand, now, did you?
-No.
-WeII, who knows?
Maybe someday you'II have a great big ship.
Bigger than this one.
And you'II go down there and get the rest of that treasure, now, won't you?
And you might be needing a mate or a captain, huh?
-I guess so.
-AII right.
And who do you think wouId come hobbIing aIong for that berth. . .
. . .but oId Long John SiIver?
It'd be Honest Long John then.
And together, we'd go down there and dig up that treasure. . .
. . .and we'd scour aII the seas for aII the treasures on those isIands.
And we'd hunt goats.
And fight cannibaIs.
It's true, matey. Certain, we wiII.
Certain, we wiII.
SubRip:diamarg
But, Mommy, if we're in India... where are all the Indians?
They're not the same kind of Indians we have in America, darling.
What kind are they then?
These are the real Indians.
The ones back home were called Indians by mistake... because... when Christopher Columbus discovered
America, he thought it was India.
Then is Grandfather an Indian?
No, dear. He's an Englishman, a colonel in the army.
You know that.
Then why doesn't he live in England?
Because Queen Victoria transferred him here.
Will we live right in Grandfather's house?
Why, of course.
Then we won't have to worry anymore about the butcher and the grocer man?
No, darling.
Too bad we didn't get acquainted with Grandfather sooner.
Look, Mommy! Look!
There's an elephant!
Are we gonna ride the rest of the way on an elephant?
Oh, no, dear. I hope not.
Now, no more questions.
- Mrs. Williams?
- Yes.
This is Sergeant MacDuff of the 7 th Highlanders.
Mommy, why does he wear that funny little petticoat?
[Mrs. Williams]
Hush, dear.
Colonel Williams sent me to meet you, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Will you come this way, ma'am?
- There you are, missy.
- Oh, my baggage.
I have a trunk, two hat boxes-
Oh, and my mandolin.
Mandolin?
You better come with me to identify them, ma'am.
- Can I come too?
- No, dear. You wait here.
Excuse me, sir, please, mister... but is this where the circuses come from?
Yes, Missy Baba. Very hot day.
Uh-
Hey, mister! You dropped this!
- Priscilla?
- Where's Missy Baba?
- Yes.
- Priscilla!
- Priscilla!
- Hey, mister, you dropped your necklace.
Hey, wait a minute.
Our rifles- Lee-Metfords.
- Where's the thieving
Pathan you got 'em from?
- Khoda Khan.
- Khoda Khan?
- Caught him, Sergeant.
Huh. Wait until the colonel hears about this.
Take him to headquarters!
Better follow me, ma'am.
But what's a talisman used for,
Mommy?
It's a sort of sacred charm, dear.
Keep it, lassie, and hang it round your neck.
Then they say no harm can befall ya.
Will harm befall him- that man Khoda Khan- now that he hasn't got it anymore?
Oh, plenty of harm.
Don't fret your little heart.
That's a bad, bad character,
Khoda Khan.
Like the robbers in your fairy book.
Like
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves?
Yes. Now, no more questions,
Priscilla.
Are there many ladies living at the army post, Sergeant?
Not many ladies, ma'am. It's a difficult place to live, even for a soldier.
Mr. MacDuff, is a sergeant higher than a colonel?
Not this side of paradise.
Your grandfather's the commanding officer of the whole caboodle here.
Is my grandfather nice?
Well, uh...
I can't say that he's exactly nice... but, uh, he's a grand soldier...
[Clears Throat]
And I have every respect for him.
The-The men call him "Old Boots. "
- Old Boots?
- Why do they call him that?
Well, because he still sleeps in his boots like he used to do in the old days... when a man had to be ready for emergencies, day or night.
- Sergeant MacDuff-
- Priscilla!
Mommy, I just want to ask
Sergeant MacDuff one more question.
How do you keep the mosquitoes from biting your knees?
Mohammet Dihn!
Blasted parlor maid. Dihn!
Yes. Them women is here.
Fetch the luggage.
Is that Grandfather?
Mohammet Dihn! Luggage.
Come on! Luggage, luggage!
Grandfather?
Bagby.
Fetch the luggage.
Will you sit down, ma'am?
Look.
And I presume you have no recollection of riding across the parade grounds... like a blasted maniac, on a buffalo!
- Oh, was it a buffalo?
- Bah!
I've told you before, Brandes... your antic behavior, your irresponsible attitude... is conduct unbecoming an officer.
Sets a bad example to the other men.
This is not Mayfair or a tea party on the Thames.
You're on probation, Brandes.
All privileges revoked for 30 days.
Dismissed!
I'll, uh- I'll tell him you're here.
Hello.
Is my grandfather always mad like that?
Your grandfather?
Oh, not always.
Only when he's disobeyed or- or thinks he's disobeyed.
How do you do?
- The ladies are here, sir.
- Oh. Splendid.
Good man. Thank you.
Splendid.
Uh, I must see them, I suppose.
I must report, sir, that Khoda Khan was arrested in Raj Pore today, sir.
What? Khoda Khan himself?
Caught red-handed, sir, with a dozen of our rifles.
- Must've been hiding them in Raj Pore.
- Bah!
Of all the thieving Pathans, why must they arrest the biggest blackguard of the lot?
- It looks bad, sir.
- Bad?
Having Khoda Khan under lock and key is like holding a tiger by the tail.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Sorry! The whole hill country will be up in arms!
- I think- I think I'm gonna call you Coppy.
- Coppy?
- Priscilla!
- But why?
Because of your hair.
It's like a shiny, new copper penny.
I imagine it is pretty awful.
I like it! Don't you, Mommy?
Well, yes, of course.
Might I ask, are you here on a visit?
- No, we expect to stay.
- Oh.
Did you really ride the buffalo?
Why, yes, I- I-
- What was it like?
- Well, riding a buffalo is like-
Didn't you ever ride a buffalo?
- Come on. Climb on, and I'll show you how.
- Oh, no. I don't think she'd-
- Hold tight. Whee!
- Oh, Priscilla!
Mrs. Williams?
- Joyce, Father.
- Oh, y-yes, yes.
I, uh- I trust, uh-
I trust you had a comfortable journey.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Ah.
What the deuce is all this?
That must be Grandfather.
This is Priscilla.
- Oh.
- How do you do, Grandfather?
Well, h-h-how do you do? Uh-
Are you- Um-
This is most irregular, sir-
Oh, please don't scold Coppy again.
It wasn't Coppy's fault.
Really it wasn't.
Coppy? Who's Coppy?
Why, uh, Priscilla has a habit of nicknaming people.
- Oh.
- You have a nickname already, haven't you?
Priscilla!
Eh? Well-
Well, people usually address me as "Colonel. "
That's what I was going to call you- Colonel.
Oh, you were.
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, sir.
Oh, sit down. Sit down.
Coppy!
It was very kind of you to send for us.
Oh, my plain duty, madam.
Son's widow, helpless female.
I'd have sent for you years ago if I'd known you were destitute.
I didn't want anybody to know.
- But the landlady always found out-
- Hush, dear.
I did my best to work.
Very distressing. Very distressing.
Well, you're here now.
We do appreciate it.
Mommy almost cried when she got your letter, she was so glad.
Dear me. Dear me, dear me.
Uh, Bagby!
- Bagby!
- Sir?
Oh, there you are.
What the blazes are-
Show Mrs. Williams her quarters.
Yes, sir.
I trust, uh- I trust you'll accommodate yourself to the life we live here.
Army post, you know.
Routine, discipline, all that sort of thing.
- Oh, we will.
- Does that mean we get to sleep with our boots on?
- Oh, Priscilla!
- What? No, no, no. Of course not.
Huh. Boots.
Mommy.
I don't think Grandfather likes me very well.
Oh, of course he does, darling.
Perhaps he just doesn't understand little girls.
You see, the colonel's always been used to soldiers.
Mommy, I want to go home.
Oh, but, darling... this is our home.
Hey! Pump that water!
Turn out the guards! Who's it-
- Hey, Sergeant!
- Come out here!
- Let me go! Sergeant!
- You'll get your bath!
- I won't do it again!
- Give him a bath, Sergeant!
- Come on, Mott.
- Hey, Sergeant!
- Hello. What are you doing, bathing?
- Yes, sir!
Clean little chappie.
Eyes right!
Party, attention!
Present arms!
It's awfully hot for so early in the morning, isn't it?
Have you been standing here all night?
Can't you even shake your head yes or no?
Priscilla, you mustn't annoy the sentry.
I wasn't annoying him, Mommy.
The poor mars deaf and dumb.
Oh, no, dear. It's just that he's not allowed to talk on duty.
- Come here, darling.
- Oh.
Here. You must wear this whenever you go outdoors.
Oh, but I like it.
It's gonna make me feel like a soldier.
And remember all the things you've been told.
I know them all by heart.
Don't eat any fresh fruit.
Don't drink any water unless it's boiled.
Don't ever go outside the army gates.
Keep out of the sun, and- and-
And don't talk to sentries.
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.
Keep that on your head whenever you go out in the sun.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Sunstroke. Bad.
You're looking a bit off- off color, peaky.
Oh, I-I feel all right.
Oh, want more meat on your bones.
- Ought to eat more.
- Oh, we expect to.
Oh. Do you know how to ride?
Oh, yes. Oh, but I haven't ridden for ever so long.
Oh, here. Mohammet Dihn!
- Mohammet Dihn!
- Mohammet Dihn!
Mohammet Dihn!
- Mohammet Dihn!
- What are you shouting for like this?
- Where is that infernal parlor maid?
- Mohammet Dihn!
Dihn!
- Oh, there you are. What the-
- Yes, sir, Colonel, sahib.
Uh, get Mrs. Williams a good horse.
- She's going riding. You go with her.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Oh, uh, good morning.
- Your helmet, sir.
- What?
Oh. Ah. Thank you.
Colonel, sunstroke.
Ah, yes.
Yes, yes.
I think he's gonna like you, Mommy... even if he doesn't like me.
- Orders, sir, from the adjutant.
- Put them inside, on my desk.
Oh, sir. I do want to thank you for ordering me a new uniform.
[Colonel] Glad to do it, Mott.
Got a good record.
Always neat. Military appearance.
- Make a good soldier one day, won't you?
- Oh, thank you, sir!
Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Mott.
- Hello.
- Who are you?
- I'm Priscilla.
- Wait a minute, will you?
- Can't.
Orders, sir.
Thank you, Mott.
Orders, sir.
All right, Patrolman Mott.
Can't you answer just one question... if it is about military matters?
- Well, what is it?
- How can I get to be a soldier?
- You?
- Really! It's important.
Who ever heard of a little girl being a soldier?
Run along home and play with your dolls... and don't follow me anymore.
- Why, hello there.
- Oh, hello, Coppy.
How's your mother?
- She's a bit peaky.
- A bit peaky?
Yes. She's going riding to put some meat on her bones.
I'm going riding too.
I might meet her.
Coppy, I'm kind of worried.
You are? About what?
I've gotta be a soldier, and I don't know how to start.
Whoever put that idea into your head?
The colonel.
You see, the colonel's never had any little girls around.
All he understands is soldiers.
So I've decided to be one.
Then maybe he'll like me.
How do I start, Coppy?
Well, let's see.
MacDuff.
- Yes, sir.
- Good morning, Sergeant!
Good morning, lassie.
Good morning.
We've a brand-new rookie, Sergeant.
Please instruct Priscilla in the manual of arms, the queers regulations... and all matters appertaining thereto.
- But, sir, you- I mean-
- Why, yes, certainly. Carry on.
Company... left turn!
Quick!
About turn!
Quick!
March!
Mother!
Elsie, did you ever?
He's with that American.
She didn't lose much time getting her hands on him.
He didn't lose much time either.
I suppose she knows he's coming in to the title.
- Better get a move on.
- But, Mother!
He hasn't looked at me twice in all the time we've been here.
Well, your father didn't look at me at first... but here you are, Elsie.
You made a very good beginning.
Yes, but whoever heard of a soldier called Priscilla?
Aye, that's the point.
You couldn't take Private Priscilla very seriously, could you?
We'll have to find a new name for you.
I got it!
I've got it.
Wee Willie Winkie.
Wee Willie Winkie?
Was he a friend of yours?
Ah, he was a lad that ran through an old Scotch rhyme.
"Wee Willie Winkie ran through the town. "
Wee Willie Winkie ran through the town-
He ran through the-
Well, he was a lad that was always getting himself into difficulties.
Hmm. Sunstroke. Bad.
Was he a sergeant?
He probably would've been when he grew up.
Party, one, two, three!
Wee Willie Winkie.
- It does sound like a soldier, doesn't it?
- Aye.
Then I'd be Private Winkie!
Private Winkie it is!
A full-fledged soldier of the queen.
Wort it be a grand surprise for the colonel?
[Laughing]
It will indeed!
And beyond that sign lies all Asia-
Baghdad, Samarqand, the forbidden city of Lhasa... even the Great Wall of China.
This is the gateway to it all.
For thousands of years, the great caravans passing through... have been robbed by the wild Afridis and Pathans.
Up there in those hills is the stronghold of Khoda Khan.
Khoda Khan, the chief they arrested in Raj Pore.
Yes.
You see that pass?
With a hundred rifles, they could hold off our entire brigade.
I read about it in school... but you make it sound so thrilling and romantic.
Look, Corporal! I've got it at last.
- Got what?
- My new uniform.
- The kilt is all wool.
- Ha! Wool!
Wool from the cotton mills of Manchester.
Good lad.
Uh, Mr. Mott.
- Wort you spend the time of day with a man?
- Why-Why, yes, sir.
- And what you got there, laddie?
- My new uniform, sir.
Aye. But you're not daft enough to wear it like that, are you?
- Why, what's wrong with it, sir?
- What's wrong!
Why, it's got to be sterilized, lad.
- Sterilized?
- Aye, sure.
How many times have I told you that in
India, everything has to be sterilized?
The food you eat, the water you drink.
But- But not uniforms, sir.
Aye, laddie. It's a new order.
You don't want to get the black majoobies, do you?
- The black majoobies?
- Ah, it's a terrible disease.
Aye.
Here. I'll sterilize it meself.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Aye. Aye.
McTavish.
McLeish.
McAdoo. McNab.
Oh. Well, thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you so much.
It's about done.
- Aye.
- Oh, it's properly sterilized now.
- Aye.
- Why, it's shrunk!
- Aye, it shrunk.
- Aye. It shrunk.
- All but the buttons.
- All but the buttons.
Gentlemen, you did this deliberately!
- What?
- I did-
- Did you hear what he accused me of?
- Aye, I did that.
- Of deliberately doing it.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
He's a bad lad.
Aye. He's a bad lad.
Of deliberately doing it.
How does it look to you, Sergeant?
Very satisfactory.
Stand at attention, and I'll inspect you.
Keep your eyes to the front.
Take the smile off your face.
Aye. That's good.
I thought maybe I'd boiled it a little bit too much.
- Boiled it?
- Aye. Just a military requirement.
Take this. It'll give you a little bit more importance.
Oh, it's just elegant.
Hmm. I carved it meself.
- Thanks.
- Welcome.
Let's let the men take a squint at you.
Slope... arms!
Right, left. Turn!
Quick turn!
Military escort, halt!
Khoda Khan, sir.
Very good, Corporal.
Escort, about! Turn!
Quick! March!
This way, if you please.
Take this for me, will you, please?
- Mr. Khan!
- Hmm.
Mr. Khan. You dropped this.
Mr. Khan, here's your necklace.
May Allah bless and protect thee... for the rest of thy days.
- Thank you very much.
- Private Winkie!
Come here!
Get under there. There.
Aw, look what you've done now!
You got your kilt all dirty.
Come here. I've a good mind to-
But he was so glad to get back his necklace, Sergeant.
Well, it'll take more than a necklace to get him out of that jail.
But why are they gonna put him in jail?
Aw, because he's a black-hearted, thieving Pathan, that's why.
But he was such a nice gentleman.
Gentleman? Pooh!
Gentleman!
Why, he'd cut your head off as soon as look at you.
Ah-
Stay over here. Wait there, lassie.
Outside, you lazy scrubs!
Outside for a special drill!
What? Special drill?
- Whose orders?
- My orders.
- Your orders!
- Yeah. My orders!
He says his orders.
Lassie, about turn.
Donald.
That's me when I was a little baby.
Oh, I think you were just beautiful.
Party, attention!
Slope... arms!
One, two, three!
Present... arms!
One, two, three!
Snap into it, will you? Snap into it!
Take that smile off your face.
Slope... arms!
One, two!
Now, on the third syllable of the word "turn"... you smartly turn to the right... snapping your left heel against the right heel... with the toes at the angle of 45 degrees, approximately!
Now, smartly!
Right... turn!
Quick! March!
Left. Left. Left. Left.
About turn! One, two, three!
Left. Left. Left.
Left. Left. Left. Left.
Party, halt!
Right turn!
Quick, get in the dress there. You're always the last man to obey the word of command!
Always the last man!
Come out in dress here.
Order! Hey.
Are you grinnin' at me?
Order!
Arms! Two!
Stand at ease!
If you persist with this stubborn silence, Khoda Khan... we shall never get anywhere.
I tell you fror the last time... we are prepared to give you your immediate release... on condition that you guarantee there'll be no more stealing of rifles... no more raids and no more plundering.
Speak up, man!
This is your last chance for freedom.
I ask nothing... and I give nothing.
Take him away.
Escort, attention! Right turn!
Quick! March!
- Sergeant.
- Party, halt!
Sergeant, what's the meaning of this?
Drilling in the midday sun? Huh?
- Yes, sir, I-You see, sir-
- Huh?
- Yes, sir. L-I-
- What's the matter?
- Yes, sir. I-I-I-
- Can't you talk, man?
Yes, sir.
You see, sir, I-I-
- Come on with it!
- Very good, sir.
You see, sir,
I- I thought a little- thought a little drill wouldn't do them any harm, sir.
The men are getting a little rusty, sir.
With your permission, General.
Party, form fours!
What's this? What's this? What's this?
Private Winkie, sir.
- A new recruit.
- Yes, sir.
Fear God, honor the queen, shoot straight and keep clean.
Very funny.
Silence!
The rascals are pulling your leg, Colonel.
Fine soldier.
- Captain Bibberbeigh?
- Yes, sir.
I think a little polishing will remove that rustiness in quick time.
Sergeant MacDuff can take that party out... for three hours extra drill.
Yes, sir.
Private Winkie's excused.
Go in and get your nap.
Sergeant MacDuff, the colonel feels... that three hours extra drill would eliminate that, uh, rustiness.
Form two deep.
Pipe Major Sneath will play you around.
Quick. Mark time.
Forward!
I'm sorry that Priscilla and I-
This is a cantonment under military discipline... and I wish that you and the child would keep to your own quarters.
I will not have this cantonment turned into a confounded nursery!
Dismissed. I mean, that's all.
Good afternoon.
Mr. MacLeish...
I'm a very unpopular man.
Soon we'll be up to a hundred.
Then it'll be all done.
- Then what'll we do, Mommy?
- Start another one, I suppose.
Memsahib,
Major Mrs. MacMonachie.
MacMonachie?
MacMonachie.
Show them in.
We'd better put these away.
Mommy, do you want me to make myself scarce?
If you want to go out and play, go on.
- I thought perhaps we might, uh-
- I was just passing.
- I'm so glad you came.
- How are you, my dear?
Just fine, thank you.
Darling, go tell Mohammet Dihn to bring us some tea.
- Remember when you go out-
- Keep away from the soldiers. Hello.
Keep out of the sun.
Keep out of Mrs. Allardyce's petunias.
Oh! I just thought of a good name for her!
Mrs. Snoopysnoot.
Extraordinary.
Tea for memsahibs.
You always hear everything, don't you, Mohammet Dihn?
Mohammet Dihn hears very much, knows very much.
Knows something very sad about your friend.
My friend? Coppy?
The one who is in the prison.
You mean in jail.
Khoda Khan.
Why you not go see him?
Khoda Khan very sad, very lonely.
But when he sees you, his heart is glad.
Poor man.
I go now, make tea for memsahibs.
You kind little girl.
You go see Khoda Khan, huh?
- If you think it would make him happy.
- Very much happy.
All right. I will.
- You give him this.
- What is it?
Mohammet Dihn prayer.
Bring peace to his heart.
Here.
Like a brave soldier. Carry dispatch.
Big secret-just you, me.
Not let anybody know.
Oh, I won't.
I found it very difficult to adapt myself, too... when I first came from England.
- You know, I remember-
- The sound of those bugles almost drove me mad.
- The soldiers were-
- Does it affect you that way?
Yes.
But I- I've an idea it won't be so dull for you.
What do you mean?
Oh, Lieutenant Brandes asked me to tell you that he was going to be in Raj Pore... tomorrow afternoon... and if you happen to be there, just by chance, my dear-
Hello, Mr. Khan. How are you today?
Why do you come here?
I thought you might be lonesome.
You're a strange child.
Aren't you sorry now you made all that trouble about those old rifles?
I'm sorry only because
I lost the rifles... and my freedom as well.
But if you told the colonel you were sorry and promised to be good... then he'd let you out of jail.
You are sorry, aren't you?
No.
Then you'll have to stay here,
I suppose, until you are.
- Well, good-bye, Mr. Khan.
- Good-bye.
Oh.
I almost forgot.
Here. It's a prayer.
Mohammet Dihn said it would bring peace to your heart.
Mohammet Dihn speaks the truth.
Well, good-bye, Mr. Khan.
- Private Winkie, get on off of there!
- I was just leaving.
This way. Don't let me catch you here again. Go on here.
Sorry.
Now- Now the fundamental principles... of the noble art of self-defense...
- is, first of all, defense.
- Aye!
Now, balance your body... equal on each leg... bending your knees in the center.
Now, come on. Let's have it now.
Put your left hand in front of your face, your right hand up for defense.
Now, come on. A little spring.
Now, spring with me.
- More spring!
- Now spring with me.
Hey, hey, Donald! Donald!
Demonstrate the punch.
Aye. The punch. The punch.
Uh, Mr. MacTavish,
I'll give you an opportunity... to clout me on the nose... with your left hand.
You see, you never get back there.
- You see, the man has no footwork.
- You're right, Donald.
Now with the right hand this time.
Right hand. Again.
You see?
- The man left the whole of his right side exposed.
- Aye.
Mr. MacTavish...
I'm afraid you'll never make a boxer.
Mr. MacTavish, I'm talking to you.
Excuse me.
Can't we ever play together anymore?
No, lassie.
You've got your orders, and I've got my orders.
Can't you teach me the manly art of self-defense?
I'd like to... but if Old Man Boots was to catch us... it would be very bad indeed.
Just straighten your left hand up.
Put that up for your defense.
Oh, Mr. Mott!
Oh, they're just beautiful.
What are they?
- Puppies, stupid.
- I mean, what brand are they?
You mean breed.
They're pure mongrels.
Pure mongrels?
I wish I had one of them.
Well, you can't. They're mine.
So soft and cuddly.
I'd give anything for one.
Well, what would you give?
- Will you-Will you trade?
- Well, that depends.
- I'll give you my toys.
- What have you got?
Oh, heaps.
Three dolls- only one's got a broken leg.
And a cookstove. And a tea set.
No. Girls' things. Hmm.
I'd give you one if I had six or seven dogs, but I've only got the two.
Can't I hold him for just a little while?
No! You're liable to get too attached to him.
Oh, good morning, sir.
Hey, Mr. Sneath.
Will you steal me a wee dog like a good man?
- A dog, Donald?
- Aye.
Sit up. Come on. Sit up!
There he is!
But, Sergeant, they're mine!
Yours? You're laboring under a grave misapprehension, laddie.
They're his.
- His?
- He's the father!
You don't deny the right of a father to his own bairns, would you?
- But- But, Sergeant!
- Look how happy he is.
There's no question of his paternity.
But I got him from his mother.
From his mother!
- It's the father that counts.
- Aye.
It's the man that has the right to his own sons. You ought to know that!
- Aye!
- At your age.
But can't I even have one of them?
No. You have no right whatsoever, laddie.
But, please, sir.
Aye.
Well, if you'll swear by the ghost of the Black Douglas-
And the unburied dead of Culloden.
- And the whiskers of William Wallace.
- Yeah.
And, uh-
That you'll promise never to blow that bugle in my ear again... well, uh, I'll give you the wee one.
Oh, sir, I'll promise.
I'll promise anything!
Oh, thank you, sir!
Thank you so much!
Oh, man, you did a great deed.
Come on. Sit up. Sit up.
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, Mommy, look. There's that man eating swords again. Look.
Run over and watch him there, and give him these coppers.
- May I, Mommy?
- Of course, dear.
Thanks.
That's the most wonderfullest thing
I've ever seen.
There's that child.
No, I don't care for any of these.
Thank you. Elsie.
Just as I thought. Disgusting!
If you had a thimble full of brains, Elsie... you'd have landed him yourself.
- But, Mama, I did everything you told me.
- Oh, you are anemic.
But, Coppy,
I can't openly defy him.
Why not? You're not one of his soldiers to be ordered about... and forbidden to do this, that and the other.
You have the right to see whom you please, where you please and when you please.
- And there's no regulation-
- But, Coppy, you don't understand.
I'm under an obligation to him for sending for me- having us here.
And for making your life miserable,
I presume.
- He doesn't mean to.
- He does mean to.
He revels in it, the old porcupine.
You are coming to that dance with me... no matter what happens.
Coppy, I'd love to, but I don't see how I'm going to manage it.
Archie! Archie!
- No, Elsie, you are definitely anemic.
- But, Mother-
Well, your father's people were anemic.
Oh! Go away!
This nasty little dog!
Archie, you mustn't. You mustn't!
Shoo. Shoo.
Go away. Go away!
- You stop hitting Archie!
- Archie should leave things alone.
He bit me! He bit me!
He bit me.
Mama!
Well, you hit him first.
- Nothing of the kind.
- You did! I saw you.
The colonel shall hear about this.
I've been attacked.
Do you understand?
I've been attacked by a mad dog.
- Yes.
- Before I could fight him off... the creature charged at me.
- Yes.
- Well, do you understand?
- Yes.
- Oh, Elsie, come along.
Come, Mama.
Yes.
Let go! Let go! I won't let you!
- It's the colonel's orders.
- I don't care whose orders it is.
- You let go of Archie. Let go.
- What's all this?
That letter you sent out, ordering
Sergeant MacDuff to destroy all the dogs.
- I changed it.
- You did what?
Sergeant MacDuff, what's the meaning of this?
It wasn't his fault.
He told me you'd bite my head off.
But I don't care what you do.
It was the meanest thing
I ever heard of.
Ordering him to- to destroy all those puppies.
But don't you know there's a mad dog around?
Yes, sir. Archie here was awful mad at Mrs. Allardyce.
But if she'd smacked you on the ear with her parasol, you'd have bitten her too.
What? That ridiculous puppy?
Bagby, look at it.
Why, from what I heard, she said it was a huge beast.
Raving mad, foaming at the mouth.
Is that what old Snoopysnoot said?
What? Snoopysnoot? Snoopysnoot!
- Oh, Grandfather, you have the wonderfullest laugh.
- Have I?
It sounds just like an old horse that's got the whooping cough.
What? An old horse with a whooping cough.
Good evening, Private Bagby.
- Private Winkie.
- Good evening, Grandfather.
Come to say good night?
Yes, Grandfather.
Now, you want me to tell you a story, I suppose.
No, if you don't mind,
I'd rather ask you a few questions.
Oh, good Lord. Don't you ever get tired of asking questions?
Bagby, shut that noise out.
Yes, sir.
I'm very tired sometimes, but that's the only way I can find out things.
Well, fire ahead.
You know all the stories you've been telling me lately... about the time you held off that detachment of Afridis for a whole week single-handed?
Well, practically single-handed, yes.
And the time you marched those Ghurkas across the desert... clean through a blasted simoom.
I did not say "blasted. "
Well, dashed.
Yes, dashed. All right.
And the time you were almost captured... and laid 16 Waziris low with the butt of your bally rifle.
Yes. That got me me first ribbon.
Yes. Always fighting and marching and working.
Well, that's been my life.
Well, what I want to ask is... don't you ever have a good time- fun, I mean?
No time for fun.
But you have time now, haven't you?
You're not doing nothing but sitting here smoking your pipe.
What do you want me to do?
Stand on me head?
Someday maybe.
But, Grandfather... won't ya- can't you take Mommy to the dance tonight?
Oh, so that's it, is it? Oh.
Oh, please. Listen.
Doesn't that music make your feet just itch to dance?
My dancing days are over.
But Mommy's aren't.
Couldn't you take her and just sit around like a... uh, cauliflower?
Like a what? Uh-
A wallflower you mean. Not me.
Oh, please.
Make it a surprise.
I won't tell her a word.
- Oh, we'll see about it.
- Oh, Grandfather.
Now you pop off to bed.
You'd wheedle the whiskers off a thistle.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Bagby.
- Private Bagby!
Bagby!
Yes, sir.
- Get my Wellingtons.
- Your what, sir?
My Wellingtons, you idiot!
My Wellingtons!
Your Wellingtons?
Yes, my dress boots.
I'm going to dance.
Very well, sir. You know, you didn't take your nap this afternoon.
Joyce? Joyce?
- Do you dare?
- But, Coppy, you're on duty and you're not dressed.
- Oh, come on. Let's listen to the music.
- Well-
Joyce?
Joyce?
Coppy, this is so much nicer than being in that stuffy pavilion.
Mmm. It's so fragrant out here with the scent of the blossoms.
Yes. I shall think of it often when I'm back in England...
- tramping over the moors in the rain-
- England!
Yes. I'm resigning my commission.
You are? Oh, Coppy.
No, I just wanted to see the expression in your eyes.
Oh, Coppy, you're dreadful.
You do care, don't you?
No.
You idiot.
- Why, good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Beak.
- Ah, Mrs. MacMonachie.
- Why, Colonel.
- Have you brought your daughter-in-law?
- Yes. No. Um, is she here?
- I haven't seen her.
- Ah. Will you excuse me? I'll look for her.
Carry on. Carry on.
- Raiders are attacking the arsenal, sir.
- Gentlemen, your posts!
It's the arsenal!
On the double, boys.
On the double.
Give me your rifle, quick!
- Corporal.
- Sir.
Two casualties on our side, sir.
Guns and ammunition all intact.
- And the fire's under control.
- Good.
Ha! They thought they'd catch us napping, eh?
- Prisoner, sir. I think he's a chief.
- That's good.
But, uh, Khoda Khan escaped, sir.
- Escaped?
- Aye.
So that was their game.
They've tricked us.
Tell him we'll give him the lash. We'll give him the lash if he won't speak up.
No speak, Colonel.
- Take him out.
- Prisoner escort, attention, quick march!
Captain Stuart, one moment.
Mr. Brandes. Captain Stuart.
Telegraph Raj Pore. Have them relay the news to the other posts... that Khoda Khan has escaped.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Brandes, you're under arrest.
I, sir? For what?
For deserting your post, sir.
- Well, Bibberbeigh, what luck?
- They've scattered like geese, sir.
Ah! Well, you men had better get some sleep.
- There'll be nothing more to do tonight.
- Good night, sir.
Good night.
- Colonel?
- Well?
Why did you have
Coppy put under arrest?
- You know perfectly well why.
- Yes, perfectly.
Because you've had it in for him all along.
- He deserted his post.
- But the raid would have occurred just the same.
You're using that just as a pretext- uh, a technicality.
Doing everything you can to keep us-
I am not interested now in the affairs of your heart.
But I cannot have you interfering... with the discipline and obedience that I demand from my men.
Discipline? You've no heart.
All you've got inside of you is a book of army regulations!
I've had enough of it!
I'm sorry I ever came here, put myself under obligation to you!
Well, you won't have to put up with us any longer- not a single day longer!
- Why are you crying, Mommy?
- Priscilla.
What are you doing here?
Come on back to bed.
- Why are you making my mommy cry?
- Priscilla, hush.
Mommy was always happy till we came here, no matter what happened.
Priscilla, dear.
I don't care. You've no one to stick up for you here except me.
Making her so miserable... just when I was beginning to think you were nice and kind... and liked Mommy and me.
Oh. Come here, dear.
You don't understand... either of you.
Joyce, you've never seen a whole regiment wiped out... because of a blunder... or laxity in discipline.
You've never seen death all around you.
But I have.
Priscilla, up in those hills... there are thousands of savages all waiting for the chance... to sweep down the pass and ravage India.
Now... it's England's duty.
It's my duty, dear... to see that they don't.
As long as I live... that duty is going to be done.
The only women we want here are those who can understand that... and respect it.
Yes, perhaps you're right.
It might be better if you did go home.
Of course, I'll continue to provide for you. L-
I wish we could-
We can't get through to Raj Pore, sir.
The wires are cut.
- Eh? What's that?
- The wires are cut, sir.
We can't get through to Raj Pore.
Well, that means we're in for it.
Are we really going back to America, Mommy?
Yes, dear.
And leave Coppy and Sergeant MacDuff and Mr. Mott and everybody?
Yes, we're going back home.
That's where we belong.
- The patrol has just left for the hills.
- Oh? Who's in command?
- Lieutenant Brandes.
- Brandes? I thought he was under restrictions.
- You ordered all men released for service.
- Ah!
I can't imagine the patrol being in less competent hands.
However, it's done now.
Come on. Come on.
Well, what's this?
What's this? What's this?
We're leaving. We were just waiting to say good-bye to you.
That's impossible. You can't go now.
The roads aren't safe.
You'll have to wait.
Maybe for weeks.
Then we aren't going? We'll see
Coppy again and Sergeant MacDuff?
Please, Colonel, when is his trial going to be?
There's not going to be any trial.
He's off.
He's gone- gone on a dangerous mission.
The patrol has been ambushed, sir.
Cut out.
Ambushed? We're in for it now.
Are you all right, sir?
Did they hit you badly, sir?
Are you badly hurt, Donald?
Where did they hit you, man?
Oh, it's too bad. Those dirty dogs.
- Hello, Pipe Major-
- Not now, lassie.
Now look here, Winkie.
Keep away from these here rifles.
Corporal, what is-
Go on, Winkie. Come on. Beat it.
Hello, Sandy.
It's so sharp that a man can shave himself with it.
- Mr. Mott.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Mott.
- Hello.
Will you please tell me what they're all getting ready to shoot?
Why, Khoda Khan of course.
Who do you think?
Khoda Khan. Why?
Just because he ran away?
Why is everybody mad at Khoda Khan?
Ha! That's a good one, that is.
"Why is everybody mad at Khoda Khan?"
Why are all the horses getting new shoes?
So they can run fast enough to catch Khoda Khan?
Missy Winkie, I am busy.
Go away, please.
I know somebody who will tell me.
Psst.
Can you come here a minute?
I came to call on Sergeant MacDuff.
I'm "afeered" that you can't see the sergeant just now.
Is he asleep?
Aye.
Will you give him these as soon as he wakes up?
Aye.
Oh, they're beautiful.
I picked them in Mrs. Allardyce's garden.
She wasn't home.
No hope?
Oh, Grandfather, I do hope
Sergeant MacDuff's feeling better.
Yes, my dear, much better.
I'm awfully glad, because I gotta talk to him about something- a secret.
All right, my dear.
You can go in.
- But don't stay too long.
- I won't. Thank you.
- I'm glad she came.
- Yes, he's been asking for her.
I'll take them.
Private Winkie reporting, Sergeant.
Before we commence drill... you'll please repeat... the recruiter's motto.
Fear God, honor the queen, shoot straight and keep clean.
Very good, lassie.
Lassie... will ya... sing me... the song once more?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
So here's a hand, my trusty friend
And "gies" us a hand of thine
We'll meet again some other day
For the days of auld lang syne
Shh. He's asleep.
Don't you cry.
He isn't going to transfer you.
Sergeant MacDuff.
They're taking you away from me.
I want you to come back and play with me some more.
Orderly?
- Orderly!
- It's only me.
What are you doing out of bed at this time of night?
I couldn't go to sleep.
I've been awfully worried about something.
- I had to come and ask you about it.
- Oh?
Well, what is it?
Why did Sergeant MacDuff have to- have to-
I liked him. I liked him so much.
Sergeant MacDuff died as a brave soldier should- for his queen.
But the queen didn't want him to die.
Did she?
- Why, no, of course not.
- Then why-
Now, you're only a little child.
You can't understand.
No, I guess I don't.
That's why I came to you.
Why is everybody so mad at Khoda Khan?
Why do they all want to shoot him?
We're not mad at Khoda Khan.
England wants to be friends with all of her people.
But if we don't shoot Khoda Khan,
Khoda Khan will shoot us.
Now come here.
Let me try and explain to you.
It's our job to keep the big pass open... so that trade can flow through it.
- You know what trade is?
- Yes, Grandfather.
Good. And bring peace and prosperity to everybody, even to Khoda Khan.
Couldrt you go and explain all that to him?
It wouldn't be much use.
For thousands ofr years, these Pathans have lived by plundering.
They don't seem to realize they'd live much better... if they planted crops and traded and became civilized.
But, Grandfather, I don't want anybody more to get killed.
Neither do I, my child.
Neither do I.
But don't worry your little head about that anymore tonight.
- Oh, I wish something could be done.
- You run along to bed!
- Good night, Grandfather.
- Good night, little child.
- Oh, you frightened me.
- What are you doing here?
I'm going to see Khoda Khan.
Please help me get my pony.
And be very quiet.
Khoda Khan live far away.
I take you to him.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure I'd have had an awful lot of trouble finding his house.
Come, come.
Priscilla!
- Father, Priscilla, she's gone.
- Gone?
- Her bed hasn't been slept in.
- Eh?
- Bagby. Bagby, go to the stable.
See if the child's there.
- Yes, sir.
Then Mohammet Dihn stole his can't and clothes.
The sentries, thinking he was the regular driver, allowed the car to leave the post.
Then-Then Mohammet Dihn took her away.
We found her footprints in the dust beside the tracks of the can't.
The whole thing's clear to me now.
Mohammet Dihn's the spy.
- And he's taking her there.
- To Khoda Khan?
Sound the assembly!
Well, Mr. Khan certainly does have a lot of steps in his house.
- Oh. Only 400 or 500 more. Come on.
- Oh, my goodness.
Khoda Khan. Khoda Khan.
Khoda Khan.
Mohammet Dihn.
It's a lovely morning, isn't it?
Khoda Khan!
- Khoda Khan.
- Speak, Mohammet Dihn.
- I bring you great treasure.
- Rifles?
No. Colonel Sahib's little granddaughter.
- You brought her here?
- Yes. Outside.
Then they will come- colonel, officers, everybody.
Through the pass, up the steps.
A whole regiment wiped out.
Allah be praised.
Mohammet Dihn, where are you?
Mohammet Dihn?
- How do you do, Mr. Khan?
- Welcome, little one.
How do you do, Mr. Khan?
They will not harm you, my chieftains.
I didn't know it was so far.
It's a good thing I didn't come by myself, like I was going to.
- You were coming here by yourself?
- Yes.
I decided last night
I had to see you, Mr. Khan.
Right away, to talk to you.
If you don't mind, may I sit down?
I'm awful tired.
And awful hungry too.
Now eat, and we will talk.
It's about the war.
- I want to ask you a question.
- Ask.
You don't want a lot of your friends to be killed, do you?
No.
Then don't you think it's awful silly to be mad all the time and fighting... when you don't have to?
Why don't you ask your grandfather that question?
I did, and he said he didn't want the war, but you wanted it.
Then you would stop the war, wouldn't you, if I could make you understand?
What is there to understand?
What my grandfather told me.
That the queen wants to protect all her people and make them happy and rich and all that.
It's no laughing matter!
It's true, all of it!
All you have to do is to sit down and talk it over with my grandfather.
Please don't laugh at me, Mr. Khan.
Allah himself would laugh, my child.
Then you want to fight.
And I thought you were good.
You had such nice eyes.
And I gave you back your necklace.
Please, Mr. Khan.
Please don't have any war.
Please don't.
Between your people and mine, little one... there can be only war.
Then you want war! You want to fight!
You want to kill people!
Like you did my friend.
Poor Sergeant MacDuff.
Oh, I hate you. I hate you!
I think you're all very, very mean!
"We will attack immediately unless the child is released. "
Khoda Khan!
Well, Mr. Dihn.
Zig, forward.
"Come thou.
Long has Khoda Khan waited... to meet the British in battle on these steps. "
- Shall we attack, sir?
- Impossible.
Shouldn't have a chance.
They'd wipe us all out.
What are you going to do, sir?
If I don't come back with Winkie, you'll have to fight your way through.
Stuart, you'll attack left flank.
- Yes, sir.
- Brandes.
- You know what you have to do.
- Yes, sir.
Stand fast!
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Oh, Grandfather.
Here's one for MacDuff.
Please don't let them shoot my grandfather.
You will not be harmed.
Khoda Khan, I-
I owe you a debt of gratitude.
You owe a debt of gratitude to her, your granddaughter.
Incredible.
Most extraordinary.
Now we shall talk,
Colonel Williams, but quietly.
Battalion, attention!
Parades will retire... in fours from the right!
Battalion, arms up!
Arms up!
- Private Winkie.
- Yes, Private Mott?
I'm forced to admit that you make a very good soldier.
You-Well, you covered yourself with glory... and distinction on the field of battle.
Thank you, Private Mott.
Sergeant MacDuff, he would have been very proud of you.
Thank you, Private Mott.
That means more to me than all the other things put together.
Thank you.
Battalion, eyes left!
(gunshots)
(speaks Chinese)
(shouting)
(speaks Chinese)
(shouting)
As magistrate of this village, it is my duty to warn you that Hi Chung, the bandit, is on his way here.
Thank you for telling us.
- Shall I pack?
- No.
- But, Alfred...
- We are missionaries.
Providence sent us here to fight evil, not flee from it.
Will you allow me to take little Ching-Ching out of harm's way?
Barbara will remain here with us.
And I wish you would not refer to her as Ching-Ching.
Mr Kruikshank, you may do as you wish with your own life.
But Ching... Barbara is a child.
- Her honourable parents were my friends.
- I know.
But they did not desert their post when danger threatened.
No.
And they were killed.
Please. Alfred!
I have decided.
(they speak Chinese)
(uproar)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- Greetings, most honourable Sun Lo.
- Greetings, Ching-Ching.
May your shadow lengthen always in the sun of happiness.
Thank you.
May the bird of prosperity continue to nest in your rooftop.
(they speak Chinese)
I hope you will always remember the sayings of our wise men.
I will, because you taught them to me.
It was a great privilege to instruct the daughter of my friends, your honourable father and mother.
Friendship is a tree of shelter from the rains of trouble.
Yes.
And so it is my wish to protect you from trouble that may be here very soon.
- What kind of trouble?
- Bad men.
- There will be looting and destruction.
- Oh...
I have arranged for Chang to take you to the home of my honourable brother in Shanghai.
Shanghai? Oh, that's wonderful.
I remember all the beautiful stories my daddy used to tell me about it.
But I'm afraid I'll have to ask
Mr Kruikshank for his permission.
You know, he's awfully strict with me.
Don't worry about that, my little one.
I will satisfactorily explain for you.
You will?
Oh, thank you, most honourable Sun Lo.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Goodbye, my little friend.
I shall see you very soon.
And until then, the memory of you will bloom like a flower in the garden of my heart.
(ship's whistle)
(speaks Chinese)
(they speak Chinese)
(shouts in Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(barks)
Shh!
I know you're hungry, but stop barking.
Your stomach has no ears.
(speaks Chinese)
Where's Chang?
Chang! Oh, Chang!
Chang!
I guess he went for breakfast.
And that's what you want, isn't it?
Hey! Hey!
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
As Sun Lo says, one cannot eat gold, but one cannot eat without it.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Come on, Mr Wu, we'll find something to eat.
Oh, no, no. Is there anyone here who speaks English? I want to buy something.
(speaks Chinese)
Look, I want to buy a dragon's head.
Head. Though I can't imagine why.
(merchant speaks Chinese)
No, me likee buy one piecee dragon head.
Catch on?
(speaks Chinese)
Lookee.
Dragon. Head. See?
Isn't there anyone who understands English?
I can, mister.
Hello. You wouldn't by any chance be able to understand Chinese too, would you?
(speaks Chinese)
Oh...
- Can you ask him how much he wants for it?
- (speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- He says $15.
No, no.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- What's wrong now?
- He's trying to cheat you.
The price is $5. Look.
Oh, yes, so it is.
- (speaks Chinese)
(mimics Chinese)
Huh?
As Sun Lo says, all things have two prices, one for the foolish.
You know, you look so young but you talk so old. How come?
In a junk from Sanchow.
No, I meant how come... Oh, well.
I guess we don't talk the same language in more ways than one.
You've been so nice, I'll buy you something.
What shall it be?
Come on, what would you like?
A soup bone.
- A what?
- A soup bone.
For my dog. He's awful hungry.
You'll never get ahead in life if you go around asking for bones.
Do you think your mother would mind if you joined us in a soup bone?
- I haven't gotten a mother.
- Oh.
- Well, your father, or family?
- I haven't any family.
- I haven't even got Chang.
- Who's Chang?
He brought me from Sanchow, and then he ran away with my money.
Oh, a lady in distress?
Just my specialty. Well, you come along with us to lunch then you can tell me all about it.
- Thank you, but I couldn't eat any lunch.
- Why not?
Cos I haven't had breakfast yet.
(honks horn)
Menu, please.
There's the menu up there.
No, it's all Greek to me.
No, it's Chinese.
Well, go ahead and order for Mr Wu and your Uncle Tommy.
All right.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Those things cost a lot.
Have you got enough money?
- Too much, so I'm told.
- (speaks Chinese)
I told him to make it two soup bones.
- Do you live here, Uncle Tommy?
- No, just here today. My boat sails tonight.
- Going home?
- No, just travelling around.
- No place in particular.
- You must be an orphan too.
Unfortunately not.
You mean you don't like your father and mother?
Well, it seems we get along better with a couple of thousand miles between us.
So, there they are and here I am, and everybody's happy.
More or less.
There you are, Mr Wu.
You certainly are extravagant, Ching-Ching.
Thank you.
What's "stravagant" mean, Uncle Tommy?
- That means you're pretty nice.
- Then I think you're stravagant too.
I promised to pick up some friends here but first I'll get you straightened out.
- Will you wait?
- Sun Lo says patience is like wealth.
Many talk about it, but few possess it.
- Sun Lo is quite a conversationalist.
- I don't know, but he talks a lot.
Aw!
(honks horn)
Ah, hail to the chief!
- Hello, Tommy.
- Kay.
- Tommy, darling.
- Dora.
- Colonel, have you been drinking?
- A mere aperitif, a soupçon of brandy.
- Yes, master?
- Bring us flagons of your rarest nectar.
And bring it with the speed of an antelope.
We perish, we swoon.
Yes, master. Black Label all round?
- Right.
- Not for me.
Do these old ears hear right?
Could it be Thomas, the pride of the Randalls, has refused a drink?
- Right.
- My boy, are you ill?
Uh-uh. In fact, Colonel,
I am still under the spell of a good woman.
(barks)
Mr Wu! Mr Wu!
You come back here this very minute.
Mr Wu!
Mr Wu! Mr Wu!
Now, where did you find this good woman?
I didn't know there were any more left.
Come on outside. I'll introduce you, but remember, I saw her first.
- What about us? Can't we go too?
- Sure, come on. It'll do you good.
Now, none of your Rabelaisian lip.
This girl has led a very sheltered life.
As if I ever said anything that would raise a faint blush on the cheek of...
Looks like she stood you up.
Nice goings-on, I must say.
Here she is. Hey.
Why don't you go all the way in?
Maybe she's down the cellar.
- That's funny.
- At least she left you the car.
- Sometimes they don't even do that.
- She must be someplace.
- Come on, let's go on in.
- When you find her, yell. We'll be at the bar.
Now, let her go, lad. Better fish in the sea.
You know, this reminds me of an experience I had in Kansas City.
I met this little lady.
Very fine and very demure.
Mr Wu, you oughta be ashamed.
(thunder)
(Tommy hums a tune)
- Just like a lullaby, eh, Colonel?
- Hmm.
A Chinese lullaby.
- Oh, there you are, Mr Randall, sir.
- Little Lord Fauntleroy.
- Go away. I don't want to talk to you.
- Your car. We must get it aboard.
- The captain's holding up the boat, sir.
- All on account of you, Atkins.
You're a heedless, thoughtless butterfly.
No consideration for others. No...
I thought so.
Colonel, this man's been drinking.
Please, sir, we must hurry, sir. Now, please.
See here.
- Steady, Atkins, steady.
- Now, Tommy, we mustn't be too harsh.
I used to have an uncle that drank.
It's a madness in the blood.
Please, sir, I can walk for myself, sir.
You'll be all right, but you mustn't shout like that.
We'll get you back on the boat safe and sound.
It's quite all right.
I can really get there myself.
- It's quite all right.
- Get in there.
- Get in, Tommy, and hold him there.
- No, sir, I'm not drunk, I assure you.
- Are you sober enough to drive?
- Look out.
(ship's whistle)
(Mr Wu yaps)
- I could've sworn I heard something.
- I bet it's a stowaway.
Who's there?
If there's anybody down here, let's find them.
(rattling)
You search behind the sacks. You too.
You check behind the cars.
Steward! Steward!
We found a stowaway in the hold, but he got away.
Very well.
Jenkins, spread a general alarm.
We seem to have stowaways aboard.
At once, sir.
(bell)
Come in.
- Right there, steward.
- Yes, missy.
You were told to watch for stowaways before we sailed.
- I did, sir.
- Well, if we find one, you'll be out of a job.
You can come back for these things in half an hour, steward.
And, mind you, he was only 12.
Richard spoke up as quick as a flash, and what do you think he said, Susan?
"You may use my bicycle, Geraldine."
"I love sport, but I love the principles of manhood more."
- I'm afraid I'm boring you.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Hope.
- Richard told me that story three times.
- I tell it not because Richard is my son.
I tell it merely because I believe that you, as his future wife, might be interested.
Apparently, I was mistaken.
Mark my words, Susan, the time will come when you'll be just as devoted to Richard...
But I am devoted to him. Only...
Only you have a peculiar way of demonstrating your devotion.
Who is in there?
(Mr Wu growls)
(screams)
Help! Help!
- Help!
- What happened?
- There's a man in there.
- What's up?
- The stowaway.
- He growled at me.
- (door rattles)
- Come out.
Come out of there or I'll blow you out.
Well, I'll be...
- Aw, the poor little thing. We frightened her.
- She's frightened us.
- What's your name?
- In Chinese or American?
What?
In American it's Barbara Stewart.
But in Chinese it's Ching-Ching.
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.
Hiding? Why?
The man said I was a stowaway.
- Well, are you?
- I... I guess so. What's a stowaway?
- How did you ever get on this ship, anyway?
- I don't know.
I never heard of such a thing in all my life.
I can't understand it.
- Neither can I.
- Oh, please don't be impertinent.
- She didn't mean to be. Did you, dear?
- No, I didn't.
- What's all this?
- We found the stowaway.
- Where is he?
- It's a she, sir.
It's this child here.
What, you?
I guess so.
She doesn't even know how she got aboard.
- What am I gonna do with you, young lady?
- I'll look after her.
- Susan, don't be absurd.
- She won't be any trouble.
Fine, Miss Parker. Bring her to my quarters after lunch and we'll have a talk with her.
- You can return to your post now, Jenkins.
- Aye, sir.
See you later, stowaway.
(Mr Wu barks)
Captain, can we put this... animal in the kennel?
Oh!
They'll take good care of it.
You'll give it a big dinner.
Why, of course I will. Here.
Don't you worry, I'll take care of it.
It isn't an it, sir. It's a him.
I've never had a dress as nice as this.
The ship's store is full of them.
All you have to do is get this one dirty and we'll find you another one.
Do you think your mother will like me better now I look beautiful?
- Mrs Hope isn't my mother.
- No?
Well, that is, not yet.
- See?
- Yes, I see.
It's time we turned the child over to the captain.
After all, charity has its limits.
What did you mean when you said you didn't know how you got on this ship? You must.
But I don't, honestly.
The last thing I remember is that I fell asleep in Uncle Tommy's car.
Uncle Tommy? Tommy who?
Randall. Tommy Randall.
- (both) Tommy Randall!
- Mm-hm.
- Your Uncle Tommy is on board this ship.
- He is?
I might've known you were his niece.
- He's a problem child too.
- I'll take you to him, Ching-Ching.
Considering his reputation, you'd better turn her over to the captain.
Very well.
Well, it seems odd, but with Mr Randall, nothing surprises me.
- Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning, Atkins.
- We'd like to see Mr Randall.
- Mr Randall's still asleep, sir.
- Well, it's about time he got up.
- Mr Randall never gets up until two, sir.
(laughs) I'm sorry, but this is important, so you'd better call him.
- Mr Randall will be very annoyed, sir.
- Tell him a pretty lady wants to see him.
- If I know Tommy Randall, that'll get him up.
- Yes, I'm afraid it will, sir.
Won't you be seated, please?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- (snoring)
- I beg your pardon, sir!
- Go away, Fauntleroy.
Sorry, but there's a young lady to see you.
- Huh?
- There's a young lady to see you.
I think it's rather urgent.
- That's bad.
- She's very beautiful, sir.
Oh?
- Well, that's not so bad.
- She has a child with her, sir.
Oh, that is bad.
She also has the captain with her.
He insists on seeing you.
That's very bad.
Here you are, sir.
- What's that?
- Your chequebook, sir.
Oh...
I don't know what your game is, but I never saw you before.
I have witnesses to my whereabouts for the past 27 years.
- Mr Randall!
- Uncle Tommy!
Ching-Ching. What on earth...? Please forgive me, I'm awfully sorry. I'm not quite awake yet.
What are you doing on this boat?
I'm a stowaway, but I didn't mean to be.
- I waited in your automobile like you said.
- But I went out and looked for you.
Well, you see, after a while, it started to rain.
So I got in the back and pulled the cover down.
Oh, you poor kid.
- I'm awfully sorry.
- But I like being a stowaway, Uncle Tommy.
This is Susan Parker, my best friend.
He's my best friend too.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Don't you think she's stravagant?
- She's magnificent.
Oh, thank you.
- Charming little niece you have, Mr Randall.
- I'm not really his niece, Susan.
- He's just pretending.
- Why...?
- But aren't you the child's uncle?
- No.
We met in Shanghai yesterday.
- Oh, Ching-Ching, you told me...
- I didn't mean to tell a fib.
I was just scared, and I knew
Uncle Tommy would help me.
You know I will. I'm sorry, Captain, to have caused all this trouble.
I'll accept full responsibility.
I'll be only too glad to pay for her passage.
I'll have to communicate with her people.
From what she tells me, she has no people.
In fact, she has all the earmarks of a waif.
But she must have someone.
She didn't live in China by herself.
I lived with the Kruikshanks, but they won't care if I stay here.
- Who are the Kruikshanks, dear?
- They're missionaries in Sanchow.
Make a note of that name and get in touch through the American consul.
In the meantime, I'll look after her.
This time, I really mean it.
I'm inclined to think that Miss Parker is better company for the child.
Oh, he's good company too.
Maybe you had better go with Miss Parker.
You can call her Susan like I do.
Can't he, Susan?
Well, I suppose so.
I'll see you later, then, Ching-Ching.
- And I hope you too... Susan.
- Thank you.
- Bye, Uncle Tommy.
- Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
Uncle Tom's cabin.
(ship's whistle)
- I can't understand it, Atkins.
- Understand what, sir?
Your gross neglect of your duties.
The most beautiful girl in the world is on this ship and you never told me.
Begging your pardon, sir, but you don't usually have to be told.
- Who is she?
- You met her mother on Monday night.
- I did?
- Unhappily, sir.
I...
- I didn't...?
- You did, sir.
Let me have it, Atkins.
You emptied a bottle of champagne in her lap, sir.
Oh!
(meows)
(mimics a train whistle)
Ding, ding!
(mimics train whistle)
Ding, ding!
Now, now, come, come, Atkins.
You can do better than that.
- You're not even trying.
- I thought it was rather good, sir.
Perhaps you can suggest something else that I can imitate better.
Well, let me see...
- Sleepy?
- Mm-hm.
It's not ten yet. You'll never be popular if you fold up right after dinner.
Begging your pardon, sir, but I think it's customary for little children to retire rather early.
- Is it really your bedtime, Ching-Ching?
- Mm-hm.
- Atkins, prepare Miss Ching-Ching for bed.
- Me, sir?
- I don't know anything about children.
- I've never...
- There's a first time for everything.
- Sir, this is very awkward.
Please, Uncle Tommy, I can undress myself.
I always do.
- I wish I could say the same.
- Oh, thank you, Miss.
Now, you close your eyes. Come on.
Atkins, a lullaby for Miss Ching-Ching.
- A what, sir?
- A lullaby.
- You know, a vocal Mickey Finn.
- Sir, I can't sing a lullaby.
You're one of the most untalented persons
I've ever met.
Can't do imitations or sing.
How do you ever entertain your friends?
- I can try, sir.
- Very well, start crooning.
One, two...

- Should I...?
- I didn't make any noise.
- Is she asleep?
- (Ching-Ching) Not yet.
Well, you should be.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Aunt Susan.
- Good night, Uncle Tommy.
- Good night, darling.
Good night, Atkins.
You've been very sweet to that child,
Mr Randall. Good night.
Good night? Don't tell me you go to bed at ten o'clock too?
- Let me see you to your room.
- It's only four doors away.
Still, let me come with you.
You might meet somebody.
Footpads, thugs, people like that.
It's not safe for a girl to be out alone after dark on the ocean.
(jazz band plays) it's beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
And so peaceful.
- Peaceful too.
- It's really almost overdone, isn't it?
The moonlight on the water.
Stars in the sky. Music.
They might've at least had the decency to omit the music.
Yes, everything is here. Including you.
And me. Taken all together, that spells romance.
- Not for me.
- Why not?
- Romance takes two.
- We've got two here.
Yes, but not the right two.
You see, I'm engaged.
Oh...
To Richard Hope. Mrs Hope's son, you know.
- Yes, I know.
- He's meeting the boat at Bangkok.
- We're to be married there.
- Mm-hm? And why Bangkok?
He lives there. He's with an exporting firm.
- Exporting what?
- Oh, ivory, apes, peacocks.
Things like that. He came out here two years ago and he's worked very hard.
You mean to say you've been engaged for two years and you haven't seen him in that time?
You Latins.
What a hot-blooded race you are!
Well, Richard isn't quite like that. We've known each other since we were children.
Oh, I see.
Well, I must say, it all sounds very lyrical.
- Well, it may not be exactly lyrical.
- Me, of course, I've never been engaged.
Not definitely, that is.
- But if I were to be...
- Not definitely is right.
I seem to recall something in the newspapers:
"Millionaire playboy sued for breach of promise."
I practically won that suit.
She only got $10,000.
Poor kid, she'd been counting on 50.
That's more than Richard earns in a year.
Well, you shouldn't be so narrow. After all,
I can't help it if I've been cursed with wealth.
Not that it isn't as nice a curse as anyone could ask for.
- Have you ever worked for a living?
- Pardon?
You know, work. Like most people do.
Oh, work. Of course. I've worked my father...
Why should I take a job from someone else who needs it?
I sacrifice myself for the good of humanity. See?
Do you know what you are?
No, but I have a feeling that you're about to tell me.
A museum piece. You should be in a glass case in an exhibit of the terrible Twenties, cocktail shaker in your hand, shirt scrawled with chorus girls' telephone numbers, and a label - "Playboy BC, Before The Crash, former habitat, Broadway, now extinct."
Hmm...
You don't exactly pull your punches, do you?
Would it please you to know that I feel about that high and six years old?
You should grow up.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Oh, but forget it. At least forget it for now.
I'm really not a reformer always.
Anyway, beneath that too-smooth exterior beats a heart of gold... I think.
- It's beating awfully fast right now.
- Good night.
(band plays "Goodnight, My Love")
Sing it. There's no one here but you and me.
And the China Sea.
But it's a love song.
Just doesn't fit the occasion.
That's all right. It's only a popular song.
You didn't write the words.
- I'm warning you, if you don't sing it, I will.
- You win.

- Good night.
- Good night.
- And... good night to you too.
- Good night!
- See that this is sent at once.
- Yes, ma'am.
- How long do we have here, Purser?
- 12 hours, ma'am.
- This would be nice for the little girl.
- Do you like that?
- I think it's beautiful.
- All right, we'll take that too.
When I get big, I'm gonna marry a man like you. Aren't you, Aunt Susan?
When you grow up, there aren't gonna be any men like him.
He's a dying race, the last of the easy spenders.
Nice jade bracelet for the lady?
- No, thank you.
- What a perfect piece of jade.
- It is lovely.
- It's all yours. Wrap it up.
- Send to the steamer with the rest.
- Tommy, I couldn't accept it.
It's all right, Susan. Mr and Mrs Kruikshank are good people, and they take anything.
Shoes, potatoes, rice.
See, if Ching-Ching says it's all right.
- Not even for Ching-Ching.
- All right, but you're being very silly.
- You know where we're going now?
- Back to the boat.
- She guessed wrong again, didn't she?
- You said it.
- We're going to a show.
- What kind of a show?
Beautiful, magnificent.
- (knocking)
- Come in.
- Mother!
- Richard!
Why did you cable me?
Where's Susan? She's not ill, is she?
- Go up on deck and call Miss Parker.
- Yes, missy.
No, Richard, she's not ill.
Why did you send for me?
After all, it's not exactly an inexpensive trip.
I know, I know, dear, but frankly the situation was more than I could cope with alone.
What do you mean?
Heavens, Mother, don't build it up.
Did you ever hear of a man named Tommy Randall?
Randall? The name's familiar.
- It should be. It's in the papers enough.
- What about him?
- He's on this boat.
- What's that got to do with Susan?
Richard, your mother's a woman of the world. You realise that. She can tell...
She can tell what?
Heavens, Mother, we're not getting anyplace.
I'm not saying there's been anything wrong between them.
So that's it?
I've flown here just to be told Susan is having a harmless little ship flirtation?
It may be harmless, and it may not.
After all, Richard,
Susan's a very headstrong young woman.
Well, marriage will straighten her out.
Wait till she hears
I'm the new assistant manager in Bangkok.
JB - JB Bradley, I mean - gave me the promotion as a wedding present.
Just think. My boy, an assistant manager.
Why, Richard, it seems only yesterday that you were in curls.
- It shows what hard work, determination...
- (knocking)
Come in.
Too sorry. Missy has go shoreside.
- Ashore?
- Yes, missy.
Thank you.
You see? She's with Randall now.
I knew I was right in cabling you.
A mother's instinct never fails.
- What do you think I should do?
- The first thing to do is to find her.
Oh, look at the Chinese Major Bowes.
That fellow, Li Ze Mon, used to run a chop suey place on Broadway.

He wants the people in the audience to get up and give imitations.
He says there's a prize of ten yuan.
Where are you going?
If I get the ten yuan, then I can buy some presents for you and Uncle Tommy.
- Ching-Ching, no.
- Nothing can happen to her.
Oh, hello. What can I do for you?
- You can give me the ten yuan.
- (laughter)
You likee sing song?
- I will if you don't start ringing that bell.

Hello, Uncle Tommy! Hello, Aunt Susan!
- I think you'd better put her down.
- There might be more water farther on.
- Richard! This is a surprise.
- Yes, it's a surprise for me too.
Uh... Tommy, Mr Randall, this is Mr Hope.
- And Miss Ching-Ching Stewart.
- Pleased to meet you.
- I never thought I'd see you here.
- Evidently not.
- Weren't you surprised to see him?
- Hardly. I sent for him.
That's marvellous. I love surprises, and usually I never get them.
- Susan, I think your friends will excuse you.
- I'm sorry, I must be going now.
- You be awfully careful of her.
- She'll be perfectly all right.
- I'm sorry if I...
- That's all right.
- Goodbye, Ching-Ching.
- Goodbye.
- You like her, don't you?
- You could call it that.
I don't see how anybody can have fun with that Mr Hope.
I'm afraid fun isn't everything, Ching-Ching.
Come on, we're gonna have a good time.
(speaks Chinese)
- Me likee see one nice piecee tapestry.
- This way, please.
- Something like this, sir?
- No.
Let me see that one.
(yapping)
Not bad.
You precious little puppy, you.
You're just like Waify.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, Ching-Ching.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- He went that way.
- Thank you.
(speaks Chinese)
Well, Ching-Ching, where do we go from here?
Hey, where'd you come from?
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!
(speaks Chinese)
No, wait, this is all a mistake.
Listen, be reasonable. Ching-Ching!
There you are, darling.
(speaks Chinese)
- (speaks Chinese)
- Wait. Give me a chance to explain.
If wishes were keys, there would be no prisoners.
So Sun Lo says.
Good old Sun Lo, always brightening the corner where he isn't.
It's been fun up till now, but it won't be so funny if we miss that boat.
- I bet the captain will be pretty mad.
- He must be, or he'd be here by now.
We've gotta get out of here.
Well, I guess we'll have to start a rebellion.
Pardon me, would any of you gentlemen be interested in getting out of this jail?
I said...
You speak to them.
Tell them about the great outside world.
- Ask them how they'd like to see it again.
- (speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Well?
They're not interested.
They said they like it here.
That's absurd. Where's their spirit?
Ask them are they men or are they mice?
(they speak Chinese)
Mice.
Well, at last. Sorry to have caused you so much trouble, Captain.
Now, see here, son.
I've been very lenient with you.
But there's a limit. You've overstepped it.
If it weren't for this child, I wouldn't be here.
- Any news about Ching-Ching?
- Sorry, Miss, not a word.
- Oh, I never should've left her with him.
- He should've known better.
It's an outrage taking a child of that age out at night in a city like Hong Kong.
Anything could happen.

To the rescue. I need you.
(Kay) We missed you, darling.
(Dora) Did you have a good time?
We missed not having you, darling.
- Tommy, it was such a nice party.
- Glad you enjoyed yourselves.
Just the little matter of a taxi fare.
Could I impose on you?
- Don't tell me you've been robbed again.
- Clean.
Miss Parker. Miss Parker, here they come.
That's better. Nine and two are eleven.
Four and three are seven.
He thought I didn't have a card.
I trumped his ace.
You should've seen his face.
It was on a redouble.
- They play a lot of bridge in Bangkok?
- Great bridge town. We call it Bridgeport.
No, you're really very fortunate moving in with our crowd.
Only last week, JB - JB Bradley, I mean - said to me, "Dick." Calls me Dick for short.
"Dick," he said, "I'm sure your missis is gonna like it here."
- You will, too.
- Oh, I know I will.
- Tell her about the house, Richard.
- Oh, yes.
But just a description of it doesn't do it justice.
It's absolutely modern. Lots of closet space.
Fully equipped laundry. It's just as good as any house in any American suburb.
And roomy too. I'll show you.
Kinda L-shaped. This is our room.
- This is Mother's room.
- Mother's?
Yes. Oh, you think she'd be better off in this one?
(Richard) I don't know.
Bangkok is a very romantic city, isn't it?
There are a lot of old temples and places like that.
But our colony doesn't bother with the native things.
We have our own little set. Fine, substantial people too. Bridge and tennis.
You know your opponents so well you can tell in advance every move.
That must be interesting.
Susan! Susan!
You should be taking a nap, you and your dolls.
My dolls are. Shut your eyes and put out your hand. I've something for you.
All right.
- Susan, where did that come from?
- From Uncle Tommy.
- Who?
- Oh, I asked him not to buy it.
Look, he bought me a bracelet too.
- Why, that must've cost...
- $300. I saw the price tag.
$300! He wouldn't have spent that much money if he hadn't felt you were interested.
- I don't think I need even answer that.
- You'll return it, won't you?
Certainly. I asked Mr Randall not to buy it.
- Shall I give back my bracelet too?
- No, darling.
I think you'd better go take your nap or play or something.
Still, he might've meant it as a wedding present.
In that case, there'd be no harm in your keeping it. After all, it did cost quite a lot.
Will my boy be happy with a girl like that?
- Sometimes I wonder.
- Of course I will, Mother.
- Why do you say that?
- Oh, I don't know.
Susan seems to have changed a great deal lately.
She'll be all right after we're married.
Well, it's about time we declared an armistice.
I've been feeling terrible, Susan.
Well, this is very pretty, but of course I can't accept it.
Take back your baubles, is that it?
Listen, Susan, I think you're being very...
What, is it as bad as all that?
- Don't you like me any more?
- That has nothing to do with it.
Well, don't you?
Not particularly.
You know what you tell me: keep your chin up and you'll be OK.
As Sun Lo says, the strongest man in the world cannot lift a heavy heart.
Why is your heart heavy?
You know that Mr Hope?
Well, Susan's gonna marry him.
Oh!
She'll have Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
It'll serve her right, too.
Oh, no! Nobody should have
Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
Ah, there you are, young lady.
Just the one I want to see.
I've got a surprise for you.
As an unshelled nut is to a squirrel, so is a surprise to him who receives it.
Righto, darling.
You're going to leave the ship at Singapore.
What?
Now, you run down below and start to get ready.
Then when you come back,
I'll tell you the rest.
You oughta give Uncle Tommy a surprise too, just to make him feel better.
- He's been in the... What was it?
- Doghouse.
With Mr Wu.
- What is all this?
- I just received this wireless from Shanghai.
- What will the consul do with her?
- There's a home for girls in Shanghai.
- He'll probably see she's placed in it.
- Home for girls?
You mean grey uniforms and pigtails?
Ching-Ching was never meant for that.
I know, old man, but I'm afraid it's about all that can be done for her.
Captain, wait a minute.
This may sound crazy, but why can't I adopt her?
Now, see here, son.
You're a bachelor. And quite a bachelor.
No court would turn a child over to you.
- It would be different if I were married?
- Well, naturally.
- It's a horrible step.
- I don't think you need worry, old man.
You haven't got time now.
- Excuse me. Have you seen Ching-Ching?
- Yes.
- Do you know where she is?
- Yes.
Well, would you mind telling me?
Below, getting ready to leave the ship at the next stop.
They're putting her in a home for girls.
She'll be marching in lockstep and eating gruel within a week.
- I hope you like it.
- Oh, Tommy.
- Tears won't help.
- But surely something can be done.
This can't happen to Ching-Ching.
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
You're gonna marry old sourpuss, aren't you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, no of fence meant.
Look, I tried to adopt Ching-Ching, but I'm unmarried.
- You're getting married.
- Richard might...
- You don't want her to go to an institution?
- Of course not.
Then listen.
I've gone completely soft about that kid.
Incredible, I know, but true.
Adopt her. Let me pay for her upbringing until I can take her myself.
That'll be as quick as I can get to the States and come back with a wife.
Will you do it? It wouldn't be for long.
You may not believe it, but there are quite a few girls back home willing to marry me.
At least there used to be.
It's not for me, it's for Ching-Ching.
- I'll do it.
- I knew you would.
May I speak to you, Susan?
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.
Susan, I'm awfully sorry if I annoyed you in speaking of that bracelet as I did.
Imagine my becoming so upset over a mere trinket. Absurd, isn't it?
Oh, I was a little upset myself. I'm sorry.
There, that's better. Everything's all right now.
Here we are, the three happy Hopes.
One, two, three, and away we go.
Mother was a little weepy when you stalked out.
Somehow she got the idea you'd prefer her not to live with us.
- Why, whatever could've given her that idea?
- I don't know.
But I told her we couldn't get along without her. Didn't I, Mother?
- Well, I don't suppose we could.
- That's awfully sweet of you, Susan.
Heaven protect us all from interfering mothers-in-law is what I always say.
Goodness. I was married myself once and I know what I'm talking about.
Not that Mr Hope's mother didn't mean well, but then, you know... young love.
We do know, don't we?
- Richard.
- Yes?
Just one thing.
Well, I want to adopt little Ching-Ching as soon as we're married.
Whoever heard of such a thing?
If I don't, they'll put her in an institution.
- That's what institutions are for.
- Oh, Richard, please.
I'm sure Richard doesn't want to start his married life with a ready-made family.
Especially with a child called Ching-Ching.
It won't be for long, just until Mr Randall gets back.
- Randall? What's he got to do with it?
- Well... You see, it's a favour to him.
He wants to adopt her as soon as he can.
When he gets back to the States, he'll arrange to take her.
- Why should I do Mr Randall a favour?
- Why indeed?
It isn't for him, it's for the little girl.
Think of her future.
Don't meddle with other people's destinies, my dear.
Forget this child. She got along before she met you and she will after she leaves you.
Dismiss her from your mind completely.
Please, don't you think Richard and I should settle this by ourselves?
After all, it concerns us.
Anything that concerns Richard concerns me.
I think Mother's right, Susan.
- You do?
- Yes.
- Your mother's right and I'm wrong?
- Well, yes. That is, I think you're mistaken.
So do I. I've been mistaken about you and me.
- Now, Susan...
- Listen, marriage is for two people.
I'm breaking our engagement.
Richard, she'll come back.
Meanwhile you wait.
The man should always wait, otherwise he's weak.
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
The captain says I have to go.
No, you don't.
Didn't you say she could be adopted by someone who's married? She's going to be.
- Here she is now.
- Oh, darling.
- Don't I have to go ashore?
- Not now. Tell her, Susan.
- Miss Parker's going to adopt Ching-Ching.
- I'm not going to be married.
- What? Oh, but you said...
- I think we'd better go now, darling.
Just a minute.
This isn't really goodbye.
I'll come back for you real soon.
And in the meantime, you won't cry, will you?
No, Uncle Tommy, but remember, one... one minute of waiting is a century to the hopeful.
I'll remember, Ching-Ching.
Goodbye, sweetie.
If you ever come back again, you won't forget to come and see me, will you?
- I'll be in the orphan asylum in Shanghai.
- Oh, sure, we'll look you up.
- Won't we?
- Of course we will.
Maybe we'll have some more fun like we had.
We might even go back to jail again.
(Tommy) Yes, we might.
Well, I think I'd better run along now.
Before I really cry. Goodbye.
We can't let this happen to her.
Look, Susan, I've got an idea.
Please don't say no till you hear me out.
I know exactly what you think of me, but that isn't important now.
Marry me. Don't misunderstand me.
You wouldn't have to put up with me.
It'd just be a marriage in name only.
Soon as we dock in San Francisco, go to Reno and get a divorce.
My lawyers will take care of everything.
I wish you would. For Ching-Ching.
It's the only way.
- You'd really do that for her?
- I'd do anything in the world for her.
- So would I.
- Then you will?
Yes.
Hey, bring her back.
- What's that?
- We're getting married. We want to adopt her.
Come on, Ching-Ching, darling.
We're going back aboard ship again.
For as much as Susan Parker and Thomas Randall have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before this company, and have given and pledged their troth, each to the other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and joining hands,
I pronounce that they are man and wife.
Amen.
- All happiness, my dear. Good luck, my boy.
- Thank you.
Twice blessed is he who loves both bride and groom, for their happiness is his.
Congratulations, Mr Randall.
Much joy to you, Mrs Randall.
- Thank you.
- A sailor's knot is as good as City Hall's.
There'll be some formalities about the child.
I'll have my lawyer take care of that.
- Susan, why did you do this?
- Young man, you're talking to my wife.
- Richard, dear!
- And you told me to wait.
- Are you really and truly my parents now?
- We're the best you've got, darling.
Sun Lo says a child without parents is like a ship without a rudder.
Sun Lo ever say anything about going to sleep?
Oh, yes.
He said sleep without dreams is given to children for their innocence and old men for their wisdom.
Well, off you go, then.
I'm almost too excited to sleep, but I'll try.
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Aunt Susan, Uncle Tommy.
Good night, darling, but I'm not your uncle any more.
- What are you, then?
- Can't you guess?
I know. You're my father now.
- Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, here you are.
Did the stewardess move your things?
She said Mrs Hope almost bit her.
- I...
- I...
- Go ahead.
- No, you.
Well, I was just going to say if there was anything you wanted me to do to lend credibility to the situation,
I'll be glad to do it, you know.
- People will talk whatever we do.
- Sure, of course.
Well, I guess I'll be off.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll try to make things as easy for you as possible.
I'm cabling my lawyers tonight. You can go direct to Reno as soon as the boat docks.
- Everything's arranged.
- Very thoughtful.
Not at all. You'll like Reno.
It's a fascinating place.
Lots of fresh air and horseback riding.
Full of nice, emotional people.
Oh...
- This is the address you go to.
- Thank you.
You're really wonderful.
I suppose you know that.
Well, at the moment,
I don't feel very wonderful.
Well, if you must know,
I don't feel so good myself.
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Tommy.
I...
Begging your pardon, sir, where shall I lay out your pyjamas this evening?
- Where you laid them last night.
- Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, sir.
(knocking)
Come in.
Susan, why didn't you warn me you were going to do this?
Well, I... I didn't have time, and besides... (laughs) it's too late now.
- Well, it's hardly funny, is it?
- Not to me.
Well, tell me one thing.
You don't love him, do you?
Do you?
No, I don't, but even if I did it wouldn't make any difference.
Yes, it would. Listen, darling,
I've been a worm, I know that now.
But I've had an understanding with Mother.
You can have your way from now on, always, if you'll tell me there's a chance.
Oh, no, Richard.
It wouldn't work. You know it wouldn't.
You can be nice. You're nice now, but...
- Please, Susan.
- No, really, I'm too confused to talk about it.
I'm even too upset to think about it.
I'll follow you.
I'll follow you until you say yes.
No, Richard, I'd rather you didn't.
You'd better lock this.

You stay in here and I'll wait out in the courtroom.
- Is this Mrs Randall?
- Yes.
You mustn't be nervous when your case is called.
I've placed you at the beginning of today's calendar. Meanwhile, wait here.
That's awfully kind of you, Judge.
This is my first divorce, and I'm a little jittery.
It is a little strange at first, but they all get used to it.
- You know, like influenza.
- (knocking)
Come.
Right in here, please.
- Susan!
- Darling, I'm so glad to see you.
Oh, this is a surprise.
But I don't understand.
Well, you see, I thought
I might want another divorce sometime.
I was sort of curious to see how they made them.
(clears throat)
- Judge Booth, this is Mr Randall.
- The husband, I presume?
Yes. This is my daughter.
- Your daughter?
- Adopted.
- How are you, young lady?
- Fine, thank you.
To greet one you love is better for the health than medicine.
Well, I declare.
That sounds like a Chinese proverb.
Judge, you haven't heard anything yet.
Well, well, well.
Come over here and talk to me.
I... I tried to stay away, but I found I couldn't.
I had to see you again.
Suppose you and I have our talk in the other room.
Uh...
- Will you excuse us for a few moments?
- Oh, but would it be proper?
- I mean, our being left alone together now.
- Oh, it's quite customary.
- You're looking very well.
- I haven't had a drink in six weeks.
- That's wonderful.
- No, it isn't, it's terrible.
Still, I'll get along, and it does show what the influence of a good woman can do.
- Oh, really? Who is she?
- Ching-Ching.
I told you I'd do anything in the world for her.
You've proven that.
Honestly, you wouldn't know me.
I'm a changed man.
I may not be any better, but at least I'm different.
I'm so glad.
You know, you were right about Reno.
It's a fascinating place.
- So charming and...
- Susan. Darling.
- Oh, Tommy, please.
- Do we have to go through with this?
Richard is waiting in the courtroom to marry me. He's gonna take me back to the Orient.
Oh...
I see.
Well, I guess that's that, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Sorrier than I can say.
Everyone rise.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
The District Court of Washoe,
State of Nevada, is now in session.
The Honourable JG Booth, judge presiding.
Be seated, please.
Case of Randall versus Randall.
- Any witnesses for plaintiff?
- The case is uncontested.
In that case, the court would like to call a witness of its own.
But the case is uncontested.
I said the court will call a witness of its own.
Miss Barbara Randall.
We don't want her mixed up in this.
The witness will take the stand.
The defendant will please be seated.
- Raise your right hand, please.
- I think we can dispense with the oath.
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Now, Miss Randall.
- You can call me Ching-Ching, Judge.
- Thank you.
Now, Ching-Ching, the plaintiff alleges general incompatibility.
Have you ever noticed evidence of such a condition existing between the parties to this action?
To my knowledge, the contestants in this action have manifested nothing but the most harmonious, cordial and friendly feelings towards each other.
- But, Your Honour, I object.
- Who are you, young man?
- Why, I'm engaged to the plaintiff.
- Engaged?
To a married woman?
- This court recognises no such engagement.
- (laughter)
Now, Ching-Ching, have either of the parties in this action ever evidenced by their conduct any proper legal ground for divorce?
There's utterly no ground for disturbing the marital status of the contestants.
Most irregular, Your Honour.
The child doesn't know what she is saying.
Oh, yes, she does.
Tell the court.
Isn't this action the result of two grown-up people behaving like children, refusing to admit that they're in love with each other?
The allegations of the complaint insofar as it refers to...
Uh...
Matrimony.
Huh?
- Matrimony.
- Oh, yes.
- Insofar as it refers to macaroni...
- (lawyer) Macaroni?
There! See, Your Honour?
The child has obviously been coached.
I was not. I just forgot what the judge told me to say.
- (laughter)
- (gavel)
- ls counsel intimating that she is lying?
- Counsel charges just that.
Have you any witnesses to disprove her testimony?
Do you wish to testify that this child was lying?
Why...
- No, of course not.
- Then you admit that you love Mrs Randall?
She knows I do.
You, Mrs Randall.
Do you wish to attack this child's veracity?
- Why, no, certainly not.
- You admit that you love your husband?
- Well, yes, I do.
- Then what's all this nonsense about?
Divorce denied. Take your child and go home, both of you, where you belong.
Your Honour, what about me?
My advice, young man, is to stop tampering with the affections of married women.
- Well, we did it, didn't we?
- You bet we did.
Judge, you're simply stravagant.

The Missing Boys
Of Saint-Agil based on the novel by
Pierre Very
Directed by
Christian-Jaque
The Saint-Agil Boys' School, where the action takes place, does not exist in reality and the characters are imaginary.
We simply wanted to provide viewers with an opportunity to remember a time when they too were thirsty for amazing adventures.
Saint-Agil
Boys Boarding School
Dormitory
- Hi, Martin.
- Hi, Martin.
Hi.
We were up to Article 7.
We'll read it together.
Then we'll discuss it.
It's pointless. Once we decide to do something, we have to do it.
Not just "do it", but "accomplish it".
Which means studying the question in depth.
Thanks.
Planning it out.
Silence, please!
I need to reread the report.
It's just a bunch of papers!
And it's freezing in here.
Don't you think, Martin?
What did you say?
Nothing, I was talking to Martin.
With all these drafts, he's gonna get a cold.
Leave Martin be!
It's true!
Our skin and flesh act as a kind of overcoat.
But he's naked all year round.
- I demand silence.
- Fine. I'll shut up!
OK, I'll read it.
Report on the secret activities of the Able Cowards Club.
Statutes. Article 1.
The Club members' goal is to set sail for the USA.
Article 2:
The Club comprises three members.
Let's do a roll call.
Number one?
Present.
Number two?
Present.
Number three?
Present.
I'll continue.
Weekly night-time meetings will be held in the science classroom, presided over by Martin the Skeleton.
Article 4:
Members have sworn not to set sail individually.
I repeat: I say we strike that article.
Too late, you took an oath!
If you had a chance to go alone, wouldn't you take it?
- I'd go with you, or not at all!
- So you say...
Can I read the last notes?
Sure, go ahead.
A: Which airline do we choose?
B: How do we board?
C: What will we do once we reach free America?
D: Remember to study the St Etienne
Standard Catalog of Military Firearms.
E...
Footsteps.
It's Planet again.
Planet? Always Planet!
Is he a sleepwalker?
Not a sleepwalker, an insomniac.
It's the same thing.
So we�ll adjourn... till next week for the report?
And we won't set sail for a decade.
You're always griping!
No. I'm just saying.
You're "just saying" what?
If Columbus had worked this slow, he'd never have gotten anywhere.
You think he didn't study the map before leaving?
Study the map?
He took an egg, balanced it on its tip and took off in his ship.
That's how he did it.
And I'll do the same.
Now I'm going to bed!
Me too. Aren't you coming?
No. I wanna work on my novel.
Your "novel"!
What's this novel about?
It's about all the adventures we'll have once we get there.
Once we get there...
How depressing to hear this!
- Are you coming?
- Yes.
Chapter IV
Where the three Able Cowards, after making (and losing) a fortune, arrive at the Mexican border.
Second meeting with the mysterious man.
Why are you back so soon?
I saw something.
Sorgues?
I hope they didn't catch you!
No, but I saw something.
Something amazing!
Who's talking?
Who's talking in the middle of the night?
Unbelievable.
Tell us in the morning.
We'll pretend we're sick.
We'll be able to talk at the infirmary.
Yes.
Unbelievable!
What's all this chatter?
In the middle of the night?
I've never heard of such a thing!
I believe you're talking to yourself, my friend.
I'm sorry, Mr. Planet.
You're forgiven.
Come, gentlemen!
Come on!
Time to get up!
And be quiet about it!
Get up, gentlemen!
Come on!
Get a move on!
What're you waiting for?
Didn't you hear the reveille?
- Yes, sir.
- Well?
All that talking kept me awake last night.
So I wasn't dreaming!
There was talking...
Who was talking?
- It was... - Who?
- I don't know, sir.
I fell asleep right away.
Macroix.
- What're you doing?
- I'm sick.
- What is it?
- Red robin.
- What?
- My throat's red.
It hurts, as if a bird were pecking at it.
- Sir!
- What?
I'm sick too.
What have you got?
Same thing as Macroix.
It burns, it hurts!
- It hurts, sir!
- You too?
It hurts here.
How very curious.
- Sir?
- What is it?
I think I've got it.
- What?
- Red robin.
No, this can't be!
Morning, Mr. Planet.
Morning, Donnadieu.
I trust you slept well.
Please keep your jokes to yourself.
Jokes?
I suffer from insomnia, and every morning people ask me how I slept.
It's stupid! And uncalled-for.
Good morning.
Good morning, Lemel.
Good morning, Donnadieu.
Good morning, Planet. Slept well, Planet?
No, Mr Lemel. I didn't.
I never sleep.
You understand? Never!
Do I ask if your wine's well fermented?
You and your insinuations...
I'm just saying aloud what people say behind your back: that you drink... alone, in secret!
You're imagining things, Mr. Planet.
You have no character.
You're an oddball, a crackpot.
A sleepwalker, in fact.
As such, I despise you.
He despises me!
Did you hear, Mr. Donnadieu?
That lush despises me!
A man who drinks in secret and who reels along in public.
What? I, reel along?
- I dare you to repeat that!
- Don't start fighting, gentlemen.
Between Frenchmen, when war is imminent?
When the enemy's at our gate?
Good morning, gentlemen.
I trust you slept well?
Yes, headmaster.
I mean... no.
I mean... a little.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Walter.
That Mr. Walter doesn't look like a very nice man!
Indeed.
Gentlemen!
He looks like a perjurer to me.
Furthermore, he scares the children.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen!
Walter is undoubtedly a fine man.
He hasn't been here long, but his work is beyond reproach.
He may be slightly reserved, but he's an excellent living language teacher.
I don't like foreigners.
You shouldn't generalize, Mr. Lemel.
Like in everything, there are good ones and bad ones.
Well, I'm sure he's a bad one.
Good or bad, it's always with foreigners that we'll go to war.
Can't you watch where you're going?
Sorry, I didn't see you!
That's no excuse to step on my feet.
You gotta look before running.
You gotta look!
You hear me?
Yes. I'm not deaf.
What? Talking back to me?
Dirty little rascal.
I'll teach you some respect, you hear me?
You're here to obey, not to talk back!
You hear me? To obey!
You good-for-nothing!
Excuse me, Mr. Lemel.
You shouldn't yell at the kids.
They're fragile.
Children are sensitive.
Yelling scares them.
Think you don't scare them, with that mug of yours?
Trust me, Mr. Lemel, yelling is no way to teach children.
If I started yelling in your ear, to teach you respect...
If I started yelling like this...!
Gentlemen! What's going on here?
Well, headmaster, this lunatic is always provoking me.
Excuse me, headmaster.
Mr. Lemel is exaggerating.
I was just explaining something.
I'd like a word with you, Mr. Walter.
I'm telling you.
It's like he came out of the wall.
Then he disappeared again.
"Like he came out of the wall."
We get it!
You dragged us here for that?
I tell you: it's true!
Better quit writing novels; you're going batty!
You can laugh as much as you want, but something odd is going on around here!
Gentlemen!
Have you quite finished?
This isn't the visiting room!
We're not talking, we're gargling.
Then gargle in silence!
There! Now stay put.
You're not sick!
Why did you come here?
I lied!
It's my turtle that's sick.
We have to cure it.
- What's the problem?
- It won't eat.
- What do you feed it?
- Nothing.
- Why?
- I don't know what turtles eat!
- They eat lettuce.
- Lettuce? Thanks.
Who's that little boy?
He's younger than the others.
Mr. Brezillier's son.
The teacher who died.
He was a widower, so the headmaster and I decided to keep the boy on.
Brezillier was a strange man.
He dabbled in the occult sciences.
You believe in that stuff?
Not really...
I do.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
You're not likable enough, and you're aggressive.
Which explains the other teachers' hostility towards you.
Their hostility, headmaster, doesn't bother me in the least.
I'm here to work, so I work.
I ask for nothing more.
It's not just about work, here at Saint-Agil.
You have to make yourself likable too.
And it seems that even the children...
I mean...
You bother them...
You scare them.
Me?
I scare the children?
Mr. Mazeau!
Got any gum?
Gum?
Another American invention!
Eating rubber... it's ridiculous!
Do I eat my suspenders?
Got any lettuce?
- Lettuce? - Yes.
- Not here, no.
- I'll get you some later, son.
- Thanks, Mr. Mazeau.
Why did you ask for lettuce?
For the little one's turtle.
Are you eavesdropping again?
I wasn't!
This yard belongs to everyone.
But you're the only one who'll get a good spanking! Beat it!
They wanna beat me up, sir!
Not big enough to fight back?
It's three against one!
He's lying; we'd never gang up on him!
They would. They're always threatening me.
They always stick together!
Who knows what they're up to!
They even plot at night...
They're up to no good!
I never asked you.
Why are you telling me all this?
'Cause they're up to no good.
It's not nice to spy on your peers, Fermier.
If you don't stop, we won't be friends anymore.
I'm warning you: we won't be friends at all.
I'd like to ask you a question.
Will you answer sincerely?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Do I scare you?
No, sir.
- No.
- No, sir.
That's what I've been told.
Then they're liars.
We're not scared of anything, anyway.
Thank you.
I didn't dare tell him, but sometimes he does scare me.
Why?
I don't know, he's kinda weird.
Silence, please.
For today's dictation, I've chosen a writer who's not on the curriculum, but I thought it'd be interesting, to get away from the classics.
His name is Wells. W - E - L - L - S.
H. G. Wells, who wrote many novels, the most famous being...
"The Invisible Man."
In English: "The Invisible Man."
First, I'll read a few excerpts.
The invisible man, is a man... who's found a way to disappear at will.
Obviously, this is just science fiction, therefore inconceivable.
No it's not; I saw it!
What could he have seen?
What's that, Sorgues?
You read this book?
No, sir, but I saw one.
"One" what?
A man who can disappear.
Silence, please!
Sorgues is losing his marbles!
Silence!
Sorgues...
I'm warning you.
I don't like that kind of joke.
Now for the dictation.
Chapter one.
The strange man's arrival.
The stranger came early in February...
I tell you I saw him!
Who spoke?
Was it you, Sorgues?
Yes, sir.
I said I saw him, as clearly as I see you.
- Who?
- The man who appears and disappears.
Here we go again!
Gentlemen!
Silence, please!
Please, keep quiet.
Sorgues...
I'm sorry, but I won't have you mocking me like this.
I'm throwing you out.
He's lost his marbles!
Maybe he really did see something.
Like what? The Headless Horseman?
I demand silence!
Go see the headmaster and give him this.
I thought changing the curriculum a bit would make you happy.
To my great regret,
I see I was wrong.
Therefore, today's dictation won't be "The Invisible Man", but the life of Shakespeare.
So Mr. Walter threw you out because you were clowning around, and you invented this far-fetched story as an excuse?
No, sir. I assure you.
It just came blurting out.
But I swear I saw that man!
A "supernatural" man?
And you just happened to see him in the science classroom.
At night.
And what were you doing there?
Huh?
Thorny question, huh?
I can't tell you, sir.
It's a secret.
A secret?
You have too vivid an imagination.
It'll play nasty tricks on you.
Here. Go back to class.
Why bother asking for lettuce?
Now that you've finished, we'll move on to another type of exercise.
Visual memory.
Take a quick look at both sides of this banknote.
Don't linger.
Quickly.
I repeat: to learn to draw well, visual memory is essential.
Grevin, for example:
What did you notice about the banknote?
It was a 100 Francs note.
And what'd you notice, Billard?
A man with an anvil.
And a woman holding a shovel.
- And...
- And what?
A hammer and an anvil.
Very poor visual memory!
And lots of numbers...
And what did you notice?
I noticed five women.
Maybe six...
Yes, sir: six women.
What's so funny?
They're naked, sir!
There's no point in going on.
You're looking without seeing.
That's why real masterpieces go unnoticed.
No one even bothered looking at the artist's signature.
The signature of the engraver.
Yet I once knew a brilliant engraver.
Do you know how he exploits his brilliance?
He teaches a bunch of idiots!
What's so funny, Macroix?
Always the Three Musketeers.
The same three rebels!
I'll lick you into shape!
On your feet, Macroix!
Baume, on your feet!
Sorgues, on your feet!
Sorgues, on your feet!
- Where is Sorgues?
- He's not here, sir.
He left without asking permission?
No, sir, he was never here.
Sorgues wasn't here for drawing class?
Where is he, then?
Sorgues's gone missing.
- Well?
- Nothing.
We asked everybody in town, but there's no sign of him.
As if he'd disappeared into thin air!
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, gentlemen.
I'm convinced the boy simply ran away.
Possibly.
Sorgues is an impressionable young man.
Maybe Mr. Walter was a bit too aggressive... when he threw the boy out of his classroom.
Please, Mr. Lemel!
I only did my duty.
Children are sensitive, Mr. Walter.
You should go easy on them.
Please don't speak to me in that tone.
I'm only stating my opinion.
It's no surprise that a student runs away from a boarding school, when one of the teachers scares the students!
Say that again and...!
Mr. Walter...
Get a hold of yourself.
Sorry, sir.
But there are times... when I can't help myself.
May I be excused, sir?
And to think some people refuse to believe... that there'll be war!
Please, Donnadieu, leave us in peace!
Sorry, sir.
Look what I found in Sorgues's desk, sir.
Very curious.
Travel brochures, catalogs, fares...
I believe our young friend premeditated his actions.
But he won't get far, that's for sure.
He might already be at home by now.
- Did you wire his parents?
- Yes.
Good.
Fetch his two friends, Planet.
Baume and Macroix?
Very well, sir.
Baume, Sorgues and Macroix.
A fine trio they make!
Hope you didn't shout it from the rooftops, Mazeau?
I don't want this unfortunate incident to leak out.
I was incredibly discreet, sir.
- Yet...
- Thanks, you can go now.
Fine, sir.
Yet, I'm extraordinarily worried.
I told you to go, Mr. Mazeau!
Fine, sir.
I'm worried because
I'm firmly convinced... that little Sorgues was hypnotized.
I'm sure someone here has the evil eye, and I'll prove it!
"Hypnotized"!
Why not "bewitched"?
The occult sciences will end up turning Mazeau's head.
- But it might be true.
- What?
That someone's got the "evil eye".
Mr. Lemel, you're not being coherent!
What?
How dare you say that?
And if front of Mr. Donnadieu, the worst gossip in the school?
That's not very nice, sir.
That's not very kind.
I've had it with being spied on!
- One of these days...
- One of these days, what?
Come in.
You may go.
Fine, sir.
What are you doing here, Mazeau?
I'm thinking.
I'm more and more convinced that the boy was put to sleep.
Put to sleep?
I know what I'm talking about.
Hypnotism.
The eyes...
You can't understand, Mr. Planet, since you never sleep.
Maybe it's Planet who's got it.
Got what?
The evil eye.
The evil eye...
So you refuse to answer?
We're not refusing, we can't tell you.
'Cause we don't know anything.
Fine.
I appealed to your sense of honesty and loyalty...
I was wrong.
I swear Sorgues didn't tell us anything.
I swear it too.
Goodnight, headmaster.
Goodnight, Mr. Planet.
- Sweet dreams!
- Right...
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr. Walter.
Good night.
Don't you find it odd that
Mr. Walter is going out, given that he rarely leaves the school?
You're the odd one, Planet.
A student's disappeared and now you see mystery everywhere!
There's mystery in books, but rarely in life.
Trust me.
- Good night, headmaster.
- Good night.
You shouldn't have come tonight!
Something's happened.
That's precisely why I came.
I doubt you really know what happened.
Obviously! No one tells me anything.
They use me, spy on me, watch my every move.
You have a persecution complex.
That's not good.
I've had it!
I feel like everyone suspects me!
It's unbearable.
There are times when I just wanna blurt it all out. It's suffocating me!
Blabbing might suffocate you even more.
It's fair to say it'd suffocate you for good.
What're you doing here?
I came to keep you company.
'Cause I know you don't like drinking alone.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
Me neither.
What're you reading?
Albrecht Durer's biography.
A brilliant painter.
Other people's lives interest you?
Obviously, since I botched mine.
What're you moaning about?
You make a good living.
"A good living"!
No?
It's none of my business, but I'd love to know how you spend your money.
See these reproductions of Albrecht Durer?
Well, they're not reproductions!
They're originals.
That's how I spend my money.
Wonderful works of art!
Genuine masterpieces!
I don't like art; it's useless.
How dare you say such a thing?
Not so loud...
Careful.
Let's have a little game.
As you wish.
Do you really think art is useless?
Useless!
Once you hang it up, that's it.
It's over.
Huh?
I'm a simple man.
I like simple and fun things.
A knife, a box of matches...
These are simple, fun things.
With a knife, you can sharpen a pencil.
With matches, you can start a fire.
With a knife, you can also slit someone's throat.
With matches, you can burn a house down, or start a forest fire.
Huh?
What can you do with a painting?
Number 8.
I've got it.
I've got the 12 too.
Lottery games are just great!
To think some people bother playing chess!
- I�ve got that too.
- You must be cheating!
Number... 90.
I've... got it.
Number 78.
- I've got that too.
- Screw this game!
Mr. Lemel...
I came here today to tell you, as nicely as possible, that you absolutely must stop drinking.
Huh?
Alcohol's bad for you.
Makes you do stupid things, makes you say stupid things.
Unless you drink it like me.
That is: on occasion.
I demand to know what was done to that boy!
In a respectable boarding school, boys who don't sleep in their beds at night must be punished.
Let's start with roll call.
Baume? Present.
- Macroix?
- Present.
Sorgues?
Sorgues is declared missing.
Let's read the minutes.
"We disapprove of Sorgues's behavior,
"He wasn't supposed to leave without us.
"Especially without telling us.
"Without money or a sense of initiative, without a working knowledge of English,
"he's bound to fail.
Serves him right!"
Sign it.
I won't sign. I don't agree.
He was right to leave.
- Planet.
- Yes, Planet.
We'd better go back to bed.
Five cases of sparkling wine.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Good.
14 boxes of cookies. Good.
Four cases of lemonade.
Good.
Hey, where are the banners?
Got the mail, Mazeau?
I didn't have time for that, Mr. Planet!
I'm taking deliveries.
It doesn't look good.
Tomorrow's Saint Agil Day... and the banners aren't here yet!
The mail's on my desk. - I'll sort it.
Every year the banners get here at the last minute!
How hard can ordering banners be?
What poor organization!
How odd!
What?
A postcard for Baume, from America.
America? That's incredible.
And from New York to boot!
Signed "Able Coward".
What an unusual name!
"Able Coward"?
Looking for something, Mr. Walter?
Yes, is there a letter for me?
No, sir.
Thank you.
He asks about a letter every day, but he never gets any.
Bizarre...
Say!
Could this postcard be from Sorgues?
From Sorgues?
It's possible! He's been missing for two weeks.
But it's signed "Able Coward".
So? It could be a nickname.
So where's my lettuce?
You promised to get me some.
Don't worry, I'm on it.
Baume!
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
It's incredible!
He's a bastard because he left alone, but he made it there, and that's just incredible!
Why's it addressed just to you?
Dunno...
How rotten!
He could've sent me one too.
Or addressed it to me too.
They'll question us.
Planet was gawking at me!
We've got a spy in our midst!
This is what we do to spies!
We rub their ears.
Then we tear 'em to pieces!
You're hurting me! You bullies!
You fat lumps!
Hey, here's your lettuce!
Thanks, sir.
- Macroix, out!
- But, sir...
Macroix, I order you to leave!
If it turns your crank...
How dare you...?
After I order you to leave, you dare say to me,
"if it turns your crank"?
If that's the way you want it, it's off to the headmaster's office for you!
If it turns your crank.
Gentlemen, after this unfortunate and unpleasant incident, we'll play "March of the Giants".
On my command!
Headmaster, when I noticed Macroix's absence,
I told myself:
"That's it, he's gone missing!"
Don't be alarmed, children.
You can sleep in peace.
Your schoolmate can't be very far.
But how extremely unfortunate!
Extremely, headmaster.
- Headmaster?
- What is it?
This afternoon, in the schoolyard,
Baume and Macroix said a lot of things.
We'll discuss that tomorrow.
It's time for these young ones to calm down... and get to sleep.
Come now!
Time for bed!
Headmaster.
I searched everywhere, and found absolutely nothing.
But I got to thinking, and something struck me.
A mysterious detail, which worries me more and more.
I think you'd better go to bed, Mazeau.
Yes, sir.
When Sorgues disappeared,
I found his lettuce on the floor.
Macroix asked for lettuce and he's disappeared too.
But now I can't find his lettuce.
Why is that?
That's the question.
Why lettuce, and for whom?
It's a mystery!
Where'd they go?
Pipe down!
Anyone still up in three minutes won't be attending the festivities tomorrow night.
What'd you tell the headmaster?
Tell me or I'll break your nose!
Don't. I gotta tell you something.
What?
You lost your postcard from America, right?
How would you know?
Did you swipe it?
No, but I know who did.
I asked for silence, remember?
Lights out, gentlemen.
Come in.
I want my postcard back, Mr. Walter.
Your postcard?
What postcard?
The postcard from America.
You picked it up off the ground.
Give it back.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fine.
You don't trust me?
I trust no one here.
MARTIN THE SKELETON.
Sorgues, declared missing.
Macroix, declared missing.
- Baume...
- Present.
I knew I'd find you here.
"Martin the Skeleton, or the Adventures of the Able Cowards".
This is all very clear.
The other two ran away, and you planned on joining them.
You won't have to bother!
You're expelled from the boarding house.
You three were troublemakers.
Two are gone, and when you leave, there will be no more trouble!
I'll wire your guardian to come pick you up.
Till then, I advise you to behave.
You can attend the festivities tomorrow.
It's all I can do for you.
Hernani!
I tell you the time has come.
My time.
What will you do with me?
Your choice: the dagger or poison!
What have you done, poor wretch?
- You asked for it!
- What a horrible death!
No, Hernani, don't.
Everything's going dark, Do�a Sol.
Are you in pain?
I feel nothing.
Do you see lights in the shadows?
Not yet.
Do�a Sol!
Look at me.
Closer, still closer!
Is she dead?
I am accursed!
Magnificent!
I love it when the dead come back to take their bows!
It's the world turned upside down.
It should be the living paying homage to the dead.
To the buffet, children!
It was good, wasn't it?
Help yourselves.
Tragedies make me thirsty.
I believe you've had enough champagne, Mr. Lemel.
What would you want me to drink, headmaster?
I gotta leave the lemonade to the kids!
Besides, champagne isn't bad.
It's the teetotallers who are evil.
Right, Mr. Walter?
You look like death warmed over.
Actually, you look like a spy!
Please, Mr. Walter...
Please!
Stop making a spectacle of yourself!
Why?
I have my reasons for drinking.
I could tell you my reasons.
In fact, I will tell you... sir!
If you don't shut up, there'll be consequences!
Consequences?
I'm finished; a failure!
Consequences mean nothing to me.
Come, Mr. Lemel.
Let's go take a walk and get some air.
Why?
There's nothing left to drink, here.
I've set aside a few bottles in my room.
Mazeau, you're a peach!
You lead, I'll follow.
Come.
One shouldn't make a spectacle of oneself, headmaster.
Come, Mr. Lemel, come!
Yeah, I drink! So what?
If I were a success - a great artist, for example -
I'd be commended for it.
All the great men drank.
Even the Great Charlemagne!
Henri IV liked the sauce... too.
I know, I know.
Come, Mr. Lemel!
Ravaillac drank too!
Michelangelo... Robin...
Robinson Crusoe.
Du Guesclin.
Philip the Fair.
Come, Mr. Lemel!
Philip the Fair.
What a man!
He had the Knights Templar burnt at the stake, because they were spying on him.
Served them right!
They're spying on me too.
'Cause I got something in common with Philip the Fair.
Let me tell you...
Headmaster!
What's the commotion?
What's going on?
I don't know.
The fuses must've blown.
Get the emergency lamps.
Please remain calm!
Nobody move!
Headmaster!
Mr. Lemel fell.
The lamps, sir.
Mind the younger ones.
He fell over here.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Quick, get a doctor!
- No. Wait.
He's dead.
A horrible accident.
Yes.
An accident?
Yes, an accident.
It's awful.
He almost fell on top of me.
I was here and he fell there.
Close call!
Mr. Planet, please contact the chief of police.
Fine, sir.
Mazeau, replace the blown fuses.
- Fine, sir.
- Here. - Thanks.
Come on, boys. Time for bed.
Come on.
Go to bed, children.
- He fell from the second floor.
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't bleeding much.
- Yet he must have fallen on his head!
Since you're here, hold this.
I'm checking which fuses blew.
This one's OK.
This one too.
This one too.
It might be this one.
It was.
Now go to bed.
- The party was going so well!
- But ended so badly... - Alas!
You say Lemel drank a lot?
He's dead now - we can say it.
He was a drunk. Especially tonight.
I get it. He undoubtedly fell over the balustrade.
Mr. Boisse, could you pinpoint... the source of the blackout?
I'm not sure.
A short-circuit, no doubt.
We've always had... electrical problems here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to examine the exact place where he fell.
A simple formality, before
I can give you a burial certificate.
Come on, gentlemen!
Time to get up!
Up!
What's the holdup?
Quick!
Time to get up, Baume!
Baume!
Where's Baume?
- Have you seen Baume?
- No, sir.
Baume's gone.
That's the third one!
Already finished?
Don't wolf it down!
Easy...
Briquet's right, this isn't normal.
After Sorgues... Macroix.
And after Macroix, Baume. Who's next?
I'm gonna write my folks.
I don't wanna stay here;
I'd rather go to public school.
Say!
Maybe there's a vampire here.
- A vampire?
- Yeah, a bloodsucking vampire!
I don't wanna stay here...!
- I want to leave.
- Calm down now!
It's getting stifling now.
If you ask me, it's a bad omen.
Trust me: all hell's gonna break loose.
Hell's gonna break loose!
Like a thunderstorm!
- What?
- War.
That's three missing now...
I came to get my postcard.
And I found it.
Don't come any nearer!
Stay where you are or I'll scream!
I'll scream!
You're crazy!
What's wrong with you?
I don't trust you.
I don't trust anyone here.
You're scared of me?
I wasn't before, but I guess I was wrong.
Don't come any closer!
Stay where you are!
Fine, I won't budge.
How'd you get in here?
Everyone's looking for you.
They think you've gone missing too.
I'm not missing.
I just pretended to be.
There are things I need to find out.
And I will.
- First of all, why'd you take my card?
- Why?
Because Sorgues's disappearance seemed strange to me.
I wanted to know...
Know what?
Who'd sent that postcard.
Sorgues sent it!
No, it wasn't Sorgues.
He may not have mailed it, but he's the one who wrote it.
I recognize his handwriting.
- Only...
- Only what?
He didn't add Martin's secret sign.
Which means he was telling us something's wrong!
I know what's up!
Sorgues didn't go to America voluntarily.
He was kidnapped!
I have more proof.
Sorgues was writing a novel, the only thing he cared about.
He left without it!
So what?
It means he didn't have the time to take it with him!
I don't know who took him away, but I'll find out.
Have a close look at that card.
And you'll see... that the stamp is a fake.
This card did not come from New York.
It's just been dropped in the school mailbox, by someone who wants us to believe... that Sorgues has left for America.
Who might that be?
I don't know yet, but I'm trying to find out.
Maybe it's you.
Are you still suspecting me?
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
Maybe together we'll be able to solve the mystery.
I don't trust you.
You got so mad yesterday!
You threatened Mr. Lemel.
When someone picks on me,
I become violent.
Yes. Very violent!
That's why Mr. Lemel fell.
What are you saying?
You're crazy...
Do you really believe that?
I was just joking.
I know it wasn't you.
I was by your side when Lemel was murdered.
You have no evidence.
Here's your evidence!
Look, a fork.
A short circuit is very easily made.
Look.
And it's easy to push a drunk man, when it's dark.
I'm astonished.
Who do you suspect?
I already told you.
Everybody.
But me.
And you.
So, you trust me?
As far as the fork is concerned, you can't be blamed. I don't know about the rest.
Saint-Agil. What a curious boarding school this is!
I was making fun of Sorgues, when he said that he saw someone coming out of the wall.
I was wrong. He must have seen something in the science classroom.
And that's why he's missing.
I'll investigate tonight.
What kind of investigation?
I don't know yet, but I'll find out.
- What?
- I don't know.
Well, I'll go with you.
As you wish, but be careful... if you do anything stupid, everyone will hear me.
I won't be taken away as easily as the others!
Mr. Walter, what do you think of Philip the Fair?
Philip the Fair?
What are you talking about?
I'm asking you what you think of him.
Philip the Fair was a French king.
Lemel said he was like
Philip the Fair.
Then he fell.
Do you know what
Philip the Fair used to do?
Not much, I believe.
He was a counterfeiter.
That's odd...
Sorgues and Macroix have been kidnapped... because they've seen something!
Sorgues saw a man appear and disappear out of the wall, right here.
Out of the wall?
That's ridiculous!
You know what we look like?
Well...
We look like two idiots.
Sorgues saw a man appear and disappear!
- Enough!
- No!
I can't stand listening to this, over and over.
"Appear and disappear!"
I feel like I'm going crazy, or like I'm becoming an idiot.
Footsteps!
Come. We won't find anything here.
We will.
You're so stubborn!
I'm staying.
Go ahead and stay.
If you want something, you know where you can find me.
Philip the Fair!
What is it?
Nothing. I'm invoking the moon.
It's a Mexican tradition.
- Really?
- Yes.
...and Sorgues, held captive by the counterfeiters in the old Mexican mill, suddenly started invoking the moon.
And the moon said:
Able Coward.
"Able Coward"?
What does it mean?
Leave me alone!
I told you that I hate it when someone reads over my shoulder when I'm writing!
It wouldn't matter; I can't read!
- Why are you looking, then?
- I like it.
Well, I don't!
OK...
This boy's got a wild imagination!
How can he come up with all this stuff?
I already told you.
I don't like people reading over my shoulder.
And you can't even read!
It's not my fault if I can't read!
I've had it - this is my mill!
Your mill?
It's a fine one, for sure!
Nothing but ruins!
Ruins!
Ruins and dust!
Is it my fault if the industrial mills ruined me?
If my wife ran off with a big-shot miller?
Next you'll say it's my fault if you got into counterfeiting!
I had to do something...
I get bored when I do nothing.
Thank God the boy's here!
When I read his novel, it's the best part of the day.
Leave me alone.
Don't read over my shoulder!
I wanna know what happens.
Can't you read it aloud?
If it makes you happy...
"In this old and stuffy
"Mexican mill,
"poor little Sorgues was being held captive.
"It was Bernadin, known as Boulder Bernadin
"because he was so hard-headed
"who was put in charge of guarding him,
"because he was a stupid and illiterate brute.
"But deep down, he wasn't really a bad Mexican."
That's me, right?
He's talking about me in his book?
It's wonderful!
I'll get you some coffee for that!
"There was also Alexis the miller.
"He smoked a pipe all day long, like a poor devil.
"In his absence, his accomplices...
"talked behind his back, calling him a cuckold and laughing about it."
Now that's funny!
And acutely observed.
"The third..."
That would be me.
"seemed one of those people who talk all the time...
"and do nothing at all."
That's a keen observation too.
Enough already!
How can I write with all this talking?
I can't concentrate!
I need pens, paper and blotter!
Don't get upset now!
Take this.
It will cheer you up a bit.
It's strong, but I added extra milk.
Coffee's good for people who do brain work.
Thanks, Bernadin.
You're very kind.
I'll continue. "One fine day, Sorgues found out that "Three Stars",
"the students' nickname for their drawing teacher
" - due to his cognac drinking habit -
"was also part of the gang."
Three Stars...
Poor Lemel!
He won't draw the banknotes any more.
- It was you who murdered him?
- You're crazy!
I have never killed anyone.
Never.
Besides, I wasn't in charge of killing him.
I only had to keep an eye on him.
Wait for me there!
You're too young.
Go to bed and sleep.
What are you doing here?
I think it's dangerous.
- You want to rescue him?
- Sure.
Go get the others.
Tell them to wait for us on the first floor. Quick.
Go quietly!
Someone's talking? Who's talking?
Now they talk in the middle of the night!
I'm telling you: I don't want to go!
Shut up or I'll cut out your tongue!
Follow me.
I'm dreaming...
How funny, I'm dreaming...
I see Baume. Baume...
The third one to go missing.
So, what's this mill?
Just an ordinary mill.
Don't worry.
Get down.
Are we going to get in?
The most important thing is getting Sorgues and Macroix out of there.
- Have you seen Macroix?
- No. Maybe they've separated them.
Macroix is tough.
They must have locked him in the basement.
I want to get out of here!
Silence!
You could keep quiet without me having to ask you.
I want to get out of here.
- Go away.
- Those trees scare me!
Stay, then. But shut up!
- What are we going to do?
- We need a strategy.
Position yourselves for battle.
The third dormitory, the elders, will be our shock troop. To the front!
The second dormitory, our backing troop, to the right!
The first dormitory, the youngsters, will be our reserves!
To the back, quick!
This is what they call
"night manoeuvres"!
Silence!
Why did they lock them up in a mill?
To turn the millstone.
Like slaves!
Holy cow!
My butt is cold!
'Cause you're scared.
Do you understand?
We have to surprise the enemy.
Anyone want to volunteer?
To do what?
To come with me.
Into the mill?
No. I'm too scared.
- I'm going.
- Very well.
Now, everybody walk to the door.
Quietly.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
I don't like murders.
What's that?
Some copies.
Worthless samples.
A souvenir of Lemel.
You made up your mind, then?
Are you leaving?
Yes. Any counterfeiting business always ends up badly.
Not a word. Don't insist!
Look!
And there are three times more in the back!
These kids have some guts!
We are besieged by Lilliputians!
What do you want?
Sorgues!
Sorgues! Nothing less!
And Macroix!
Macroix?
Who's Macroix?
Our friend.
He's not here!
I've never seen him.
Oh, your friend! Sure!
How would you know?
He's here. In the basement!
Sure, in the basement!
Then go get him right now!
Right. Let's go get him.
Come on, to the basement!
Come.
Come on, to the basement!
The basement is 10 km away.
We're going to the station, what did you think?!
Leave it to me. Come on.
Did they hurt you?
They're nice fellows.
I had them under my thumb.
Who took you away?
You'll never guess.
- Baume, they have escaped!
- Who? - The gangsters!
They won't go far. Quick!
What is it?
All the students are missing!
It's impossible.
He's out of his mind!
He's completely crazy...
Mazeau!
Mazeau!
The dormitories are empty.
All the students are missing!
Huh?
Stop! Stop!
They're here!
What's going on?
This time it�s war!
So?
- Don't you want to come in?
- No.
Why?
We're scared; we're talking about a crime.
And there's a murderer.
We don't want to be taken away.
Well, OK.
I'll go in with Sorgues.
Stop people coming out.
What if it's the murderer?
Take him prisoner.
Silence, now!
Sir!
Headmaster, sir!
It's disgraceful.
They're crazy!
It's disgraceful.
They forced us to go with them.
They say that you have taken
Sorgues away, that you have killed Mr. Lemel and Macroix!
Baume said that!
Then he said...
What did he say?
That you killed Lemel because he was going to talk.
This kid is a mythomaniac.
He's getting his revenge because I threw him out!
He took me away when I told him that I had seen a mysterious man in the science classroom.
When he dismissed me,
I went out that door.
Then he caught me from that one, while I was passing by.
Where I found the lettuce!
Headmaster... the evil eye... it's you!
Lemel's murderer, it's you.
And you've killed Macroix!
No. I wouldn't dare...
You've lost, Boisse.
Yes.
I've lost.
But I don't know anything about Macroix.
I couldn't hurt a kid.
I don't know where he is.
That's the truth.
I'm sorry, I fell asleep.
You're excused.
- Macroix is back!
- You see!
This is good news.
People in town were starting to talk.
I didn't want to tell you, sir, but you understand...
Macroix!
Baume, Sorgues!
How are you?
Where were you?
I went to America.
Are you serious?
Well, almost.
- Almost?
- I was in Le Havre, in Normandy.
I embarked secretly.
They caught me.
- It's incredible. Tell us more...
- Boisse is going to scold me!
You shouldn't worry about Boisse any more.
- No way...
- Yes!
Macroix?
- How do you do?
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.
- I'm glad to see you again.
Mr. Walter...
Do you want to attend our secret meeting in the science classroom?
Certainly. With pleasure.
- Hi, Martin.
- Hi, Martin.
Mr. President.
Mr. Walter, Able Coward.
The Able Cowards secret society, as a token of gratitude for your services, has decided to nominate you
Chairman of Honor!
I give you the floor.
My friends, thank you.
Mr. President,
I'm very honored.

- Hi, Martin.
- Hi, Martin.
Hi.
We were up to Article 7.
We'll read it together.
Then we'll discuss it.
It's pointless. Once we decide to do something, we have to do it.
Not just "do it", but "accomplish it".
Which means studying the question in depth.
Thanks.
Planning it out.
Silence, please!
I need to reread the report.
It's just a bunch of papers!
And it's freezing in here.
Don't you think, Martin?
What did you say?
Nothing, I was talking to Martin.
With all these drafts, he's gonna get a cold.
Leave Martin be!
It's true!
Our skin and flesh act as a kind of overcoat.
But he's naked all year round.
- I demand silence.
- Fine. I'll shut up!
OK, I'll read it.
Report on the secret activities of the Able Cowards Club.
Statutes. Article 1.
The Club members' goal is to set sail for the USA.
Article 2:
The Club comprises three members.
Let's do a roll call.
Number one?
Present.
Number two?
Present.
Number three?
Present.
I'll continue.
Weekly night-time meetings will be held in the science classroom, presided over by Martin the Skeleton.
Article 4:
Members have sworn not to set sail individually.
I repeat: I say we strike that article.
Too late, you took an oath!
If you had a chance to go alone, wouldn't you take it?
- I'd go with you, or not at all!
- So you say...
Can I read the last notes?
Sure, go ahead.
A: Which airline do we choose?
B: How do we board?
C: What will we do once we reach free America?
D: Remember to study the St Etienne
Standard Catalog of Military Firearms.
E...
Footsteps.
It's Planet again.
Planet? Always Planet!
Is he a sleepwalker?
Not a sleepwalker, an insomniac.
It's the same thing.
So we�ll adjourn... till next week for the report?
And we won't set sail for a decade.
You're always griping!
No. I'm just saying.
You're "just saying" what?
If Columbus had worked this slow, he'd never have gotten anywhere.
You think he didn't study the map before leaving?
Study the map?
He took an egg, balanced it on its tip and took off in his ship.
That's how he did it.
And I'll do the same.
Now I'm going to bed!
Me too. Aren't you coming?
No. I wanna work on my novel.
Your "novel"!
What's this novel about?
It's about all the adventures we'll have once we get there.
Once we get there...
How depressing to hear this!
- Are you coming?
- Yes.
Chapter IV
Where the three Able Cowards, after making (and losing) a fortune, arrive at the Mexican border.
Second meeting with the mysterious man.
Why are you back so soon?
I saw something.
Sorgues?
I hope they didn't catch you!
No, but I saw something.
Something amazing!
Who's talking?
Who's talking in the middle of the night?
Unbelievable.
Tell us in the morning.
We'll pretend we're sick.
We'll be able to talk at the infirmary.
Yes.
Unbelievable!
What's all this chatter?
In the middle of the night?
I've never heard of such a thing!
I believe you're talking to yourself, my friend.
I'm sorry, Mr. Planet.
You're forgiven.
Come, gentlemen!
Come on!
Time to get up!
And be quiet about it!
Get up, gentlemen!
Come on!
Get a move on!
What're you waiting for?
Didn't you hear the reveille?
- Yes, sir.
- Well?
All that talking kept me awake last night.
So I wasn't dreaming!
There was talking...
Who was talking?
- It was... - Who?
- I don't know, sir.
I fell asleep right away.
Macroix.
- What're you doing?
- I'm sick.
- What is it?
- Red robin.
- What?
- My throat's red.
It hurts, as if a bird were pecking at it.
- Sir!
- What?
I'm sick too.
What have you got?
Same thing as Macroix.
It burns, it hurts!
- It hurts, sir!
- You too?
It hurts here.
How very curious.
- Sir?
- What is it?
I think I've got it.
- What?
- Red robin.
No, this can't be!
Morning, Mr. Planet.
Morning, Donnadieu.
I trust you slept well.
Please keep your jokes to yourself.
Jokes?
I suffer from insomnia, and every morning people ask me how I slept.
It's stupid! And uncalled-for.
Good morning.
Good morning, Lemel.
Good morning, Donnadieu.
Good morning, Planet. Slept well, Planet?
No, Mr Lemel. I didn't.
I never sleep.
You understand? Never!
Do I ask if your wine's well fermented?
You and your insinuations...
I'm just saying aloud what people say behind your back: that you drink... alone, in secret!
You're imagining things, Mr. Planet.
You have no character.
You're an oddball, a crackpot.
A sleepwalker, in fact.
As such, I despise you.
He despises me!
Did you hear, Mr. Donnadieu?
That lush despises me!
A man who drinks in secret and who reels along in public.
What? I, reel along?
- I dare you to repeat that!
- Don't start fighting, gentlemen.
Between Frenchmen, when war is imminent?
When the enemy's at our gate?
Good morning, gentlemen.
I trust you slept well?
Yes, headmaster.
I mean... no.
I mean... a little.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Walter.
That Mr. Walter doesn't look like a very nice man!
Indeed.
Gentlemen!
He looks like a perjurer to me.
Furthermore, he scares the children.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen!
Walter is undoubtedly a fine man.
He hasn't been here long, but his work is beyond reproach.
He may be slightly reserved, but he's an excellent living language teacher.
I don't like foreigners.
You shouldn't generalize, Mr. Lemel.
Like in everything, there are good ones and bad ones.
Well, I'm sure he's a bad one.
Good or bad, it's always with foreigners that we'll go to war.
Can't you watch where you're going?
Sorry, I didn't see you!
That's no excuse to step on my feet.
You gotta look before running.
You gotta look!
You hear me?
Yes. I'm not deaf.
What? Talking back to me?
Dirty little rascal.
I'll teach you some respect, you hear me?
You're here to obey, not to talk back!
You hear me? To obey!
You good-for-nothing!
Excuse me, Mr. Lemel.
You shouldn't yell at the kids.
They're fragile.
Children are sensitive.
Yelling scares them.
Think you don't scare them, with that mug of yours?
Trust me, Mr. Lemel, yelling is no way to teach children.
If I started yelling in your ear, to teach you respect...
If I started yelling like this...!
Gentlemen! What's going on here?
Well, headmaster, this lunatic is always provoking me.
Excuse me, headmaster.
Mr. Lemel is exaggerating.
I was just explaining something.
I'd like a word with you, Mr. Walter.
I'm telling you.
It's like he came out of the wall.
Then he disappeared again.
"Like he came out of the wall."
We get it!
You dragged us here for that?
I tell you: it's true!
Better quit writing novels; you're going batty!
You can laugh as much as you want, but something odd is going on around here!
Gentlemen!
Have you quite finished?
This isn't the visiting room!
We're not talking, we're gargling.
Then gargle in silence!
There! Now stay put.
You're not sick!
Why did you come here?
I lied!
It's my turtle that's sick.
We have to cure it.
- What's the problem?
- It won't eat.
- What do you feed it?
- Nothing.
- Why?
- I don't know what turtles eat!
- They eat lettuce.
- Lettuce? Thanks.
Who's that little boy?
He's younger than the others.
Mr. Brezillier's son.
The teacher who died.
He was a widower, so the headmaster and I decided to keep the boy on.
Brezillier was a strange man.
He dabbled in the occult sciences.
You believe in that stuff?
Not really...
I do.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
You're not likable enough, and you're aggressive.
Which explains the other teachers' hostility towards you.
Their hostility, headmaster, doesn't bother me in the least.
I'm here to work, so I work.
I ask for nothing more.
It's not just about work, here at Saint-Agil.
You have to make yourself likable too.
And it seems that even the children...
I mean...
You bother them...
You scare them.
Me?
I scare the children?
Mr. Mazeau!
Got any gum?
Gum?
Another American invention!
Eating rubber... it's ridiculous!
Do I eat my suspenders?
Got any lettuce?
- Lettuce? - Yes.
- Not here, no.
- I'll get you some later, son.
- Thanks, Mr. Mazeau.
Why did you ask for lettuce?
For the little one's turtle.
Are you eavesdropping again?
I wasn't!
This yard belongs to everyone.
But you're the only one who'll get a good spanking! Beat it!
They wanna beat me up, sir!
Not big enough to fight back?
It's three against one!
He's lying; we'd never gang up on him!
They would. They're always threatening me.
They always stick together!
Who knows what they're up to!
They even plot at night...
They're up to no good!
I never asked you.
Why are you telling me all this?
'Cause they're up to no good.
It's not nice to spy on your peers, Fermier.
If you don't stop, we won�t be friends anymore.
I'm warning you: we won't be friends at all.
I'd like to ask you a question.
Will you answer sincerely?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Do I scare you?
No, sir.
- No.
- No, sir.
That's what I've been told.
Then they're liars.
We're not scared of anything, anyway.
Thank you.
I didn't dare tell him, but sometimes he does scare me.
Why?
I don't know, he's kinda weird.
Silence, please.
For today's dictation, I've chosen a writer who's not on the curriculum, but I thought it'd be interesting, to get away from the classics.
His name is Wells. W - E - L - L - S.
H. G. Wells, who wrote many novels, the most famous being...
"The Invisible Man."
In English: "The Invisible Man."
First, I'll read a few excerpts.
The invisible man, is a man... who's found a way to disappear at will.
Obviously, this is just science fiction, therefore inconceivable.
No it's not; I saw it!
What could he have seen?
What's that, Sorgues?
You read this book?
No, sir, but I saw one.
"One" what?
A man who can disappear.
Silence, please!
Sorgues is losing his marbles!
Silence!
Sorgues...
I'm warning you.
I don't like that kind of joke.
Now for the dictation.
Chapter one.
The strange man's arrival.
The stranger came early in February...
I tell you I saw him!
Who spoke?
Was it you, Sorgues?
Yes, sir.
I said I saw him, as clearly as I see you.
- Who?
- The man who appears and disappears.
Here we go again!
Gentlemen!
Silence, please!
Please, keep quiet.
Sorgues...
I'm sorry, but I won't have you mocking me like this.
I'm throwing you out.
He's lost his marbles!
Maybe he really did see something.
Like what? The Headless Horseman?
I demand silence!
Go see the headmaster and give him this.
I thought changing the curriculum a bit would make you happy.
To my great regret,
I see I was wrong.
Therefore, today's dictation won't be "The Invisible Man", but the life of Shakespeare.
So Mr. Walter threw you out because you were clowning around, and you invented this far-fetched story as an excuse?
No, sir. I assure you.
It just came blurting out.
But I swear I saw that man!
A "supernatural" man?
And you just happened to see him in the science classroom.
At night.
And what were you doing there?
Huh?
Thorny question, huh?
I can't tell you, sir.
It's a secret.
A secret?
You have too vivid an imagination.
It'll play nasty tricks on you.
Here. Go back to class.
Why bother asking for lettuce?
Now that you've finished, we'll move on to another type of exercise.
Visual memory.
Take a quick look at both sides of this banknote.
Don't linger.
Quickly.
I repeat: to learn to draw well, visual memory is essential.
Grevin, for example:
What did you notice about the banknote?
It was a 100 Francs note.
And what'd you notice, Billard?
A man with an anvil.
And a woman holding a shovel.
- And...
- And what?
A hammer and an anvil.
Very poor visual memory!
And lots of numbers...
And what did you notice?
I noticed five women.
Maybe six...
Yes, sir: six women.
What's so funny?
They're naked, sir!
There's no point in going on.
You're looking without seeing.
That's why real masterpieces go unnoticed.
No one even bothered looking at the artist's signature.
The signature of the engraver.
Yet I once knew a brilliant engraver.
Do you know how he exploits his brilliance?
He teaches a bunch of idiots!
What's so funny, Macroix?
Always the Three Musketeers.
The same three rebels!
I'll lick you into shape!
On your feet, Macroix!
Baume, on your feet!
Sorgues, on your feet!
Sorgues, on your feet!
- Where is Sorgues?
- He's not here, sir.
He left without asking permission?
No, sir, he was never here.
Sorgues wasn't here for drawing class?
Where is he, then?
Sorgues's gone missing.
- Well?
- Nothing.
We asked everybody in town, but there's no sign of him.
As if he'd disappeared into thin air!
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, gentlemen.
I'm convinced the boy simply ran away.
Possibly.
Sorgues is an impressionable young man.
Maybe Mr. Walter was a bit too aggressive... when he threw the boy out of his classroom.
Please, Mr. Lemel!
I only did my duty.
Children are sensitive, Mr. Walter.
You should go easy on them.
Please don't speak to me in that tone.
I'm only stating my opinion.
It's no surprise that a student runs away from a boarding school, when one of the teachers scares the students!
Say that again and...!
Mr. Walter...
Get a hold of yourself.
Sorry, sir.
But there are times... when I can't help myself.
May I be excused, sir?
And to think some people refuse to believe... that there'll be war!
Please, Donnadieu, leave us in peace!
Sorry, sir.
Look what I found in Sorgues's desk, sir.
Very curious.
Travel brochures, catalogs, fares...
I believe our young friend premeditated his actions.
But he won't get far, that's for sure.
He might already be at home by now.
- Did you wire his parents?
- Yes.
Good.
Fetch his two friends, Planet.
Baume and Macroix?
Very well, sir.
Baume, Sorgues and Macroix.
A fine trio they make!
Hope you didn't shout it from the rooftops, Mazeau?
I don't want this unfortunate incident to leak out.
I was incredibly discreet, sir.
- Yet...
- Thanks, you can go now.
Fine, sir.
Yet, I'm extraordinarily worried.
I told you to go, Mr. Mazeau!
Fine, sir.
I'm worried because
I'm firmly convinced... that little Sorgues was hypnotized.
I'm sure someone here has the evil eye, and I'll prove it!
"Hypnotized"!
Why not "bewitched"?
The occult sciences will end up turning Mazeau's head.
- But it might be true.
- What?
That someone's got the "evil eye".
Mr. Lemel, you're not being coherent!
What?
How dare you say that?
And if front of Mr. Donnadieu, the worst gossip in the school?
That's not very nice, sir.
That's not very kind.
I've had it with being spied on!
- One of these days...
- One of these days, what?
Come in.
You may go.
Fine, sir.
What are you doing here, Mazeau?
I'm thinking.
I'm more and more convinced that the boy was put to sleep.
Put to sleep?
I know what I'm talking about.
Hypnotism.
The eyes...
You can't understand, Mr. Planet, since you never sleep.
Maybe it's Planet who's got it.
Got what?
The evil eye.
The evil eye...
So you refuse to answer?
We're not refusing, we can't tell you.
'Cause we don't know anything.
Fine.
I appealed to your sense of honesty and loyalty...
I was wrong.
I swear Sorgues didn't tell us anything.
I swear it too.
Goodnight, headmaster.
Goodnight, Mr. Planet.
- Sweet dreams!
- Right...
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr. Walter.
Good night.
Don't you find it odd that
Mr. Walter is going out, given that he rarely leaves the school?
You're the odd one, Planet.
A student's disappeared and now you see mystery everywhere!
There's mystery in books, but rarely in life.
Trust me.
- Good night, headmaster.
- Good night.
You shouldn't have come tonight!
Something's happened.
That's precisely why I came.
I doubt you really know what happened.
Obviously! No one tells me anything.
They use me, spy on me, watch my every move.
You have a persecution complex.
That's not good.
I've had it!
I feel like everyone suspects me!
It's unbearable.
There are times when I just wanna blurt it all out. It's suffocating me!
Blabbing might suffocate you even more.
It's fair to say it'd suffocate you for good.
What're you doing here?
I came to keep you company.
'Cause I know you don't like drinking alone.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
Me neither.
What're you reading?
Albrecht Durer's biography.
A brilliant painter.
Other people's lives interest you?
Obviously, since I botched mine.
What're you moaning about?
You make a good living.
"A good living"!
No?
It's none of my business, but I'd love to know how you spend your money.
See these reproductions of Albrecht Durer?
Well, they're not reproductions!
They're originals.
That's how I spend my money.
Wonderful works of art!
Genuine masterpieces!
I don't like art; it's useless.
How dare you say such a thing?
Not so loud...
Careful.
Let's have a little game.
As you wish.
Do you really think art is useless?
Useless!
Once you hang it up, that's it.
It's over.
Huh?
I'm a simple man.
I like simple and fun things.
A knife, a box of matches...
These are simple, fun things.
With a knife, you can sharpen a pencil.
With matches, you can start a fire.
With a knife, you can also slit someone's throat.
With matches, you can burn a house down, or start a forest fire.
Huh?
What can you do with a painting?
Number 8.
I've got it.
I've got the 12 too.
Lottery games are just great!
To think some people bother playing chess!
- I�ve got that too.
- You must be cheating!
Number... 90.
I've... got it.
Number 78.
- I've got that too.
- Screw this game!
Mr. Lemel...
I came here today to tell you, as nicely as possible, that you absolutely must stop drinking.
Huh?
Alcohol's bad for you.
Makes you do stupid things, makes you say stupid things.
Unless you drink it like me.
That is: on occasion.
I demand to know what was done to that boy!
In a respectable boarding school, boys who don't sleep in their beds at night must be punished.
Let's start with roll call.
Baume? Present.
- Macroix?
- Present.
Sorgues?
Sorgues is declared missing.
Let's read the minutes.
"We disapprove of Sorgues's behavior,
"He wasn't supposed to leave without us.
"Especially without telling us.
"Without money or a sense of initiative, without a working knowledge of English,
"he's bound to fail.
Serves him right!"
Sign it.
I won't sign. I don't agree.
He was right to leave.
- Planet.
- Yes, Planet.
We'd better go back to bed.
Five cases of sparkling wine.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Good.
14 boxes of cookies. Good.
Four cases of lemonade.
Good.
Hey, where are the banners?
Got the mail, Mazeau?
I didn't have time for that, Mr. Planet!
I'm taking deliveries.
It doesn't look good.
Tomorrow's Saint Agil Day... and the banners aren't here yet!
The mail's on my desk. - I'll sort it.
Every year the banners get here at the last minute!
How hard can ordering banners be?
What poor organization!
How odd!
What?
A postcard for Baume, from America.
America? That's incredible.
And from New York to boot!
Signed "Able Coward".
What an unusual name!
"Able Coward"?
Looking for something, Mr. Walter?
Yes, is there a letter for me?
No, sir.
Thank you.
He asks about a letter every day, but he never gets any.
Bizarre...
Say!
Could this postcard be from Sorgues?
From Sorgues?
It's possible! He's been missing for two weeks.
But it's signed "Able Coward".
So? It could be a nickname.
So where's my lettuce?
You promised to get me some.
Don't worry, I'm on it.
Baume!
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
It's incredible!
He's a bastard because he left alone, but he made it there, and that's just incredible!
Why's it addressed just to you?
Dunno...
How rotten!
He could've sent me one too.
Or addressed it to me too.
They'll question us.
Planet was gawking at me!
We've got a spy in our midst!
This is what we do to spies!
We rub their ears.
Then we tear 'em to pieces!
You're hurting me! You bullies!
You fat lumps!
Hey, here's your lettuce!
Thanks, sir.
- Macroix, out!
- But, sir...
Macroix, I order you to leave!
If it turns your crank...
How dare you...?
After I order you to leave, you dare say to me,
"if it turns your crank"?
If that's the way you want it, it's off to the headmaster's office for you!
If it turns your crank.
Gentlemen, after this unfortunate and unpleasant incident, we'll play "March of the Giants".
On my command!
Headmaster, when I noticed Macroix's absence,
I told myself:
"That's it, he's gone missing!"
Don't be alarmed, children.
You can sleep in peace.
Your schoolmate can't be very far.
But how extremely unfortunate!
Extremely, headmaster.
- Headmaster?
- What is it?
This afternoon, in the schoolyard,
Baume and Macroix said a lot of things.
We'll discuss that tomorrow.
It's time for these young ones to calm down... and get to sleep.
Come now!
Time for bed!
Headmaster.
I searched everywhere, and found absolutely nothing.
But I got to thinking, and something struck me.
A mysterious detail, which worries me more and more.
I think you'd better go to bed, Mazeau.
Yes, sir.
When Sorgues disappeared,
I found his lettuce on the floor.
Macroix asked for lettuce and he's disappeared too.
But now I can't find his lettuce.
Why is that?
That's the question.
Why lettuce, and for whom?
It's a mystery!
Where'd they go?
Pipe down!
Anyone still up in three minutes won't be attending the festivities tomorrow night.
What'd you tell the headmaster?
Tell me or I'll break your nose!
Don't. I gotta tell you something.
What?
You lost your postcard from America, right?
How would you know?
Did you swipe it?
No, but I know who did.
I asked for silence, remember?
Lights out, gentlemen.
Come in.
I want my postcard back, Mr. Walter.
Your postcard?
What postcard?
The postcard from America.
You picked it up off the ground.
Give it back.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fine.
You don't trust me?
I trust no one here.
MARTIN THE SKELETON.
Sorgues, declared missing.
Macroix, declared missing.
- Baume...
- Present.
I knew I'd find you here.
"Martin the Skeleton, or the Adventures of the Able Cowards".
This is all very clear.
The other two ran away, and you planned on joining them.
You won't have to bother!
You're expelled from the boarding house.
You three were troublemakers.
Two are gone, and when you leave, there will be no more trouble!
I'll wire your guardian to come pick you up.
Till then, I advise you to behave.
You can attend the festivities tomorrow.
It's all I can do for you.
Hernani!
I tell you the time has come.
My time.
What will you do with me?
Your choice: the dagger or poison!
What have you done, poor wretch?
- You asked for it!
- What a horrible death!
No, Hernani, don't.
Everything's going dark, Dona Sol.
Are you in pain?
I feel nothing.
Do you see lights in the shadows?
Not yet.
Dona Sol!
Look at me.
Closer, still closer!
Is she dead?
I am accursed!
Magnificent!
I love it when the dead come back to take their bows!
It's the world turned upside down.
It should be the living paying homage to the dead.
To the buffet, children!
It was good, wasn't it?
Help yourselves.
Tragedies make me thirsty.
I believe you've had enough champagne, Mr. Lemel.
What would you want me to drink, headmaster?
I gotta leave the lemonade to the kids!
Besides, champagne isn't bad.
It's the teetotallers who are evil.
Right, Mr. Walter?
You look like death warmed over.
Actually, you look like a spy!
Please, Mr. Walter...
Please!
Stop making a spectacle of yourself!
Why?
I have my reasons for drinking.
I could tell you my reasons.
In fact, I will tell you... sir!
If you don't shut up, there'll be consequences!
Consequences?
I'm finished; a failure!
Consequences mean nothing to me.
Come, Mr. Lemel.
Let's go take a walk and get some air.
Why?
There's nothing left to drink, here.
I've set aside a few bottles in my room.
Mazeau, you're a peach!
You lead, I'll follow.
Come.
One shouldn't make a spectacle of oneself, headmaster.
Come, Mr. Lemel, come!
Yeah, I drink! So what?
If I were a success - a great artist, for example -
I'd be commended for it.
All the great men drank.
Even the Great Charlemagne!
Henri IV liked the sauce... too.
I know, I know.
Come, Mr. Lemel!
Ravaillac drank too!
Michelangelo... Robin...
Robinson Crusoe.
Du Guesclin.
Philip the Fair.
Come, Mr. Lemel!
Philip the Fair.
What a man!
He had the Knights Templar burnt at the stake, because they were spying on him.
Served them right!
They're spying on me too.
'Cause I got something in common with Philip the Fair.
Let me tell you...
Headmaster!
What's the commotion?
What's going on?
I don't know.
The fuses must've blown.
Get the emergency lamps.
Please remain calm!
Nobody move!
Headmaster!
Mr. Lemel fell.
The lamps, sir.
Mind the younger ones.
He fell over here.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Quick, get a doctor!
- No. Wait.
He's dead.
A horrible accident.
Yes.
An accident?
Yes, an accident.
It's awful.
He almost fell on top of me.
I was here and he fell there.
Close call!
Mr. Planet, please contact the chief of police.
Fine, sir.
Mazeau, replace the blown fuses.
- Fine, sir.
- Here. - Thanks.
Come on, boys. Time for bed.
Come on.
Go to bed, children.
- He fell from the second floor.
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't bleeding much.
- Yet he must have fallen on his head!
Since you're here, hold this.
I'm checking which fuses blew.
This one's OK.
This one too.
This one too.
It might be this one.
It was.
Now go to bed.
- The party was going so well!
- But ended so badly... - Alas!
You say Lemel drank a lot?
He's dead now - we can say it.
He was a drunk. Especially tonight.
I get it. He undoubtedly fell over the balustrade.
Mr. Boisse, could you pinpoint... the source of the blackout?
I'm not sure.
A short-circuit, no doubt.
We've always had... electrical problems here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to examine the exact place where he fell.
A simple formality, before
I can give you a burial certificate.
Come on, gentlemen!
Time to get up!
Up!
What's the holdup?
Quick!
Time to get up, Baume!
Baume!
Where's Baume?
- Have you seen Baume?
- No, sir.
Baume's gone.
That's the third one!
Already finished?
Don't wolf it down!
Easy...
Briquet's right, this isn't normal.
After Sorgues... Macroix.
And after Macroix, Baume. Who's next?
I'm gonna write my folks.
I don't wanna stay here;
I'd rather go to public school.
Say!
Maybe there's a vampire here.
- A vampire?
- Yeah, a bloodsucking vampire!
I don't wanna stay here...!
- I want to leave.
- Calm down now!
It's getting stifling now.
If you ask me, it's a bad omen.
Trust me: all hell's gonna break loose.
Hell's gonna break loose!
Like a thunderstorm!
- What?
- War.
That's three missing now...
I came to get my postcard.
And I found it.
Don't come any nearer!
Stay where you are or I'll scream!
I'll scream!
You're crazy!
What's wrong with you?
I don't trust you.
I don't trust anyone here.
You're scared of me?
I wasn't before, but I guess I was wrong.
Don't come any closer!
Stay where you are!
Fine, I won't budge.
How'd you get in here?
Everyone's looking for you.
They think you've gone missing too.
I'm not missing.
I just pretended to be.
There are things I need to find out.
And I will.
- First of all, why'd you take my card?
- Why?
Because Sorgues's disappearance seemed strange to me.
I wanted to know...
Know what?
Who'd sent that postcard.
Sorgues sent it!
No, it wasn't Sorgues.
He may not have mailed it, but he's the one who wrote it.
I recognize his handwriting.
- Only...
- Only what?
He didn't add Martin's secret sign.
Which means he was telling us something's wrong!
I know what's up!
Sorgues didn't go to America voluntarily.
He was kidnapped!
I have more proof.
Sorgues was writing a novel, the only thing he cared about.
He left without it!
So what?
It means he didn't have the time to take it with him!
I don't know who took him away, but I'll find out.
Have a close look at that card.
And you'll see... that the stamp is a fake.
This card did not come from New York.
It's just been dropped in the school mailbox, by someone who wants us to believe... that Sorgues has left for America.
Who might that be?
I don't know yet, but I'm trying to find out.
Maybe it's you.
Are you still suspecting me?
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
Maybe together we'll be able to solve the mystery.
I don't trust you.
You got so mad yesterday!
You threatened Mr. Lemel.
When someone picks on me,
I become violent.
Yes. Very violent!
That's why Mr. Lemel fell.
What are you saying?
You're crazy...
Do you really believe that?
I was just joking.
I know it wasn't you.
I was by your side when Lemel was murdered.
You have no evidence.
Here's your evidence!
Look, a fork.
A short circuit is very easily made.
Look.
And it's easy to push a drunk man, when it's dark.
I'm astonished.
Who do you suspect?
I already told you.
Everybody.
But me.
And you.
So, you trust me?
As far as the fork is concerned, you can't be blamed. I don't know about the rest.
Saint-Agil. What a curious boarding school this is!
I was making fun of Sorgues, when he said that he saw someone coming out of the wall.
I was wrong. He must have seen something in the science classroom.
And that's why he's missing.
I'll investigate tonight.
What kind of investigation?
I don't know yet, but I'll find out.
- What?
- I don't know.
Well, I'll go with you.
As you wish, but be careful... if you do anything stupid, everyone will hear me.
I won't be taken away as easily as the others!
Mr. Walter, what do you think of Philip the Fair?
Philip the Fair?
What are you talking about?
I'm asking you what you think of him.
Philip the Fair was a French king.
Lemel said he was like
Philip the Fair.
Then he fell.
Do you know what
Philip the Fair used to do?
Not much, I believe.
He was a counterfeiter.
That's odd...
Sorgues and Macroix have been kidnapped... because they've seen something!
Sorgues saw a man appear and disappear out of the wall, right here.
Out of the wall?
That's ridiculous!
You know what we look like?
Well...
We look like two idiots.
Sorgues saw a man appear and disappear!
- Enough!
- No!
I can't stand listening to this, over and over.
"Appear and disappear!"
I feel like I'm going crazy, or like I'm becoming an idiot.
Footsteps!
Come. We won't find anything here.
We will.
You're so stubborn!
I'm staying.
Go ahead and stay.
If you want something, you know where you can find me.
Philip the Fair!
What is it?
Nothing. I'm invoking the moon.
It's a Mexican tradition.
- Really?
- Yes.
...and Sorgues, held captive by the counterfeiters in the old Mexican mill, suddenly started invoking the moon.
And the moon said:
Able Coward.
"Able Coward"?
What does it mean?
Leave me alone!
I told you that I hate it when someone reads over my shoulder when I'm writing!
It wouldn't matter; I can't read!
- Why are you looking, then?
- I like it.
Well, I don't!
OK...
This boy's got a wild imagination!
How can he come up with all this stuff?
I already told you.
I don't like people reading over my shoulder.
And you can't even read!
It's not my fault if I can't read!
I've had it - this is my mill!
Your mill?
It's a fine one, for sure!
Nothing but ruins!
Ruins!
Ruins and dust!
Is it my fault if the industrial mills ruined me?
If my wife ran off with a big-shot miller?
Next you'll say it's my fault if you got into counterfeiting!
I had to do something...
I get bored when I do nothing.
Thank God the boy's here!
When I read his novel, it's the best part of the day.
Leave me alone.
Don't read over my shoulder!
I wanna know what happens.
Can't you read it aloud?
If it makes you happy...
"In this old and stuffy
"Mexican mill,
"poor little Sorgues was being held captive.
"It was Bernadin, known as Boulder Bernadin
"because he was so hard-headed
"who was put in charge of guarding him,
"because he was a stupid and illiterate brute.
"But deep down, he wasn't really a bad Mexican."
That's me, right?
He's talking about me in his book?
It's wonderful!
I'll get you some coffee for that!
"There was also Alexis the miller.
"He smoked a pipe all day long, like a poor devil.
"In his absence, his accomplices...
"talked behind his back, calling him a cuckold and laughing about it."
Now that's funny!
And acutely observed.
"The third..."
That would be me.
"seemed one of those people who talk all the time...
"and do nothing at all."
That's a keen observation too.
Enough already!
How can I write with all this talking?
I can't concentrate!
I need pens, paper and blotter!
Don't get upset now!
Take this.
It will cheer you up a bit.
It's strong, but I added extra milk.
Coffee's good for people who do brain work.
Thanks, Bernadin.
You're very kind.
I'll continue. "One fine day, Sorgues found out that "Three Stars",
"the students' nickname for their drawing teacher
" - due to his cognac drinking habit -
"was also part of the gang."
Three Stars...
Poor Lemel!
He won't draw the banknotes any more.
- It was you who murdered him?
- You're crazy!
I have never killed anyone.
Never.
Besides, I wasn't in charge of killing him.
I only had to keep an eye on him.
Wait for me there!
You're too young.
Go to bed and sleep.
What are you doing here?
I think it's dangerous.
- You want to rescue him?
- Sure.
Go get the others.
Tell them to wait for us on the first floor. Quick.
Go quietly!
Someone's talking? Who's talking?
Now they talk in the middle of the night!
I'm telling you: I don't want to go!
Shut up or I'll cut out your tongue!
Follow me.
I'm dreaming...
How funny, I'm dreaming...
I see Baume. Baume...
The third one to go missing.
So, what's this mill?
Just an ordinary mill.
Don't worry.
Get down.
Are we going to get in?
The most important thing is getting Sorgues and Macroix out of there.
- Have you seen Macroix?
- No. Maybe they've separated them.
Macroix is tough.
They must have locked him in the basement.
I want to get out of here!
Silence!
You could keep quiet without me having to ask you.
I want to get out of here.
- Go away.
- Those trees scare me!
Stay, then. But shut up!
- What are we going to do?
- We need a strategy.
Position yourselves for battle.
The third dormitory, the elders, will be our shock troop. To the front!
The second dormitory, our backing troop, to the right!
The first dormitory, the youngsters, will be our reserves!
To the back, quick!
This is what they call
"night manoeuvres"!
Silence!
Why did they lock them up in a mill?
To turn the millstone.
Like slaves!
Holy cow!
My butt is cold!
'Cause you're scared.
Do you understand?
We have to surprise the enemy.
Anyone want to volunteer?
To do what?
To come with me.
Into the mill?
No. I'm too scared.
- I'm going.
- Very well.
Now, everybody walk to the door.
Quietly.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
I don't like murders.
What's that?
Some copies.
Worthless samples.
A souvenir of Lemel.
You made up your mind, then?
Are you leaving?
Yes. Any counterfeiting business always ends up badly.
Not a word. Don't insist!
Look!
And there are three times more in the back!
These kids have some guts!
We are besieged by Lilliputians!
What do you want?
Sorgues!
Sorgues! Nothing less!
And Macroix!
Macroix?
Who's Macroix?
Our friend.
He's not here!
I've never seen him.
Oh, your friend! Sure!
How would you know?
He's here. In the basement!
Sure, in the basement!
Then go get him right now!
Right. Let's go get him.
Come on, to the basement!
Come.
Come on, to the basement!
The basement is 10 km away.
We're going to the station, what did you think?!
Leave it to me. Come on.
Did they hurt you?
They're nice fellows.
I had them under my thumb.
Who took you away?
You'll never guess.
- Baume, they have escaped!
- Who? - The gangsters!
They won't go far. Quick!
What is it?
All the students are missing!
It's impossible.
He's out of his mind!
He's completely crazy...
Mazeau!
Mazeau!
The dormitories are empty.
All the students are missing!
Huh?
Stop! Stop!
They're here!
What's going on?
This time it's war!
So?
- Don't you want to come in?
- No.
Why?
We're scared; we're talking about a crime.
And there's a murderer.
We don't want to be taken away.
Well, OK.
I'll go in with Sorgues.
Stop people coming out.
What if it's the murderer?
Take him prisoner.
Silence, now!
Sir!
Headmaster, sir!
It's disgraceful.
They're crazy!
It's disgraceful.
They forced us to go with them.
They say that you have taken
Sorgues away, that you have killed Mr. Lemel and Macroix!
Baume said that!
Then he said...
What did he say?
That you killed Lemel because he was going to talk.
This kid is a mythomaniac.
He's getting his revenge because I threw him out!
He took me away when I told him that I had seen a mysterious man in the science classroom.
When he dismissed me,
I went out that door.
Then he caught me from that one, while I was passing by.
Where I found the lettuce!
Headmaster... the evil eye... it's you!
Lemel's murderer, it's you.
And you've killed Macroix!
No. I wouldn't dare...
You've lost, Boisse.
Yes.
I've lost.
But I don't know anything about Macroix.
I couldn't hurt a kid.
I don't know where he is.
That's the truth.
I'm sorry, I fell asleep.
You're excused.
- Macroix is back!
- You see!
This is good news.
People in town were starting to talk.
I didn't want to tell you, sir, but you understand...
Macroix!
Baume, Sorgues!
How are you?
Where were you?
I went to America.
Are you serious?
Well, almost.
- Almost?
- I was in Le Havre, in Normandy.
I embarked secretly.
They caught me.
- It's incredible. Tell us more...
- Boisse is going to scold me!
You shouldn't worry about Boisse any more.
- No way...
- Yes!
Macroix?
- How do you do?
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.
- I'm glad to see you again.
Mr. Walter...
Do you want to attend our secret meeting in the science classroom?
Certainly. With pleasure.
- Hi, Martin.
- Hi, Martin.
Mr. President.
Mr. Walter, Able Coward.
The Able Cowards secret society, as a token of gratitude for your services, has decided to nominate you
Chairman of Honor!
I give you the floor.
My friends, thank you.
Mr. President,
I'm very honored.
I am afraid you come too late, doctor.
Yeah?
We'll see .. we'll see.
The mother is dead.
I think I can save the baby.
Come along, I'll need your help.
I'll need some hot water right away.
Doctors shouldn't go against the will of God.
Pray we should die, too.
- No, no.
She is a pretty baby, Karl.
Your sister, she was pretty too.
And what did it bring her, but disgrace.
I tell him now.
Better the baby die too, maybe?
The mother, she didn't have a wedding ring.
It is my business to save lives.
[ Baby crying ]
Helga.
Get to work there.
Helga .. pull off my boot.
Helga .. come here.
Helga.
Helga.
You are going to marry Jeb Mondstrum.
I say you are ..
- But she don't hardly know him, Karl.
She had plenty time to get acquainted.
You are not going the way of your mother.
You are starting out just like her, reading novels.
Getting crazy notions in your head.
Well it ain't going to happen in my family twice.
But, Karl.
- No.
What's in the blood is there.
No-one can change it.
When I see you married with a wedding ring ..
Then I have done my duty.
You can't go out in this storm yet.
Better stay here.
Make yourself at home.
Ah, goodnight.
- Night.
Goodnight.
No.
You know .. you are a pretty girl.
No.
Helga, you are as good as mine already.
Let me go.
[ Dog barking ]
[ Dog barking ]
[ Dog barking ]
[ Dog barking ]
Quiet, Major.
Oh, you're a girl aren't you.
Yes.
Well what ..? How did you ..?
Well come on out.
Please let me stay here.
I won't make any trouble.
What's the idea? You can't stay in here.
Come out, I tell you.
But your dog will bite me.
Oh nonsense, Major doesn't bite girls.
Come on.
Say, hurry up will you.
It happens to be raining out here.
Where are we going?
Where?
Inside.
House.
You know: house.
Doors, windows, roof.
House.
I think I'd better not.
You're not afraid of a house, are you?
Alright. Stay here then.
Oh, wait a minute.
Alright. I'll go with you.
Alright. Come on.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Hey, don't kid me.
You'd better take off your clothes.
No.
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.
I .. I mean you'd better change your clothes.
You are soaking wet.
Here, I'll get you something dry to put on.
I won't be a minute. Just get warm there by the fire.
Here we are.
Say, what?
Here.
You can wear these.
Thank you.
Pants.
Yes. Of course.
I haven't worn petticoats for years.
Hey, you'd .. you'd better go in here and ..
Change.
Just throw out your wet clothes and I'll hang them up to dry.
Well.
Say.
Who are you anyway?
Uhoh.
Never mind. Never mind.
We won't talk about you at all.
No, sir.
You know what we'll do?
We'll talk about me.
You know who I am?
No? Well, I'll tell you.
I'm Rodney.
Mr Spencer's little boy.
I'm thirty, white and unmarried.
I'm really a very fine fellow.
Never unkind to animals.
Never kicked babies in the teeth.
Always courteous when drunk.
Yeah, this is my old man's cabin.
He wanted me to become a lawyer.
So, obedient to his every word
I took a course in engineering.
Opportunity came to me in the guise of a bridge to be constructed in Detroit.
The competition open to all.
I'm here now, working on my model.
And after I win the competition I hope to go on and on and on and on and ..
Carve a great career for myself.
Will you have cream or sugar in your coffee?
Yes.
Alright.
There you are.
One?
Caviare?
Is that ..
To eat?
Sure.
Well.
It looks like ..
Like buckshot.
Well it isn't. It's fish eggs.
You know. Fish.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We'll have to have a little port.
To warm us up.
Skol.
Here we go.
You poor kid.
You're all in, aren't you.
You'd better stay here and get some sleep.
It's alright.
I'll take you home in the morning.
Well ..
I had better go now.
Now listen. You're not going out in that storm again.
No, sir.
You're going to stay here.
Look. This is my room.
You can sleep in there.
It's alright. I'll sleep out here.
See.
There you are.
Well.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
What are you thinking about?
I was just thinking how nice you are.
Okay. Goodnight.
[ Dog barking ]
Alright. Alright.
Hiya, Major. Hi, boy.
How are you, boy?
Well, good morning.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
Getting your breakfast.
What?
Getting my breakfast?
Well, I should say not.
If there is any waiting-on to be done around here, I'll do the waiting.
You sit down there.
You don't know what a good cook I am.
I'll take care of this thing.
What happened?
- I burnt myself.
Wait a minute.
Here.
This will fix it.
See.
It doesn't hurt now, does it?
No.
It doesn't hurt now.
Well.
It's morning. I ..
I guess I'd better be going soon.
It's much safer to travel at night.
Oh, come on.
Stick around here with me today.
We'll just forget about everything.
We'll have a lot of fun.
Huh?
Ah, sure you will.
I tell you what we'll do.
We'll go fishing.
Have you ever been fishing?
- No.
What?
Say, you don't know what you've missed.
There is the grandest little spot right down here with fish like ..
And do they bite?
Oh, come on.
Say you'll stay.
Will you?
Well.
Of course you will.
I don't know.
Don't shake it around like that.
You'll never catch one that way.
Hold it still.
Hey.
I've got a bite.
Alright, haul it in.
Where did he go?
Up in that tree.
Where?
- Here, here.
I'll get him for you.
Here.
Quiet, Major.
My fish.
You exaggerate.
Let me hold him.
Wait a minute. I'll get him off the hook for you.
Oh, let me hold him.
Here you are.
He's gone. Where is he?
Here he is. Here he is.
There he is.
- Yes.
Little fish.
I'm going to cook him for your supper tonight.
Hey, hurry up.
We haven't much time.
Coming.
Did you bring my shaving things?
Come on.
Now the brush.
And the soap.
Did you bring the soap?
Soap?
You don't expect me to shave without soap, do you.
Oh, you mean "soap"?
Give me that soap.
Give me that soap.
Come on now. Give me that soap.
Hey, quit stalling. You'll make me miss my train.
Give me that soap.
Now I've got you.
You bad girl.
Are you going to be good?
Are you?
Huh?
Yes.
Do you call that being good?
Huh?
Oh gee, I don't want to go, darling.
But I have to.
These drawings have to be in.
The competition closes in three days.
You understand that? Don't you?
And after all.
Six days isn't long to wait.
Is it?
No.
Not very.
Alright.
Come on now and help me finish packing.
Oh, you forgot these.
Oh yes.
You want these with you, don't you?
Sure.
Say.
Your father and mother.
Do you think they will like me?
Like you?
I should say they will.
I never had a picture of my mother.
I guess she never had one taken.
Just like.
Like she never had a ring.
Oh, Rodney.
I know now, that it wasn't true all those things my uncle said about her.
About her not being good because she didn't have a ring.
But you're going to have a ring, Helga.
I'm bringing one back with me.
Everything alright now?
Yes.
Oh say, I got to go.
Sure. But I'll be back before you know it.
Yep.
Now you take good care of yourself while I'm gone.
Eat lots.
Get plenty of good sleep.
Don't set fire to the house.
And don't take any wooden nickels.
Alright. Now we're ready. Come on.
Oh say, you forgot your bridge.
Oh yeah, the bridge.
The most important thing of all.
Can you bring it?
Yes.
- Alright.
This is as far as you'd better go, darling.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Be good. It won't be long.
Goodbye, Major. Bye-bye boy.
Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye.
Come along, Major.
You are going back with us.
No.
I say you are.
No, no.
You are going back now.
Come with me.
- No!
Did you hear me? You're going back now.
- I don't want to.
All aboard!
All aboard!
Say, shut that door!
I was trying to get out.
With the train going thirty miles an hour?
Give me a cigarette.
And a match. And a match.
Come on, come on. What are you doing?
I'm out.
- I'm out.
Four more.
Yeah? Here's your four and four better.
Come again.
- Yeah?
I'll just tap you.
What have you got?
- Four bones of fire.
That's good.
- I'll say it's good.
Hey Suzie, come here a minute.
Stick around. You brought me luck.
That's the best hand I've had since Sitting Bull sat down.
Sit down.
It's alright kid, sit down.
What's your name, kid?
Never mind. Meet the joint.
Hello.
Hello, Frenchy.
- Hello, Coco.
Hello, Burly.
- Hiya, Burly.
Hello Eva.
- Hello, Burly.
Who is winning?
For a change.
Yeah?
Well.
Who are you?
Oh .. this is Suzie.
Suzie?
- Yes.
Miss ..
Miss Lenox of Lenoxville.
She caught this train by mistake.
You can get off at the next stop.
How much does it cost to go to Detroit?
Thirty-three berries.
You broke, kid?
I understand. I ran away once myself.
Give me two.
Say, Burly.
- Huh?
You know that beauty that ditched this afternoon and married a local bootlegger?
Why don't you let Suzie take her place?
I never thought of that.
Stand up. Let me see what you look like.
Not bad.
- Not bad? She's okay.
Think she'll work alright?
- Sure.
Alright, Pansy. Have the wardrobe woman fix her up.
Uhoh, uncle. Come back with the ante.
I guess you got some that way once.
- You can never tell.
Hi, Suzie.
- Hello.
Where you been?
- To post something.
Oh, I suppose you mailed another letter to that guy?
Yes.
I told him I'll meet him at Marquette.
What makes you think he'll be there?
Oh .. he'll be there.
Oh, Suzie.
Come here a minute, will you.
I want to talk to you,.
Suzie.
Do you happen to know a man by the name of ..
Jeb Mondstrum or Mardstrum?
No.
Okay.
Now don't worry, Suzie. I ..
I told him there wasn't anyone around here who answered your description.
You had better not show today.
Just keep under cover until we pull out of town tonight.
The ..
The Sheriff told me they're watching all the outgoing trains.
Now, I can't stop them,.
But I don't think they'll search my private compartment.
So we'll fool them. You be there when we leave tonight.
Oh, hello Sheriff.
Have any luck? Did you find her?
No, but we ain't finished with them beauties yet.
Did you try looking in the wagon car?
We'll look alright.
Good luck.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
Right up this way folks, for the dancing girls.
The show starts right away, folks.
Next, I present for your approval, Major Crumb.
One of the strongest people in the world.
Would you believe that when he was only
18 years old he was over six feet tall.
But later in life he got married and settled down.
Just over here, the ladies from Arabia.
And then, from Arabia, the tattooed lady.
Why, folks.
One tour of this little lady's anatomy brings before your very eyes ..
Some of the most marvellous features of the world.
For instance, on this limb here ..
We have the Eiffel Tower.
Get at any eyeful of that and you don't have to go to Paris.
On this limb right here we have the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
Make it lean, madam.
I said lean, not fall.
Across the little lady's back.
We have a panoramic representation of the Statue of Liberty.
But here is one statue that you cannot take liberties with.
Look at, but do not touch.
Across the little lady's torso.
I said, across her torso.
We find the Atlantic Fleet.
In action.
What's that? Show you Chicago?
Why listen brother, this is an exhibition not a Cook's tour.
That will be all, madam.
Now on the next platform here.
Right this way folks, can I draw your special attention to this ..
Platform right here which has the beauties of all nations.
Right here, folks.
On your toes, you canaries.
First I present for your approval.
Miss Hula from Bermuda.
From the sandy beaches of Waikiki.
Bombay Beulah from India.
Well?
If you don't like it, what do you keep on looking for?
Oh, I'm sorry.
But they told me I could find Miss .. Miss ..
You ain't ..?
- My name is Spencer.
Rodney Spencer.
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr Spencer.
My name is Madame Panoramia.
They call me "Pansy" for short.
How do you do.
She may be a little dark boys, but she will be a bright spot in your memories.
Now folks.
For the sensation of all sensations.
And last but not least the attraction of all attractions.
I wish to present for your approval.
The Belle Zedema.
The favorite of the Sultan of Turkey.
But she escaped and his loss is your gain.
If he finds her I shudder to think of the consequences.
For when she dances, every muscle ..
Every fibre in this little lady's body ..
Sends out high voltage that will more than electrify you.
I'll ask the little lady to retire and prepare for her sensational dance.
Now, as I promised, folks.
I'm going to have the little lady from Honolulu dance for you.
Alright Pop, let's have a little music.
Take it away, lady. Come on.
Rodney!
Well ..
I'll be seeing you, Suzie.
Rodney.
Oh, it's nice to see you.
It's been so long.
I've been worried about you, Helga.
You sure you're alright?
Sure.
Sure I'm alright.
I'm so happy you've come to take me away.
Let's get out of here quick.
I'll just get my things.
That won't take me long.
Just a minute.
Hello baby. Come on, snap into it.
The supper will be ready in my tent in five minutes.
Hmm.
Who is your boyfriend?
What do you mean?
And I thought you were just a little hick.
Get rid of him.
What did you say?
Don't try to start anything around here, sap.
Please.
Give him the air. And be in my tent in five minutes.
What did he mean?
What right has he to talk to you like that?
What right?
Oh he ..
He.
Oh.
No, Rodney. It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my fault.
- Don't try to explain.
But they came to take me back.
- And you couldn't wait for me?
But they were going to make me marry Mondstrum.
And I'd have sworn you love me.
Rodney.
I do love you.
- You've a swell way of showing it.
It would have killed me if I'd had to go back to that man.
So you stayed and took this one?
He just called me a sap.
Well, he was right.
A sap not to realize how cheap you are.
Oh Rodney, don't say that.
I couldn't wait to get back.
To marry you.
To marry .. that's funny.
I should have paid you off.
Thrown a few dollars on the bureau. It's the kind of language you understand.
You don't know what you are saying.
- I even bought the ring.
Engraved with your initials and mine.
And the word "Always".
You said you wanted a wedding ring more than anything in the world.
Well. There it is!
Let me explain.
What will become of me if you leave me?
- I'll tell you what will become of you.
You'll go from one man to another just like every other woman in the gutter.
Gutter?
- Yes.
Alright.
But I'll make it a worthwhile gutter.
I'd always hated men until I met you.
Hated them.
But from now on .. it will be different.
So, you're on your way, sap?
Dinner is now ready in the dining car.
Dinner is now ready in the dining car.
How about having a little bite with me, lady?
[ Explosion! ]
Number 13!
Well, Spencer. I told you it would happen.
What is it, chief?
- A cave-in at number 13.
Anybody killed?
You should have thought of that before you neglected to put in the bolster.
I asked you if anybody was killed.
- It's no fault of yours they weren't.
A man can drink or work.
But he can't do both.
From now on you'd better concentrate on the drinking.
You're through.
Oh Mike.
- Excuse me, judge.
Yes, dear?
Oh Mike, dear.
Who is Friedman bringing tonight?
Well I believe he did mention his name but ..
The judge and I were talking politics at the moment.
Uhoh.
Well the next time I'll have Friedman phone me.
The table looks lovely, darling.
You go on with your blarney.
Marie, set two extra places.
I'll be back in a moment.
Hello?
Hiya, baby.
Is he really coming?
He ought to be here any minute.
I'm waiting for him now.
Swell.
New clothes and a little money straightened him out okay.
And did he fall for that yarn about
Kelly slipping him a juicy contract.
Oh, that's wonderful.
And he hasn't the faintest idea who I am?
Alright.
Oh, someday I'll tell you.
No, no. It's just a whim of mine.
I just want to pay back an old debt.
Would you mind explaining again just what I'm doing here, Friedman.
You want that contract don't you?
Yes. But this mysterious lady ..
What's she got to do with contracts?
My boy, the key to a big contract is Commissioner Michael Kelly.
And the key to Michael
Kelly is Mrs Lenox.
Is there ..
Is there a mister Lenox?
Now, is there a mister Lenox?
Well come on Rodney, here we are.
Good evening, Jane.
Take care of Mr Spencer.
Hiya, baby.
- Freddy. So glad you came.
Only, this is a very quiet party.
You won't enjoy it.
Don't worry, we'll suffer together.
- Yes.
Oh .. oh Rod.
Mrs Lenox - Mr Spencer.
What a pleasant surprise.
Mr Spencer.
You see.
One never knows what
Freddy is liable to bring in.
Well Freddy.
Mike.
How are you?
- Here's that man I told you about.
Mr Spencer, I want you to meet Mr Kelly.
Well I've heard a lot about you, Spencer.
Thank you, Mr Kelly.
- Have a little cocktail?
Yes do, Mr Spencer.
Sure. I think a cocktail will do you good.
You know the proposition I was talking about?      - Yes, Freddy.
I think it's going to go through.
A Martini?
No?
Well, perhaps you'd rather have ..
Have a little port, huh?
No thank you.
Some hors d’oeuvres?
Maybe some caviare?
You know .. caviare?
Looks like buckshot.
But it isn't.
It's fish eggs.
You know, fish.
Come and meet some charming people.
Did you like that, George?
I think the most amusing thing about men is they mistake cruelty for character.
They can't forgive.
They have no ..
No ..
- Tolerance?
Thank you.
I once knew a girl who went through hell for the man she loved.
But he had no .. tolerance.
So he told her:
"You are a bad woman."
"Go to the gutter where you belong."
As a matter of fact she did rather well for herself.
I knew an instance very similar.
Only being a man,
I learned both sides of the story.
Really?
I would love to hear you defend the male sex, Mr Spencer. Please go on.
True. The man I knew was intolerant.
But only because he was crazy about the woman.
How interesting, Mr Spencer.
Then he found out how much he'd hurt himself.
And being a man ..
I suppose he was afraid it would hurt his character if he went back, huh?
No. As soon as he cooled off he did go back.
He did go back?
Sure. The sap went back.
And as it usually is, he found the woman who was burning him up had gone off.
Probably with someone else.
Those people usually meet again sooner or later.
Surely he must have seen her?
Oh yes, he saw her alright.
She was sitting on top of the world.
Goody, goody, goody. I hope she didn't even speak to him.
You see, she couldn't resist the temptation to humiliate him again.
Well you know, women don't forget very easily.
They resent being called .. gutter.
I think we'd better change the subject.
Ah, but you mustn't miss the rest of the story.
That will interest you.
This woman.
Not content with smashing one man's life.
Went merrily on.
To the highest bidder.
Always a parasite.
The last I heard of her she'd sunk so low ..
She'd accepted protection from a shady politician.
Please, Mike.
I've had enough of this.
She'll treat you as she treated me.
When the next man comes along.
Only it won't hurt you because you're used to her kind of woman.
I want to talk to you.
I've nothing to say to you. If you were younger I'd slam you into the table.
Spencer, what's the matter with you?
- That goes for you or anybody else.
Rodney.
Goodbye, Mrs Lenox.
Susan.
Susan.
Susan.
It's no use talking, Mike. I'm leaving.
So this is the fellow you told me about. The first?     - Yes.
Now wait a minute.
Let's figure this out.
You can't run after him.
Why not?
If you leave here tonight.
There will be no coming back.
Do you realize that?
Yes.
But this man doesn't want you.
Of course he wants me.
All that bitterness and that contempt.
It's only because he is desperately hurt.
A man doesn't feel that unless he loves you.
Well it's a strange way ..
I don't expect you to understand.
I didn't until tonight.
I wanted to hurt him as he hurt me.
And then ..
Oh, I know.
Think of your pride.
Didn't I tell you I love him?
I'll make him see me as I was.
Susan, don't you realize what you're heading for?
What difference does it make?
As long as it's with him.
Saints alive, what is the matter with this house.
People coming and going and bells ringing.
Well?
- I'd like to see Mr Spencer.
Oh, that crazy egg. Sure, he's gone.
When do you expect him back?
He's never coming back. He's gone for good. Like a wild one he was.
Threw twelve dollars down on the kitchen table and rushed off with his grip.
Where did he go?
Maybe the big hotel at Timbuktu.
How should I be knowing?
Well, didn't he say anything?
Leave an address or something?
Didn't I tell you he was crazy?
Never a word did he say.
Susan.
Did you see him?
No.
He had gone.
Where?
I don't know.
Oh, Susan.
Come along with me.
Tomorrow you may feel different about this.
No, Mike.
I'll never feel different.
I've got to find him.
New York is a pretty big place.
I know.
But I'll find him.
Where to, lady?
What?
- Where do you want to go>?
Oh, I don't know.
Just keep on driving until I tell you to stop.
Okay.
Goodnight, Pepe.
- Oh ..
Do you think you ought to go in there alone?
Well, I've been in there every night this week.
That's one of one of the toughest places in these parts.
Come in and have a drink with me.
- No thank you.
I'll be getting back to the yacht.
- Goodnight.
A table?
The American. He is here again.
Oh .. be nice to him.
He buys so much wine.
And big tips.
Oh baby. Come darling.
Come, darling.
Tired?
A little.
I've done the same dance eight times tonight.
Why not come out on the yacht?
It will be cool on deck.
- I'm not interested in yachts.
You know, I'm beginning to believe you.
Well, is that so hard to believe?
Yes and no.
I can see a little halo around that head alright.
But it hardly fits in with this.
Well, there is no halo, my friend.
Then why not sail with me?
Arabia.
Egypt.
Ceylon.
Sunshine. Pretty clothes.
Contentment.
When the cruise is over, you won't find me ..
Well, how shall I say it.
Financially ungrateful.
What's the matter? Don't you like me?
Better than any man I've ever met.
With one exception.
You are very interesting.
Perhaps I'm in love with you.
Anyway, I find it hard to leave this port.
All my life I wanted to meet a man like you.
Understanding.
And now that I have met you.
I haven't anything to offer you.
Everything I have belongs to him.
Any news?
No.
But it can only be a question of hours.
They send him down for a spell every three months.
He's a week overdue.
Of course I shouldn't say this really ..
But has it occurred to you that he might never come down?
A lot of them don't, you know.
That swamp is a hotbed of fever.
Why did you have to say that?
I thought perhaps if you knew definitely that you would never ..
Don't, don't.
- Why not take me?
There wouldn't be a single wish of yours I wouldn't ..
But I've told you what
I've been through.
Even to get this near to him.
A woman could go up there and be with him now.
You don't think I would leave when ..
- A lot of women jump at the chance.
I know.
Each time I write.
Or phone.
Alone.
One room for tonight, baby.
Make it snappy.
Hey, Suzie. The boys are here from up the river.
Rodney.
How are you?
Well, I'll be ..
Leave him alone. You know the rules of the house. I saw him first.
What are you doing here?
I'm working.
Oh yeah?
Next stop Algiers and then Port Said, eh?
Oh no.
- That's the route they all take.
You leave him alone. He belongs to me.
Let me speak to you alone.
Alone?
Sure, why not.
- Oh baby.
Beat it, beat it.
You're looking pretty good, old playmate.
You don't understand why I came here.
Oh no?
Penthouses and politicians don't last for ever, do they.
Alright.
Sit down and have a drink.
Well, why don't you sit down?
No thanks.
What have you got to say to me?
So many things.
But I'll say them.
Some other time.
Frightened little one, or just being coy?
Well, now that we've said hello.
What kind of a toboggan brought you down here?
I left Kelly after I saw you.
That night.
You took your time about catching up with me, didn't you.
It cost money. And I had to work.
Same old trade, huh?
Since I last saw you.
No man has had a minute from me.
Not even a second.
You lie.
No man since then.
Well.
What do you want?
Our love for each other has made such a wreck of everything.
Your fault as well as mine.
I thought that we might try again.
You know.
You're the only woman I wanted to build a fence around, and have all to myself.
You built the fence.
An army of men.
But I never wanted anyone but you.
But there never was a time that I wouldn't have been as true as heaven.
If you'd only let me.
Oh, Rodney.
I'll do anything for you.
Go anywhere you like.
I'll share anything.
Or nothing.
We should forgive each other.
And try again.
We've got to forgive each other.
Rodney.
Ah, why talk about forgiveness?
Why ask anything different from me?
Every other man you knew took you at your own price.
Nothing.
This time.
I'll take you as I find you.
No!
No, no.
Sorry.
I thought you might need me.
Oh .. one of your clients, eh?
No, she don't need you.
She's got a date with me.
Beat it.
- I don't take orders.
No?
- None of that, please.
I happen to know all about this.
I think you're making a great mistake.
I wish she'd marry me.
She is fine.
Marry?
Hey, listen.
All you need is the price of a marriage licence.
Just the price.
Not the wedding.
Just the price.
Did it ever strike you for a second that you might be wrong?
What right have you to take a stand like this?
What right?
Do you know why I wallow up in the swamps?
Do you know why I never drew a sober breath on the waterfront?
It's heat .. booze .. insects.
Damp-rot and sweat.
But it eats up the memory of you.
Come back. You come with me, yes?
Ah, get away.
[ Door knocks ]
Okay.
I'm all set.
Come in.
This is a surprise.
Yes, I am on my way.
The barge is leaving for up river.
Nice of you to come and ..
Say goodbye.
So you're going to get married, eh?
Don't you care?
- Sure I care.
That's why it will be nice to know that you are set.
And happy.
Wouldn't you like to go .. home?
There is a schooner sailing tonight.
Why don't we leave on her?
These hurts that we have inflicted upon each other.
It's become a bond.
Nothing can break it.
We are just like .. like two cripples.
Twisted.
Only together can we ever become ..
Straight.
You have a queer way of looking at things.
[ Ship's whistle! ]
Come on, Rodney. Shake a leg will you, boy. That's the second whistle.
Go ahead. I'm coming.
Let me do that.
Oh no, please.
Let me.
So you’re going to get the ring at last, eh?
He seems like a pretty niçe fellow.
I'm glad you're getting that rîng.
You know what would happen if you'd come with me?
You'd have to cook ..
Wash ..
Live in a dump.
- Yes, I know.
I'd drink.
- Not if you were happy.
Every time a man came along, I'd ..
I'd wonder.
I'll make you believe in me.
T-G oö
The terrible Vladinoffs, they may have a tip.
You know, he used to run horses in Russia before he became minister of interior.
Hello Alexandra.
- Hello.
- What do you backing?
I suppose one really ought to put something on the king's horse.
- How loyal.
- In Russia you always back the tsar's horse?
No, in Russia I genuinely back my father's horse, I do at least know they are trying.
Oh, then you know more about them than I do my dear.
- That's not very difficult Father.
- There's the king's horse.
- There's the king's horse.
- There he goes.
- Hello Fothergill, how did you find your...
- Hello.
Yes, my final visit to England.
I'll I've left on the king's horse.
- How much?
- Five up.
- Good luck.
- Good luck.
I see you've been press correspondent in Russia five years.
- Yes.
- Going back to the same job?
No, this time I'm translating
English novels for a publisher.
- Have no difficulty with the language, eh?
- No, very little in speaking and...
- not much in writing.
- When you leave?
Tomorrow night, chain cross.
Thank you.
Goodbye Alexandra.
And thank you for the lovely flowers, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Alright Alex, I'm sorry you can't stay for shooting.
Oh thanks, but there's plenty of shooting where I'm going.
- Bear, wolves?
- No, everything, even ministers.
Take a seat, please.
Excuse me sir.
Dinner is served.
Dinner is served.
Why is the dining car always at the other end of the train?
Hold your head up, Countess.
Countess Olga Vesselro.
Princess Nina Volchonsky.
- Is my back all right?
- For the tenth time, yes.
Oh, I know I'm going to faint.
Countess Vera Brastov.
Countess Alexandra Vladinoff.
Daughter of the minister, betrothed to Colonel Adraxine.
Countess.
We congratulate you,
Colonel Adraxine is a very lucky man.
What a lovely child.
Anna Sprohoff.
- What did His Majesty say?
- He congratulate you.
- Colonel Adraxine is a very lucky man.
- And so I am.
And Alexandra is a very lucky girl, aren't you darling?
- Why, of course she is.
- Of course I am.
- I hope it will be a success.
- Of course it will be.
He is the greatest fool in the guard and she is the cleverest girl at court.
Mr. Fothergill.
Some more please,
- Hello Fothergill.
- Hello Stanfield.
- You are in a hurry.
- Yes, I've to go to the police.
The police? Well, are you lunching at the London Tavern?
- I hope so. Sorry, I'm late. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Tyevsky's Route, 40.
- Anyway, you admit you write this article?
- Of course.
It's an attack on the imperial government.
Not an attack, merely an account of the system of government.
In your opinion, if you were
Russian it would mean Siberia.
Your permit to remain in Russia is canceled.
But my whole future is bound up in Russia.
You have 48 hours to get out.
Look here see, you don't realize, I,
I've worked here for years, I love Russia.
I've tried to make the English understand that the Russian outlook...
I'm sorry but I have 23 appointments before lunch.
If everything else fired but it cleared out in 48 hours. 48 hours, two days.
There it is, six years hard work completely chucked away.
- There are other jobs, of course.
- Not in Russia.
- Certainly.
- The police have chucked me out.
- Not if you do the right job.
- Well, what, for instance?
The British Secret Service.
- Be a spy?
- Why not?
You're not afraid of the word, you'd be serving your country.
Wouldn't have to give anyone away, all we want is information.
- Information of what?
- The revolutionary movement.
Now, my job is to recruit young Englishman like yourself... who can speak Russian well enough to pass as Russians.
Go on, what's the catch?
Well, if you're caught, your number is up.
But I, I could claim
British nationality, wouldn't I?
No, you couldn't do that.
If you did tell the truth,
British authorities would... politely disclaim all knowledge of you.
It is a case of, heads they win, tails I lose.
- Bit one-sided, isn't it?
- Well, it's the chance we all take.
The pay is rather good.
Would it interest you?
No, I don't think so.
- Oh, cream please.
- Yes sir.
Well, think it over.
- How do you do Fothergill?
- Good morning.
Pleased to see you, come along.
I'll introduce you to our general manager.
Oh, thanks.
Well, aren't you a bit surprised to see me this morning?
Well, takes a good deal to surprise me, you know.
This way.
But surely the police will be there to see me off the premises, won't they?
Naturally, at the evening, a man carrying your passport will leave Russia.
You collect his luggage at the station and board the night express for Germany.
That's the fellow you got to look like.
- Peter Ouronov, who's Peter Ouronov?
- You are.
That's your name for the future, you'd better memorize it.
And what's Peter Ouronov's first job?
To join the revolutionary movement.
There's a man named
Axelstein, he runs a bookshop..
I've got the pamphlets from Zorin but think the distribution will be difficult.
- You think you can manage?
- I'll do my best.
Ah, it's lovely, beautiful.
Yes, that's the 1840 edition.
Do you seen Maronin today?
No, he ought to have been here half an hour ago.
Hope nothing is happened to him, such a hot head..
- What about this one?
- Yes, that's very good.
- Maronin?
- You know what happened?
For the third time this month, 20 students arrested.
- Yes, 20.
Five of them gassed.
You know what that means?
Exiles in the north and their work stopped.
- Sounds dreadful.
- Yes, you said dreadful.
- What do we do? Nothing.
- No, no, no...
Does anyone ever do anything?
We just talk and talk and talk.
Quiet, you young fool, if you want to talk...
I, I have taken the liberty of telling your Excellency's coachman...
- to go by the Nietshoc Bridge.
- But that's a long way around.
I have to meet my daughter and it's already...
- Fit Your Excellency.
- Pard me Excellency.
- Prudence your Excellency, is essential...
- Prudence?
That your show of police around with him, insights the terrorists.
But I am personally responsible to His
Majesty for your Excellency's life.
- Oh, let's go, let's go.
- If I could...
Do you like it Father?
- Are you happy dear? Really happy?
- Of course dear.
God bless you my darling.
I'll be ready in a few minutes, can I come home with you?
No, not in my carriage, I couldn't risk it.
Not as things are just now.
Hello darling.
It's all too vague, it's no proper plan.
Anyway, we haven't got the package through Norway yet.
- I have enough jelly left for two oranges.
- We need four.
- Maronin is quite sure of himself.
- Oh, his impatience will ruin everything.
Maronin is an impulsive nut, what's more, he's always late, half past nine.
- Here he comes.
- At last.
- You're late.
- I'm sorry, I had a client.
- May I?
- Yes, go ahead.
A client, a police officer I couldn't get rid of him.
We all agreed that the business must be postponed.
- No, I agree with Maronin.
- There's no time to work out a proper plan.
Oh, all I need to know is the route and the time.
The wedding procession is across the bridge at 5:15, the second carriage is Vladinoff's.
What the devil you doing here?
Look at this place, close the bridge.
- Call the ambulance.
- Right sir.
Warn the horsemen.
- You, phone the minister.
- Yes sir.
Are you all right?
- Is my father hurt?
- His Excellency is safe.
- He's not wounded?
- Not a scratch Countess.
Thank God.
- Father, father...
- It's all right my dear, it's all right.
You get in the next carriage.
Come in.
Come in.
Alexis?
What's, what's the matter?
What is it? What's, what's happened?
- Nothing, it's all right.
- Come over here.
Whatever happened?
They got me, he fired as I ran.
Just out right, through the buff.
- You mind if I stay here a little while?
- No, no, of course not.
- There may be danger to you.
- Danger? Don't be a fool.
I'm sorry to be such a bother to you.
Go on, forward.
- You political prisoner?
- Yes, but I'm no better off than you.
- Tell me, how far is to Siberia?
- Take us at least six weeks.
Something ought be done about these dining cars.
Lunch wasn't good but their dinner was simply uneatable.
As a soldier I'm accustomed to privations... but the caviar was filthy and the champagne is certainly not 1906.
Now what the devil is happened?
- The train stopped sir.
- I know that, you fool. What for?
I'll go and see sir.
- Colonel Adraxine?
- Yes.
Urgent dispatch Colonel.
Bad news?
Splendid news, general mobilization.
You know what that means?
- War.
- War, at last.
Prisoners for Vatterus get ready to leave.
- Hoflosev.
- Yes.
- Bernstein.
- Yeap.
- Nevski.
- Yeah.
- Osipenko, Osipenko.
- He's there.
- He's a fever.
- Never mind, come and help him up.
Come on, get up there, come on.
- There's a doctor where you're going.
- All right.
- Rinkoff.
- Yeah.
- Payden.
- Yeah.
- Chiskim.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Give me four packages of that...
- You can only have two.
- How's that?
- The most we're allowed to sell prisoners.
- It'll have to do then.
- Give me two.
- Sugar?
- Over there.
- Excuse me Captain, are we to remain here?
- What's your name?
Ouronov, Axelstein.
Axelstein?
- No, you're to go to Roskovensky.
- Roskovensky, I never heard of that.
I have.
- Here?
- No, east of that.
- About here?
- Somewhere there.
It's over 1,000 berths north of here.
- The world's end.
- Yes, the world's end.
- We're leaving in a few minutes, get ready.
- This has just come.
Spreads like fire, doesn't it?
Yes, looks as though all the European countries will soon be involved.
Ready sir?
- The sled is here.
- Ready?
The sled is here, we can start out.
Would you mind telling us the latest news, we've heard nothing for several weeks.
- You knew Russia was at war, didn't you?
- No, we didn't, with what country?
Germany, France, England,
Austria, they're all it.
- Not England?
- Yes, England.
- Looks as if the whole world is coming in.
- England?
Well, war is one thing you won't to have to worry about Roskovensky.
- War.
- That's what we'd been waiting for.
Come on, come on. Last in, come on, get at.
- Ouronov, what's the time?
- What is that matter?
Night for six months... and a blasted cold hell for two years.
It's 11:33 in the morning, if you're really interested.
Nights, nights, nights.
Night, always nights.
Never ending night.
Nothing but night over all year.
The sun must be dead.
Everything must be dead.
We're the last things alive.
Sorry Axelstein.
I've to be melodramatic once in a while.
Calendar finished yet?
I can't be quite sure whether it's
March the 15th or the 16th.
- I suppose it makes little difference.
- Well, at least we do know that it is 1916.
Two years in this frozen hell... while the rest of the world turn upside down and inside out and no tobacco.
I've been working out a theory Ouronov.
The Imperial Army is sure to be defeated.
Perhaps, even now the war is over.
Russia's fate is in the hands of her own people.
There's bound to be a revolution.
Ah, and listen to this.
Comrades, the work fellas and people, the last hour of the struggle is here.
With a fist of arms, we must wipe out the bourgeois... and aristocrats from the face of the earth.
Death or victory, now or never.
Comrades, on behalf of the Soviets of Klintsy
I ask you to honor us Comrade Axelstein... by accepting the position of chairman of the Soviets of our town.
All you have skilled work will have to join the Red Army, fall in.
Next.
- Have you any papers?
- Come with me.
- Just a minute.
- It's Comrade Axelstein.
- I'll take it.
- Oh, thank you.
This is my dear comrade and friend...
Peter Ouronov, the man who was sentenced with me to exile.
You can't go home now... they've made me Commissar of
Klintsy and you're my assistant.
Olga...
Paola, Elizabeth...
Elizabeth...
Elizabeth...
Ivan, Ivan...
Martha, Martha Bedoyna...
- What do you waiting for?
- Come on.
What's the matter with you? She's only a woman.
I wasn't trying to get away, I was, I was born here.
Born here were you, well, now you can die here. See to it.
The next one.
Give me shirt, give me shirt.
- Is she in there?
- Yes.
- Can we have a look at her?
- No.
My orders are to wait until
Comrade Axelstein arrives.
- Take away.
- See that you carry them out.
And what is more, all this senseless destruction is got to stop.
Don't you understand? You're destroying...
- the property of the people.
- All right, all right.
The point is what we going to do with the woman, I say shoot her and be done with it.
- No.
- Why not?
Here is an order requiring us to send her to Petrograd for...
Waste of time, Wee got the rifles, we got the wall and we've got the woman.
- And we got the order.
- Here, whose side are you on?
- On the side of revolutionary discipline.
- Revolutionary fiddlesticks.
How much is she promised you to let her go?
Be careful Tomsky or I shall report you to the Central Committee.
Report me? You'll hear some reports before the night is out, I promise you.
There's going to be trouble here unless we get her away.
- Yes, and not much time to lose.
- Well, it's up to you.
You start at once, you can reach Saratuse before dawn and take the train to Petrograd.
Get up please, get up.
- Who are you?
- I'm the assistant Commissar.
I'm ready.
Wait.
- Am I not to be shot?
- No.
But I want to be shot,
I hate you all, I despise you.
You're red vermin, long live Russia, long live the tsar.
- What must I say to make you kill me?
- I have to take you to Petrograd.
- Why?
- By order of the government.
- Then in Petrograd?
- That I don't know.
But they'll kill me in Petrograd, why not here?
I have my orders.
And I must obey them, I'm sorry.
And it's better that you should obey them too.
- Why?
- Well, it's better.
- Let's go then.
- You can't go like that.
Unless you want them to tear you to pieces?
I'll try and find you something that will make you less conspicuous.
Parator Station as quick as you can and don't step for anything.
Come along, better hurry.
Halt, stop the horses.
Stop those horses.
- Your orders?
- Axelstein.
It's cold, don't you let me put this around you?
Already dawn.
Wait.
Station master? Station master?
Good morning, comrade.
- You are the station master I suppose?
- I am the station master.
When you expect the next train to Petrograd?
- Train number 617 to Petrograd at 2:20 PM.
- Will it be on time?
The 2:20 is always on time.
Go back to Klintsy and report to...
Comrade Axelstein that I'm at the first train from Saratuse.
I was to go with you comrade.
You go back to Klintsy and report as ordered.
I go back to Klintsy comrade, and report as ordered.
You know you've nothing to fear from me, don't you?
I know Commissar.
- Where the guards?
- I sent them back to Klintsy.
- Were those your orders?
- No.
- Thank you.
- Why did you send them back?
- Didn't like the look of them.
- Were you afraid of them?
Afraid for me?
Now that you're alone, aren't you afraid that I'd try to escape?
Where could you go?
Yes, you're right.
Where could I go?
Go back to Klintsy, Comrade Commissar.
He wants the woman to himself.
There's plenty of money, did you not see it?
I did, go back to Klintsy, eh?
- Yes.
- Afterward.
And report that he joined the train at Saratuse, eh?
You've got it.
Thank you.
- What's your name Commissar?
- My name is Peter Ouronov.
Peter Ouronov?
- Where are you from?
- Oh, you wouldn't know the place.
- Oh, sorry.
- It's far away?
Very far away.
- You know my name?
- Yes I know, is Alexandra.
- Were you living in Petrograd?
- Well, I was but I'm not to leave my orders.
Oh yes, your orders.
Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd...
Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow...
What did he say the train?
I didn't hear any, did you?
Hey, just a minute.
I, wait here, I'll go and see.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats, please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Where is train?
Take your seats, please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
But I don't see the train.
The train is that are seen are being blown up.
- Is the train coming?
- No, it's mistake.
I'm afraid we're in for rather a long way.
Think you better try and get some sleep.
It's not very comfortable but don't know when you'll get another opportunity.
You're very tired, you know.
- Please try and sleep.
- Thank you.
Why don't you try and get some sleep?
No I, I think I'd better stay awake.
- Where are you Commissar?
- I'm here.
Why is it all so quiet?
At stations one always hears whistles, signals, bells.
Well, the bells are out of order, try to sleep.
I can't sleep.
Been trying to pray.
- You don't pray, of course Commissar.
- Sometimes.
When I was having long sleepless nights
I used to try to repeat verses to myself.
- You had sleepless nights?
- Siberia.
- What verses?
- Oh, Shakespeare, Browning, Shelley.
But they are English poets.
- Have you been a student in Petrograd?
- No, at Oxford.
But it was very seldom that Russian students went to Oxford.
My father wanted me to go to Oxford.
I see.
Say some of your verses.
- Browning.
- Browning?
You must not fear death...
fear death to feel the fog in my throat, the mist in my face.
- Oh, I'm afraid I'd be boring you.
- Go on.
Well, just the end, I admire it.
For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave.
The black minutes at end.
And the elements rage, the fiend voices that rave...
shall dwindle, shall blend, shall change, shall become...
first a piece out of pain, then a light,
then thy breast. Oh, thou soul of my soul, I shall clasp thee again.
And with God be the rest.
- You like it?
- It's optimistic, like the English.
Listen to a Russian poem.
It is hopeless and pessimistic, like we Russians.
I have grown weary of my little dreams.
I have outlived the hour of my desire.
Alone with tortured empty heart I will be...
beside the ashes of their dead gray fire.
The lasting wind of destiny has blown the roses of my glory with its breath.
Go on, don't stop.
- And listen for the shambling feet of death.
- Louder, louder.
Since solitude has made winter in my heart, now like the last frayed lonely leaf am I.
Know how to use it? Go on. Get back.
It weighs upon the storm, right forest bound...
- Why did I do that?
- Was in self-defense.
You saved my life and probably your own as well.
Train number 617, train number 617.
Train number 617.
- I'm going to...
- Do you strong enough?
- I'm alright to wait outside for the train.
- I'm afraid there are no trains.
No train?
What are all these people hurrying for?
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take, wake up, wake up, take your seat, take your seat please.
Take your seats, take your seats please.
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd, take your seats please.
Take your seats. Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
- Just a moment, just a moment.
- No, leave me lone.
I'm not going to hurt you.
All I want to know is where you're going.
- The forest.
- The forest, why? To hide?
Come on, you can tell me.
Fresh soldiers, they was headed to us, the other army.
Which? The whites?
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm not going to hurt you, all I want to know is which, the reds or the whites?
- The whites.
- Are you sure?
Yes, Cossacks, Cossacks.
All right, go.
Did you hear that?
- Seems the Whites have retaken Saratuse.
- I heard it.
Well, it's about a mile from here, can you manage it?
- Yes.
- Come on then.
- Cossacks, it is the White Army.
- Yes, it's the White Army.
Go to the outpost, you better shout out as you get near in case they try to shoot you.
Ask at once for an officer.
Tell him who you are and tell him to take you to the Commandant.
Say that you've escaped from a Red
Commissar who was taking you to Petrograd.
Ask for his help and try to get at once to the south.
Goodbye.
- And you?
- Oh no, I'll be all right.
Safe journey to you.
- Would you allow me to thank you?
- No, no, no.
- Goodbye.
- Comrade Ouronov?
Yes?
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Outpost number four.
All right, pass.
- Next?
- Anton Pakrovsky.
Red town Commissar.
- Anything to say?
- I am a peaceful citizen.
I was made Commissar against my will.
Take him out.
But Captain, I am innocent,
I swear it, I am innocent Captain.
- You don't understand Captain.
- Next.
Vivan Lupien.
Corporal Tamaneff of outpost four reporting a prisoner.
What's she been doing?
Came to the outpost and wanted to see the commanding officer.
- Your name?
- I'm the Countess Adraxine.
I want to see the commanding officer.
- And what business had you at the outpost?
- I want to see the commanding officer.
- Answer my question.
- Are you the commanding officer?
Answer my question or you'll be sorry for it.
General...
- Alexandra Nicolei.
- Andreyevitch.
My dear Alexandra.
But what in heaven's name is all this?
I very stubbornly insisted on seeing the commanding officer.
And the captain, very rightly, wanted to know what I was doing here.
Come with me Sasha, we'll look after you.
Why, in a week we shall retake Klintsy.
Yes, you will be back in your own home.
- Could I possibly have a bath?
- Yes, certainly.
- Karevsky?
- Coming Excellency.
Here, Excellency.
The best room you have for the countess and a bath.
Well, I can manage the bath your Excellency but...
- There's no but.
- Well Excellency, there's no soap.
Lieutenant Gregorin?
- Yes sir?
- A cake of soap for the countess.
- Yes sir.
- Thank you, General.
- I'm sorry to give you so much trouble.
- Oh, it's no trouble at all.
- And I hope you'll preside at our dinner.
- I would love to.
But I can't appear like this.
Certainly do something about it.
- What about this one?
- It's getting better.
- And aren't they wanting you in the house?
- Yes, them want.
I think is somebody at the door.
- Dresses for the countess.
- Good gracious.
I hope you brought enough.
Well, she can't dine with us without a frock.
No, more is a pity.
You don't know what you're missing.
Your dresses have come.
I think there are about 50 of them.
Will you please go and lay them out on the bed?
Gentlemen...
Go on, please don't stop.
Will you have a glass of champagne Countess?
- You all right Sasha?
- Yes.
But I can't believe that I'm really here.
In safety with friends...
- and to hear music again.
- Yes, it's all over Sasha.
Cheer up.
- Now Countess, what are your plans?
- To leave Russia.
Leave Russia?
Why, in another month, we shall be in Petrograd.
- Of course.
- You are coming home with us.
Shall we dine?
- What was that?
- No cause for anxiety, Sasha.
- What was it?
- Just a matter of routine.
They weren't killing the Red prisoners?
They were executing some commissars and a few other Red bandits.
Where are you going?
Well, I lost the company,
I've been on patrol duty.
Fall in with us, we storm Saratuse in an hour.
Get up, the Reds are here.
Get up, you fool, the Reds are here..
Get in the cellar, down there.
- Lukovsky.
- Here at your service comrade.
This vodka is filthy stuff.
You can do better than this.
Well, I have some special bottles in the cellar but there's not enough for everybody.,
Everybody? But I'm not everybody.
- Bring them up.
- At once comrade.
Nikolai Rakof.
The former of the White murderers.
- Responsible for the death of 43 comrades.
- I tried to save all I could.
- I can bring witnesses.
- Take him away.
- Don't, don't, comrade...
- Next.
Fellow comrade, without me they can decide nothing.
- Who?
- The commissars.
What's more, they're all cowards.
- To your health.
- Good health to the delegates.
- Good health to the delegates.
- This is my round.
- Welcome comrade, come on.
- They get treating us all.
- Oh, no, no thanks.
- Come on, drink, come on.
- Come on, have a drink.
- Have a drink.
- Why worry?
- Forget it.
Drink.
- That's better.
- Shall I tell you a great secret?
Soldiers are soldiers.
White or Red, there's no difference.
They can order you about but what can they do?
Shoot, kill, destroy but, but I organize.
- Can you organize comrade?
- Yeah.
The reorganization of the economic life... on the basis of the ex-appropriation of the means of production.
Bravo.
Did you understand that?
- Yeah.
- You did?
Do you want to reorganize the boot factory?
I'll make you commissar for reorganizing the boot factory.
No?
Theater? No?
Electricity, that's very important.
We're going to electrify the whole country.
Prisons? No?
- Hotels?
- Oh, what did you say about prisons comrade?
We'll reorganize everything. There it is.
With my signature on that commission, you'd be in charge of the prisons.
Good health to the comrades. Bravo, bravo.
- Reorganize everything.
- Every real thing.
You organize everything, eh?
- What's become of this Countess Adraxine?
- She's in the prison.
Take two men and bring her here.
Hello comrade, what about a little vodka before we go home?
No, brother, we better not, drink it yourself.
Very sorry comrade, the woman prisoner is already been released.
- What? What on earth?
- The commissar went to the prison.
- What? Stop that brawl there. Commissar?
- Yes, with a special order.
Devil he did, what fools we've been.
We must get them both, man and woman.
Call a search party. Send a hundred men.
- A hundred men?
- A hundred men.
- Don't sit down there waiting, get on.
- Come on.
- Can we rest here?
- Yes.
- We safe here?
- I hope so.
- There must be brook somewhere.
- The Gulburch Brook.
- You know this forest?
- Belongs to me.
It belonged to me.
We mustn't rest here any longer.
I'm on the run now as well as you.
- Shall we go?
- Not just yet.
Why?
I'm afraid the searchers are coming in the forest.
What do you want me to do?
There someone in the woods, not far from here.
Think we'll be safe here.
- You keep your nerve now, won't you?
- Yes.
Swear you'll kill me before you let them get me.
Swear.
Alright, I swear.
Get in there, they're coming through.
It's our only chance.
Keep still, don't move, don't say a word.
- Found anything yet?
- Who are you?
- You're not our company.
- No.
- What company are you?
- What? Third.
What the digging you doing here? This is our beat.
Oh, it's the devil's own job comrade, I...
I'm no forester and I lost my way because I lost my whistle.
- You're not going to drink alone?
- No, only an ox drinks alone, have it.
How can I answer? I've lost my whistle.
You let me drink and I'll whistle, will you?
- Let's sit here and finish this.
- No, no, we can finish that as we go along.
- Come on, they'll be looking for us comrade.
- Oh, it's a dog's life comrade.
Where are you going?
- They're over there.
- No, they're not, they're there.
- We heard them.
- Is he with that outfit?
No, no, I'm with the others.
Oh, he's all right, we can go along together.
- Is the flask empty?
- Not quite.
Hello?
Hello?
- Don't be afraid, tell me where you are.
- Here I am.
Were you thinking that I wouldn't come back for you?
When did you fall in love with me?
First time I saw you, get up I said, get up.
You turned and I was lost.
Listen.
Good news.
- What is it?
- Heavy guns.
Mean they're fighting again.
They'll give up the search.
And in a few days, we'll be able to leave the forest.
Don't you like my forest?
I adore it.
Hello, comrade.
- Any luck?
- The skies opened and mana fell from heaven.
You ready? Catch.
Did you call this outfit mana?
Well, I thought we'd better look like refugees than soldiers.
Keep still just a minute, there.
- Come here.
- I wanted to see myself.
Careful.
Where did you pick them up?
Pick them up? If you'd heard me bargaining for them and for the other things.
- Did you bring some food too?
- Did I bring some food?
I don't believe it.
- Lobster.
- Yes.
- Jam.
- And...
Brandy.
There's enough there to last us for days and days.
I think that old boy must be the champion looter of the revolution.
- And all he wanted was your wristwatch?
- Well, what's the use of a wristwatch... in a country where trains are apt to be a week late?
Oh, yes, train.
- We have to find the train.
- And we can.
The old boy tell me, we're not very far from the line to Kazan.
We must go down into the plain.
- How far is it to the nearest station?
- The nearest station?
There 10,000 people waiting for the train at every station, just wait here.
You'll see, we'll stop them.
Get out of the way, get off the track.
Get out. Stop. The train is full.
Get out.
There's no room in here. Get out of me.
- Please, my sister can't walk anymore.
- Let go of me and get off.
Come on, where there's so many there's room for two more, come on.
Very nice, would you like them comrade?
Do you like me comrade?
Nobody can leave the station without a pass from the commissar.
Right.
- Show your hands.
- Pass.
Inside.
Pass.
- Pass.
- Show your hands.
Inside.
- Inside.
- They allowed you to go.
- Go, please.
- Pass.
- The name?
- Fredo Moramo.
- From?
- Moscow.
- Where you going?
- Astrakand.
- What for?
- To be with my family.
- What was your job in Moscow?
- I was a clerk in an insurance office.
Every word a lie, you're Conola, managing director of the Pudalafki works in Petrograd.
You financed the White bandits.
You conspired against the
Republic of Workers and Peasants.
You're a fugitive from the justice of the people.
And you're on your way to the White Army.
Condemned to be shot.
Next.
Show me your hands.
- Why did you send him in?
- I didn't Comrade Pushkov.
- He came with the woman.
- Who is the woman?
My sister.
Step up, show me your hands.
These are the hands of a woman who... never worked in her life.
- Your occupation?
- I was a lady's maid.
Worst sort of counter revolutionaries.
Like relics, lady's maids.
- Your name?
- Anton Andrea.
- From?
- Tchekerovsky.
- To?
- Subhorsk.
- What for?
- I have a brother there.
My sister needs nursing.
- Why?
- She was ill.
- What illness?
- Typhoid comrade.
- Why aren't you in the army?
- I was ill.
You too? Sensitive family.
3/4 of the population of
Tchekerovsky were sick with typhoid.
- What's your occupation?
- Electrician.
The army needs electricians.
I'll leave my sister with my brother and report for service in the army.
Pass.
Countess.
Good afternoon, well rehearsed.
Countess Alexandra Adraxine, nee Vladinoff.
Daughter of the bloodhound Vladinoff, fugitive from the People's Justice.
- What is your name?
- Maria Andreas.
Don't be ridiculous Pushkov, look.
Yes, there's a slight resemblance.
- Slight?
- Slight.
- Well, what else I need to prove her guilty?
- Proofs, witnesses.
- What? Expect a grand duke to turn up?
- No, but there's Lieschen.
What about Lieschen?
Lieschen was a gardener on the Adraxine estate.
- I'll fetch him.
- Stand back.
Next.
- Your name?
- Ivan Smirnoff.
Just my size.
Load.
Present, fire.
Did you find anything on him?
Yes comrade, sewn in the lining of his coat.
A White spy, condemned to be shot.
Come here, stand here.
Turn your face to him.
Lieschen, look at that woman.
- Who is she?
- I don't know comrade.
- Have you never seen her before?
- Never comrade.
Lieschen, you were a gardener on the Adraxine estate.
- I was.
- You ever see the countess?
Very often comrade.
Are you ready to swear that this woman is not the countess?
In front of the altar comrade.
That's all, take her to the guard room.
And now what?
Honored guests of the revolution?
No, I have to report to the checker in Samara, I'll take them with me.
Waste of time.
We've no right to shoot this woman unless we can prove her guilty.
- Rubbish.
- If found guilty, they'll both be shot.
- The train leaves in an hour.
- Next.
Next, next.
Pass.
Blankets? Blankets.
I'm afraid it was an ordeal for your sister,
I'm sorry, but we can't be too careful.
Yes, yes, of course.
I think it best that we make ready for the night straight away.
- Oh, let me help.
- Thank you.
- You must be tired out and ready for sleep.
- Yes, I'm tired.
Oh, let me go up there.
- It's Quite all right, you go below.
- No, but, surely...
- I really insist.
- Oh, it's very good of you.
- When do we get to Samara?
- Tomorrow evening.
- Tomorrow evening?
- Yes.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
I'm afraid you won't find it very comfortable here.
Feels quite luxurious to us, we've been traveling for three days in a cattle truck.
- Shall I shade the light?
- Yes, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Where could that other boot have got to?
- Oh, here it is.
Thank you.
Hello?
- No more commissar?
- No, I didn't hear him go.
- Don't worry, he won't be far away.
- What you think of the fella?
- Was very polite.
- Well, that's something, anyway.
What's more, he strikes me as an honest man.
You're right.
That's not going to make things any easier for us.
Come in.
- Oh, tea.
- Yes, I got it from the engine driver.
Thank you.
- No thank you, I've had some.
- Are you sure?
Yes, really.
Well commissar, are we going to face another trial in Samara?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
And when that happens, perhaps it might be wiser... to tell a more convincing story about yourselves.
Don't you think we were speaking the truth then?
Would ever be truth without trust.
You, for instance, don't trust me, obviously not.
- At any rate, we owe you our lives.
- Even that was a matter of hard lying.
You should thank
Lieschen, he's a marvelous liar.
Shouldn't we also thank you commissar, for telling him what lie to tell?
Oh no, no, you mustn't think it like that.
My own lie was a very poor one compared with Lieschen's.
What was your lie?
When I said that photograph bore only a slight resemblance to you.
Actually, I thought it a pretty good one.
- You don't think I'm going to admit it.
- No, of course not.
Don't let's admit anything.
I don't really care who you are.
- Yet you made every effort to save my life.
- That was because I like you.
Did you?
Well... since you don't care who
I am, there's no reason why we all... shouldn't be the greatest of friends.
Oh I hope that perhaps you share some food that I've got.
I'm afraid the bread is very stale but there's a little cheese to go with it.
Don't you think, if the commissar is so kind we might share our food?
- We brought some with us too.
- Oh?
Oh but, oh but this is amazing.
To think that I offered you my stale bread.
We are very grateful for it.
- I haven't had a picnic like this for years.
- There's even enough for supper tonight.
And this to wash it down.
- You don't know Samara?
- No.
Our army is just take it from the very important people... all kinds of people, who are all kinds of things before the revolution.
There are bound to be many who knew the Countess Adraxine in person.
And no Lieschens, eh?
The perfect Lieschen is the rarest of all creatures.
I see.
So you're warning us.
Hardly as much as that, but I'm wondering what's going to happen to you.
- I mean, none of us know that.
- No way.
No, but I thought you might possibly have something in mind.
I'm afraid we just do what we can as a rule.
- Don't we?
- Me and you.
- Just take a chance if it comes along.
- What else can we do?
- You had luck so far?
- A wonderful luck.
And the most wonderful of all was to meet you.
Do you think so?
Yes, I do think so, even if tomorrow means the end of us.
As it may do.
Tomorrow may mean the end of me too, if it does... will you remember me?
Forgive me for saying that your sister.
I understand Pushkov, we both understand.
Before we reach Samara tomorrow, I'd like...
Oh I, I most humbly beg your pardon.
I don't know what you must think of me behaving like this.
I think this brandy, I'm not used to it, I...
No it's, it's quite understandable.
We've all been through a great strain.
Isn't it good to stretch your legs again?
How peaceful.
This is just a small place on the Volga.
If you go down there, you come to the river in about 10 minutes.
See some barges tied up for the bank for the night.
Believe they sometimes take a passenger if there money to pay.
Some of the barge men are
Tartars grand old fellas.
This is really the most interesting part of Russia.
Only so few people see it.
Excuse me, I must go and get our order stamped by the commissar.
You know, I, I pity him in a way, he's such a boy..
Do you realize we've got to escape now?
It's almost dark and there's mist.
- We should've a chance, surely.
- Yes, I believe you're right, we should.
- How with the boy?
- What about him?
He might, he might suffer for it.
Yes, that's true.
What's happened?
- The commissar shot himself.
- Deliberately, through the head.
Oh dearest, quickly. There's no time.
What is it? What is it?
I just realized that, that if this is what he wanted us to do.
Of course. Come.
Forgive me dearest, we're going too fast for you.
A train, the train...
What is it darling? What is it?
Do you hear the whistle?
Do you hear the whistle?
Don't leave me.
We're approaching Astrakand.
As soon as we arrive I'll fetch a doctor.
Papers? None?
Go on.
Everyone on deck, medical inspection.
Nobody else on the barge? Nobody ill?
- Come on, speak up.
- A woman, a man is gone for a doctor.
Well, I'm a doctor.
Now dear children, don't be frightened, we won't eat you.
Here, take this, it's chocolate.
- Stretcher.
- Coming sir.
- Attention.
- Attention, attention.
Anisimov.
Sparisov.
Lewkin.
Arbukov, Nebralenko.
Ivanovski.
Lomov.
Muspin.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Calinin, Ouronov.
- Ouronov.
- Ouronov.
Where is Ouronov?
Pevich.
Trustav.
- Are you ready?
- All ready to fire sir.
- Stop, stop.
- When the next batch can go, launch them on.
Right, left, keep march.
Get up, what are you doing? Get on.
In a few minutes, it won't hurt you anymore.
Shoot you fool, get after him.
Hey, young fella, what you doing here?
Doctor.
- Well?
- I just saw him go somewhere in there sir.
Hear, you can't go in there, this is Red Cross Hospital.
- There's an operation going on.
- Well, I'll wait till it's over.
I know this is unbelievable doctor...
I've no proof, I've no papers, nothing but you must believe me.
- I'm no cause to be here but for her.
- Of course I believe you, will you be quiet?
How can I tie up your wound if you don't stay still?
- It's all right, I'll keep still.
- Nurse...
- Yes, doctor?
- Let me go that list.
Yes sir.
Read out the names of the women leaving for Bucharest.
Elisabeth Von Samnov Pachova.
Anna Grigorovich, Maria Ocash.
Sofia Lyevich, Baronet Maria Nithrop Narozen,
Countess Alexandra Nicolaiva Adraxi...
- Adraxine, you mean she's on that train?
- It's too late.
Get out of my way, I have to take that train.
Alexandra, Alexandra...
- Alexandra.
- Here, here.
Princess, the reasoning for the lack of reason of my reason is so unreasonable that it is not without reason that I complain of your beauty.
Don Quixote, your soup is ready.
Uncle...
He should be in a madhouse. They'd soon give him all the victories he wanted.
Oh, but he doesn't harm anyone.
- Doesn't harm anyone?
- No.
What is he doing to you when he sells all his property piece by piece?
What will you say if he mortgages the house?
Victory! Victory!
And that fool of his, Sancho, even took the horse to town today.
Aw... more books!
Ah, well at least they haven't gotten rid of Rosinate.
I don't know what the poor beast's going to eat now they've sold the last bit of land...
Last bit of land?
What do you mean?
Lively, Sancho, make haste!
I'm comin', I'm runin'...
Here I am.
What's this I hear?
A madman, do you see? Now he's gone and sold his half acre.
Has he really sold everything to buy books?
Just as I thought! He wouldn't take the horse.
He just took one look at the poor beast, and he said,
"That's not a horse, that's a hat rack!"
Of course I may know nothing, but I can't see why you exchange good land, land you can walk on, land you can grow things on, for old bits of paper!
And what do you get out of it?
Better clothes? Better food?
All I can see is it makes you uncomfortable.
Armor clothes me, battles soothe me.
Oh, and by the way, he threw in this old helmet as well, if it is a helmet.
But it has no visor...
Oh, you mean a flap. I'll soon fix that.
Sancho, doesn't your heartache with the injustice of the world?
I can't say I've noticed it up to now.
You shall be my squire and if return
I'll make you governor of the many kingdoms I shall conquer.
Oooh! A island, Master, that's what I want, an island with plenty of good land, and plenty of good wine on it, and plenty of water'roud it...
To keep out the soldiers and thieves alike.
Ladies and gentlemen, this evening...
Big performance, Amadis of Gaul,
Pantomime given by the well known Priaca Players.
Tell your friends.
Who do you think you are? Acting all day with your head in the clouds doesn't put bread into our stomachs, you miserable worm.
You will regret calling me these names when I come back laden with riches, when I bring you back silks and satins, and a booby crown - er, a ruby crown, when I'm proprietor of an island, a real island with real water'round it...
...and cows and chickens and pigs...
And doctors examining you?
An island with a wall'round it, a madhouse, that's where you and your Don Quixote will finish up.
Why both of you together have got the brains of a child.
The Sierra Nevada is calling, is calling.
The night in the mountains is falling, is falling...
There's nothing left in the house but old papers.
We can't raise money of them.
What will become of Maria and me?
Don't worry Carrasco, something will happen.
- Listen...
- I hear singing...
His madness continues even though we've put him to bed.
The Sierra Nevada is calling, is calling.
The night in the mountains is falling, is falling...
Go fight, Don Quixote, the powers of dark,
Go fight, Don Quixote, the powers of dark.
For you, my lady divine, for you
I will conquer or die.
Oh, is he never going to stop?
How many songs does he know?
It's all very well for him to sing. A madman never worries about mortgages and starvation.
It is only the fever... it will pass.
The Sierra Nevada is calling, is calling.
The night in the mountains is falling, is falling...
So fights Don Quixote the powers of dark.
Go fight, Don Quixote, the powers of dark.
The princess enters on the stage.
Watch her simplicity, her grace...
From Saragossa to the sea, none can deny her right of place, her smiling eyes.
Her lips, her hair; are of a quality beyond compare.
My heart is sad because the giant Melichelad wants the lad of my fair daughter, the princess...
Although I say "the lad" for sooth,
'tis with more modesty than truth.
Each month this same Melicheland of some young virgin takes... her hand.
A hundred knights defied him.
The giant ate them up!
Ay, lack! Amadis, knight of Gaul, turned his adveture to do good.
As well becomes a noble knight, he bravely enters every fight.
The battle rages, steel meets steel, passion will wreak defiance.
To whom belongs the victory, the brave knight or the giant?
The maiden's honor trembles, sparks fly from their arms.
Pray to the saints in heaven to save Amadis from all harm.
The giant, now trembling with fear, calls on the enchanter Merlin to appear.
Bravo, Amadis! I am with you, I am on your side.
Merlin, defend yourself!
Chico! Open your eyes!
There's a battle going on!
Oh, look, a giant with his navel!
Now, my lord Amadis, since I have saved you from the magic spell,
I beg of you to knight me.
That's right, Amadis, make him a knight!
Knight him, knight him!
Since the audience is so graciously disposed, we will now knight the famous Don...
Don Quixote de la Mancha.
Don Quixote de la Mancha, I dub thee knight.
Swear to obey the laws of our order?
I swear!
Look, Amadis, he's got no feather.
Give him yours.
The managemet will go to any sacrifice to please.
Hey, d'you think I pay you to stand around and do nothing, you lazy wench?
How dare you insult a noble lady before a knight and a king?
Hey, what's he say?
Madame, allow me to devote all my life to your service.
And this is the lady of his dreams.
He has already fought for this decoration.
Ad what name would you give the lady, sir?
Dulcinea.
This castle new, this new made device,
All enriched with marble and forged by molten fire,
This castle blessed by love, from its empire...
Endowed by Heaven and happy artifice.
A fortress against all vice, where virtue is mistress
And holding sway, entrancig all hearts that they too must say that for evil to triumph would be tragedy.
Master, our siesta, what about it?
We've been on the road since dawn.
A knight never sleeps.
A knight never sleeps. A knight never eats.
A knight lives on adventure, but I'm not a knight. I know, I'm nobody.
I know nothing!
Sancho, adventure at last!
An army of giants.
Giants? All I can see is mutton.
A knight is never wrong.
Harrah! Harrah!
I still say they're sheep.
Stupid! Never will you know the ways of chivalry.
Maybe, but I do know my muttons.
Look'ere! Your helmet's in a nice mess!
Oh, my helmet!
Take it to the lady of my dreams.
Who is the "lady of my dreams?"
Dulcinea.
Oh, very well, I'll take your helmet to the lady Dulcinea, but how shall I recognize her house?
Enriched with marble and forged by molten fire.
That's a new one no me.
Oh, I remember, yes, the night you sang.
But, how shall I know the lady?
By her virtue.
I see.
Oh, go now, and don't forget-
Bring back another helmet.
Not a bad looking wench. There, but I shouldn't worry about those sort of things.
Here! Perhaps you can tell me something.
Do you know a princess called Dulcinea?
Dulcinea? Princess? Never heard of her...
Oh, of course! I remember!
- That's what Don Quixote called her.
- You remember!
- Me?
- Yes. There she is.
If that's a princess my brains are going soft, or yours is. Give me a drink, quick.
Sancho! Sancho!
Is there a man here called Don Quixote?
Why yes, sir, he's my ucle.
I have orders to arrest him.
Where is he?
Who knows?
He disappeared three days ago.
But what do you want with him?
Has something happened?
Has anything happened?
We accuse one Don Quixote...
...having as accomplice an individual named Sancho Panza, both vagrants...
...is accused of having attacked a flock of sheep.
Hey, what're you doing? Assassin! Thief!
He's got my shaving gear!
Well, Sancho, did you find my Dulcinea?
Yes, Master, and she was in the courtyard.
- At court, you mean...
- At court, yes, and she was milking a cow.
Oh, you lie, Sancho!
I lie, do I? Perhaps you'll tell me that this helmet is a lie.
Perhaps you'll tell me it looks like a barber's plate.
Sancho! The helmet of Mambrine.
How did you win it?
By my bravery, Master. See, in the courtyard at the court...
There was an enormous devil pestering the princess Dulcinea.
- A giant!
- A giant, exactly. What did I do?
With my usual bravery I attacked him,
I stunned him, I tore a button off his trousers.
Here it is, Master.
Course, he bit a lump out of it, but I couldn't help that.
You exaggerate, Sancho.
It is the helmet of Mambrine.
It may please you, Master.
It has surprised me that you, simple squire, should have conquered a giant.
Well, Master, he was only a little giant, well, you know Master...
So I gave him a slosh and I left him.
What are you doing?
Thinking of the good things
I could eat today...
Sausages, sausages, chicken, cheese, more sausages... no! A nice duck...
- With thick rich gravy.
- Always you think about eating.
Well, can you tell me anything better?
Chivalry.
Yes, I've got chivalry in me head but my stomach craves for food.
Who are those men?
Only prisoners.
Halt!
- Where are you going?
- To the galleys.
- What for?
- For having loved.
He loved gold which did't belong to him.
To the galleys for love? To me, Sancho!
Oh dear, oh dear...
Whose little boy are you?
- What's he in for? Murder?
- No, he wrote a book.
- Heretic. Against God?
- No, to prove that criminals don't exist.
Order!
Oh, Lord love a duck!
- Who are you?
- Don Quixote de la Mancha.
- Flowers of chivalr-
- Chivalry.
- Essence of good knights-
- Knighthood.
- Idiot.
- Idiot.
Free these men. God is the only judge.
Yes, all right old man. Now get a move on.
- Sancho! Free these men!
- But will he let me?
Go on...
Guards, arrest this fool!
Stop! Listen to me! Gentlemen please...
Take your chains to the lady of my dreams.
What is he saying?
He says he wants us to take our chains to his girlfriend.
Our chains? Take them yourself!
Friends, take your chains to my...
Welcome, sir. My house exists for such as you, with aching limbs and hungry appetite.
Oh my lord, I thank you for your gracious welcome into this magnificent castle...
Ah, princess, I'm unworthy of such a honor!
What about a bed for my master, and some food, and...
Ah, silence...
Look what they've done to him, those cursed...
- Magicians.
- Magicians.
Have him brought here, this Don Quixote, this relic of the past.
I see no splendor in attacking authority.
- He who attacks the law attacks your grace.
- Attacks God!
I swear, your grace, there's nothing bad about him.
He's only ill in mind...
Will your grace come to our assistance and help us to end these mad adventures?
One doesn't punish a sick man.
One takes care of him!
We will take care of him, so!
No, no, my chief of police. This is a case even beyond your competency.
The man's malady is obscure and requires special treatment.
- Have you got any good wine?
- Excellent! From the year the comet fell.
Good wine's good for pilgrims, you know, and I feel very pilgrimish this morning.
- Just exactly what is your profession?
- The old man seems to be a little bit...
Oh, our profession... we are knight errants, you know.
We live on inspiration.
But a little change is good now and then, so don't delay, friend.
Knights never eat, knights never sleep. We do great things all day and keep from harm away.
Oh, what a life, without my wife.
No matrimonial chain and in the end I gain.
Oh, island sweet, with lots to eat old wine, fresh fowl and steak enough to make you ache!
Worth that be fine, when all that's mine.
No hunger and no thirst for King Sancho the First.
This knighthood gane will he'er be tame, rescuing buxom maidens, that's the best of games...
What a delight to be a knight. A chivalric face!
Old sheep, we must give praise.
My island sweet with lots to eat old wine, fresh fowl, and steak enough to make you ache.
The evening's fun, if on the run.
Poor prisoners we set free, Don Quixote and me.
Do you know a man named Don Quixote?
Never heard of him.
A scarecrow of a man with a lance.
Making trouble everywhere.
He must be here! I saw his horse outside.
And he's always with a fat fool whose name is Sancho Panza.
It's not me, sir. Never was me, sir.
Never will be me, sir.
Are you trying to be funy with the police?
No, I'm just trying to convince you, sir, that I don't know him.
- What's that?
- I don't know this rogue Don Quixote, I swear I don't.
Sir! I beg of you, sir, wake up!
- A knight never sleeps.
- They're after you!
- Oh, princess, oh, you must go!
- Sir!
I regret, but chastity is the first law of chivalry...
- That's not the question. The police are here.
- Police! Then I will defend you, princess.
- Master! The police!
- I'm ready for them.
- It's madness to stay here. We must fly!
- The police will never dare attack a knight!
You know that, and I know that, but do the police know it?
Maybe you are right.
Let him rest. He has fever.
I'll swear to you that he's not a criminal.
- Not a criminal? What do you call it?
- I assure you that he's a good man sir.
Go on, get out. Let justice take its course.
Keep it a secret.
Illustrious warrior, Knight of the Mournful Countenance...
In the name of his grace, the Duke of Belanga...
I invite you to follow me to his grace's castle, there to be entertained in company with your squire.
All charm aside, this time I think it really is a castle.
Like all the others, you fool.
I'm going to fill my stomach right up to the ears.
Your greediness makes me disgusted.
Governor of a island, in all his finery!
Aren't they going to dress you up, too?
No. I will not forsake my arms.
I owe my glory to them.
His grace, the duke, and her grace, the duchess, await you, gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, I beg of you do not give way to laughter.
This is a comedy that must be played seriously.
Its success depends on it.
Don Quixote de la Mancha, Knight of the Mournful
Countenance, and his squire, Sancho Panza.
'Tis a honor for my court to welcome you, illustrious knight.
We greet with joy Don Quixote and his squire, Sancho Panza.
We have heard of your great deeds.
And what for? To bring a madman to his senses?
I'm sure to lose mine in the process.
Oh, and that muzzle! Now is this supposed to fit my head?
Gently, gently... Be careful, will you?
Ah, no, leave the glasses!
I am surprised, Sancho, that a man of your intelligence should abandon a loving wife and children...
I search of adventure and the doubtful pleasure of governing an island.
Yes but I must follow my Master, missus.
I love him. I belong to him.
As the ivy to the wall, as the roses 'round Mother's door...
As for the island, I'll take a chance on that, as I took a chance with my dear wife.
You know, even a blind chicken can find a grain of seed.
Sancho! I told you before, not to speak in proverbs.
Let him be, my Don Quixote. Sancho pleases me more than I can say, just as he is.
No, spring lamb is too dangerous for a Governor!
Oh, this fellow's getting on my nerves!
Can't take that one away.
I'm told, oh Knight of the Mournful Countenance that you serve a lady...
...of surpassing beauty, by name Dulcinea.
Why yes, your grace, her beauty can but be described only in music and in-
I music? Then you shall sing to me of her, for you are doubtless a musician, albeit a romantic one.
Yes, like all knights errant.
No! Too indigestable for your excellency!
Thanks very much!
Too indigestable!
The swallows have departed!
The song I sing is of the fair lady of my dreams, who lifts me far above this coarse and common world.
Her crystal heart also, clear and true.
Her cheeks a fiery rose in damask petals curled.
For her I have braved all dangers with good heart.
My arms have saved my queen from other prisons base.
The enchanter's horrid snares, the world's envenomed tongues, and forced the universe to kneel before her grace.
Fair one for whom I live, I here alone, am now...
I'm not imprisoned nor slave of lying show...
Alone against all victors base and coward knights...
My standard I will guard nor rival will allow.
Why, Don Quixote, compared to the lady of my dreams, the charms of Dulcinea seem as nothing.
One night as well compare the moon to the sun, the daisy to the rose.
That is impossible to believe! I challenge it!
You say that I lie? Your maners do not become a knight of chivalry.
Then you shall defend your lady with your sword!
Gentlemen! One moment, please!
Knights errant are in truth unruly here!
Let us at least finish our meal in peace.
Then if you so wish it, you shall decide by single combat which of your ladies outvies the other...
...in grace and beauty. Only on one condition I insist.
That the loser shall renounce knight errantry forever, and return home.
Do you accept these conditinos, gentlemen?
I do.
I do.
He is an old man, and you are young.
Do not hurt him!
This way to your island, my dear Governor.
Oh, you are very nice...
Lord love a duck, what was that?
What's all this funny business?
I say, my master will need me.
Be calm, Excellency, be calm.
Remember your dignity!
How can I see my island with this thing over my face?
The ceremony must follow the traditional rites.
Even a blind chicken may find a grain of seed.
Don't be afraid, Excellency.
Nothing risked, nothing gained.
What're you doing? What're you trying to do?
Where are you taking me to?
This way to your island, Governor.
One, two, three...
Master, where are you?
I've got such a sinking feeling, Master!
The knight of the Gryphon.
Don Quixote de la Mancha,
Knight of the Mournful Countenance...
Champion of the Lady Dulcinea.
May God keep you and may your valiance prove worthy of your lady's beauty.
You're breaking my ribs!
This is no joke... stop this!
Don Quixote wins!
- Don Quixote?
- Magic!
One can never be sure with lunatics!
Help! Help!
Confess that Dulcinea surpasses all other women in beauty.
I'm suffocating! Oh, spare me!
I'll confess anything you like!
Heavens! Carrasco? A magician in the features of Carrasco? Die, scoundrel!
Oh, pity! I am Carrasco in the flesh,
Maria's fiancé.
I have been tricked.
They have made a fool of me!
It was for your own good.
Mind, Don Quixote! Stay with us!
We must celebrate your victory.
Master! Master!
Your grace, how much longer will your indulgence permit...
...this madman, Don Quixote, to disturb the peace?
He wants man to distribute justice in the place of God.
Many have been burned for less.
No, no gentlemen. Let us at least keep our sense of values.
In politics there are no conclusions, only endless argument.
Your grace, Don Quixote is a man without guile.
His books alone are responsible for his behavior.
Then burn his books! That should content you, sir.
At least you'd have something to burn.
I can't get this thing open. I'm not a tinker!
This is what comes from wearing a saucepan instead of a hat!
Why can't you be like ordinary people? You know,
I haven't said much about your duke up till now...
But I've been thinking a lot, ad I'll keep on thinking, too.
Hey friend, that must be heavy. Where's your donkey?
I had to sell it. Taxes and wars have ruined us.
When the mills are finished with our grains...
We will have nothing left but the husks and flowers for the duke.
Look, Sancho, there they are!
Giants! Giant devils!
Cruelty, Greed, Injustice.
They want to retard the world.
They're widmills! I tell you they're only windmills!
Master! That's only the sails of the mills turning in the wind!
Easy, easy, quick! He might drop!
Slowly, slowly...
Be careful, boys, be careful!
Steady now, steady!
Now steady, gently!
Is he still alive?
He's coming back in a carriage!
Welcome back! Now begins a new life for you!
Master, it must be the magicians that came in the night.
It's them that's burned your books.
The magicians you talk about so much.
Master! Master!
I deceived you, Sancho. There is no island for you.
Oh Master, don't let that worry you.
I don't particularly want an island.
Master!
There'll be none of that. No trays.
The Star-Telegram has you quoted quite definitely:...
..."Before departing by plane for New York, Mr. Cheyne stated...
...that the new equipment is to be provided by the present bond issue".
The other papers have virtually the same.
What does the confidential bulletin say?
"Tuesday morning. Paris wires...
...the President will probably sign the Bannerman Mining Bill today".
Van Wyck's London cable says:...

8:45, Mr. Cheyne.
- Our guests still asleep?
- Yes, sir.
Reynolds will drive them out to Connecticut at 11:00, sir.
- Well, let them sleep an hour more.
- Very good, sir.
- Will you be dining at home tonight?
- I don't know.
- You can call me at the office.
- Very good, sir.
Burns, give this to my son. Have him call me at the office on a private wire.
Very well, sir.
Shall I waken them now, Mr. Burns?
No, Mr. Cheyne wants the dear things to sleep an hour longer.
They can never wake up, as far as I'm concerned.
Yes, Master Harvey?
Well, Burns said that...
Oh, here he is now.
Yes?
Your breakfast will be ready in the dining room, Master Harvey.
Yes, but...
But...
Oh, very well.
It wants its breakfast in its rooms.
Prepare the tray.
Why can't I go downstairs and eat my breakfast if I'm hungry?
Is that the way you act in people's houses?
In people's houses, they let you eat when you're hungry.
Well, you're my guest, and you'll do as I say.
Besides, I bet you never had breakfast in bed.
My mother has it, but it's sissy for a fellow to have it, unless he's sick.
Who are you calling a sissy?
I'll take care of it.
Did you say I was a sissy?
I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy.
Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey?
You heard me order it.
Go ahead, Charles. It'll be in your room.
You want to have some breakfast, don't you?
Yes.
I like to eat the way people eat.
Will mine be in my room?
Sure. Think we only got one servant?
Wait a minute, Pogey.
Why do you want to go around making him mad for?
What if he is?
You just can't remember one single thing.
Getting my father to get his father...
...to make him spend the Easter with us was a plot, wasn't it?
- Yes.
- Come in.
Well, then, what do you want to go around spoiling plots for?
I just wanted to make him feel he owed you something.
- Could you get coffee if you wanted it?
- Sure. I just don't like it.
- Do you want some?
- No, I like cocoa.
Your father instructed me to give you this.
- What for?
- He didn't confide in me.
You're to telephone him, if you get up.
- Is there anything more you wish?
- Yes. You can fill my bath for me.
With pleasure.
We thought you were in bed.
No, and I'm going to eat mine on that desk.
- Are you sorry Easter's over?
- I don't know.
Haven't you been having a lot of fun?
I guess so.
You're the one that's from Providence, aren't you?
Uh-huh.
Why, I'd think a boy from Providence'd be very happy to make a trip to New York.
I'm from way out in Indiana.
All right.
I've got a little brother that I bet'd be happy to have all the luxuries you've had.
He can have my room.
Hello. Hello, Father?
Just a moment.
I'll see if your father's in.
Morning, Son. What?
I'm going back to school now.
Yes, sir. $40.
That's it. I thought you might have to stop for lunch somewhere...
...before you get back to school.
You can treat the boys.
Have a good time, Son.
See you in June. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Father.
He's a wonderful boy.
He was 5 here.
I wish his mother had lived to see him now.
10 years old and yet he's one of the editors of his school paper.
Think of that.
Now, watch.
Sit up, Conrad.
Do you hear me? Sit up!
Sit up! Move.
This isn't the way my Treasure Island looks.
It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island.
Gee, it's very valuable, huh?
Sure. Would you like to have it?
- It belongs to your father.
- It does not.
My father gave it to me so as I could have it when I grow up.
- You take it as a present, Charles.
- You're going now.
Gee whiz!
I'm glad you like the book, Charles.
Look, Harvey, maybe I oughtn't to take it.
That's all right.
That's just an act of friendship.
Sometime, maybe, you'll want to do an act of friendship for us.
What?
Oh, maybe we might like to join the Buffaloes.
You're the president of the Buffaloes, aren't you?
Yeah, but there's 15 other fellows in the club.
Yeah, but when you get together in Mr. Tyler's room...
...and toast marshmallows and things...
...you talk about who you're going to let in, don't you?
I'm not allowed to tell what we do.
That's all you do.
You sit around Mr. Tyler's fireplace...
...and talk about camping and things like that.
Well, do you want to do an act of friendship?
What if the others don't want you in?
Now look here, Charles...
...you like being the president, don't you?
Certainly I do. It's an office of honor.
And what if you weren't the president anymore?
- You can't do anything about it.
- Oh, yes, I can.
What if you weren't at the school anymore?
I'm going to be at the school.
Harvey could buy the school and shut it up. Couldn't you, Harvey?
No. That isn't what would happen.
Your father sells my father's automobiles in Providence, doesn't he?
Yes.
Well, then, do you think he'd like it if you had a chance...
...to do me an act of friendship and didn't do it?
What if he woke up one day, and my father took away...
...all the automobiles he let him have to sell and said:...
..."You're fired".
You know how many people are out of jobs?
Millions of people.
And they're all hungry and in rags.
They can't send their sons to school.
You're not old enough to work...
...so you'd have to go out with your mother and father and beg.
And that certainly would be awful...
...to have your mother sitting there, all dressed up in rags...
...and eating rotten bread and things like that.
Wouldn't that be terrible?
Your father can't do that.
Now look, Charles,
I don't want him to do it.
I just say I don't want him to have to do it.
I know they won't let you in.
Monsieur Gattard will continue with...
...second and third form French on Thursdays...
...which will replace Dr. Spitzer's science section...
...moved up to Friday afternoon.
That will give Dr. Spitzer more time for golf.
- Thank you.
- That covers everything, gentlemen.
We'll reconvene at tomorrow night's regular faculty meeting.
- Oh, Mr. Tyler.
- Yes, sir?
Harrison's doctor feels he needs another month's rest.
Could you possibly take over first form Latin?
Oh, I think so.
I thought you might like what added salary the extra work would bring.
Well, that's very kind of you,
Dr. Finley.
Did you get straightened away from last winter's difficulties all right?
Yes, and now that you've brought that up...
- I don't know quite how to thank you...
- Oh, don't mention it, Bob.
This ought to make things easier from now on.
- Yes, sir. And thank you very much, sir.
- Glad to do it, Bob.
Hello, Charles. What's the matter?
Can Harvey Cheyne make his father do anything he wants?
I don't think so. Why?
He says if we don't let him and Pogey Williams and Alvin Savage...
...join the Buffaloes...
- I'll have to leave school.
- What?
I don't know what to do with this.
He gave it to me.
It's awful valuable, and he won't take it back.
He gave you this?
He says if he doesn't get in the Buffaloes...
...he'll get his father to take away my father's automobile business.
Well, that's absurd, Charles.
Well, he wanted to be on the school paper...
...and he got his father to give a new printing press, didn't he?
So they had to let him on, didn't they?
- He's always...
- Come in here, Charles. Come in here.
Come on. We've got to set type up now.
- There isn't room for any more.
- What did he write?
- It's about his vacation.
- I want more than this in.
There isn't room for any more.
If you wanted more, you ought to write it sooner.
Give it here.
Hey, give that here!
I want to write some more.
We told Mr. Tyler he could read proof at 5:00.
I don't care. You treat me like I wasn't one of the editors here.
Oh, you used "like" as a conjunction.
- I did not.
- Oh, yes, you did.
That makes 10 cents more you owe to the dunce box.
Yeah, and you still haven't paid up for saying "either, or"...
...instead of "neither, nor" down at the dining hall this noon.
I did not...
Come on.
You're awful slow with that proof.
- It's not ready yet, Mr. Tyler.
- Yes, so I assume.
You have half an hour.
Come here, Harvey.
I want to talk with you.
It's their fault it's late.
They wouldn't let me...
Harvey, I put that first edition of Treasure Island in your room.
Oh, you did? Thanks.
It was a nice gift, but Charles didn't think he ought to take...
...such an expensive present, and I'm inclined to agree with him.
Oh, that's all right.
I want him to have it.
Why, Harvey?
Well, it's...
We don't need it. We've got lots of them.
Harvey, you know that's a silly answer, old man.
- Well, it was an act of friendship.
- You mean a bribe, don't you?
- What's a bribe?
- A bribe's a dishonest gift.
A person who accepts it knows that he must do something dishonest in return.
Be honest, Harvey.
All I wanted was to belong to the Buffaloes.
Look, people give presents after someone's been nice to them, don't they?
So what's dishonest with giving presents before someone's nice to you?
Harvey, why do you think you don't belong to the Buffaloes?
'Cause Charles don't want me in.
It isn't Charles that kept you out.
I kept you out.
What? You said you were a friend of mine.
I am, but sometimes we have to do things for friends...
...that we don't particularly like to do.
Harvey...
...do you remember me saying it hadn't been wise for you to tell the boys...
...that you ought to be a member simply because your father was so important?
Yes.
And I said the way to get in was for you to be important...
...to stand on your own feet...
...not depend on your father for everything you want.
My father gives me everything I want.
Did you talk this over with your father, Harvey?
No. He's got more important things to do.
He's anxious for your happiness, isn't he?
Sure.
- I'm perfectly happy.
- Oh, no, Harvey, you're not...
...because you know you've been dishonest.
- Well, so were you dishonest.
- Now, Harvey.
Well, you took a bribe.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you find some money in your room...
...a couple of days before Christmas vacation...
- ...lying on your table in an envelope?
- What?
Yes. Only it wasn't a bribe.
It was a present...
...because I thought you were a friend of mine.
- Did you put that $50 there?
- Yes.
I was going to tell you it was from me.
I thought maybe you'd make the history exam easier.
You went to the dentist and came back late, and I didn't get a chance to tell you.
- I had no idea it was from you.
- You kept it, though.
It'll be returned, Harvey.
I'm afraid you need a little sterner lesson than I can give you.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to talk it over with Dr. Finley and see what he thinks ought to be done.
You hate me.
- Where's Coventry?
- It isn't a place.
It means he can't talk to anybody, and you can't talk to him.
You just have to pretend he doesn't exist.
And if he tries to talk to you, you have to report it to a master.
What did he do?
I don't know. He's a fresh kid.
That's all.
"Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere
Take thou there from my brand, Excalibur
And fling him far into the middle mere
Watch what thou seest and lightly bring me word
To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere"
- Well, what did Sir Bedivere say?
- That's all I was supposed to commit, sir.
Ten lines.
Does anybody know what Sir Bedivere replied? We'll have to find out tomorrow.
I know what he said, sir.
Persons in Coventry do not speak after a class is dismissed.
Kind of funny about Eddie stopping where he did.
Yes. Yes, it was.
I guess I got a right to look at it, haven't I?
The only reason you got your old paper was 'cause I got it for you.
You make me sick.
Punching somebody isn't speaking to him, is it?
No.
All you got to do is say he tried to break Coventry with you.
Takes some people an awful long time to learn something.
- It'll only cost $10 if you want to go back.
- I'm never going back.
- Why, Son. What's happened?
- I just got here.
I'm all right, I guess.
- What's the matter with your leg?
- Oh, it's all right, I just sprained it a little.
Here, here. Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Cheyne?
- Ask Dr. Walsh to come in.
Oh, I don't need a doctor, Father.
- What's all this? Tar?
- It's ink from the printing press.
A little of it got on me. I left school.
Dick, I wish you'd see if this boy of mine is all right.
- Well, well, son. Been in a fight?
- I fell down trying to escape.
Take a look at that right leg.
- What do you mean trying to escape?
- It doesn't hurt now.
- Can you walk on it?
- Yes, sir.
It was just a lingament or something.
I think you'll pull through.
- What happened to him?
- I'm trying to find out.
Why do you say you escaped, Harvey?
Because they had me prisoner at the school. Nobody could talk to me.
- I guess they were scared I would talk.
- Who was scared?
That old Tyler and all of them.
- Who's old Tyler?
- He's a master.
He kept me out of the Buffaloes and took a bribe.
- What bribe?
- I gave him $50 at Christmas...
...to make the history exam easier.
And yesterday
I found out he wasn't a friend of mine.
- He fixed it so as I couldn't tell anyone.
- Let me get this straight, Son.
Do you mean to say that a teacher let you give him $50?
- Yes.
- And then locked you up...
...because you threatened to tell about it?
Yes, in the basement.
I had to fight my way out.
- Good heavens, what school is this?
- Green Hill, Connecticut.
- Does Dr. Finley know about this?
- Sure he does.
He's trying to keep it quiet, too.
He's scared because you gave so much to the school.
It's very important that Dr. Finley be at my house this evening.
- I also want to see that teacher, Tyler.
- Yes, sir.
Maybe you oughtn't have anything at all to do with them, Father.
You just let me handle this, Son.
I bet they make up some awful lies about it.
I must point out the extraordinary sums of money that he's had at his disposal.
Very large sums for a small boy.
Well, the boy was confused...
...bewildered, almost terrified when he came into my office.
Your mere assertion that I give him overlarge sums of spending money...
...in no way seems to justify the severe treatment...
...to which he's obviously been subjected.
Mr. Cheyne, Harvey's "severe treatment" came from no member of the faculty.
I've told you of his attempt to bribe
Mr. Tyler. Here's the $50, by the way.
Behind that lies a long list of infractions...
...based on his attitude that he's a special, privileged character.
His attempt to resist the normal, healthy discipline of being put into Coventry...
...brought no further discipline from us.
But it did bring him a solid bash on the nose from one of his fellows.
It was a blow, I am sorry to say, that any one of the other 120 boys...
...in the school would have been glad to deliver.
Oh.
Well, in that case...
- ...have some coffee, Dr. Finley.
- Thanks.
Now, tell me.
This bash on the nose came from a Bison?
- A Buffalo. Wellman is a Buffalo, isn't he?
- Yes, sir.
Perhaps you will accept some coffee, too, Mr. Tyler.
Thank you, sir.
Really, Mr. Cheyne,
Harvey is great material.
He's simply been misdirected, that's all.
Smart. Why he has a mind as fine as any in the school.
Well, he certainly fooled me.
It seems that I have begotten a sort of junior Machiavelli.
Perhaps it's not my place to say this,
Mr. Cheyne...
...but it's simply because you and he have never had any relationship.
To him, you're just a machine pouring out money, a machine he's trying to imitate.
If you take time out from being a tycoon in big business and spend more time...
...getting to know your own son, you'll realize...
I'm sure Mr. Cheyne realizes that very clearly now.
I can see that the school would do with a little more cooperation with me, yes.
But you gentlemen must realize...
...that besides being both father and mother to Harvey...
...I'm tied up in my own work...
...in matters that also relate to his future welfare.
I suppose what you want from me,
Dr. Finley...
...is permission to deal as drastically with Harvey...
...as his future conduct might deserve.
I'm afraid we'll have to leave that in your hands for a while, Mr. Cheyne.
For the rest of the spring term at least,
Harvey will have to be rusticated.
Rusticated?
"Temporarily canned,"
I believe the boys call it.
Well, that is news. And here I'm trying to put you on the carpet.
It seems a bit thick...
...after the printing press and all your other generosities...
...but for that very reason, for the effect on the other boys.
Oh, I understand perfectly, Doctor.
You've no other course.
Well, Bob, if we're going to catch that train, we must be off.
Goodbye, Mr. Cheyne.
I'm sure that when Harvey comes back in the fall...
...he will be a boy that we can all be proud of.
Well, good luck.
My young Mr. Tyler is pretty intense, but he's quite right.
You're rather a nice fellow for a...
What did he call you?
- A tycoon.
- Oh, yes.
Well, you're rather a nice fellow for a tycoon.
So take the boy in with you for the next few months, will you?
You won't mind the extra work. If you give him a chance to live up to you... we're liable to have another splendid citizen on our hands.
- Good night.
- Good night, Doctor. Thank you.
Harvey.
Don't, Mr. Tyler, please don't. Don't.
Two hours ago, you might have gotten away with that very nicely, Harvey.
From now on, it doesn't go.
That's all we'll have to say tonight,
Son.
- Elliot, I am going to be a father again.
- Good heavens, Mr. Cheyne.
No, no, no, Elliot.
No, it's just that it seems that smart little boys...
...from so-called wealthy, well-bred parents...
...don't grow up very successfully by themselves.
- Lf you're speaking of Harvey, sir...
- Yes, I am.
- Did you get passage for next week?
- Yes, the Queen Anne on the 7th.
You wanted to go over the London corporation papers...
- ...before you retire.
- Yeah.
Well, get a larger suite.
Harvey's going with us.
It seems that he's been...
- ...rusticated.
- Oh, I am sorry, sir.
Will you be taking a tutor along with him?
So how the deuce did you know what that meant?
Frankly, I jumped at an obvious conclusion.
Well, you're smarter than I was, Elliot.
No, no tutors.
I've got to get closer to that boy.
I'm darned if I know just where to begin.
Poor kid, maybe it's all my fault.
I don't know.
Oh, well.
I'll make it somehow.
If the radio tells them where every ship is, why do they have to...
- Radiogram, Mr. Cheyne.
- Oh, thanks. What, Harvey?
I said, if the radio tells them where all the ships are...
...why do they have to keep on blowing that old foghorn all the time for?
We're off the Grand Banks now.
A lot of small fishing boats out there.
Too small for a radio.
They don't want to hit any of them.
I bet this boat could go right through one of them.
Why do they have to come so far out from land to fish for?
This is where they get all the codfish and halibut off these banks.
Those boys wouldn't believe you own this boat.
I don't, Harvey. I am just one of the directors of the line.
Well, you're the chairman, so that's the boss, isn't it?
Look, Son, why don't you have some fun with these kids for a while?
I've got a radio to send and then...
...well, later on I'll pick you up, and we'll go up on the Captain's bridge, huh?
Hear that?
My father's taking me up to see the Captain...
...when he gives him some orders, later on.
- Oh, bushwah.
- I'll play you both.
Can't you see we're already playing?
All right, then,
I think I'll get an ice-cream soda.
You can't.
The soda fountain doesn't open till noon.
Oh, no? We'll see about that.
Hey, Purser. Hey, you, come here.
Well, are you the three important customers?
Yes. Have you any money?
- I've got a dime.
- That's not enough.
We'll have three chocolate ice-cream sodas. Make them big ones.
You know we're not supposed to open till noon, don't you?
You've got nothing else to do.
Oh, of course, you'd know all about that.
I know everything about this ship.
I've been all over it.
- Meet with your approval?
- It's all right.
Crew would be glad to know that.
All right, drink them up, boys, and don't take all day, huh?
There's no hurry.
We're going to have another.
- This will be enough for me.
- Me, too.
What's the matter with you?
I could have five or six of these.
- Yes, you could.
- You bet I can. Make another.
But I'll be glad to make them for you, even though I know you can't.
Yeah, I'll show you.
There. You didn't think I could do it, did you?
That's fine, you certainly surprised me.
I think I'll go meet my father now.
That's a boy, and go and eat a great big lunch now.
Look, he's getting sick.
He's gonna be sick.
- Uh-oh. I hadn't counted on that.
- I am not. I feel fine.
I can go and meet my father if I want to, can't I?
Come on, I'll bet you anything.
Which way is it to the deck?
How do I get outdoors?
First to your right.
There he goes, come on.
He came out here.
Hey, Harvey!
You try run Manuel down, huh?
You big killer whale with smoke spout.
You try swallow Manuel like he little smelt, huh?
That's all you ever got to say.
On the Isle of Fishamingo
Lived a chief called Bingo-Bingo
What's this?
That whale she have calf, huh?
Little bull calf, too.
All full of ocean inside.
Here. Here, come on now.
I pull you out of ocean, now you give some of that ocean back. Come on now.
Give back.
Come on, give back.
Fifteen years I've been fisherman.
First time I ever catch a fish like you.
Hey! Aboard the vessel!
Hey.
I bring you new kind of fish.
What'd you get?
I've got new kind of fish.
He got no tail.
He got pants on his dorsal fin.
- I think maybe he about 10 year old.
- Oh, it's a kid, ain't it?
Go on, tend your bell.
- But, Dad...
- You know better than leave your watch...
...especially in the fog.
Go on, tend your bell.
Lend a hand here, Olley!
I pump him out a little bit.
I guess maybe he need more pumping yet,
I think, huh?
Get a buoy-keg.
Roll him.
He must have fell off that liner.
Sure. He no like that big foolish...
He come visit Manuel.
He got more salt water in him, ain't he?
Where...
- Where is this?
- Oh, you's awake?
How's you feeling, boy?
I...
I fell, didn't I?
- Did you pull me out of the water?
- No, Manuel, he fished you aboard.
Who are you?
I's Doc. I's the cook.
How does your throat feel?
- Awful.
- Always do.
Take some of this and you'll feel better.
Oh, that's worse.
- What smells so bad?
- Smells?
Ain't nothing smells bad around here.
Oh, you means the fish.
But they ain't got no smell.
Them's nice, clean salt fish.
70 quintals already done salted down in that forehold.
Is this the bottom of the ship?
Well, where's my father?
Was your pappy overboard with you, too?
- Oh, this is some other boat.
- That's it. We done picked you up.
Oh, where are my shoes?
I've got to see the Captain.
Back here.
Here you is.
You reckon you're pert enough to hop on deck?
You find the Captain and tell him to come down here.
I reckon you're lucky he didn't hear you say that.
- Where are my clothes?
- Here they is and they ain't dry.
- Boy, you...
- Where is the Captain?
Up on deck.
You sure is a tonic to yourself.
How do you do, son?
So you slipped from your mooring.
Going to stay with us awhile.
You look like a spring herring now...
...but you're going to fatten up before the fall.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where's the Captain?
Aft.
- How do I get to the Captain?
- You got to him.
- Well, how are you feeling, sonny?
- You mean you're the Captain of this boat?
That's the general opinion.
How long would it take you to get to Europe?
Well, I don't know, sonny.
I never tried to sail there.
But I want you to take me there.
I've got to meet my father.
Well, that's a pity, because I'm afraid it can't be done.
All right, then, take me to New York.
I don't think you understand, sonny.
We're working off the Grand Banks.
This schooner is from Gloucester, Massachusetts.
We'll take you there when we're through fishing.
I don't want to go to Gloucester.
You don't? Well, now.
- Is he the Captain?
- We let him think he is.
- Maybe he'd like to be captain, Dad.
- Oh, I don't know, Dan-o.
I know you want to get home, son, but we're out here to catch fish.
We ain't going to leave here till we catch enough to fill the fore and after hold.
Say, look, my father is Frank Burton Cheyne.
Don't you believe me?
I don't doubt you know your own daddy's name.
But we'll pay you if you take me to him.
Don't you want to make some money?
That's what we're hoping to do catching fish.
But he's rich.
He can buy more fish than you ever saw.
Why, he owns the boat I fell off.
- You mean the liner?
- Yes, he practically owns it.
It might have been the fall that done it.
Dories in, sir.
Now you take it easy, son.
- Now you've got to listen to me...
- Dan-o.
Uncle Salters'll take the bell.
You take him down below and let him bend on some of your clothes.
No matter what course we take, son, you can't tack around like that.
Then you go and rest a little more.
- Now, what's your name?
- Harvey Ellsworth Cheyne.
Well, mine's Dan. Come on down below.
So, how'd you fall off that boat in a calm?
There was a storm coming down.
This morning? There wasn't no storm this morning. It was a flat calm.
Well, I ought to know.
There ain't been no more than a little swell all day.
Wait'll we get a rough day out here.
What do you call a rough day?
When she's putting most of her cabin house under water.
Here, put these on.
Wait till you see some of the places we go.
What places?
Stone Fence, St. Pierre's Bank,
Whale Deep, Virgin Rock.
Pop gets a ride along with the fish.
Folks say he thinks like a codfish.
Well, if thinking like a codfish is gonna get me where I want to get...
I don't care how he thinks.
Pop don't make no hasty judgments.
Hey, these are the worst clothes
I ever saw. This stuff itches.
Wait'll you wear them for a little while.
They'll shrink to your tonnage.
- Round to port.
- Come on, get this stuff on. Dories in.
That's got nothing to do with me.
For those 850-pounders
They're more than out-floundered
- Did you bring them in better?
- Lean to port, man.
- Hey, Dave, hoist away.
- Starboard bin, and pull up.
Got plenty of coffee boiling, Doc?
- Yes, sir, Capt. Disko.
- Look at Long Jack.
He's got such few fish they die of loneliness, I think.
You did better, maybe?
Wait till you see what I get.
I get fish with hair on him.
There my new kind of fish!
How you feel, little fish?
Hey, are you gonna cut up all these old fish and stuff before we get going?
I want to get to my father.
Well, it'll be some little time, yet, son.
Easy on that salt, Henry.
- When?
- It's just like you said, Tom.
They're running kind of smallish.
- About three months, son.
- Three months?
When we head into Gloucester with a full load of fish...
...we'll help you find your folks.
- But I want to get going right away.
- Excuse me, son.
Was them sharks ravenous today.
Right stole all my gear.
- Hey, can't you understand me...
- Now, look here, sonny.
I've been close-hauling your problem, and I want to help you...
...but we've got our problems, too.
All of us here share in the fishing...
...and heading back to Gloucester now...
...we'd maybe lose all next winter's daily bread for us and our folks.
You wouldn't want that now, would you?
Are you crazy?
I told you my father had more money...
Hoist away, Jack!
Are you going to listen to me, or don't you understand...
Stand away, boy.
Hey, if you think I'm going to stay on this boat for three months...
Now, look here, son...
I don't blame you none.
Now you won't me either after the bile's out of your system.
And even if your daddy was half what you say...
...it wouldn't be right nor just to gamble two weeks good fishing...
...against a yarn give out by an upset boy.
But I am a fair-minded man...
...and while you're aboard,
I'll pay you wages. $3 a month.
- Now come on, sonny.
You start helping Dan with them cod livers.
Here's a pair of gloves.
We wash them out first, then we put them in there...
...and after we get the bucket full, then we put them in the barrel.
That's how we get cod-liver oil.
- You think I'd do that?
- Here, they won't hurt you, little fish.
Yeah, you heard pop's orders.
You're one of the crew now.
I am not and I'm not going to work on this boat and nobody can make me, either.
Hey, Disko, you hear this?
Come on now, don't be scared, little fish.
You keep away from me.
All of you keep away from me.
None of you can make me do anything.
Hey, Disko. You got mutiny on board.
If you don't want to help, just keep quiet.
When I get off this boat, I'm going to get my father to put you all in jail.
You're all kidnappers.
Well, I guess there ain't nothing else to do.
I'll bet they put you all in jail.
In jail for the rest of your lives, and I'm going to do it, too.
You hit me.
Now you just sit there and think about it, sonny.
Look at Manuel. He's saving fish to sleep on. Catch up, there!
Hey, I do more work as you do with your best girl's six brothers.
Who in the tarnation laid that bucket there? Dag-diggit!
Now, mind what I told you, son.
You're too young to be telling a crew of men...
...what you'll do and what you won't do.
But you might as well start in learning a few things.
You see that gurry?
Well, when you've hove them fish heads overside...
...you can come below and get some supper.
Until you do, you get nothing.
I'm not going to eat, either.
You do as you mind to about that.
Let it rain some more coffee, huh, Doc?
Fog's lifting. It'll be clear in an hour.
How is my little fish? Smiling and happy?
No, he's still sulking.
He's the orneriest kid I ever seen.
Maybe his papa's got so much money he don't want that little boy no more.
- Maybe he throw him overboard.
- He sure spins a yarn for a kid.
- Aye, his papa own that boat.
- Yeah, interesting talker, all right.
Why, he's a good enough liar to write books.
A rope's end, that's what I'd give him.
I'm telling you, it's the fall he took that did it. It plumb distracted him.
My cousin Eben back from Vermont was like that.
He fell off of a barn, and he played with rag dolls for 30 years.
If you want what I think, as soon as this fog lifts we'll take him into Saint John's.
- I mean it.
- And lose two weeks good fishing, huh?
Better than taking a chance on three months bad luck.
Now we have plenty sunshine for Mr. Happy Face.
He's a passenger on a fishing schooner, and you know that's bad luck.
What happened to the Orinoco last year...
...when they took on the passenger at Newfoundland?
On the way home, two men get killed and they don't get hardly a quintal of fish.
- By golly, that true.
- My brother was on the Bedford...
There was a passenger on the Dorothy Clemens...
...when she got rammed by the liner.
Well, that's nothing.
There's lots of vessels lost out of Gloucester...
...never had no passenger on board.
I was a passenger on my father's boat...
...and I never brought him no bad luck.
- Daniel, here...
- Your own son ain't being a passenger.
Skipper, when we trawled this bank last year...
...there was nothing but dories loaded to the gunwales.
This kid comes aboard this morning and look at today's catch.
Now, look here. Wait a minute.
- There ain't no passenger on board.
- Why not?
Well, I made him a member of the crew.
Well, it stands to reason if I'm paying him wages, he ain't no passenger, don't it?
No, sir.
You can't just buy Jonahs off that way.
I hold, he's still a passenger as long as he ain't done no work.
Yeah, and Jack's right.
Well, he'll work as soon as he gets hungry.
What's going to happen between now and the time he does?
Now look here. I decided this.
Manuel's responsible for him being on board. So you got to put him to work.
- Me?
- You got to, Manuel.
Yes, sir.
Manuel, that's only fair and just.
- I stick his face in that gurry.
- You got to do it.
Please do, Manuel. We don't want no Jonahs happenings aboard.
- You gonna do it now?
- I go stand my watch.
- I mean it, Manuel.
- All right.
I think I pay doubles for my mistake, huh?
Me, what likes kids like tub of rat poison. And that kid, two tubs.
He just say one word to me,
I throw him right back to the fish.
Ah, the supper she is great tonight, Olley.
Doc has fish cakes like the stars.
I sure could stow away about a dory-load.
I never taste such fish cake.
And this raisin bread...
Just like cake.
Say, look, you could get me some food, couldn't you?
- But I'm sick and I'm hungry.
- Go away from me.
- Do you want to make some money?
- Go away from me, I break your neck.
Why do you want to be a kidnapper?
Look, do me a favor, huh? Shut your face.
- You're just as bad as the rest of them.
- You crazy. Nobody bad round here.
You just bad luck.
Listen. Listen, you.
You clean up gurry little bit,
I give you a nickel, huh?
See, look,
I'm trying to give you $10,000, maybe.
You get out one of those boats and take me back to New York.
You and me in that dory, huh?
Yes. How far are we from New York?
You want row a Nova Iorque, now, huh?
Well, I know how.
I've been taught in school.
Now, look. You clean up little bit, huh?
Anything. Just so little work.
You want nice boat look nice, huh?
It's a dirty rotten little boat
I wouldn't even spit at.
Say, you... Say, this is finest schooner out from Gloucester.
Jonah, for the last time.
You gonna work or no?
I'm not gonna have anything more to do with you.
That is good here.
Hey, Jonah. Hey, kid.
Where you hiding?
Hey! What you doing?
- I'm going to New York.
- You what?
- I'm going to get away from here.
- Why, you...
- You keep away from me.
- Hey, you.
- Put down that oar.
- I won't.
Put down... Hey, put...
You bad luck, all right! You...
I can do this long as you can.
Oh, you crybaby, too, huh?
I am not.
No? Good. Now look...
- ...you still want row a Nova Iorque?
- Yes.
- You still hungry?
- Yes.
Then come here.
Now. Now you can go below and eat.
That man said I could eat.
- Manuel?
- It's okay, he do some work.
- I did not.
- You clean something off deck, no?
- You made me do something.
- That was work.
That's fine. Sit right here.
- Yes, sir.
- How did you get him to do it?
He do anything for me.
Even break my leg, maybe, too.
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Once Doc baked some biscuit
And throw them away
Next day no more fish
Come around boat to play
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Said cabbage to fish cake
Who lay on one dish
I beautiful cabbage
You only poor fish
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
- Who's that?
- Me.
The food was awful.
But it was better than nothing, I guess.
If you hadn't choked me,
I wouldn't have had to kick you.
You kick me? I feel nothing.
All cleared up, hasn't it?
The weather, it's nice now.
- It was till you come up.
- Well, they sent me up.
No. No, I bet they ask you stay.
They said you wanted to show me how to go on watch.
Nice fellows.
- All right. Go ahead, watch.
- How?
Just keep quiet.
Go someplace.
Go look for iceberg or boat or something.
Is that all there is to watching?
That seems like a lot of hooey.
Hooey?
What kind smart talk that "hooey"?
You better tell sailor's angel that smart talk. He like to hear that, I think.
- Who's he?
- I guess you don't know nothing, huh?
Sailor's angel, he fly around up there all time.
You watch here, look out for 25 men below.
He watch up there, he look out for you.
You go sleep, maybe. He tap you on shoulder with his wing and he say:...
..."Hey, Manuel, wake up.
What's the matter? I ashamed for you".
He very nice fellow. Everybody know that.
Oh.
Well, nothing on the port side.
That fine. Anything on starboard?
No. Nothing on the starboard, either.
And nothing in the head.
That port, that starboard.
I bet I know a lot of things you don't know.
I know that's not French you're singing.
That's right. About 10 million people know it's Portuguese.
- I bet you can't speak French.
- Right now I sorry I speak English.
What's this?
That's a boat, that's easy to see.
Yes, maybe your father come back see if you good and drowned, huh?
Yeah, that boat's no bigger than this one.
- What do you keep singing for?
- Because I like to sing.
- I've never heard that song before.
- Me, neither. I just make him up.
You can't write songs.
I don't write them.
I just find them in my mouth.
A song can't be any good like that when you just make it up.
Say, that's best kind songs.
When you feel good inside, like trade wind, she just come out.
O my beautiful lady
People learn songs. Songs aren't just inside of people like that.
Say, sometimes a song so big and sweet inside, I just can't get him out.
And then I look up at stars and maybe cry. It feels so good.
Don't you never feel like this?
- No, I guess you don't.
- Nobody else ever did, either.
Say, my father, when he alive, he made better songs than me.
And what kind of songs did he sing?
Songs about the sun and the sea.
Songs about the clouds.
Big songs about the wind and the storms.
And little songs, too, about the tip of my mother's nose.
Oh, my father, he feel beautiful inside.
- Is that all he did, was sing?
- Is that...
My father was the best fisherman in the whole Madeira Islands...
- ...and that's every place.
- Well, that's not so much.
How you mean, not so much?
Well, I mean, he didn't do much for you.
I mean, he didn't leave you anything.
He didn't leave...
He leave me this hurdy-gurdy that his grandfather leave him.
He teach me how to fish, how to sail a boat.
He gave me arms and hands and feet, feeling good outside...
...and he teach me how to feel good inside.
My father do all this.
He have 17 other kids, beside.
What else a father do, huh?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Say, listen, my...
Capt. Disko!
Capt. Disko!
That Jennie Cushman, she is even now under our stern!
She come make you happy, I think!
The Jennie Cushman?
I might've known it.
Yes, sir.
That's her nosy, long topmast prying into our wake.
Hey, there!
On the Cushman!
Where's that poor excuse for a skipper you got aboard?
And who is it might be wanting him?
You know consarned well who wants him, you bilge-raised haddock!
Well, if it ain't Disko Troop.
And me thinking
I was gonna fish here all alone.
Who passed you the word I was here so you could follow me, Disko?
Now look here, Walt Cushman.
I'm sick near to retching...
...at you using my brains to catch a trip of fish.
Sailing under my wake every time I find a good spot.
Why, Capt. Troop.
Now, is that the way for one gentleman to talk to his colleague in commerce?
You're trailing me
'cause I can find cod...
...where you can't find half a pound of sick squid.
I'll do the fishing, Disko...
...you just get out that checkerboard and try to figure out how really smart you are.
So what, he beat you at checkers last winter, huh?
Yeah, and he cheats at that, too.
He'll beat us into Gloucester this trip, too, I think.
Oh, you think so, do you?
Well, now, listen to me,
I'm gonna tell you something.
I ain't so dumb.
Fussing around like that will make him think the fishing is good here.
Then, in the morning, when the fog banks roll in...
...we'll sneak out and leave him sitting here baiting big and catching small...
...while we're out finding fish.
We'll have a full hold and be tied up in Gloucester...
...by the 1st of August, and he'll still be out here...
...floundering around, trying to catch fish...
...or I'll look more like a halibut than he does.
They sure are mad at each other, aren't they?
No, no, no. They're not mad.
They just make it up.
They do that all time.
About everybody's crazy here.
You make up your songs, they make up they're mad.
You got bunk, you better go below.
- No, I'd rather stay here.
- You go below.
- No, I'm gonna stay here and watch.
- I watch here. You go there, watch.
Go sleep. Do something.
I no understand you.
There's a place in my heart
For the one I love best
And I still keep her picture
Tattooed on my chest
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Well, I stole a march on Walt Cushman all right, I reckon, that time.
Yes, we did that, certain sure.
We did, you darned old farmer.
Go on, hold her to her course, northeast by east.
She heels over so much.
Well, leave her heel. You ain't steering no mowing machine, now.
Heave that lead, Manuel.
He think he got hold stern end of cow, maybe, huh?
Hey, kid. Hey, wake up.
Come on, wake up, little fish.
Hey, wake up, wake up.
Somebody think you dead, they have celebrations.
So that's your tub of rat poison.
You tucked him in his little bunk last night, huh?
What do you mean?
This foolish kid, he bother me.
I don't know. He fall asleep, pulled tarpaulin over him, I guess.
And me, I look all over for this.
You did, huh? I suppose he pulled your coat around him, too.
I look for my coat, too.
- So you stole my coat, too, huh?
- Why, no, I...
Sure, he stole it right off your back.
So big tough fisherman is gonna throw him back to the fishes, huh?
Some day, I think I...
Ten fathom.
Thanks. Thanks for covering me up with your coat and everything.
That's all right.
Would you by any chance be showing any blue pebbles from the bottom?
I never did thank you for saving my life.
I ought to thank you for that, all right.
You feel better this morning, huh?
I guess so.
Well, when you got it figured out, you come and let somebody know, huh?
Blue pebble, she is.
By golly, I think that
Disko know this ocean better...
...as I know inside my shirt.
- Are you fishing now?
- Sure.
I fish for bottom, so she don't fish for us.
Go away with your foolish questions, which don't have no brain.
All right, then, if that's the way you feel about it.
Fifteen fathom and clear away!
By golly, I beat you this time.
He who has a daughter
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Speaking in his native lingo
He said, "Marry Bingo-Bingo"
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
He will bring you beans and sorrows
Yes, I know about his morals
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Bingo-Bingo came to woo her
Brought a lot of presents to her
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Dag-gummit, of all the consarned...
What's the matter, farmer?
Think you're sticking hogs?
This dad-bitted boat keeps bouncing around under me, of all...
- What you laughing at?
- Him.
- Well, don't laugh.
- Why? Everybody else did.
It's all right, they got right to laugh.
They know how chop bait.
- You know how?
- Doesn't look like anything.
Go ahead, chop. Tail first.
Try it again, harder.
You fish for sperm whale, maybe.
Don't laugh. Beside, you laugh no good.
Like seagull.
I guess I want to do something.
Yes, but you wanna do just what you want to do.
I tell you what you do.
You go below in galley and help Doc.
You carry slops.
You sweat in galley like Dan did before you talk about being fisherman.
- Go on now, go on.
- All right.
You think Manuel soft with that kid, huh?
You think 'cause I catch him
I let him still be Jonah, huh?
Not on your livings.
Kid, he drive me crazy.
Think I break his neck.
Kid.
- Spit.
- What?
- Spit first.
- Why?
You'll find out.
Oh.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- You go out fishing?
- Sure, sometimes me and Uncle Salters.
Who goes with Manuel?
Nobody. You don't see him baiting a trawl, do you?
- You mean, he doesn't fish?
- Sure he does. He fishes hand line.
He ain't used a trawl or had a dorymate since his pop died.
Oh.
- Did you start fishing with your father?
- Sure, that's natural, ain't it?
Get your dories ready!
Come on, boys, step lively.
Get your dory to the rail.
Lower your dory to the rail.
Keep well to the westward, Tom.
We'll head straight down the road as soon as we got all the dories spilled.
Come on, get her in the water.
Don't crack that one on me.
Ease a little.
- Thank you, Uncle Salters.
- Manuel, he all set.
Here's a hook.
Isn't it too rough to go out in that little boat?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, to go out alone.
I not go alone. Five minutes,
I have 100 fish keep me company.
I mean, wouldn't it be better if you had someone to row, maybe?
Who I get to row? Doc? Disko?
You very foolish this morning.
Well, I rowed a boat at school.
I could row...
Oh, I see. You row this boat, huh?
What you know about boats when you cannot even chop bait?
I know lots about boats, see?
I know that's the jib, and that's the jumbo...
...and that's the fore rig, and that's the fore topmast...
...and that's the foremast, and that's the triadic stay.
That's the main topmast, and that's the main mast...
...and that's the main rigging, and that's the gurry kit.
That's the Duncan Street, and anything else you want to know?
Where you learn all this?
I read a book on it in Capt. Disko's cabin, and I don't care who knows it.
And you can go row your old boat all by yourself.
I wouldn't go out in it for anything.
By golly, that's smart kid.
About time to break his neck, ain't it?
I got no time break necks.
I got fishing to do.
Lower away.
Hard alee. Stand by the headsail!
Twenty-eight fathom.
She's shoaling fast, Capt. Disko.
We're getting to her.
Twenty-six fathoms, bottom rock.
We're on the bank. Let go your anchor.
Tie up your jib and jumbo!
Stand by your foresails.
Bait them snug, boys, bait them for home and mother.
- This fog is going to lift for you.
- Well, that's something.
Oh, what do you care, Jack?
Pop could find fish in a graveyard.
There's a run of cod on this bank...
...that Walt Cushman won't know nothing about.
Ahoy there, on the mud scow.
Whose anchor chain is that a-rattling like it's full of rust and roaches?
Well, if it ain't Disko Troop.
Did you spring your fore stick trying to follow me, Disko?
I suppose you'll deny
I showed you the road to this spot...
...a year ago this very day, you cross-eyed mackerel.
You want to row over for a game of checkers?
Fishing is mighty sparse here.
We'll never sink under the weight of fish we been catching.
Well, I ain't doing so good myself.
I can lay it to your presence, maybe.
He's lying, the same as me.
He's a plank deeper in the water than he was the last time we seen him.
I think that Walt Cushman, he smart fisherman.
Maybe we better sail after him all time, huh?
Well, boys.
You gotta start in filling fish from now on.
That meddling buoy-tender's near as full up as we are.
We'd be way up around Virgin Rocks by now if it weren't for picking up Jonahs.
He's been working mighty hard, Mr. Jack.
I don't think there's much Jonah left in him. Honest.
Or we might fill faster if our Jonah-catcher...
...would throw away his hand line and bend on a trawl for once.
You don't think I catch as much fish as you, huh, Jack?
I ain't saying that.
Maybe you just bump your head on bunk when you get up this morning, huh?
Or maybe you Portuguese just don't know nothing about trawl-fishing.
I tell you what I do.
I take Jonah kid with me tomorrow.
I fish hand line, I show him same time.
I bet you we bring in more fish as you and Nate toguessers.
"Toguessers". Speak English, will you?
More fish as me and Nate together.
More fish than you and Nate together.
Reckon we take that, Nate?
You mean I'm going to be your dorymate?
I mean nothing of kind.
You just sit in boat and be Jonah.
I do fishing.
- I'm going out with Manuel in the morning.
- That's fine.
Did you say you'd like to bet a little something on that, Manuel?
Oh, you think you scare me on bet, huh?
I tell you what I do with you.
I bet you my brand-new safety razor I buy last Christmas.
98 cents, mail-order house, I...
You put up 50 cents piece.
Brand-new, this year's.
That's a wager.
You sure you didn't bump your head, Manuel?
I no bet on sure thing. I bet on myself.
Just as good.
I guess I didn't mean what I said about going in your boat.
Make no difference what you mean.
You in it now.
I'm awful glad I am, Manuel.
I don't think I'll be a Jonah, honest.
What your name? Harvey?
Well, I gotta call you something.
I'll call you Harvey.
Oh, that's better.
You no laugh like seagull now.
Come on now, I feel tired.
You gotta help row.
Really? Gee!
Put in the pins.
Put the oars in the pins.
We gotta go someplace.
Now, when I say three, you row.
All right. I'm ready.
One, two, three.
That fine school you go to, you row on your back, huh?
I was too anxious, I guess.
Never mind anxious, you leave me be anxious.
Now, come on.
One, two, three. Row!
Row!
We get someplace.
Bottom of the ocean, I think, maybe.
Now we fish.
Well, go on. Bait your hook.
How you think you gonna fish sitting there looking at me?
You bait just like you row boat. Here.
Look, you must put barb all way through.
Like this.
Otherwise that fish he spit that out six, seven times when he feel something.
You know this fish, he don't go to school...
...he don't know French, but he pretty smart, too.
Now drop him down to bottom.
Then pull up about six inches, maybe...
...so he look fish straight in eye and say,
"Look here. I got corn beef and cabbage".
Hey, I've got one.
You got new idea, maybe, too, huh?
What you think, we just feed fish free here for nothing?
I guess I was too anxious again.
I told you, stay away from that anxious business.
Let the fish be anxious. Here, look.
One, two...
...now it's in his mouth.
Now up he comes.
Gosh. Can I take him off the hook?
We got no time for that.
We don't know this fish personal.
- Hey, I've got one now.
- All right, pull him up.
Don't let him stay down there and tell all other fish what going on.
Pull him up! Hey, wait a minute. Hey...
...you gonna bring fish up see you, you going down to see him?
- Pull him up!
- I will.
Oh, the boat tipped and I...
Oh, he got off.
How you expect catch fish, falling on your backside all time?
Bait your hook.
Don't look like they was jumping in your dory.
I wait till I get soft place for them to land in first.
I'll catch the next one.
You'll beat Long Jack and Nate.
Don't you worry.
He won't get your razor.
You think so, huh?
Nothing going on here now.
That fish, he have meeting down below.
He tell all other fish there's something not so funny going on.
Has your father been dead a long time?
Six year, next month.
Seem a long, long time.
How did he die?
He drown off Cape Sable in storm.
Wave come at night and wash him overboard.
- Didn't they find him?
- No.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What you sorry about?
Well, I mean your father.
They didn't find him.
What they need find him for?
He all right.
Well, but, drowning out in the ocean, all alone at night...
Well, what's trouble about that?
That fine way.
The Savior, he take my father up to fisherman's heaven...
...up with all his old friends.
Quick he take him up. Quick.
Just like I pull up this 35-pound fish.
The Savior, He see my father all tired and wet down there in the water.
So he light the harbor buoy and he say:...
..."Come on up, old Manuel...
I so happy you come up here to help us fish".
And my father, he say, "Thank you.
I very happy to come up, too.
And maybe I show you something about fishing up here, huh?"
And then they all laugh.
And the Savior,
He put his arm around my father...
...and He give him brand-new dory to fish in.
You think they really fish in heaven?
Why, sure they fish in heaven.
What else they do?
The Apostles, they all fishermen,
I think.
You remember that Simon, called Peter?
Remember that time when...
...he don't catch no fish in the sea of Galilee?
And the Savior, He stand on the shore and He say:...
..."Simon, you throw your net on the right side".
And Simon, he throw his net on the right side...
...and he catch so many fish, his net, it almost break in two.
I think the Savior,
He the best fisherman.
But my father, he come next.
And not fishing like this. Oh, no, no.
Fish bite all time.
When no more fish, the Savior, He make more fish.
He make more fish. He make more bread.
He make more wine.
And at night He stand watch all by Himself.
He say:...
..."Good night, fishermen.
You tired now.
Go to your bunks.
And no snorings, please.
Good night, Manuel's father".
Oh, that very nice place.
Oh.
Sometimes I think I go there right now.
Then I say, "Now, whoa, Manuel.
You gotta be better fisherman first.
That Savior, He only give dories to first-class fishermen, like your father".
So I keep on fishing. I no hurry.
I know my father keep place for me in his dory.
Hey, sleepy-face, look.
- You log on a bump.
- Oh, say. I didn't...
Easy now, easy. He's a big one.
And stay off your backside, you hear me?
Come on, pull him up.
I'm trying to...
You want Manuel help, huh?
I think you get blisters.
Blisters good for fishermen. Come on.
Pull him up, pull him up.
- Hey, what's this?
- Yeah.
- Pull him up. Pull him up.
- What is he?
He's a halibut.
Big, like mainsail, huh?
The boat tipped again.
Gosh, I told you I'd get one, didn't I?
By golly. My little fish catch fish bigger than he is.
I feel my whiskers disappear now.
I told you we'd beat Long Jack and Nate, didn't I?
Sure, we beat everybody.
Manuel and his little fish, they beat everybody.
We make fisherman out of you, huh, little fish?
What chicken-livered squid done this?
Easy, Jack, them hooks!
Hey, Long Jack. What's the matter?
We were putting out our second tub, and Jack was snagged overside.
He might as well have fastened to an octopus.
- Get him a knife.
- Cut him off.
Nate, I think you need new dorymate, maybe.
One what's good fisherman.
Maybe next time you get one what ain't old lady...
...what gets all mixed up with knitting needles, huh?
- That Long Jack, he is mad.
- I knew he would be.
That will stop him fishing for a while,
I guess.
What you mean you knew?
When I heard you betting last night with Long Jack...
...I sneaked up on deck and tangled up his trawl.
What you do?
Sure. I put some knots in it and took a lot of bait off the hooks.
What are you going to do?
You still alive and strong, huh?
That good.
You go back. You tell other fish:...
..."Manuel ain't got no fisherman in his boat.
He got no dorymate.
He just got cheat".
And I no catch big, strong, honest fish like you that way.
Tell them good and loud.
Oh, but, Manuel, I just wanted us...
I just wanted you to win. That's all.
Well, what have we got here?
What's the matter? I don't remember hoisting no signal to come aboard.
We lose something.
Something we never have, I think.
This kid, he no like our way fishing.
He want come back.
Manuel, won't you listen?
You give him hand, maybe.
He got no way cheat himself overside.
Come on, son. Kid, come here.
Don't like fishing, son?
What happens... What do you do when people don't speak to you around here?
Now, you have to settle that yourself, son.
I'm skipper to a crew, but I ain't dry-nursing them.
I don't take no part in squabbles.
They settle that between themselves, just like everything else.
Whatever's foul between you and Manuel...
...you will have to free and clear yourself.
Hey, Doc.
Yes, sir, that sure do beat all.
- What was he saying about me?
- He don't say nothing about you.
Just got a new funny story, that's all.
You should have come aboard this morning, Jack.
These things are worked in pretty deep now.
And lose a day's fishing? No, sir.
That's what somebody expected me to do.
No yellow-livered job is going to keep me from doing my share...
...or winning a bet, either.
I can pull this one through, Jack...
...but I'm afraid
I'm going to have to cut the others.
Fine.
Here's the bet, Jack. I pay prompt, huh?
I'll take it
'cause I won it fair and square.
That's a sight more than you tried to be.
You crazy, Jack.
You don't think I fouled your trawl?
That trawl fouled itself, maybe?
I been handling trawl for 20 years,
Portegoosie...
...and I never seen line snarl itself that way, except by human hands.
Well, maybe you too anxious to win bet, Jack, huh?
Maybe you no keep your mind on things.
Listen, Portegoosie.
Either you or that kid done it.
It stands to reason.
If I found he put his Jonah flippers into my trawl...
...I'll wind him twice around the capstan and break him off short.
I think you put hooks in yourself so you got chance to drink more rum, huh?
You call me a cheat?
Jack, you talk too loud, you drink too much rum, huh?
I'll discover right now who done it.
Or, by thunder, I'll cut hooks out of you where there ain't none.
Jack, you hurt your arm.
Don't, Long Jack, don't.
It wasn't Manuel. I did it. I did it last night while you were having supper.
But I didn't mean you should get the hooks in your arm this way.
Honest, I didn't.
I just thought we'd have a little fun and win...
- Why, you sneaking little...
- Jack, what you do?
You keep out of this, Portegoosie.
Oh, Long Jack, what do you worry about?
He admit the whole thing like regular grown fella.
He say he sorry.
Everything all right now.
Nothing's all right till I beat his ears off. Get out of my...
- You touch that kid, I tear you apart, see?
- Yeah?
Me, Manuel talking.
I tear you apart, see?
So don't get me mad, Long Jack.
I get all crazy and sick inside.
All right, start cutting, Disko.
Maybe he cut picture of your girl out there. Huh, Jack?
I am telling you, Manuel, keep that kid away from me.
He's a...
He's a Jonah, and you'll find this is only the beginning.
What's the matter, little fish, you sleepy?
- I'm so ashamed, Manuel.
- Sure.
We all got be ashamed once.
So we don't do things again what we got be ashamed of, see?
Yes, but you not speaking to me...
...and those hooks in Jack's arm...
Jack, he very tough man.
All fishermen have hooks in them.
Oh, sure. Two, three, four hooks.
My father, he have hook in his arm right here.
And three year later, he think he have pimple on back of his neck.
You know what was it?
Hook coming out.
And my father, he say, "So that's what's been in Denmark all this time, huh?"
That fine.
There's a school of fish
Way down deep in the sea
Where the little fish
Studied geography
My father, he teach me this song.
And I put your kind of words to it.
There they write on a slate
And they read from a book
Learn to run with the bait
Then just leave them the hook
I got to sing every time I get mad.
It drive those flying fish out of my stomach, do you know?
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
You'll be a baleia
By-and-by
Baleia, that mean big fish...
...like whale, you know?
With fins and a tail
To help you sail
And maybe some wings
To help you fly
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Here's Disko. Cod must be coming.
Hello, friend!
- Hiya, James!
- Come on over.
There the Blue Gill.
She's from Gloucester, same as us.
And there's the Elizabeth K. Brown.
She sail good when the skipper he is sober.
There the Flying Swan.
She drag her anchor all time.
Everybody comes here and fishes last...
...because it's the biggest and best bank, huh?
Sure. Only some come too soon, some come too late.
Disko, he come right with codfish, see?
- Say...
- Look, look, look!
There Virgin Rock I tell you about.
Now watch, watch, she gonna roar.
Say, that's the bottom of the ocean.
Sure. She get lonesome sometimes.
She come up for a little look around.
Yes, sirs, by thunder, there she is.
I think that Jennie Cushman she filled with fish already.
She beat us home, huh, Disko?
He got here too early.
The real run ain't started yet.
By this time tomorrow, we'll be fishing
72-hour stretches, hand line.
The cod will be covering this bank like herring.
Walt Cushman beats me into Gloucester,
I'll hang myself with an eel.
Hey, at the wheel, there. Downwind!
All right, up, up, up. Hurry.
Pick it up. That thing's squirming.
Bring him in, Danny boy, bring him in.
In case some of them ain't expecting this.
We're full up and ready for home.
Hey, little fish, that's for us. Disko say we all full up and we go home. Come on.
Hey, pitch up that last fish, Manuel.
Then you and Harvey's going to take me a-visiting.
- Hey, Daniel?
- Yes, sir.
As soon enough hands come aboard, tell them to turn to...
- ...and heave up that anchor short.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, aboard the vessel.
Would anyone on the Flying Swan be wanting to send any mail to Gloucester?
We got sickness aboard.
We're heading for home.
Go on, Disko Troop.
You and your sickness.
You're just crowing, that's all.
No, we all catch too many fish, too soon.
We all sick about it.
Well, some of the lads expected you, Disko.
You could mail those, if you will.
It's a pleasure to be postman to you, Benjamin.
Why don't you sign up with me next season...
...and get home before the snow flies?
I know what you're going to say, Disko.
I don't want none of your sarcasm.
We heard your bell and saw your flag.
I hope you founder with all hands.
It's nice to have your good wishes, John.
Hey, Disko.
If our new baby is born before I get back...
...talk Molly out of naming him
Hubert will you?
- She wants to call him Hubert.
- Another baby, Martin?
Well, you ought to stay at sea all the time.
That's what he do if he stay on this boat.
Hey, there! Aboard the Bluegill.
Any mail for Gloucester?
Kind of late starting the crew, ain't you, Disko?
Well, I just thought
I'd like to carry your mail, Peter.
We just come back from rowing our mail over to the Jennie Cushman.
- That's a poor attempt at a joke, Peter.
- Yeah?
Does that look like a joke?
Why the sneaking sand shark.
Never ring a bell nor nothing.
Never give us no sign he was going to swing off today.
Get back to the vessel.
Give me them oars.
- But I can...
- Well, go on then. Put your back into it.
Hey, aboard the vessel.
- Get that anchor in!
- Hey, what's eating Disko?
- Is he liquored?
- Aye on that. It's the Cushman.
Pull up your foresail.
Hey, Disko.
Here comes the Cushman.
You don't think I took it for a waterspout, do you?
Hey, get that anchor in.
A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho.
A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho.
Goodbye, Disko. What's the matter?
Have you run aground?
You haven't any mail for Gloucester, have you, sir?
If you'd save your wind to fill your sails...
...you might keep us from passing you.
- We're going to race the Jennie Cushman?
- Sure.
Come on.
This fine kind racing business.
You got that backside anxious business, huh?
You gonna row or swim to Gloucester, maybe.
This fine time diving and swimming.
Put your back into that windlass.
You don't think that anchor's going to float up out of the water, do you?
Sway up on them halyards...
...and you needn't be afeared of parting them.
Wipe down them dories.
We're going to bury her nose this trip.
I can't work with this in me.
Pull it through, will you?
- Start hollering. Nobody hear you.
- I haven't the time.
Now stick that in your face and suck blood out.
Anchor all clear.
Get it aboard and cathead it.
On your main halyards now.
Sway up that mainsail!
Come on, sway her up.
Two blocks is where I want to see her.
Come on!
She's got a good lead on us, Capt. Disko.
Yeah. Got his topsails set already.
Running like a scared sardine.
I'll climb over his stern rail or sail the bottom out of us.
She's stepping now.
Just look at this lady go.
It's awful heavy going, Disko.
If a big one ever hits her when she's heeled over like this...
Don't you worry about this little lady.
She can take care of herself.
I told you so. Now what'll I do?
Ease her off a bit. Give her a hand.
She'll right herself.
Disko must have picked up an engine someplace.
Yeah. Well, wait till tonight.
I'm shortcutting across Franklin Shoals.
He won't dare follow me with his draft.
- Six fathom.
- Six fathom. Yes, sir...
...he's taking a shortcut across this bank, and thinking I'm going to get scared...
...and swing her off.
Well, I'll cut shorter.
Five fathom.
They're feeling for the bottom, all right.
- Five fathom.
- He can do it with that hull of his, Disko.
But we draw more water than the Cushman, don't we?
I know what water we draw.
You keep her to it.
Three-and-a-half fathom.
Hey, Disko, you ain't been looking down the neck of a jug again, have you?
Now listen here, farmer,
I can draw 16 feet of water...
...and not find bottom, can't I?
I ain't ripping out no keels, but I'm going to beat Walt Cushman...
...into Gloucester and that's all there is to it. So don't you swing her off.
Why, I know this bottom as well as my wife knows her own kitchen.
- You keep her to it now.
- I'm with you, Capt. Troop.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll bet old Walt's hot under his hatches.
- Shake your bustle, little woman.
- Yes, sir.
Manuel, we're gonna pass them soon.
Oh, sure. That Disko, he pass anything.
He half porpoise, I think, huh?
What are you doing?
I figure up how much
I get my share fish in there.
If market price good, say four-and-a-half, five cents pound, Manuel, he get...
By golly, I gonna have lots of money.
And with my $3 a month,
I'll have $9, won't I?
Sure. We very rich men, now, huh?
We have fun spending it when we go ashore, you and me, huh?
- What will you do ashore?
- Well, first I gotta go church store.
You know, where you buy a crucifix and Madonna and things.
And I buy a little two-place gold candlestick I see there...
...that I take to church, and I light candles for my father's birthday.
3rd this month, August.
Oh, that's very nice, Manuel.
Not so nice as my father should have, maybe.
It's nice in small way.
I think maybe
I light candle for myself, too.
- I have few bad thoughts this trip.
- You never had any bad thoughts.
- Oh, sure.
- What were they?
- I forget them now but I have them I think.
- Then what will you do?
Oh, then I get dressed up.
Oh, I go to get nifty suit.
You know, purple-colored.
Oh, very nifty suit.
With cloth-topped shoes to match, you know? And big pearl buttons.
And then I get new tie with big yellow flowers.
Then I walk up and down Duncan Street, and I say, "Hey, girls, girls...
- ...hey, look, look. Manuel is in town".
- Girls?
Oh, sure. Beautiful girls. I got maybe five, six girls in Gloucester.
I tell each one I like her best.
You gotta tell big lies to girls...
- ...to make them happy.
- You don't go with the girls?
Oh, sure I go with girls.
Every man go with...
I guess maybe you're right.
- I don't go with girls.
- I kind of thought you were kidding.
Oh, sure, sure.
That girl business is all kidding. Sure.
I think maybe I gotta do some more kidding from now on, huh?
Here we talk all time about what I do.
What you do?
You talk to your father on telephone, huh?
You tell him you live and happy, huh?
My father?
You forgot about your father what own that big boat you fall off...
...and he think maybe you swallowed up by shark or something.
Oh, well, I don't know.
You don't know how happy he be, huh?
- Oh, I guess he'll be glad, all right.
- He leave his skin, I think.
He hug you to pieces and take those pieces back home with him, huh?
But I don't want to go back home, Manuel.
You don't want go home?
Well, I mean...
What do you mean, little fish?
I want to stay here with you in Gloucester and go out fishing again this way.
You want be fisherman?
I want to be a better fisherman than Tom Platt or Dan.
I want to be as good as you are.
As good as me, huh?
Oh, that very nice, little fish.
But how about your father? He come, too?
Oh, well, I could see him between trips, if he wants to see me.
What you mean, if he want to see you, little fish?
Oh, well, he's got his business and everything. He'd be all right.
I want to be with you, Manuel.
Please.
My little fish.
If you all want to see a boat what's going to be passed, come and see one.
Hold her to it, Manuel.
We'll lay her right alongside them.
It will be the best boat from here in.
I'll take a reach for his beard as we pass by.
Them topsails will carry away if we keep this up.
I'll take the lower spars out of her before I'll let Walt Cushman...
...work the windward of me.
She's driving now.
Yes, sir! Walk along, little girlie.
They're coming now, Walt!
I guess they got us.
No, he ain't! There's more than one way to open a clam.
Stand by to come about!
What's this? Disko, he coming about.
For more funny business, I think.
Why, the calm-weather coward!
Can't take an honest licking.
Try and bluff me, will he?
Stand by the main sheet!
Steady, Manuel.
Now watch him jump and holler when he has to give way.
I'm gonna cut plumb across his bow!
- Give away to her, Disko.
- Well, I ain't giving way, neither.
- You've got to budge.
- I'll budge like a barnacle.
She'll cut us down, sure.
- Steady as you go!
- Hold her to it, Manuel! Don't lose an inch.
Land sakes, Disko, here she comes!
Hard to starboard!
I had the right of way, you old beach goat!
- You must have mislaid it somewhere!
- Still riding anchor, ain't you?
Well, we ain't to Gloucester yet. I'll do more than keep you in sight, Disko!
Capt. Cushman is a sailor
But he should have been a tailor
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Cushman might have been a grocer
But a first-class seaman, no, sir
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Poor old Walt broke his jib, and he's checking his topsails.
You'll best do the same, Disko.
That main top'll go if you don't.
Well, since you're such a nervous galoot, and we got old Walt licked to a frazzle...
I'll mind what you say.
Go aloft with Jack, Manuel.
Stand by to try the topsails.
I go up to get a little air,
I think, maybe?
Want to luff her first?
I'll luff her when you reach the masthead.
Somebody open window and let in nice breeze, eh, Jack?
I'll bet Manuel is the best fisherman in the whole fishing fleet, isn't he?
Stand by to clue up the fore topsails!
- Step lively up there now!
- Slack away below!
Hey! Look out for yourselves!
- Watch it!
- Manuel!
Jump down!
Manuel!
Luff her, Nate!
In heaven's name, Nate, luff her.
I can't, she's jibing!
Hold fast, Manuel!
Manuel! Manuel!
Get a dory overside!
Are you all right, Manuel?
Can you work free?
Doc!
Capt. Disko!
We'll get you out of this in a minute, Portegoosie!
He says he's good as dead. Gone.
He knows it.
Why, Doc? Why?
He's stove in.
All the bottom half of him's gone.
But he don't want the kid to know.
You're all right, aren't you, Manuel?
You aren't hurt, are you?
I all right, little fish.
What's holding up that dory?
Disko, don't put dory overside!
You hear what Doc...
But we've got to free you, Manuel.
No. I say don't put dory overside!
What's he mean?
What's the matter, Manuel? Manuel!
Hey, Harvey! Harvey, mind the boy!
No, not out here. Go back.
You're all right, aren't you?
You aren't hurt, are you, Manuel?
I all right.
Get that dory in the water.
I can't do nothing, Disko.
He's fouled in the backstay.
Manuel!
The drift's tightening, Disko.
You'll have to cut him loose, or it'll take him in half.
No.
We ain't cutting loose unless it's going to help you free Manuel.
You cut him away, Disko, you hear me?
Get me an ax!
No, Capt. Disko. No!
You cut that line, it'll carry him under.
We can't just keep him out there till the line saws him in half.
Get me an ax.
I sorry about race, Disko.
You beat him next year, huh?
Manuel!
Now listen, little fish...
I go now and fish with my father.
You remember I tell you he keep seat for me in his dory.
What are you talking about?
You're not going. We'll save you.
We have good times together, eh, little fish?
We laugh, we sing, so you smile now.
Come on, smile.
Long Jack can fix it.
You'll be all right. See, Manuel?
Good.
Manuel, he be watching you. You'll be best fisherman ever, little fish.
No, no, Manuel. No.
Manuel!
Well, goodbye again, Harvey.
So long, sailor.
Going down to get your pay, Harv?
I guess so.
You're leaving too, huh, Long Jack?
Yep.
You'll begin to grow whiskers right soon, and I thought maybe this might be...
...a good thing for you to start in with.
Thanks. Thanks, Long Jack.
You've just got fuzz now, but if you start scraping them off they'll toughen up...
...and get like... Get like...
Fair weather, Harv.
Goodbye, Long Jack.
I got everything, I guess.
Yeah. Say, Dan, these clothes...
I guess I kind of wore them out some.
Oh, that's all right.
Well, Dan, I'd like to keep them...
...but I can't pay you out of my pay yet because...
...well, there's something I sort of wanted to do. So I was just thinking...
There ain't no hurry. Your pop can settle it with my mom when he gets here.
Say, is he really flying out here all that way? All in one day?
I guess so.
You sure got the laugh on all of us...
...him having all that money you said he had and everything.
Say, Dan, when somebody...
...I mean, when something happens to somebody...
...what do they do with the rest of their things?
Their family get them, I suppose, or whatever kin they have.
Well, did he have any kin?
No, not that anybody knowed of.
Well...
If someone liked someone a great deal...
...and he didn't have any kin, that would sort of make him a kin almost, wouldn't it?
And, well, if they had something like this, for instance, that wasn't worth a lot...
I don't know, Harvey.
You better ask Pop about that.
He'd know more about that.
Oh.
Well, boy, come to get your pay?
Why...
There you are, our deal when you signed on.
Fisherman's Home?
Yeah, that's where the poor and old and crippled of us...
...set on a sunny porch and try to out-lie each other.
Manuel would want it that way.
You wouldn't have a better idea, you think?
Well, he wanted to get a candlestick for his father with two places.
How much would that cost?
Oh, $2 or $3, I reckon. Here.
Oh, then that's all right.
I have enough.
What'll you do with the rest of Manuel's things, Capt. Disko?
Oh, we'll send them up along to the Home,
I guess.
Does this have to go?
Why, no, Harvey.
I thought maybe you'd like to keep that.
Your daddy will be here directly.
You're kind of stretching to see him.
Ain't you?
Yes, sir.
When are you going out fishing again?
Oh, in about six weeks, when we're shipshape aloft.
Well, will Dan go, too?
No, that's the winter season.
Dan'll stay here ashore, school.
Then you'll need someone to take his place, won't you?
Yes, sir, I need a good hand to take Dan's place.
Well, I was thinking...
Maybe I'm not quite good enough yet...
...but Manuel said I was getting...
Manuel said...
Well, son?
Well, Manuel taught me so much,
I know I could.
And if you'll take me along, I'll...
Well, now, there's nobody
I'd rather sign than you, Harvey.
But ain't you kind of forgetting...
...all the lost time you and your daddy have to catch up with each other?
You'll want to berth alongside him for some time to come, won't you?
- Yes, sir, but...
- Harvey!
...he has lots to do.
And I like being a fisherman.
I've been thinking about it.
I want to be as good a one as...
I mean, I want to stay here with you on the We're Here.
Harvey! Hi, Harvey! Where are you?
It's Father.
There's your daddy now, ain't it?
Yes, sir.
So if you'll tell me now...
- ...whether I can...
- Harvey!
Hello, Father.
Harvey, Son.
Well, well. My boy again.
So you see, Harvey, by leaving early tomorrow morning...
...we can get the sleeper plane out of Boston.
- Yes, sir.
- You'll like the sleeper plane.
It's great. Big berths and everything, just like a Pullman.
- I know. But, look, Father.
- What?
I was thinking that if...
Maybe I could go somewhere on a boat.
All right. I was going to put the yacht up for the winter...
...but we might take her out and go to Bermuda.
I didn't mean the yacht, I meant the...
Oh, well, I don't know.
Well, you see, the plane would get us to the ranch...
...in time for the rodeo after the roundup.
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Son?
But there's no fishing out there, is there?
The best trout fishing in the world.
And if I do say it myself, I can teach you to cast a fly wherever you want to put one.
Yeah, I read about that kind of fishing once in a magazine.
Manuel said that any fish that ate a bug was some kind of a frog.
Who's Manuel? He sounds like a pretty funny sort of person.
He's the man that picked Harvey out of the water.
Well, I certainly want to meet that man,
Capt. Troop.
- Where is he?
- He's dead, Mr. Cheyne.
Where are you going, Son?
Just out. I'll be back in a little while.
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- No.
I mean, I'll be back in a little while.
Really, I will.
Well, I guess that's all the vittles.
Will you come in the parlor and chat a while?
Yes.
Where was he going, Capt. Troop?
Oh, I reckon he has a couple of errands to do.
Will you have a pipe?
I got some pretty fairish tobacco here.
- No, thanks.
- Have a chair.
That was fine pie, Mother.
Thank you, Discobolus.
I'll leave the dishes awhile.
Dad, is this boom set in here just right?
Well, let's see now.
Capt. Troop, tell me, that hurdy-gurdy...
...and the razor, were they Manuel's?
Yes, they was, Mr. Cheyne.
He must have been a pretty fine man.
Harvey's a fine boy now, the kind of boy I'd always hoped he'd be.
Yes. They was real dorymates,
Mr. Cheyne.
Yes, I had that chance once.
I'm afraid I threw it away.
Now that I got the chance again, I...
Well, I guess I'm just getting what I deserve.
Well, as long as you set your course a little too late...
...maybe Manuel sailed it for you.
But that don't say you can't sail it after him.
You're still the boy's dad, man.
A boy is never too old not to need a dad.
You just hold a hawser out to him.
Someday he's going to lay onto it and pull you right into his heart.
And when you do get in there, you'll find
Manuel mighty satisfactory company.
Yes, sir.
Sure you won't change your mind, have a pipe, Mr. Cheyne?
No thanks, Capt. Troop. I...
I think I'll take a little walk, if you'll excuse me.
Yeah, why don't you do that?
Stroll up by the church, maybe?
Yes, it's mighty pretty there this time of evening.
That one is from Manuel to his father.
Yes, my son.
And that one is from me to Manuel.
Do you think they're good enough?
I only had $9.
Oh, I know they are.
- What do I do now?
- Would you like to kneel here and pray?
- Can I say anything?
- Anything.
Do you have to stay here?
No, my son.
Look...
...I guess you have an awful lot of things to do...
...taking care of everybody.
Look, if it is that way, the way Manuel said...
...could you fix it so someday...
...there'll be an extra seat in Manuel's father's dory...
...with him and Manuel?
Because I just got to be with Manuel.
I got to.
I guess that's all I wanted to ask.
So, please.
Harvey.
Harvey, Son.
I just wanted to get out in the air for a little while.
Go ahead, Son, let it go.
I know about it.
- I know about Manuel.
- Please, please go away.
Harvey, we haven't talked much before, have we?
But we can start now.
We can talk this over.
We can talk over everything from now on, can't we, Son?
You better go up to the house.
I'll be back in a little while.
- Really, I will.
- No, let me stay here with you.
Maybe I can help.
Come here to your dad, Son.
I don't mind your crying.
Please don't get in this boat.
This is Manuel's dory. Manuel's and mine.
I know it hurts, Son, but you won't always feel like this.
Just think, tomorrow you'll be on that big sleeper plane.
Before you know it, you'll be flying right over the tops of the Rocky Mountains.
I don't want to go anywhere but here.
I want to stay here...
...and go fishing, the way Manuel did.
- I want to be where Manuel is.
- Harvey.
Son, won't you listen?
- I'm lonely, too.
- Please, please go away.
I'll be all right, if you'll please let me alone. Please.
And so we are met here today...
...facing the open sea on three points of the compass...
...to pay tribute to the men who have sailed from this port...
...and gone down to that sea, never to return.
For three centuries...
...women and children of Gloucester men have stood upon this shore and cried:
..."There go the ships".
This year, as every year...
...there are those that have waited in vain.
It shall be ever thus.
In years to come...
...women of Gloucester shall watch and wait...
...sending their prayers and faith to men over the horizon.
Men whose every day is one of life and labor uncertain...
...but men of strong faith in themselves...
...in their ships...
...and in the God who is on land and sea.
So to those of these men...
...whose last resting place is beneath the sea they loved...
...we pay our humble tribute...
...as we cast these wreaths and flowers...
...upon the waters of their outgoing tide.
George Appleton.
William Barry Chester.
Allen Robert Case.
Zachary Benjamin Dennis.
Winston Ellery.
Michael Farnsworth.
Manuel Fidello.
Harry Gunderson.
John Frederick Ethram.
Newt Ellison.
Dave Miller.
Henry Barkell.
Thomas Walton.
Augustus Nelson.
Phineas Sawyer.
Stand by for the mail.
We know you're not a pirate.
We know, you'll get your knife back when we dock in Singapore.
Say, you just get on a phone and call Scranton, PA...
- and ask anybody about J. Wilberforce...
- Have you any arms sir?
Just these you see growing out of me armpits.
You'll do.
No excuses Mr. Atkins, your job is to look after this dock.
If I ever find it in this state again, I'll, I'll...
How's your wife?
She's, she's very much better sir and thank you very much for the flowers.
Oh, don't thank me, my gardener has to get rid of them somehow.
Who's the big shot?
Sir Guy Wilmerding, managing director of the line.
Right this way Sir Guy.
Gangway please.
Glad to have you with us again sir.
Oh, none of that mush.
I know how glad you are.
Not bad, not bad at all for a synthetic stone.
- You ought to know Paul.
- My lovely Olga.
Hey, I bet that lug stops in China.
That's the insignia of Wing YuLan, everything in the archipelago pays dividends to him.
Good morning purser.
Good morning Miss YuLan.
We've made arrangements to take your chairs aboard in the after gangway.
Thank you.
Mr. Dawson sir, here comes the captain.
Look at him, with a 3 days hangover and watch him grouse.
Of all the ungrateful, brass hearted skippers of a rusty old teakettle... who thinks he's still strutting in the Royal Navy.
Our captain.
Oh Alan? Alan Gaskell? I got some last minute cargo for you.
Oh hello Ken, what you doing up in broad daylight?
Oh Captain Gaskell. I want you to meet
Charlie McCaleb, the American novelist.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Well, Hong Kong seems to have taken you to her bottom again.
Now wait a minute,
I've seen your face before.
No, don't tell me, it's right on the tip of my tongue.
- Remember Johnson?
- Johnson?
- Who?
- Johnson.
Oh Johnny old boy, what you doing way out here?
- Oh, maybe you can tell me.
- No, no, this is Captain Gaskell.
- The master of the ship you're sailing on.
- Hiya captain, coming along with us?
Yes, yes, I'm afraid so.
He's supposed to be over here gathering material for a new novel, I've dragged him... through wars, riots and revolutions.
He doesn't even know he's in China.
If you should stir up anything exciting, why... shove him in a front seat and tie his eyes open.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute,
I'm not running a day nursery... and I'm not stirring up any excitement just for the sake of literature, see you later.
Don't you worry old fella, I'll be right there, I'm the old Ringside Kid.
Got an eye like an eagle.
Goodbye Captain
Greshall, had a marvelous trip.
Ship ahoy, ship ahoy.
Ship ahoy.
- Are you all right Charley?
- I cover the waterfront.
- Steward.
- Yes sir? Good morning sir.
That's your idea of clean brass?
- Sorry sir...
- You haven't answered my question.
No sir, it isn't my idea clean brass sir.
You've been sampling my whiskey again, haven't you?
Oh, yes sir.
- Not as good as the last lot, is it?
- No sir.
Then why haven't you done something about it?
- I will sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you sir sir Guy wants to see you sir.
- Good morning captain.
- Good morning.
Ah, so there you are.
Good morning Mrs. Aiken.
We were just talking about you captain.
Mrs. Aiken tells me you've been sensationally blotto ever since you went ashore.
- Sir Guy?
- Oh, she does, eh?
You don't like my behavior ashore or aboard ship, you can get a new boy.
In fact, I wish you would.
- You wouldn't go if you could.
- Wouldn't I?
I'm so close to being back to
England now I can hear Big Ben chiming.
I've heard that from men for 50 years.
It's only the weak ones that sneak out of the China Seas.
It's the bullheads like you that stay on.
What about a little spot to keep your brain from addling?
No, I haven't the time.
I've got to get the pride of your fleet underway.
Mr. Rockwell, go to the captain's saloon, check those chronometers.
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.
Third officer hasn't come aboard yet sir.
Yes, I know, I've just been looking him over, he's in the Sepoy Hospital.
Tried to clean out
High Spade McQueen's last night.
- Bad sir?
- Yes, knife in the kidneys.
Port captain is trying to find someone to replace him.
- What you got in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco sir.
It's bad enough to have a ship like this and a captain that looks like... me without having a chief officer who looks like you.
I'm sorry sir.
Had it in me jaw when I came on duty and I forgot all about it.
Oh Mr.Willet of the Royal
Canada Bank is awaiting to see you sir.
- He's just down there at your quarters.
- Thank you.
- Hello Willet.
- Good morning captain.
- Gold come aboard yet?
- Yes sir.
- All stowed away as we agreed?
- In the steamroller.
- Good.
- Thank you sir.
Wipe that smile off your face.
Is that your idea of clean brass?
You haven't answered my question.
Did I ask you?
A little too big for you, isn't it Mr. Rockwell?
I apologize sir.
Chief officer sent me down to check the chronometers.
Yeah.
- But I don't keep them in my cap.
- No sir.
- What you going to do with that button?
- To button it sir.
I was just hoping you weren't too angry with me sir.
- Oh, carry on.
- Thank you sir.
Excuse me sir.
- Who's in there?
- It's China Doll, a gal that drives men mad.
What the devil are you doing aboard?
Nothing lambie, just showering the dewdrops off the body beautiful.
How many hours do we have to spend saying goodbye before it takes?
That's just the trouble toots, it took too good.
Gee, were sweet to me.
Say, I thought maybe you could use all that money you won at the Tai Fan last night.
Oh, then we were there?
Yeah, we had a million laughs.
I made 17 straight passes myself.
- Get on your horse, we're shoving off.
But why you so anxious to get me out of here?
Is that hunk of caviar making the round trip?
What hunk of caviar?
That red headed Russian princess whose aboard from Singapore.
She isn't a Russian and she isn't a princess... and I have my doubts about her hair being red.
I don't care what she is, if she was a
Chinese sextet, it'd be the same thing to me.
What I'm trying to get through your numb skull is that I'm not going to stand by...
Now, wait a minute Dolly.
You and I are friends.
We had a lot of fun together.
And as far as I'm concerned, you're a number one girl in the archipelago.
But I don't remember making any vows to you nor do I recall asking for any.
Don't you get polite at me, when you start talking with your high hat on I...
I know you mean it and and scares me.
Say, who do you think you are anyway?
- If I had a nickel's worth of pride...
- Alright.
That's the way you feel about, I'm not standing in your way.
That's just the soup I'm in,
I don't feel that way at all.
You, you dog.
Oh, that's more like it.
Come in.
- Pilot tug's alongside sir.
- Alright.
Stand by to single up your lines fore and aft.
Aye, aye sir.
Alright, come on now nuisance, over shore.
Oh but I'm looking, what I'm going to do with my ticket? It's all paid for and everything.
And I knew you'd something up your sleeve.
Alright, come on, we'll get your money back.
No but I got a job in Singapore.
- Honest...
- Oh yes, yes, I know.
I suppose they've elected you mayor.
No but it's on the level, Hoffmann sent me a contract for the rest of the season.
No.
Look, I know how you feel about it.
I won't come near you. Nobody will...
No.
Alright toots, you, you win, I...
I hope you have a good trip, goodbye.
Alright, alright, if you've got your ticket and a job, I don't suppose I...
- Lambie.
- Stop wrestling me around.
You turning this skiff into an excursion launch.
Come on, snap into it before the fore hold loading.
You just came down to say goodbye?
You brought enough of your cigarettes to last on a voyage to New York.
Oh I'll smoke a lot more cigarettes than that toots, before we ever really say goodbye.
Listen, I told you to...
- Good morning sir.
- Davids, isn't it? Tom Davids?
Yes sir.
Your port captain told me to report for duty as 3rd officer.
- Duty as what?
- Third officer.
These rocking chair sailors ashore.
Here I am in the middle of the typhoon season, a tough voyage ahead.
I ask for a fighter, and they send me a punching bag.
Give me a chance, is the first one I had for over a year.
I know these waters better than most, I've sailed them as a master for over 10 years.
No one had a better record on this coast than I had.
Then, just because of an accident, I'm not a coward.
Stow it Davids, you let pirates scuttle your ship... and you lost every white man aboard except yourself.
The board of trade lifted your ticket, I didn't.
Give me a chance please.
You got a uniform?
Nothing clean sir.
Alright, I'll have the steward give you one of mine.
- Yes sir.
- Report to Mr. Dawson.
I'll have the uniform laundered and return it to you.
No, that's all right.
Keep it, you probably need it.
Thank you sir.
Well, if it ain't old rough on rat himself, how are you, Jamesy?
Dolly, you're looking just as pretty as ever, what you've been doing?
- Bidding the big boy goodbye, eh?
- Goodbye nothing, I'm making this voyage.
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.
Why, I'm just as happy as if
I'd won the Calcutta sweepstakes.
You ought to have the shekels piled up to the roof by now.
I haven't done so bad, you know...
Dolly, I'm still willing to share it all with you.
Say, there ain't enough dough in all Asia to make me change the way I feel about one guy.
Still crazy about that Gaskell, eh?
Well, whenever you get tired of running around with an Airedale... and you want to run around with a
Saint Bernard, why, you let me know.
Sure, whenever I get lost in the Alps, I'll whistle for you.
- Alright, I'll come running, goodbye Dolly.
- See you later.
- You'd be easy with them there pigs.
- Well Kingston, you're a wonder.
How you've been able to sail with that... sour bellied Gaskell as long as you have, I don't know.
- Hello Jamesy.
- Well Captain Gaskell, I was just telling...
Kingston how happy I was to be sailing with you.
- Hey, stow that on the port side.
- Yes, yes.
You still carrying that cargo of soft soap, eh?
No, no, really, I mean it. You don't know what a safe feeling it is to be... sailing with a captain that's never been raided by the pirates.
Yes, there's not much profit for pirates in this zoo of yours.
Say, who you swindling with this scrubby lot, eh?
That's the finest lot of animals I've ever shipped.
Well, they're not as noisy as that last batch of sopranos you had.
Say now, Jamesy, just between you and me.
- What do you give them to keep them quiet?
- I just give them one of these little pills.
And they sleep and dream all the way across, never lose a pound.
I don't suppose you ever thought of giving them a little... gravel just to add a pound though.
Why captain, that would be dishonest.
They got big feet for singsong girls, haven't they?
Well they, they don't bandage the feet nowadays, these are enlightened days.
Those feet are big even for enlightened days.
- Captain Gaskell sir.
- Sir Rockwell.
What is a woman do when you throw something at her?
- A woman?
- She dodges it, a man catches it.
Here, catch. Sergeant of guard.
Take them to shore, charge them with attempted piracy.
And ask the police commissioner to wireless me anything he can sweat out them.
Hido, Hido.
You go ashore and tell Moray to bail them out before they start to talk.
Tell Ngah I'll go through with the job as agreed but he'll need more men, go on.
Hey captain, that's good work.
You're the finest skipper on this coast.
Thanks.
- See you on the next trip.
- Goodbye and thank you for all your trouble.
- Take care of yourself dear.
- I will.
- So long Sybil and good luck.
- Thank you so much.
- B-39.
- Thank you.
- Don't forget to write Sybil.
- I won't.
- Sybil?
- Alan?
It is Alan.
Oh, so this is your ship. My, I am lucky.
Yes, yes, I'm captain of this tub.
Are you visiting out here?
Just traveling.
You might start to unpack Pether.
I've been just traveling for some time.
I, I heard about Bart, I meant to write, but it was so long after he died.
News is slow out here.
We spoke of you so often, wondering what you were doing.
Oh, getting into trouble mostly, then trying to get out of it.
Well, you're in for more trouble now, looking after me for a whole voyage.
I'm in your hands again Alan.
Look here Alan, can't you get this boat? What's wrong?
- Look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- I have.
- Gangplank secure sir.
- All clear forward sir.
- Cast off your bow line.
- Aye, aye sir.
Good morning captain.
- Hiya neighbor, the name is Timmons.
- Ah, I can take it or leave it alone.
No, no, the name, Timmons.
T - I - M - M - O - N - S.
I'm the guy that can do it too.
Who is it?
- Who is it?
- It's just me toots.
Listen, when I told you to stay out of here, I wasn't shadowboxing, I meant it.
- Oh, I just came in to borrow a book.
- I don't keep them in my bathtub.
I decided to improve my mind.
You better take two books, give yourself an even break.
Now, how about you doing about 3 turns around the deck... before dinner just to work up an appetite, eh?
Ok, Ok toots. I know you ain't got much time to fool around with passengers.
- It's your own fault, you wanted to be one.
- Except maybe that English dame.
- You're becoming very observant.
- I saw her when she came aboard.
She looked like she was smelling a dead fish or something.
Considering her surroundings that's highly possible.
And I also got a load of you when you moved her into the royal suite.
Why didn't you lay out a red plush carpet for her?
Well, that's just a throwback to my old manners.
The lady happened to know me when
I acted that way for the sheer joy of it.
Oh, I get it, a hometown honey.
I knew her years ago and her husband.
Married? Oh, being married don't seem to tie her down none.
He's dead.
So, so she's back in circulation again.
Well, maybe it's a good thing you didn't get hooked up with nobody out here.
Thanks but if I'd had a more definite tie,
I might've behaved a bit more decently.
Say, if you ain't decent boyfriend, you'll do until something decent comes along.
Out here maybe.
But anywhere else in the world we'd both be a little bit soiled.
Did you ever see an English river Dolly?
No, I'm dumb at geography, just like I am at everything else.
Well, it's cool, clear and clean.
Put a stream like that alongside any river out here, dirty, yellow, muddy... you'll see the difference.
That was only a few years ago.
The pirates killed every white person aboard except the Capt and then scuttled the ship.
Better take care of these pearls in the case of piracy.
Why? They're artificial, they're not worth anything.
12 and a half bucks, quite a bargain I'd say.
Where did you get them Mr. Timmons?
- Well, she picked them up...
- I bought them myself in Tokyo.
Well you know, it's not always easy to tell the real from...
- I'm sure you didn't pay too much for them.
- Bet your sweet life she didn't.
That little woman gets her money's worth every time, eh Poopsie?
Hey, you see that chess game over there?
When I was 4 years old, I played
10 people all at once, blindfolded.
I lost every game.
Pirates? Baloney.
Where did you really get those pearls, eh?
- You won't tell Wilbur, will you?
- Twelve and a half bucks to Wilbur.
That pirate hooey of yours is stuff they always tell tourists.
I'll bet they don't rate one through nine with our rum-runners.
Bosh, your rum-runners learned the game from our pirates.
Even the hijacking and that trick of identifying each other... by matching the halves of a torn a hundred dollar bill.
- Here they use a hundred pound note.
- Sunday paper bunk.
- Hey mate, come here.
- Yes sir?
- How are you Mr. Davids?
- How are you Sir Guy?
Tell him that bunk about the ship they held up and scuttled.
Get a load of this, it's terrific.
- I don't remember saying anything Timmons.
- You can't get out of it like that.
Tell him about the one white officer who came out of it alive.
What's the matter with that bird?
Was I speaking out of turn?
I'm afraid you were, that's Tom Davids.
Captain of the ship I was telling you about.
Say, don't look now, well I think my stomach is full of butterflies.
Isabelle.
- Isabel MacCarthy.
- Yes ma?
Would you say that I looked like a lady?
No Miss Dolly, I've been with you all too long to insult you that-away.
Say, what's the difference?
What's that snooty
English dame got that I ain't?
She's more refined like.
She would never wear that dress with all them shiny beads you got.
That dress is more my type.
You've been hinting for that dress for a month.
Go on and take it, you spoiled it for me anyway.
You sure got the right feeling though honey.
I got to let this out a smidgen.
You sure is got the right instincts no matter what they all say.
What do they say?
Oh, it's just a mite of talk, they say yous got yourself so hooked on to that...
Captain Gaskell that he's shaking himself like a wet hound dog... and can't get you loose no how.
Yes Miss, they do, like a wet hound dog.
He can't shake me off, I hopped off, see?
And I'm glad I did, do you hear that?
I'm glad, I'm happy.
Sure you's happy honey.
But don't you worry, you'll get over it.
Twenty years on the China Seas and she never lost a spangle.
I had a spangle once, it was a cockier spangle.
She had a litter of field mice.
Good evening Miss Portland, I've got you the other side of Mr. MacArdle.
- Oh well, I get it, where is the big guy?
- You mean the captain miss?
He went, that is I believe he's escorting Mrs. Barclay.
Oh, why doesn't she put a ring in his nose so she can lead him around easier?
Excuse me sir.
Say, Ah Feng, bring me a double hooker of scotch quick.
Yes miss.
Well Jamesy, you old trambo, long time no see kid.
No fault of mine Dolly, you're the original one man girl..
As long as I've got a one gal guy.
I just saw Captain Gaskell upstairs walking with Mrs. Barclay.
Very lovely looking girl, isn't she?
She couldn't take me away from a girl like you in a thousand years.
Hey, what makes you think she's taking anything away from me, eh?
Get on the belt line and keep them coming.
I think you know everybody Sybil, except perhaps Miss YuLan, Mrs. Barclay.
How do you do?
- And Miss Portland.
- How do you do?
Hello.
You needn't be so confoundedly possessive
Alan I knew Mrs. Barclay long before you did.
Say, you had such a start.
I'm only trying to catch up.
Ah, you had your chance
Sir Guy but you spurned me.
At least Alan didn't meet me till after I was married.
That ruins all my guesses.
I had such a romantic meeting arranged for you two.
The squadron ball at Gibraltar, music, lanterns, uniforms...
Her husband was at sea so I claimed every dance.
- We walked back to the hotel together.
- With or without moonlight?
Oh, there was a harvest moon.
You've never seen a moon until you've watched the one over China Seas.
It'll be full by the time we get to Singapore.
Oh glorious.
Say, speaking of meetings Jamesy, do you remember that night in that putang joint... in Saigon when you and me met up with a certain party?
Oh, do I.
There wasn't any moon but he had a shiner on his left eye that lit up the whole street.
A cut on his right leg, why he'd bled to death if it hadn't been for China Doll here.
- My, that was a romantic meeting.
- She saved his life.
And never got a word of thank for it, I'll be darned.
I wish I could tell you what she said when I tried it.
You never used to be so particular about your language.
That's right Dolly.
This will be an awful comedown after the Royal Mail.
Oh, I don't know, there's something very real and dramatic about this atmosphere.
You know, pirates and machine guns, barricades...
Mr. McCaleb, I want you to meet a literary rival of yours Mrs. Barclay.
Oh, good evening Mr. McCaleb.
Thanks, I've got all the insurance I can handle.
And Mrs. Barclay, I'm sure I saw you in London two years ago.
Why, of course Miss Yu-LAN, it was at the American Embassy... and then again at the Gainsboroughs' in Sussex.
Peg, isn't she the most amazing hostess?
It was only two years before that I...
Too amazing for words, there I was, with a cinder in me eye as large as a paving block.
With the grand duke on one side of me and the marquis on the other... both trying to get pull my top lid over my bottom.
Miss Portland is a professional entertainer.
No, I am lady or you'd like me to try something else.
No, I'm afraid you haven't anything left for an encore.
So you think it's funny, eh?
What are you grinning at?
- You must be very fond of him.
- What makes you think so?
To humiliate yourself like this.
I'll see you later Alan.
Don't worry, he knows where the royal suite is and... so do I, I had it the first time I sailed on this ship.
The more violent the storm, the sooner it subsides.
When I want you to sound off, golden bells, I'll pull your rope.
I, I apologize for this exhibition, it's all my fault.
And as the man said when they were about to hang him, this will be a lesson to me.
Madam chairman and ladies of this literary group... it is with sentiments of profound respect that I address you this afternoon.
Because woman is the mother of all literature, I thank you.
Hey look, I'm awful sorry I blew up. Honest, I am.
But hookers of scotch and the fact that
I'm so fighting nuts about you, I can...
You saved me a lot of trouble, you painted the whole dirty picture... for her with a nice, truthful brush, thanks.
Gee toots, don't talk to me like that.
I get scared when you put the freeze on me.
Look, I'll go to her...
- apologize, do anything in the world you...
- You keep as far away from her as you can.
And farther away from me.
Come.
- Captain Gaskell sir.
- Well, what's wrong Mr. Rockwell?
Your navigation chart...
Excuse me sir, this navigation problem sir, I'm having trouble with it.
- Trouble?
- Yes sir.
Yes, I should say you are.
If your figures are correct Mr. Rockwell this ship is in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
Yes sir, it has me worried sir.
Yes.
Well, suppose you try adding here instead of subtracting.
Perhaps that'll put us back in the ocean again.
Yes sir, thank you sir.
- Alright.
- Excuse me sir.
How's it toots?
Well, go on and play dumb if you want to, I just came in to... tell you I'm not going to come around and pester you anymore.
Look.
I'm taking all my cigarettes.
You know, it's moonlight outside. Gee, it's pretty.
Ain't it funny, we always fight when it's moonlight and make up when it's raining?
It's about time for the rainy season, ain't it toots?
Ah, come on out of the trenches, I'm not going to throw any bombs, I'm harmless.
Yes, of course, you're as harmless as a revolution.
Well, don't forget your cigarettes.
I won't, I know an exit line when I hear one.
Well, anyway, it won't be so lonely while Jamesy is aboard.
I hate to hear you talk like that Dolly.
Well, a gal is got to do the best she can with what's around.
You owe yourself more than that.
The trouble is boyfriend, there ain't any male Mrs. Barclay, so charming, so refined.
The real trouble is there aren't enough female Mrs. Barclay.
Don't give it another thought Alan.
You know, I once hoped you'd know me very well but not that well.
But when you once hoped, you, you weren't in this part of the world.
No, that's true but here I am.
- Yes?
- Captain Gaskell.
Mr. MacArdle wants to go forward to look after his animals.
No MacArdle can't look at his animals.
I wouldn't let an admiral go forward without a guard.
You find it an exciting part of the world, don't you?
Exciting? Nursing and cursing a bunch of leftovers who are supposed to be officers... derelicts for a crew?
But ashore, the glamor of...
Yes, you saw me this morning after a trip ashore, did I look particularly glamorous?
Well, I wasn't thinking of backgrounds.
- That girl, she's glamorous, surely.
- Sybil, I don't deny her.
But you know why I came out here, why I resigned from the service.
- It's all I could do.
- Yes, we...
I might've cracked up
Bart's life if you'd stayed.
Sybil.
If I thought there was the slightest chance, I...
I'd stumble out with everything
I wanted to say six years ago, I...
Alan, I have a confession to make.
I'm not just traveling,
I followed a memory, traced you here.
And now that I've found you,
I don't care how you've lived.
I'll always be in love with you.
I'll jump ship at Singapore.
We'll dig up a magistrate or a chaplain.
A Buddhist monk, if there's none other. We'll go back together.
Oh, England.
I've a place in Sussex with a fireplace you can stand in.
Your cocoa sir.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Come in old man, come right in.
What's the matter? What happened to you?
The chef is been at the vanilla extract again sir.
Wait for me with a cleaver.
A cleaver is a new matter sir.
Ah yes. Well, give him a quart of brandy to taper off on, he be alright in the morning.
Sybil, I want you to meet the best chief steward in the line, Ted Gary.
Honest as the day is long.
And he said to Mrs. Barclay, right in front of me, I was the best steward in the line.
Honest as the day is long.
And never a word about that last bottle of whiskey I pinched.
No doubt, the old man is going soft.
Relieved me right in the middle of me watch so I could come to breakfast.
Called me Bertie.
I had a chew of tobacco in my mouth as big as that and he never even noticed.
And he said he'd take me to the races ashore.
Well...
That's the way it is with those two bottle men, I've never seen it fail.
- All of a sudden...
- I knew a man once in Liverpool that way.
Davids.
- Aren't you going to wait for your coffee?
- No.
- It's too stuffy here.
- And smelly too.
May I please have the sugar sir?
Thank you.
Mark.
- Good.
- Lovely shot.
That's a lovely gun.
I hope that they don't leave them laying around loose.
Captain lock them up all the time we no use.
- That's good.
- Mark.
- Hiya.
- Ah, good morning.
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.
I guess she's still burned.
Mark.
I got it then.
I'm afraid you're much too consistent for me Mrs. Barclay.
Oh, not at all.
Mark.
I received your note, really wasn't necessary.
Oh, I'm sorry I acted so crazy.
Say Jamesy, how about you and me starting a little competition for the common people, eh?
- Alright, I, I'll bet you a shilling.
- Ok.
Bring us a gun.
There you are.
Are you and Captain Gaskell going to make your home in Singapore or Hong Kong?
Oh, I don't think we're going to stay out here at all.
Did you hear what she said?
It's all over the ship that they're going to get married... the minute they get into Singapore.
- That's why Gaskell is turned sunny side up.
- Mark.
I think you're very wise not to stay in the Orient.
We have a saying out here...
After the cheap, strong wine, the most delicate tea has little flavor.
- Oh, be careful.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I...
Quite all right, you had no idea the gun was loaded.
Oh, you don't think I pointed it at you on purpose, do you?
There's nothing to think about Miss Portland.
The gestures of a woman like you simply do not exist.
Mark.
It's beautiful the way these ducks know how to throw the old harpoon.
That's one of the advantages of a very fine cosmopolitan education.
Come on Jamesy, let's you and me take a powder.
Clay pigeons, that's the thrilling sort of life you're headed for in England Alan.
Shooting clay pigeons, eh?
Exactly and whether you believe it or not, I'll revel in it.
Greetings boyfriend.
Well I, I understand congratulations are in order.
I'd like to be the first to wish you the best, you'll need it.
One day, you'll say something nice and never forgive yourself.
Look toots, I...
Oh gee, I don't blame you for being sore,
I know I've done a lot of stupid gabbing... but this is on the level, I wish you all the luck.
And that's one baby you'll never have... to be ashamed of. She's the real McCoy and she'll make a... a marvelous wife for you.
- I wish you meant that.
- I do.
Well, well, that's better.
Now, let's quit good friends, instead of like a couple of cabdrivers after a drunken brawl.
Yeah, I guess that's the way it ought to be done.
But I ain't been brought up to do the right thing like that English dame.
All I can say is what's down inside of me.
And I don't care how long you've been carrying the torch for her.
You can't quit me any more than I can quit... you and you can kiss a stack of cookbooks on that.
- Thank you.
- Well, anyway it'll be quieter in England.
- Wait till you get there, if you ever do.
- What's to keep me?
Well, I've been trying it for 30 years, there's something about this place.
From my windows I can see the whole harbor of Hong Kong.
Big ships coming, big ships going, the
China I know, the China I've helped to make.
And on quiet nights, off in the hills,
I can hear the sound of distant firing.
They were at it when I came and they'll be at it after I've gone.
More guns won't stop them too many of them.
And the only things they respect are courage and honor.
Yes and England's power, England's place here... can never be any greater than the men who represent her.
They might be able to use an
Englishman at home sometime, you know.
Oh, I was hoping that someday you'd take my place.
- I had me eye on you for a long time.
- Well, take it off.
I'm quitting the
China Seas as soon as we dock.
Well, if you're...
- in earnest?
- Dead earnest.
I'd better be looking for somebody to take your command, eh?
What about Dawson?
Dawson? Take my ship?
I've always heard you speak highly of him.
Yes. Yes, of course I speak highly of him.
Dawson is one of the best.
Absolutely, you couldn't do better.
Dawson?
I never forget a name or a face, now, I've seen you somewhere before.
You've seen me a dozen times a day since...
No, don't tell me, don't tell me, it's on the tip of my tongue.
The name is Timmons,
T - I - M - M - O - N - S.
How do you pronounce that?
Timmons, Timmons, Timmons, T- I - M - M...
I thought he said Timmons.
I drink to the health of Admiral Puff.
My compliments to Mr. Dawson.
- Tell him I'll be up on the bridge shortly.
- I drink to the health of Admiral Puff.
Whoopee, are you good Jamesy?
- Attaboy Jamesy.
- You called sir?
What? Oh, yes, yes. See that all the staterooms and portholes are secured.
- We're in for a blow.
- Will it be a real storm Alan? Terrifying?
All seas aren't alike, can't tell much more.
I did hope for your sake, though, it'd be an easy trip.
That's too much to expect from the China Seas.
Attaboy...
Anything else sir?
What? Yes.
Might tell them that anybody that can't hold his or her liquor... better lay off until this blows is over.
I'm afraid you're a good influence on him Sybil and I deplore it.
- Alright, here we go again.
- I beg your pardon.
Here's to the health of
Admiral Puff Puff Puff, three times.
- Ok?
- Perfect.
- I think you did one bounce too many.
- Ah, she was all right.
I had my eye on her just like a hawk.
My dear fellow, what do you suppose I was doing?
Oh, there's two against one, two against one.
Captain says the weather is blowing up, a word to the wise.
Come on Jamesy, we're off again.
Greatest game in the world, that makes men remember and women forget.
I'll play this game until you can't remember anything but your little Jamesy.
Here's to the health of Admiral Puff three times.
Keno, you forgot to say
Admiral Puff Puff Puff.
Oh, doggone it anyway, I...
- Drink up sir and start all over again.
- Come on, down the hatch.
Ah, don't look so sad toots, you doing swell.
Have you ever noticed Sir Guy, that a man is never angry with a woman he doesn't like?
- I had not, until now.
- Me either.
And I shall be more pleasant to her after this, shall we?
Good evening skipper, how's the barometer doing?
- Falling to a new low.
- Well, don't let that worry you captain.
Say, where you been keeping yourself stranger?
Have breakfast with me in the morning, if you can eat anything.
I'll be there, nothing takes my appetite.
Say, how about joining the game that kills all care?
Oh, I'm afraid it would kill me too, good night.
Kill nothing, all you need is a wooden, hollow leg to play this game.
Here's to the health of Admiral...
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
Missed out again Jamesy, sock it down boy.
It's thickening up like mud sir, we're running right into it.
Running into it? We're in it already.
Why don't you keep her on her course?
What you trying to do?
Write your name in the ocean?
Old man is getting back to normal, good thing with this coming on.
Put your oilskins on and get to your stations, stick her nose right into it.
Yes sir.
Mr. Davids, tell the steward to look out for his passage...
- better get life belts on them.
- Yes sir.
- Exciting sir, isn't it? My first typhoon.
- Really?
Well, if you live long enough you may see another one sometime.
- Get to your station.
- Yes sir.
Excuse me sir.
Chief, keep up a full head of steam, we're in for a twister.
Good old Grandfather.
Don't get panicky, just stick by me.
Hey, stop showing off, come on up here.
Come on lady, slip into this.
I really shouldn't you know, with my figure.
Tie it up in the front.
Let me help you miss.
You've lost your pearls.
No, I, I broke the string Mr.Romanoff has them.
Yes, yes, I will restring them for her as soon as we get out of this.
Oh, I never want to see them again.
Throw them away, do anything you please.
Oh, if we only come out of this alive.
Now, now, Poopsie, don't let a little wind blow you off your feet.
Have you seen Miss Portland sir?
- Isn't she in her cabin?
- No.
By Jove, if she went out on deck in the condition she was in...
You all, you all don't suppose she's been washed overboard?
Can't find Miss Portland sir, afraid she may have been washed overboard.
- Keep your hand to it.
- Aye, aye sir.
- Where's MacArdle?
- His door is locked sir.
- Why didn't you break it down?
- Was afraid to without orders.
That's the game, you old beachcomber,
I beat you, you hear that? I won.
Prosit.
Hey, that's the typhoon, that's the typhoon Jamesy.
Come on, give me the other 20 you owe me, come on.
Ah, quit stalling Jamesy, and give me that 20 you owe me.
Alright, if you won't give it to me, I'll take it.
What a twister that was.
Hello Dolly.
Well, where you going?
Winners always go home, don't they?
What's the idea of locking the door?
- Caveman stuff, eh?
- Oh no, it's...
- It's just a force of habit Dolly.
- Say, are you trying to insult me?
Did I ever take anything that wasn't coming to me?
Why darling, you, you know that you could have anything that I've got, anytime.
- Now, come on you, fork that over.
- Alright welsher.
There's £200 that I won and I won on the level, if you ain't a good enough sport...
No, you don't, you know what I'm talking about.
You know what I mean.
You know, it's pretty stormy out there and you never know when you might wash overboard.
- Say, are you threatening me?
- Dolly, you've seen it.
- I haven't.
- I tell you, you've seen it.
I haven't, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about that half of the £100 note that you just took from my wallet.
I don't know what you're saying but I'll forget you ever said anything.
Dolly, it would do you no good to double cross me.
- Oh, this is a hanging matter.
- I don't want to hear another word.
If it was anybody else but you, I'd chuck you overboard.
But I'm so crazy about you it's eating my insides out.
- You're in with me.
- I don't want to be, I...
Dolly, you're in with me, there's a quarter of a million pounds of gold on this ship.
Your share will make you a rich woman.
We can go anywhere, do anything.
Look, I'm no good to you.
- What do you want with me?
- Because you're a smart girl.
You're smart enough to hide that note, you're smart enough to know what it means.
- Yeah, I'm smart enough to stay out of this.
- Even as much as I love you... you're in with me from now on or else...
I'm going to break that pretty little neck of yours just like...
- The marines have landed.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
Dolly and I were just sealing a little partnership... which I hope she'll never have cause to regret.
Perhaps you better do your sealing in the main salon where there's lot more witnesses.
Maybe you're right captain.
Look out.
- Hold her.
- That was a near thing Alan.
Dawson.
- Get some lines, lash this down.
- Come here with that line.
Hey, come here.
- Cold darling?
- Yeah, yeah, cold, that's it.
You with me?
- It's a tough ocean to try and swim in.
- That's a good girl.
Now, you keep miles away from that fella Gaskell or...
I might think that you're trying to double-cross me.
Captain Gaskell, the steamroller is loose sir.
It'll mash those coolies like a lot of turnips.
Oh, the poor devils.
Let it go overboard.
Come on.
Close up that rail.
Davids, lend a hand.
Get the tarps off those winches.
Alright, turn on the steam.
Go to your quarters, you're under arrest.
Well, what do you want?
I want to thank you sir, for saving my life sir.
- Oh, go to bed.
- Is it all over sir?
Yeah, we'll stand regular watch from now on.
Mr. Kingston, what time do you come on watch?
- Eight bells sir.
- You're one minute late.
I'm sorry sir.
Keep her half speed and make your repairs on the port engine.
Aye, aye sir.
- Davids is here sir.
- Yes.
Alright.
I know what I'd do with him if this was my ship.
Well, wait till you get a ship.
Mr. Davids...
Yes sir.
Mr. Davids, for the rest of this voyage, you'll be relieved of... duty and confined to your quarters in arrest.
When we reach port, I'll have to turn you in to the board of trade... for neglect of duty and disobedience of orders.
I don't blame you sir.
But it's funny somehow, during the year I've been on the beach...
I've prayed every day for a chance.
And then when I got it, I couldn't make good.
I'm just a washout, that's all.
I'm sorry Davids.
- Call me when you relieve the watch.
- Yes sir.
This will cost you your ticket.
It's me toots, I've been waiting for you to come off watch.
Get out of here.
Look, I got a mighty good reason for being here.
You've always got a good reason for anything you're doing.
In fact, I don't know anybody who could think up any... more remarkable good reasons than you can on short notice.
Listen to me toots, I took an awful chance coming here.
- I might have got heaved overboard.
- Well, don't run any more risk by staying.
- Get off on the rest of your rounds.
- Toots, you got to listen to me.
- I only came here for one thing.
- I'm quite aware of that.
You're always waiting for a sailor, to comfort him... as only a woman like you can comfort a man who's too tired or too drunk to care who is.
Toots, don't be like that, if you keep that up you got to talk yourself right out of...
I hope so.
Oh, you hope so, do you?
Well, you've been begging for it, now you're going to get it.
You won't be so high and mighty when I get through with you.
You just wait, I'll fix you, you'll be lower than a coolie, you'll be lower than Davids.
You'll come crawling to me on your knees.
I warned you not to double cross me.
You said you could use the gun.
Well darling, you're a marvel.
You're a real partner.
You know, I thought that you was going...
What is it matter what you thought I was going to do? You got what you wanted.
Ah, don't take it so hard Dolly.
Oh, take what too hard?
I got what I wanted too.
I guess.
Sparks, Sparks.
Look out sir Malays.
Oh look, they're bringing them right now.
Got a cigarette Jamesy?
I thought you said nobody get hurt.
You can't expect the boys to stand there... and take it after someone cuts loose at them, can you?
- I must've been crazy, stark staring crazy.
- Take it easy, take it easy.
Be careful.
What you hiding those pearls for?
They do not worth anything.
I don't want to lose them.
You're perfectly right my dear, I've been through one of these things before.
They take everything in sight.
Something funny about those pearls, I'm going to have... appraised when we get to Singapore.
Wilbur, don't be insane.
Every one of those guns came out of our arsenal.
- Our arsenal sir?
- Yes.
I don't see how they could've broken down the steel door.
An-may in the ife-lay oat-bay.
- Davids.
- Yes Dawson.
- No savvy Malay.
- Do you?
Not enough but MacArdle does, I'm sure.
Hey look here, don't any of these fellows speak English?
No savvy.
Now, isn't that just too bad? Oh, that's terrible.
Yes.
Look here, whoever you are, in that lifeboat out there... there are some mills bombs in the seat locker in my quarters.
Yeah, if you're not too badly hurt watch your chance and try and get them.
I'll hold them here as long as I can.
- No savvy.
- No savvy?
There's your chance Mr. Dawson.
- And get those bombs.
- He's crazy, what's the use?
- I'd only be shot at.
- Yes.
I understand Mr. Dawson.
Get out of my way.
As far as I can make out, he comes from a very royal family and is very sorry to...
- disturb you like this.
- Why, no disturbance at all.
He wishes to assure you that no one will be harmed.
If you will open the strongbox... he'll willingly take the gold and depart with only the friendliest feelings toward you.
- Open the safe.
- Yes sir.
You haven't lost your ticket ye, old man.
If you want me to, I'll be only too glad to put in a good word for you.
Where's Alan? You don't think they'll hurt him, do you?
No, no, of course not, my dear, no.
No, they need the captain healthy.
I'm sorry Poopsie, looks like that guy did the appraising.
Why that's sand, you're pretty smart Gaskell.
Well, apparently the bank patronized some other line.
You can't fool these Malays with an old trick like the boxes of sand.
Why, whoever is at the head of this gang is got brains.
They know when there's gold on board a ship.
Why, their spies tell them about every shipment... of gold that leaves any bank in Hong Kong.
Listen MacArdle, make it clear to him.
If there was any gold aboard, he could have it and welcome.
Listen man, I'm talking to you as though I'm your own brother.
Save yourself while there's still time.
Look here, that's my skipper, you can't...
Looks as if the party came too late.
Why, it's the boot, the Malay boot.
- Why, that's cruel torture.
- Size is 9C.
Why, you're not going to let him torture you?
Have you any suggestions?
- Is that the latest style?
- Don't let them do that man.
Why, you'll never be able to use your...
- foot again.
- Listen Jamesy, you're a fast talker.
Better one I've ever seen, tell him something, tell him anything.
Tell him the bank fooled me as much as it did him.
I've talked my head off, he won't listen.
Tell him where it is, I can't bear it.
It's killing me to stand here and not be able to help you.
- I can't bear it.
- Well, put your fingers in your ears.
Stubborn half-wit.
- Gaskell, my boy Gaskell.
- Don't start counting, I'm getting up.
Please tell them where it is Gaskell.
Why, it's breaking my heart to see you suffer like this.
There can't be any gold, he would've talked.
Nobody could be that tough.
Come on, club out.
Die you...
Oh, you poor boy, you.
I made them understand there's no gold here.
It was Jamesy that saved your poor feet for you.
Are they gone?
Yes, it's all right, they're getting into the junk.
Here, take it easy, there's nothing you can do. Here Gaskell.
Davids.
- Davids.
- Davids.
Shut your mouth.
- I got the bombs.
- Good, good, let me have this one.
Keep clear while I blow my way out.
And thanks Davids.
Can you make it over and heave it in that junk?
I'll try.
Davids, remember after you pull the pin, you only got five seconds until it goes off.
- You're crazy, you'll get us all killed.
- Get back.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Hey, a little less noise please.
Captain Gaskell?
- What you find?
- Not even a scratch on the door sir.
The arsenal must've been opened with a key.
Tell the chief steward to bring
MacArdle and Miss Porter to my cabin.
Yes sir.
Listen darling, where did you put that half of the hundred pound note?
- I know it's safe but I got to...
- I hid it.
- Where?
- In Gaskell's cabin, in a tin of cigarettes.
- Well, aren't you a wonder.
- It's safe.
He won't find it, he doesn't smoke my kind.
- Oh, quit worrying, I'll get it.
- No, you won't.
You'll stay right where you are till this thing blows over.
Now, promise me darling, that you won't go near the place.
That's easy. I wouldn't exactly enjoy looking...
Looking at his bandaged feet.
Well, that's too bad.
But what about us?
What about the poor devils he captured?
You know, I wouldn't put it past him to use the Chinese boot on them.
- If he does, they'll talk.
- Oh, he won't use the boot.
- He'd never hit a man below the belt.
- Well, we're not hung yet.
Gaskell may suspect the whole world but he's got to prove it.
- Well, let him prove it, let him prove it.
- Are you out of your mind?
Alright, come in.
Captain Gaskell's compliments and will you come to his cabin?
And you too Miss Portland.
Just a minute.
- Jamesy, that...
- Now, now, now, wait a minute.
It's simply a matter of routine.
If it comes to the worst, I'm the only one that he can prove anything against.
So you just sit tight and keep a stiff upper lip.
Alright bozo.
Order me an upper and lower and I'll keep them both stiff.
Alright, come on, answer.
- After you left my cabin, where you go?
- Back to my own quarters.
- What time was that?
- About half past 11.
- Was anybody there?
- Nobody but Isabel, I told her to go to bed.
Your maid says she was asleep at a quarter after 9, two hours before.
Ah, it's always a quarter after 9 to that numbskull, it's the only time she knows.
- Did anybody come to your cabin later?
- My dates are my own now.
The deck watch saw a man leaving your cabin after 1 o'clock, that was you, wasn't it?
- Look here Alan, that's not...
- I'm conducting this inquiry Sir Guy.
That was you, wasn't it?
What do you want me to do?
Blacken the lady's name?
- That was Jamesy, wasn't it?
- Well, supposing it was, what then?
Why was he in your cabin?
He came to borrow a hot water bottle for one of his pigs.
- Got a cigarette Jamesy?
- No darling.
- Here, here you better have one of your own.
- No, never mind, I don't...
No, no bother at all, I know what these little attentions mean to a woman.
Well I, I don't want one now.
I guess it's just nerves, I...
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry you don't feel well, you rode out the piracy as such a good shape.
- Perhaps you'd like one.
- Well, well, thank you.
The captain is far more generous with your cigarettes than you ever were.
Too generous. I guess I'll take them home with me while there's... still a couple left for myself.
- How many tins have you Jamesy?
- One.
- Four and one are five, are...
- Lose any?
I thought I left six here.
Oh, yes, yes, so you did, I almost forgot.
I don't understand this cat and mouse business.
Is this the one?
Yes, that's it.
You won't find what you're looking for,
I've both halves of the hundred pound note.
Oh, what are you browbeating the girl for?
Just a minute MacArdle, your turn is next.
One half of the note was found on a dead pirate, the other half was hidden... in her cigarette tin.
Hello.
- These Chinese characters look familiar.
- Yes, they're MacArdle's shipping symbol.
Well, that's queer.
If I wasn't sure of it, why, I'd swear that I wrote those characters.
I'll swear you wrote them
MacArdle before any admiralty court.
Yes? Well, what will your oath prove?
Save your breath MacArdle, we caught two of your men, they've talked.
- You used the Chinese boot on them.
- No, I saved that for you, if I needed it.
How did you manage to get the ship's rifles?
You couldn't have done a thing without them.
You've answered to all the questions so far, don't stop now.
Alright, I won't.
- You gave him the key to the arsenal.
- Me?
She gave me nothing.
You were the only one who knew where it was besides myself, you came to my cabin...
- Alright, you lost it.
- Waited till I passed out...
- get to the key and handle over to MacArdle.
- That's a dirty rotten lie,
I'll sue the line and get plenty too.
- Defaming a lady's character...
- Yes, quartermaster.
- Yes sir?
- Tell the sergeant at guard to come here.
And send a radio message to the police superintendent in Singapore.
- Tell him to meet us at the dock, urgent.
- Urgent, yes sir.
And you better send for a squad of lawyers too if... you think you going to pin anything on me.
- What a dirty little snake you are.
- What's that to you?
Getting into my cabin because I trusted you.
- Trust? When do you really trust...
- Waiting for a chance to...
- do your double cross.
- I didn't.
- Turning on your own people.
- I didn't, I...
- Sold out every man woman coming on-board.
- Alright then, I did.
I stole the key, yes,
I stole it and gave it to Jamesy.
But I came to your cabin to warn you about him, figure it out for yourself why I didn't.
I'd have stood and fought back to back with you.
But you taught me something I didn't even know myself.
When a woman can love a man right down to her fingertips, she can hate him the same way.
Now call your cops, call every cop in the country, I don't care.
If you can dish it out, I can take it.
You fool, you hotheaded, crazy little fool.
And me thinking all the time that my powers of fascination had won her.
Ah, don't be so tough Gaskell.
China Doll had nothing to do with it at all.
You think it's as simple as all that?
I'm not the judge, the jury and the law.
You'll find that out soon enough.
No, I won't. I've fooled them many a time before and I've done it again.
I've cost you millions, and I'd still be fooling them... if it wasn't for the little yellow haired lass sad... that wouldn't even give me the time of the day.
- What's wrong MacArdle?
- Nothing, nothing.
Nothing at all.
One of those pills will make a pig sleep the entire voyage.
- I'll sleep until kingdom come.
- Get a doctor quick.
Jamesy.
I had a chance darling, to throw you overboard.
If I had, I'd still be safe.
Loving you is the only decent thing I ever did in my life.
Even that was a mistake.
- You sent for me sir?
- Take Miss Porter to her cabin.
Keep a close watch over her until further orders.
Aye sir.
Well, he's out of it anyway.
- He finished the game the way he played it.
- Yeah, tough.
He didn't yell no dice when they rolled against him, I won't either.
Good luck toots.
- Singapore.
- So am I, where are you from?
Lordy, Lordy. Now I got enough clothes to last me a million years.
Well, I hope you have better luck in them than I did.
Don't you worry
Miss Dolly, I got me a conjure.
The left hind leg of a black cat that's been killed by a snakebite.
Nothing going to touch me no matter what they does to you.
Yes?
Well darling, have you put your house in order?
No, it's in a worse mess than ever.
Sybil, I should've told you before, I'll be tied up here for weeks at the hearing.
Now Alan dear, what are you trying to tell me? Be frank.
That's just it...
I want you to escape all the frankness it's going to be thrown around the next few weeks.
Everybody will know about it, read about it.
Even at home, for that matter, the people you know.
But you can live down a scandal if you want to.
Yes but this will have an official stamp on it.
I'll have to get up in court, tell the whole story.
I want to Sybil, because I'm involved.
In fact, I'm as guilty as she.
Guilty? Oh, what nonsense.
How could you be Alan?
I am though.
She tried to warn me about
MacArdle, I wouldn't listen.
I nearly threw her out.
With as dirty an insult as a man could give a woman.
- That's not like you.
- I don't know why.
Except, I'd just seen her in MacArdle's cabin.
I didn't think she get skid that far.
And you're really in love with... this old tub after all.
No, no but it's that too.
After all you can't pile up 6 years... of something and then just leave in the flash, you know?
No.
No, of course not.
Well, I'm off to the hotel.
I'll take the next boat home.
You know, I came
15,000 miles to find you Alan.
Now you're further away than you ever were.
You wouldn't like that fireplace in Sussex.
I think that's what
I've been trying to tell you.
Sybil, aren't you clinging to something that I could never be again?
Yes, perhaps I am.
But I think that's the only beautiful way it ever could be.
- Goodbye Alan.
- Goodbye Sybil.
Come on, you large, limping seagull.
Come to the office and resign.
Don't worry about that,
I'll resign soon enough.
All I got to do is scratch my name on a piece of paper.
Around this madhouse, it's always a million things to do before you can do what you want.
- I'll make it easy, honest I will Poopsie.
- Good bye.
Hey, you're just the guy, where can I pick up a string of genuine pearls for the missus?
Oh, yes, yes, I'll be very glad to arrange it for you.
That's a pal, I told you
I'd square with you Poopsie.
You squared it beautifully.
Bank sent for the gold sir.
- Alright, turn it over to them.
- But there isn't any gold sir.
- The boxes were full of sand.
- Oh yes, yes, so they were.
The shipment is in the toolbox of the steamroller.
Steamroller? Toolbox?
That stumps me sir, I never would've thought of looking for it there.
No, I was counting on that.
Oh, so you decided to make the trip after all?
Yes. Yes, I just came along looking for local color.
Local color, phooey. If anybody could get local color, I can get it.
These streets are in deplorable condition.
Quartermaster, fish him out before he soaks up all the local color in the harbor.
Aye, aye sir.
Come in.
- Is the police superintendent ready?
- He'll be here any minute now, come on.
Goodbye, Isabel.
Goodbye Miss Dolly, you sure been mighty good to me,
- Skip it.
- Even if they does hang you.
Well, there's the old Quien-Howe.
Aren't they ever going to paint that smokestack?
Boy, how you used to crab about it when you were first mate on her.
Seems like a thousand years ago.
Well, you don't need to talk if you don't want to.
I was only doing it for the benefit of those mugs back there.
That's what I thought.
I've never seen the time yet when you could overlook an audience.
That's more like it, it's kind of good to have you barking at me again.
Always worrying about your performance, you don't care... about anything except, how is the act going?
What you crying for?
I can't help it.
Get in there and quit that blubbering.
- Now, listen to me numbskull.
- I'm all ears.
My official job ends when I turn you over to the police superintendent.
From then on,
I'll be on your side of the fence.
Oh, what's the use? I'll plead guilty and take what's coming.
- You're going to tell the whole truth.
- Sure I am, that's the least I can do.
And I'm going to tell the truth, everything.
That you tried to warn me, that, well, that I was drunk.
- Oh, no, you weren't.
- Yes, I was. Dead drunk.
Oh, you big cluck, you'll gum up the works, you'll ruin yourself.
You'll bust up your whole career if you do that.
It's nothing else to do
Dolly, it's your only chance.
Oh, never mind me, what about her?
She going back to England.
- Back to England? But you still love her.
- She's leaving on the next boat.
Oh, you can't let her do that toots, you still in love her.
- Don't start telling me what to do.
- I said, you're still in love with her.
- And don't yell like that, I'm not deaf.
- Oh, you poor sap, you love her.
And don't call me a sap.
- You love her.
- Yes, I love her.
But not the way I do you.
Oh toots, you can't.
That ain't fair, ain't right. A nogood dame like... me why, I'll always have you in trouble Alan.
No, you won't.
Married life will slow you down plenty.
You...
You'd marry me?
Well no, not if you're going to make it such a blasted favor.
Oh, you, you poor sap.
Come in.
- Good morning captain.
- Good morning superintendent.
- Here's your receipt for the prisoners.
- Yes, all right.
I'll be over as soon as I get through.
- Anything you want...
- Anything I...
Toots, I got everything.
Come on superintendent, let's get on the horse.
What about a nip to cool that aching brow?
No, no, fix one for yourself,
I got to get around to court.
Somebody will have to protect that judge.
Those shoes are disgraceful on an officer Mr. Kingston.
- A hose coupling just broke sir.
- Hose couplings shouldn't break.
Change the hose and change your shoes Mr. Kingston.
Yes sir.
Change your shoes Mr. Kingston.
A piracy, a typhoon, a disabled ship swung into port, his sweetheart on her way to... jail and all he can say by way of conversation...
- is change your shoes Mr. Kingston.
- That bark of his is all front.
- He's really pretty sick at heart.
- Sick? The man hasn't got a heart.
Perhaps not Mr. Kingston but whatever it is he has, it gets things done.
And now, children.
We come to one of the most famous.
And most priceless pictures in the whole world.
The Medici Venus.
I want you to notice the beauty and delicacy of the composition.
And the flesh tints.
Isn't she a little bit skinny, teacher?
Not skinny, Tommy. She is ..
Well, slender.
She is the embodiment of female grace and form.
All visitors out please.
Come along, children. We must be going.
All visitors out please.
Closing time.
All visitors out please.
Closing time.
Hey, Bert! Hey!
Yes? What's up?
Come here, quick.
It's gone.
Look. Look!
"Sorry, but I had a better use for this."
"The Amateur Cracksman."
Read about it.
Old master still missing. Paper, paper.
"Cracksman laughs at police."
"Tell me what is wrong with Scotland Yard."
"There is an enquiry demanded .."
MacKenzie, I want to warn you. You'd better not take this thing too calmly.
What with the newspapers and the questions in parliament.
Scotland Yard is being made a complete laughing stock.
This sort of thing has got to be stopped.
Once and for all.
I'm busy.
- Sir, it's about ..
I don't care what it's about.
- But it's about the picture, sir.
The Venus, sir.
That's it.
The one that everybody is talking about.
Do you mean that you can tell us something about it?
Do you think you've got a clue?
- No.
I've got the picture.
Here, sit down. Sit down.
Well, upon my soul.
What is your name please?
Maud Holden.
How did you get this?
It just came in the post.
In the ordinary way.
I opened the parcel.
And there it was.
And this was with it.
- Oh.
"I saw your farewell performance when
I was a boy. I have never forgotten it."
"Would you return this to .."
"Dear old Scotland Yard for me."
"I understand there is a reward offered."
"Amateur Cracksman."
Well.
So you are Maud Holden the actress?
- Well.
I used to be.
When was your farewell performance, Miss Holden?
Oh .. twenty years ago.
Aye.
You don't think I've had anything to do with this, do you?
The theft, I mean.
- No, no.
Of course not, Miss Holden.
Thank you very much.
I think I can promise you the reward.
Thank you, sir.
It seems as if the amateur cracksman is somewhat of a benefactor, Miss Holden.
Well.
In this case .. yes.
But I don't want anything said of it.
Don't worry, Miss Holden. We're no more anxious for the publicity than you are.
Thank you. Good day.
Good day.
This is the picture alright.
- And do you think that will help us?
You see, we'll be more of a laughing stock than ever if this news gets out.
Can't find the criminal.
Can't even find the picture and the confounded thing is handed to us.
If it wasn't for him, I'd ..
[ Radio: ]
"Mr Raffles is bowling today."
"Apparently, he had the Australian batsmen completely baffled."
"Mr Raffles is getting ready to bowl now."
"There goes the ball. There go the wickets. He's done it!"
"And it's seven wickets for Mr Raffles."
Mr Bunny Manders is on the telephone, sir. He wants to come and pick you up.
Not now. Tell him I'll meet him at The Ambassador.
Very good, sir.
Mr Raffles thanks you, sir.
He says he'll have to meet you at The Ambassador Club.
And if you will excuse me, sir.
- Yes? What is it?
It is these bills, sir.
Some of them are becoming ..
If you will pardon the expression, sir, a trifle exigent.
You said the grim total is 200 pounds?
- Yes, sir.
I'm arranging for that this evening.
- Very good, sir.
[ Alarm bell! ]
Blimey, look!
There is your burglar.
Must have got locked in.
Looks like he's having a good time too.
Here, get him off that alarm button.
Come on, Pussy.
Well, will you put handcuffs on him, Philips?
I don't think so. I don't think he'll try to get away.
No tricks now.
I think I'd better take him back home.
Rascal. Making all this row.
And don't try and steal my watch.
You are a concern.
I think I'd better take him home, eh.
Well, my missus won't have him in the house. I promise you that.
I'm going to try to sneak him into my house.
Good evening, Inspector.
- Hello, Philips.
Everything quiet?
Is that under arrest?
Yes, sir. Taking him in for giving a false alarm at Baldridge's.
What's that?
A kitten in Baldridge's?
- We found him playing with the alarm.
It doesn't sound right to me.
- Not right?
There's no way of getting in Baldridge's without setting off the alarm.
If somebody knew that they might bring along a kitten.
Get some men round the back of the shop.
- Yes, sir.
Come with me.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, A.J. Good show today.
- Thank you very much.
Good work, Raffles.
- Thank you, sir.
Good evening, Mr Raffles.
- Get me a packet of Hiltons, please.
Thank you.
Ah, A.J.
We thought you wouldn't show up.
I've been telling Gwen you'd come.
That means I got here just in time.
Your brother is an atrocious dancer.
Bunny. A waltz is a thing of grace and poise. You take the lady's hand, so.
Place your right hand, so.
See you later.
But Lady Melrose is waiting for you.
This brother and sister dancing should be discouraged I think.
Especially if the sister is you.
- Can this be you talking?
Yes, I think so.
- Gwen.
Lady Melrose.
- Pretend you didn't hear.
Gwen, dear.
If we don't go to her, she'll come and get us.
Lady Melrose.
How do you do, Mr Raffles.
I am so glad to meet you.
I can't see why she wants to meet you.
She doesn't give a hoot on cricket.
No. But I know a personable young man when I see one.
Sit down there. Gwen, come here.
May we have your picture, Mr Raffles?
Do you mind, Lady Melrose?
Not at all.
Just look at each other if you will.
How could I look anywhere else.
Thank you.
Getting that old face of yours in the papers again, my dear?
Yes. I thought I would have to go through the divorce court to do that.
At my time of life.
Well, I'm very glad to see you, Raffles.
I've been to Lords every day this week.
A splendid show. Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
I'm very proud to meet you. I saw you play for the gentlemen in 1919.
Did you, by gad?
Don't encourage him, Mr Raffles.
Or you will be hearing all his cricket history.
You rescue me. Come and dance.
- Yes, I'd like to.
I think you'd better dance with Gwen.
I was beginning to feel like the other woman.
Mind you hurry back.
- We will.
Now that is what I call a really charming man.
He was my house captain at school you know.
There was nobody like him.
And he hasn't changed a bit.
Well, come and sit here by me until he comes back.
I'm afraid I have to get back to barracks, Lady Melrose.
"Barracks"? Nonsense.
A date with a chorus girl, most likely.
Don't be so old-fashioned, George.
But you brought Mr Raffles, so I forgive you.
You and Gwen are coming down tomorrow for the weekend. Don't forget.
There is just the possibility I may not be able to manage it.
I'll phone in the morning, if I may.
- Alright.
By the way, we've got a new telephone exchange down there.
I'll write down the number for you.
I've got to run along.
You'll see Gwen home, won't you A.J.?
- You leaving?
Yes, I've got to. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Do you mind seeing me home?
- Mind? I'm in luck.
Oh, you are saying the nicest things tonight.
I am? Oh, it just comes natural.
I haven't been drinking.
Oh .. Gwen.
There is that voice again.
Mr Raffles.
We've been glad to see you.
Goodnight, Gwen darling.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Where to, sir?
15 Lennox Mews, please.
Very good, sir.
Come on, Lucy. Come on.
Come on.
Do you know that I've never ridden in one of these things before.
I'm glad you haven't.
- Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because I should like you to remember this evening as well as shall.
You know, you're a strange person.
Strange? Well, why am strange?
You say things like that just to encourage a girl and then ..
The next item we meet you are ..
Terribly nice and polite and ..
Distant.
Why, it's not very easy to be distant in a hansom cab even if you want to be.
And I don't.
You know Gwen, when you used to visit Bunny at school.
I was terribly in love with you. I was always far too scared to let you know.
Nine years ago.
You've changed a good deal since then.
Too much, perhaps.
And not all for the better.
What do you mean?
- Oh, nothing.
Now there you are. That's what I mean when I say you're mysterious.
Tell me your big secret.
Because I felt for a long time that you had one somewhere in your life.
I'm awfully tempted to tell you just one secret anyway.
It's simply this.
I'm still in love with you.
Oh, I am so happy.
I could laugh or sing or something. Or just chatter.
Oh darling, so could I.
Can't you make it down to Melrose this weekend?
We could have so much time together.
- With you?
Well .. of course I can.
Whoa, Lucy. Whoa.
Here we are, sir.
Already?
Once more around the paddock?
- Yes.
If it ain't too late for you, it certainly ain't for me.
Come on, Lucy.
Barraclough.
Barraclough.
I am coming, sir.
Did you call me, sir?
- Yes. Did I wake you up?
It's perfectly alright, sir.
- That means I did. I'm sorry.
Have a drink, Barraclough.
- Have a drink, sir?
I'll pour it out for you.
I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir.
- I do mind. How much soda?
Well, if you insist, sir.
I will take mine without soda.
A splendid idea.
It is an old family custom.
- Oh, indeed?
To the Barracloughs.
- To the Barracloughs.
I beg your pardon, sir. Thank you.
Tell me, Barraclough. Why have you never been married?
Surely there must have been some woman in your life?
There was, sir.
Two of them to be exact.
That was years ago.
Neither of them became Mrs Barraclough?
- No, sir.
Perhaps that was because I knew them both at the same time.
It didn't seem to work out.
Perhaps you're wondering why
I'm in such a gay mood tonight?
No, sir. I think I've already guessed the reason, sir.
You have?
From the tenor of the conversation.
With your permission, sir.
I should say that you have met a lady.
The lady.
Barraclough, you're positively psychic.
Thank you, sir.
Are you contemplating matrimony, sir?
If she'll have me.
I'm turning over a new leaf.
After tonight the old
Raffles is no more.
Behold the new.
Love does some strange things, sir.
Barraclough, you need another drink.
No, sir. I'd rather not if you don't mind.
I've become very talkative and I insist on singing.
Ha. Well, what's the matter with that?
I sing very badly, sir.
Is that all, sir?
That's all, Barraclough. For you.
For me, life is just beginning.
I see, sir.
Barraclough, did I remember to say she's the most wonderful girl in the world?
I had hoped, sir.
That you were going to spare me that.
Goodnight, sir.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Look.
Well, what do you make of it?
How did it come?
- In that cigarette packet.
Hiltons.
Fingerprints?
- I've just sent for Evans.
These please.
- Very good, sir.
"My farewell performance."
First the picture and then this.
What do you make of it?
Is the fellow reforming?
I don't know about that, sir.
But I know that he can't wipe out a crime by this sort of thing.
"Farewell performance". Pah!
He thinks he has the right to end things just because he thinks he will.
But that's where he is wrong.
We'll give him his farewell performance.
Have you got something?
He has.
- What is it?
"West Milton 28."
Looks like a telephone number.
- It is.
Foster.
Foster, is that you?
Find out whose telephone number is ..
West Milton 28. I will hold on.
That will be all, Evans.
- Yes, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Lord Melrose?
Are you sure about that?
Thanks.
The telephone number belongs to the country house of Lord Melrose in Essex.
West Milton.
Come on, Mr Raffles.
Show us what you can do.
Jolly decent of His Lordship to give Mr Raffles for our side.
Aye, it will give us a chance for once.
Give it everything you've got, Mr Raffles.
Fine bowling, Raffles.
Come on, Mr Raffles.
Here I am.
Harry. You frightened me.
- Don't be so jumpy.
The old girl bring the necklace down with her?                - Yes.
You saw to that, eh? You got a little plan of the layout like I told you?
Yes. Here it is.
The big tree is just opposite this window.
This is Lady Melrose's room.
First door on your right.
I can do it with my eyes shut.
Harry, don't you think we ought to give it up?
If you're caught it's prison.
For me too.
- Will you take hold of yourself.
You want to go to Australia don't you?
You want to have your own little farm?
You know I do.
- Well, stop worrying.
Don't forget, a sleeping powder in the old girl's milk tonight.
I won't forget it.
Now, we'd better not be seen talking to one another.
Howzat!
Thank goodness that's over.
Now we shan't have to go through it again for another year.
Oh Lady Melrose, I don't believe you dislike cricket as much as you pretend.
My dear, it bores me to death.
It bores poor Gin and Tonic too.
Come along, darlings. Come with mummy.
Shall I take them, Milady?
- Thank you, Wilson.
Goodbye everybody. See you later.
And Wilson, I will wear the gold dress tonight.
Such a nice girl, Wilson.
She's the only maid I've ever had who doesn't breathe on me.
Have you finished in there?
A.J. I've got to talk to you.
What is it?
Well .. I'm in trouble.
Bad trouble, A.J.
I've been nearly off my head all day.
I phoned your flat this morning.
But they told me you'd come down here and that's what brought me.
Is it money?
Bad?
How bad?
Worse than you can imagine.
Oh, I've been a fool.
I've been gambling.
It's at thousand pounds.
All in one go?
No, it's been going on for weeks.
I don't know what started me.
But that isn't the point.
Last night after I left you, I ..
I had a final plunge to get it back.
And of course I lost.
But this time it wasn't my money.
They were mess funds I took.
This morning I found out there is an audit coming on Monday.
Oh, I see.
I'm just a common thief.
I'll be cashiered, disgraced.
They will put me in jail. I've been thinking about doing myself in.
You know that wouldn't help.
- It would get me out of it.
What about Gwen?
Would you do that to her?
What am I going to do?
I don't know yet.
You need a thousand pounds by
Monday. Is that it?         - Yes.
I don't mind telling you I haven't got it.
You haven't?
No. But that doesn't mean it can't be got.
You mean that?
Practically anything can be if it has to be and quite obviously this has to be.
The only question is how.
There is not a lot of time.
That was lovely.
I hope that interruption didn't disturb you just now.
That husband of mine.
Bunny.
Cheer up. Everything is going to be alright.
You mean I can count on it?
- Every penny of it.
Thanks, A.J.
What?
- Did you enjoy it, sir?
Oh yes. Splendid, splendid.
Nothing like a whiskey and soda after music.
How about a spot in the library?
- That's a good idea, sir.
Come along, come along.
- Thank you.
If you can't do it Raffles nobody else can.
Bless my soul.
Scotland Yard?
Scotland Yard, did you say?
Yes. Inspector MacKenzie.
Alright. Show him in. Show him in.
- Yes sir.
What on earth do you suppose
Scotland Yard wants here?
I can't imagine.
Lord Melrose?
Inspector MacKenzie?
Well, what is it? What do you want?
If you don't mind, sir.
My business is confidential.
Nonsense, nonsense. These are my guests.
This is Mr Whitely, Mr Thorndyke.
And Mr Raffles.
Mr A.J. Raffles, the cricketer?
Oh, I am a great admirer of yours, sir.
Well, I've long been a great admirer of yours.
Oh, I've read a lot about you.
You're quite a famous person.
Thank you, Mr Raffles.
Now if you will kindly tell me what your business is.
Lord Melrose.
We have reason to believe that an attempt will be made to rob this house.
Oh, I say.
- Not really?
I take you to mean burglars?
A burglar.
A?
Meaning one?
Aye.
This is very disturbing.
My wife is nervous enough already.
We've been reading all about this chap in the papers.
Oh, what's his name?
The Amateur Cracksman.
Ha. Amateur Cracksman.
The names these journalists invent.
Besides, there doesn't seem to be much very amateur about him by all accounts.
What do you say, Inspector?
- I agree. He is misnamed.
I call him just a thief.
As I told you, Inspector.
Lady Melrose is a very nervous woman.
I don't want her to know anything about this. Not a thing.
Or any of my other guests.
- I understand.
I am afraid she may come in at any moment.
Raffles, would you mind going out to her?
Well, it's been very nice meeting you, Inspector.
Excuse me.
Now, Inspector.
What do you propose to do?
I wonder would it be inconveniencing you too much Lord Melrose ..
If I was to stay here for a while?
Stay here?
Bless my soul.
What am I going to say to people?
Well, if I might suggest.
An old friend.
- An old friend?
Well, you leave me no alternative.
By the way, Lord Melrose.
You have a new telephone exchange here?
Yes, it's been in for two days.
A beastly nuisance changing your number like that.
Now, since getting that new number have you given it to anyone?
Given it? Not that I remember.
Yes. I've given it to one person.
At that beastly nightclub last night. I gave it to Bunny.
Who did you give it to?
- Bunny Manders. A nice young lad.
I've known him all his life. He and his sister are spending the weekend here.
Look here, you don't think that one of my guests is the ..?
Oh no. No, no.
No. That's purely a routine question.
Please remember that.
- Alright.
Who is that strange man with George?
I don't know. I met him only minutes ago and I didn't quite catch his name.
My dear, a most extraordinary thing.
A very old friend of mine has just happened to turn up.
This is mister ..
Cameron.
Mister who?
- Cameron, my dear.
One of the Scottish Camerons, you know.
He and I used to go deer-stalking.
Deer-stalking?
How do you do, Mr Cameron?
It's a pity you didn't get here in time for the music.
And George's snoring.
My dear, you know I don't like music.
Well, I don't like cricket.
But I don't take a nap in the middle of the playing fields.
Look after Mr Cameron.
Yes, of course. Come along, Cameron.
I want you to meet some of the others.
If you don't mind at the moment I'd ..
Like to have a smoke outside.
Yes, of course.
Enjoying a bit of air, Mr Raffles?
Oh, it's you .. Cameron?
Aye.
It was good of you not to give me away just now before the others.
Oh, not at all.
No, I always believe in helping the police whenever I can.
You know, I have a theory about the Cracksman.
I believe he is a myth.
Invented by Scotland Yard to cover up a multitude of, shall we say, failures.
Ah, now you are being very hard on us, Mr Raffles.
No. The Cracksman exists alright.
I'm going to hook him one of these days.
Play him and land him like a fish.
Like a fish?
Aye.
I'm a fisherman, Mr Raffles.
- Oh, yes.
You still haven't told me why you're fishing in this quiet pool.
I prefer not to divulge that.
Well, in any event I doubt there is anything much for me to worry about.
No.
I think you can go about your business undisturbed.
Thank you, Inspector.
After those reassuring words ..
I will.
There you are, A.J.
Mr Manders - Mr Cameron.
How do you do.
- How are you, Mr Manders?
Fine, thank you.
A beautiful spot, I'd call this.
Yes it is.
It reminds me of Stratford on Avon.
Ever been down to any of the revivals?
Yes, several times.
I saw The Merchant Of Venice there a few seasons back.
A student of Shakespeare, Cameron?
As well as a ..
Deer-stalker.
Well, a lover of the theatre, Mr Raffles.
You know, the finest performance of the Merchant of Venice I ever saw ..
Was with Maud Holden as Portia.
I imagine she was a bit before your time, Mr Manders.
No, as a matter of fact
Raffles and I saw her together.
We went to her farewell performance when we were kids.
Yes, she was magnificent.
Whatever happened to her? Is she dead?
No.
No, I don't think so.
In fact I heard of her the other day.
Well if you see her, I wish you'd tell her she still has a faithful admirer.
Yes. Two of them.
Ah.
Have a cigarette?
No thanks. I don't smoke.
Perhaps it's just as well.
There doesn't seem to be any in it.
Oh, Hiltons?
Why, Raffles will have one of those.
That's his favourite brand.
Really?
Yes, of course.
There you are.
- Thanks.
Mr Raffles.
Cricket has conquered music.
They are all calling for you.
Won't you come in and play lion?
Excuse me.
I just wanted to save you from that awful ..
What does George call him, "deer-stalker"?
Who is he? What is he?
- Well ..
You know something.
Come on, tell me.
Lady Melrose, I think it is most unfair the way they keep you in the dark.
Yes. That man is a detective.
- A detective?
What on earth is a detective doing here?
Well, he probably suspects an attempt on something.
Your necklace, for instance.
- My necklace?
What nonsense.
The ideas people get.
Why it's just all those silly papers.
- I agree.
And I suppose you probably keep it in a safe?
No. We have a safe here but ..
That is the first place burglars look.
I always keep my necklace in my bedroom.
Oh.
You think I shouldn't?
Well I imagine if there is a detective in the house it's alright.
He'd likely sleep outside your door all night.
He will do no such thing.
I shouldn't sleep a wink.
- He has to be where the emeralds are.
I will send them down to the safe and he can sleep here.
Good .. and yet ..
What?
As you say, that's probably the first place a burglar would look.
Just what I've always said.
I shall keep them in my room.
You will have the detective lying like a spaniel on your mat.
Not on my mat.
Well, you can't have it both ways.
Or can you?
Yes.
I think I can.
I've got an idea.
Mr Raffles.
I'm a very wily old woman.
George.
Yes, my dear?
I'm going up to bed now.
I want you to come up and get my jewel case and put it in the safe for me.
What? Why, you've never done that before.
Well, after all I've been hearing on the wireless about that amateur cracksman ..
I thought perhaps I should.
I doubted you would be so sensible.
I'll be up in a minute.
- Goodnight, Gwen.
Goodnight, Lady Melrose.
Goodnight. Forgive my going up won't you.
George's cricket was so exhausting I am worn out.
Sleep well. We will.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Deer-stalking indeed.
I'll deer-stalk him.
I beg your pardon, Milady?
- Nothing.
Put the milk down there.
I think I will take a sleeping powder tonight.
Do you think it wise, Milady?
Wise? Why not?
I don't know. I just thought ..
- Nonsense, go and fetch it.
What are you doing?
- Leave the milk there.
[ Door knocks ]
Is that you, George? Just a minute.
Come in.
Here you are.
You're a very sensible girl, my dear.
- Glad you think so.
So do I.
Goodnight, my dear.
- Goodnight.
Nothing to worry about.
- No.
Why are you standing there, grinning?
- Sorry, Milady.
Got my sleeping powder?
Yes, Milady.
- Well, put it in.
I hope I shall get off to sleep quickly tonight.
Yes.
I'm sure you will, Milady.
Never used this safe.
Except to keep the poker chips in.
And Kitty's birth certificate.
A lock of my hair as a baby.
Well, that's that.
When was this taken?
Oh, that was taken last night at The Ambassador.
Good one of my wife, isn't it.
Now sit down, Cameron.
How about a whiskey and soda?
So Mr Raffles was with you last night?
Yes, Gwen and Bunny brought him.
We've never met him before.
What a nice chap.
Aye.
I've no doubt he was the highlight of the occasion.
And to come early to meet the guests and all that.
Well no, as a matter of fact he was very late.
For a while we though he wasn't coming at all.
Is that so?
Remember me?
- Oh, Gwen.
Everybody has turned in.
We have the whole place to ourselves.
I've never seen a warmer, kindlier moon.
Does it meet with you approval?
Yes, it is nice.
Shall we walk to the brook?
Gwen .. I've got ..
What's the matter?
I wish I could explain.
There is so many things I want say and so many things I can't say.
It is so bewildering.
Have I done something?
No, you've never been anything but sweet and wonderful.
Even though there must be questions.
Tumbling over each other in your mind.
Questions that should be asked.
But can't be answered.
Very well then. I ..
I won't ask them.
Gwen, there is one thing you must know.
One thing you must believe.
Nothing matters to me except your happiness.
How very considerate.
Well.
I don't suppose there is anything more to be said.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Ah, Raffles.
Everyone gone to bed?
We've just been putting
Kitty's necklace away.
Now the only thing left to do is to put on the burglar alarm.
Oh, you have a burglar alarm?
Yes. One of these new electric-ray things.
There are six bells and they ring all over the house.
That must have quite a musical effect.
Yes. And once the thing is set.
If anyone tried putting as much as his toe through a window.
I think we've taken every precaution.
- It seems more than adequate to me.
I'm just going to trot off to bed. Goodnight, Raffles.
Goodnight, Cameron.
Well, I'll say goodnight too.
I'll come with you.
Splendid. Splendid.
Are you sleepy?
- Aye. A bit.
Are you?
Yes. I'll probably read for a while before I turn in.
I imagine your work leaves you pretty tired?
It does.
I can think of only one job as exciting as tracking down criminals as you do.
What's that?
Dodging you fellows.
Goodnight, Inspector.
Goodnight, Mr Raffles.
Dear Mr Raffles.
[ Burglar alarm bell ]
A.J.
A.J.
What are you doing? Who are you?
Look here.
You can't do this to me.
Help me! It's the burglar, I believe.
Bunny!
Crawshay, huh?
Out of your depth here, aren't you.
I ain't taken a thing, Guvnor.
True, I ain't.
Well, Inspector. You weren't far wrong. I congratulate you.
I think we are both to be congratulated.
He didn't get anything.
Is this the "Cracksman" fellow?
This?
No.
He looks a pretty slimy sort of an eel.
I say, what about Kitty?
I had quite forgotten all about her.
Cameron, I am a little disappointed in your cracksman.
This isn't the cracksman, Mr Raffles.
Crawshay and I are old acquaintances.
I've been responsible for several little holidays of his.
That's too bad. Rather like fishing for salmon and catching a minnow, isn't it.
The salmon is still in the stream, Mr Raffles.
And patience is a virtue, Cameron.
It's alright. Kitty is fast asleep.
I am so glad she didn't wake up.
Well come along. I think we'd all better toddle back to bed.
Goodnight, Cameron.
You are A.J. Raffles the cricketer, ain't you?
Yes.
A nice looking little ticker you got there.
Well thank you. I hope you weren't looking at it professionally.
Blokes like me, we have an eye for little things like that.
Come on, Crawshay.
How extraordinary.
A.J.
Come in.
Hello Bunny.
- You dressed early.
Got to go to town on that business of yours.
Now?
What earthly excuse are you going to give to old Melrose?
I'll take care of that at breakfast.
Can I come to town with you?
No.
- Why not?
I can't sit around here wondering all day.
There is nothing to wonder about.
It's all going to be alright.
I'll have that money for you by dinner time.
Are you sure?
Just As sure as if it were in my pocket.
What do you expect, sir?
Not another attempt?
I don't know. But something.
That's why I sent for you, Merton.
If Crawshay knows something
I want to know too.
But if the jewels are still in the safe?
I know.
It's a puzzle.
Wait.
Cameron. Are you still here?
I thought your work was done.
No, not yet, Mr Raffles. Not all of it.
What did you do with your minnow?
- Crawshay?
He is in the village jail.
- Oh.
You are up early, Mr Raffles.
- Yes. A lovely morning, isn't it.
Had your breakfast?
- No, I haven't.
Aha. Here comes the saviour of the Melrose jewels.
Three cheers for Scotland Yard.
Good morning, Raffles.
- Good morning, sir.
Oh, kidneys.
- I say, Raffles.
What have you done to your hand?
It's nothing. Just a little bruise I got yesterday.
My dear boy, I do hope it's not serious.
I don't think so. Can you give me some bacon, sir?
But you are bowling for
Middlesex tomorrow.
It will be alright by then.
Is that an egg in there?
Yes. Look here, you may have bruised the bone or something.
Why don't you run up to London and let old Spurgeon have a look at it?
It's really nothing.
It's a very important match, you know.
Maybe I should go up.
Dash up immediately after breakfast and get him to vet it for you.
Yes. I think I will.
Get my bags packed and send the car round to the front door.     - Yes, sir.
I hope you're not leaving me.
George! George!
That sounds like Kitty.
What is it, my dear? I'm coming.
I've been robbed. George, where are you?
I've been robbed.
My necklace, they've stolen it.
Nonsense, my dear. Go back to bed.
You're all undressed. Don't look at her.
Don't be so silly. What does it matter what I look like. Don't you understand?
My necklace has been stolen.
Your necklace is in the safe. Don't you remember? You gave it to me.
No, I did not.
Kitty, those sleeping tablets have been too much.
I'll go and get it and show you.
- I gave you the case.
The necklace is not there.
I kept it in my room.
What's that?
Oh, you're still here, are you?
A fine detective, you are.
Letting them steal my necklace.
A detective indeed.
I believe it was you who stole it.
Have him searched.
- Lady Melrose.
You mean that case you sent down to the safe last night was empty?
Oh, so it's penetrated, has it?
Who told you I was a detective?
Do you think I don't know detective's feet when I see them?
Oh, Mr Raffles.
How right you were in everything you said. But why didn't you protect me?
Where were you, Mr Raffles?
Oh, where were you?
Aye.
Where were you, Mr Raffles?
I, when?
When the alarm went off.
I was in my room, reading.
Of course.
Inspector.
Inspector, look.
The case is empty. The necklace was never in the safe at all.
Of course not. I don't see what you wanted to go and look for.
Well, I'll give a thousand pounds reward.
A thousand pounds to anyone who returns the necklace to me.
All your nonsense of safes and detectives and burglar alarms.
Yes, Kitty. Now go back to bed, my dear.
You are all upset.
Gwen, will you be so kind as to ..
Or kidnapped.
Come along.
See that nobody enters or leave the house.
What's that, Inspector?
I propose to examine everyone.
You can't do that. I won't have my guests treated like that.
I'd rather lose the necklace altogether.
I'm afraid the matter is in my hands now, Lord Melrose.
And you will not lose the necklace.
Well I hope there is no objection my having my guests in the house.
I don't think I'll be needing those now.
That's right, isn't it?
We're under arrest?
Ah, I don't know.
I think we might make an exception in your case.
Oh, thank you.
That's alright. You can put
Mr Raffles' things in the car.
Wait a minute. Are you sure you would not like to search them first or me?
I don't think that will be necessary.
- Alright.
I am extremely grateful to you, Inspector.
Tell Gwen I'll call her from London.
- Alright, A.J.
Good luck with the salmon fishing, Cameron.
Aye.
I'm thinking of trying new bait, Mr Raffles.
Oh, splendid.
But Lady Melrose whatever possessed you not to put the necklace in the safe?
It was the way dear Mr Raffles talked.
A.J.? When?
- Last night.
He agreed with me that the safe would be the first place a thief would go to.
You mean he told you to keep it up here?
- No.
I told him I always did.
Did he ask you?
- Yes.
He seemed quite concerned about it.
Excuse me, Lady Melrose.
I must speak to him.
It wasn't his fault.
It was all my fault I suppose.
[ Car engine noise ]
Are you letting him go?
Yes.
Get a fast car immediately.
And this is what you do.
Take that fellow Crawshay out of the village jail and get him to London.
And when you do get him there, let him escape and then follow him.
What?
- Go on, don't argue.
This isn't the first time I've set a thief to catch a thief.
Filthy weather, Mr Raffles.
Did you get my cricket bag and put the car away?
Yes, sir.
- Thanks.
Oh, you're back, sir.
A boring weekend, I take it.
Not exactly boring, Barraclough. No.
Any letters, any messages?
Bills. All bills by the look of them.
I'm afraid so, sir.
Leave that. I want you to go out for me.
I want you to go to the Airways
Office in The Haymarket.
And get me a seat on the evening plane for Amsterdam.
Here is a tenner. Sorry to send you out in the rain, but be as quick as you can.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me, sir.
Is Mr Raffles in?
- Oh, Miss Manders.
Gwen.
Crawshay has escaped.
Mackenzie let him escape.
What?
"Set a thief to catch a thief", he said.
I see.
Why did you do it? Whatever made you begin it all in the first place?
Too long a story to tell you, darling.
It's all so incredible, so fantastic.
Maybe that was the reason.
Well, thank you for coming to tell me about Crawshay.
I didn't come for that.
[ Doorbell ]
Don't let them in. Don't let them in.
Gwen, you shouldn't have come here.
- They couldn't keep me away.
It will be alright. It's alright.
Wait.
Come in here.
[ Doorbell ]
Ah, the fisherman.
- Aye.       - Come in.
You must have exceeded the speed limit.
I suppose police don't mind doing that.
Aye, I have a good car.
You have a good cloak too.
Yes.
It is useful cover in an emergency.
That's worth remembering.
What did the doctor say about your hand?
I haven't been down to see him yet. I'll go along later on.
Let me get you a drink.
- No thanks.
Do you mind if I help myself?
No. Go ahead.
Crawshay has escaped, Mr Raffles.
Has he now?
Well, that sounds rather careless of you, Inspector.
He is here, in The Albany.
Is he?
I must look out for him.
I am looking out for him.
I've got the place surrounded.
Then there is nothing to worry about. Except the necklace.
I'll get that as soon as I've got Crawshay.
Has he got it?
No. But he knows who has.
- Oh.
Do you mind if I look around the rooms?
For Crawshay? By all means.
Thank you.
- Do you mind if I read my letters?
By all means.
- Thank you.
A nice vase you've got here.
Yes.
Not big enough for Crawshay to hide in though.
Is this your bedroom?
- Yes, allow me.
After you.
Is this the bathroom?
Yes.
Go in. I'm not bathing at the moment.
And that other door?
That's the spare room.
May I see it?
At the moment, it is occupied.
Occupied? You don't say.
By a lady.
Her name is not Crawshay.
Hmm.
You can trust my discretion.
How do you do, Inspector?
Have glass of sherry, Gwen.
Yes, thank you.
That's a fine looking clock you have.
Are you interested in clocks?
Take a look at the works.
An interesting specimen.
I'll take your word for it.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see it?
No thanks.
I've seen all I came to see.
And a bit more.
Maybe I will have a drink with you after all.
Splendid.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
Do you mind a pipe?
No, not at all.
What's the matter?
- I left my pouch.
Is this pipe tobacco?
- Yes.
I don't think you'd care for that.
Let me give you a cigar.
I have something rather special.
Thanks.
I'll smoke this after dinner.
Take another one for now.
No, I'd rather have my pipe.
Oh, my cigarette.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope you will find that alright.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me, I'm playing butler today.
Mr Mackenzie?
We've spotted Crawshay.
He's on the roof.
I'll come along.
You had better leave someone outside Mr Raffles' door in case ..
In case ..?
Well, in case Crawshay tries breaking in that way.
Oh.
I want to give you every protection, Mr Raffles.
Or in case Mr Raffles tries breaking out.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
- I do.
Put your hands up.
What do you want?
- I want the sparklers. So hand over.
Mr Crawshay, if I give you those jewels it won't do either of us any good.
The police want both of us.
They know you're here.
Yes, I don't think. You ain't going to get away with no story like that.
Either you hand over them sparklers or I blow the blooming daylights out of you.
Alright, then. Go ahead and shoot.
But do you know Crawshay what will happen to you?
Have you ever heard a man condemned to death?
I have.
The murderer I saw clung to the dock-rail like a wet towel ..
When the judge put on that black cap.
It's not a cap exactly.
It's a piece of silk or something.
Just telling you this so you'll know.
And while he does that there is a silence.
You can hear your heart going like a piston at the bottom of your throat.
You try to swallow.
But you can't.
That's when you feel the rope round your neck and the trap door under your feet.
And then from a long way away.
You will hear the judge's voice.
Telling you that you are to be hanged by the neck.
Until you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
I'm sorry, Crawshay.
I admit that wasn't very fair.
Why, you ..
That's what comes of listening to a bloke like you.
I entirely agree with you. Now come on, we've got to get you out of here.
Here is the rope, Inspector.
That's how he went down.
Pull it up!
Got any money?
- Nothing.
Here's a fiver. It's my last but good luck.
Look.
Now go downstairs and get the pair of them.
They've got me, Guvnor. They've got me. What am I going to do?
That ledge. Down that pipe to the next ledge.
That window leads to a passage.
And then you're on your own.
Sorry for the bad evening.
You're a pal, Guvnor.
Before you go do a pal a good turn. Know what that is?
God love you, Guvnor. You're a pro.
A real pro.
Now for them.
[ Door knocks ]
Where is he?
Mr Raffles? He's in his room.
Of course I've got him.
He's been put out with something.
Where's Crawshay?
He got away through the bathroom window.
Mr Raffles.
Mr Raffles, what's happened, sir?
What is it?
- Mr Raffles.
Mr Raffles, sir.
What's happening?
Mr Raffles.
What is it?
Oh, Barraclough.
Well, Inspector. Crawshay came alright.
Aye, Mr Raffles. Crawshay came and went.
Inspector.
Inspector, we've got him.
- Anything on him?
Only a five-pound note.
A five-pound note?
Just a minute, sir.
Don't stop me. I've been sent for.
Gwen, my dear. What are you doing here?
What you must do too, Lord Melrose.
Trying to help Mr Raffles.
You are too late, all of you.
Confound it so.
Well, Inspector. You got your man.
Aye.
We got him alright, Mr Raffles.
Good. You can always depend on dear old Scotland Yard.
Yes.
Here is a warrant for your arrest.
No!
- What?
You will have to explain your business in Amsterdam, Mr Raffles.
My business in Amsterdam?
Amsterdam is the jewel market of Europe.
You are the Amateur Cracksman, aren't you Mr Raffles?
Yes.
Aye.
Raffles.
Well, there it is, Bunny.
I'm sorry, but there it is.
You still haven't got your necklace, Inspector.
Lord Melrose. Do you remember the reward you offered?
One thousand pounds to anybody that would return it.
I don't need to be reminded.
Bunny, could you use a thousand pounds?
I'm sure you could.
Now you just give the necklace back to Lord Melrose.
You will find it in my tobacco jar.
The tobacco jar?
Well, I'll be ..
Yes, I thought you would be.
A.J.
How could you have been such a fool?
Supposing I did need the money?
What is all this? I don't understand.
I think I do.
Now see here, Inspector.
We've got these back.
No need to go any further.
And I don't want any scandal.
Aye, you needn't worry.
Your name is not on the warrant.
Well Inspector, you got your necklace.
I have.
But you haven't got me.
Here!
Here, get after him!
Go and get something to break down that door.
[ Gunshot! ]
Good heavens, he's killed himself.
Gwen.
Go on.
Barraclough. The door.
I can't stop.
- No, hurry.
Goodbye, Barraclough.
Hurry Raffles.
Hurry, sir.
Good luck, darling.
They'll nab him downstairs.
I wonder.
You see him?
- No.    - He's got away.
You two men cover the side of the house.
- Very good, sir.
You get over there.
You two follow me.
We've the entire square surrounded, sir.
- Good, good.
Where did he go? Where did he go?
Don't stand staring like that.
But sir, but sir ..
- What's the matter?
You just went down that way, sir.
That was him you fool.
There he is.
Where?
"Meet me here at 7 o'clock."
"Positively my farewell performance."
Sir, it's a hoax to waste our time.
I'm not so sure.
You know, Merton.
There is not much fun in life if you never trust anybody.
And this Raffles fellow.
Well, I don't altogether dislike him.
I hope you're not making a mistake.
I'll chance it.
You may take your men away.
I think I'd rather wait for Mr Raffles alone.
Yes.
Darling, you shouldn't have come.
Suppose they're watching for you?
I had to see you once more.
Just for a moment.
Yes. But supposing they f頽d you here?
- Now don't you worry. I'm not worried.
I love you.
I know I said it before but I thought you may like to hear it again.
0h, darling.
No matter what happens, we'll be together. Promise?
I want you to stay, and yet.
I want you to go.
It so happens I've got to go.
Where?
Just round the corner. I have an appointment at 7 o'clock.
I hate to keep anybody waiting but sometimes you have to.
I understand.
